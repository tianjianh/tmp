Bournemouth 1-1 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Matt Ritchie struck late to earn Bournemouth a share of the points after West Brom took an early lead at the Vitality Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a match between two sides safe from relegation, a mistake by Cherries goalkeeper Artur Boruc was punished when Salomon Rondon headed home.
Boruc saved Craig Gardner's penalty before half-time, and Ritchie drew the hosts level with a close-range header.
Craig Dawson hit the post late on as the Baggies pressed for a winner.
Relive Bournemouth v West Brom
Reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches
The midfielder had earlier seen his penalty pushed onto the crossbar by Boruc, who dived to his right again to brilliantly push away the follow-up effort.
The draw meant Bournemouth are without a win in four games, while West Brom's last victory came against Manchester United eight games ago.
Bournemouth looked in control and untroubled until a glaring mistake from their goalkeeper gave West Brom the chance to strike.
Boruc's low clearance went straight to Jonathan Leko, who dribbled towards the box before finding Evans on the left.
The former Manchester United man's pinpoint cross was emphatically headed home by Rondon, and Boruc could only kick the ball angrily back towards halfway for the restart.
Boruc will prefer to look back at the moments that kept his side in the game.
West Brom were awarded a penalty three minutes before half-time when Tommy Elphick tangled with Gareth McAuley.
Boruc tipped Gardner's spot-kick onto the bar with an excellent save, then got back to his feet quickly enough to push the follow-up away.
It was a moment that proved vital, giving the Cherries the chance to come back late in the game.
Bournemouth dominated possession and played the kind of attractive football they have for much of their debut Premier League season.

But it was a more basic approach that drew them level, with Ritchie latching on to a throw-in that slid off the head of Claudio Yacob inside West Brom's area.
It was a moment of sloppy defending not usually associated with sides managed by Tony Pulis, and helped deny what would have been only their second away win in the league in 2016.
West Brom host Liverpool, who just three days later will play in the Europa League final, on 15 May, the last day of the Premier League season.
Also at 15:00 BST that day, Bournemouth travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in a match that could have an impact on the race for Champions League places.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "We didn't deserve to lose today, we had a lot of possession but they are not the type of team to go behind to."
On Artur Boruc's save: "It made a different atmosphere in the ground. In the second half we were much improved and I thought we deserved the equaliser.
"I'm slightly disappointed with elements of the performance, but overall you have to reflect on the season and it's been a great effort by the players."

West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "We're disappointed, the players have worked so hard. Bournemouth play the way they play, but they didn't really cause us any problems.
"Harry Arter should have been booked for pushing Jonas Olsson over, then there's a blatant handball that again he doesn't get booked for and the challenge on Darren Fletcher is a straight red.
"We've had five penalties this year, and missed four so we have to blame ourselves on that."
