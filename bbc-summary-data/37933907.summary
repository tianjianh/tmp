Lucy Pygott, 17, from Hartley Wintney, and 16-year-old Stacey Burrows from Farnborough were hit as they crossed a road in Aldershot on Tuesday evening.
Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club (AFD) said it had been "overrun" with tributes.
The crash happened on Queen's Avenue just after 19:10 GMT.
Mike Neighbour, the club's chairman said Lord Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) had been among those who had phoned the club to offer "his support".
The club said the messages of support they have received from around the world had been "overwhelming".
Lucy was this year's England Under-20 3,000m champion and European Youth Championships bronze medallist.
Stacey was the Hampshire Under-17 3,000m champion.
Hampshire Athletics Club said a minute's silence would be held in memory of the girls at the Hampshire Cross-Country League fixture at Bournemouth on Saturday.
In a statement the club said: "The whole athletics world has been shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic incident which led to the deaths of two young female athletes.
"We send our sympathy and condolences to their families, friends and colleagues at Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club."
Dozens of flowers have also been left at the crash scene.
Farnborough Sixth Form College, where the girls were students said a reflection room for students had been set up and many had laid flowers in the college's quad.
The college said counsellors had also been brought in to support pupils and staff.
Hampshire Constabulary said Specialist officers were providing support to the teenagers' families.
A serving soldier arrested on suspicion of drink driving, two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of careless driving while unfit through drink or drugs, has been bailed until February.
