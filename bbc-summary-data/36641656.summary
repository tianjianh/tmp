Rugby league's longest-serving full-time referee Richard Silverwood has been suspended pending an investigation by the Rugby Football League.

Silverwood has not taken charge of a game since overseeing Hull FC's win over Hull KR at Magic Weekend in May.
It is his third suspension, having been stopped from officiating in 2009 for a breach of the RFL's information and technology policy, and again in 2011.
The RFL has not disclosed the circumstances leading to the inquiry.
Silverwood's 2009 suspension followed an alleged leak of confidential information to a trade union, while the 2011 disciplinary procedure resulted from an "off-field incident" during a game between Huddersfield and Leeds.
Meanwhile, fellow referee Sam Ansell has also been suspended pending an investigation.
The 26-year-old was added to the nine-man panel of full-time match officials in January.
