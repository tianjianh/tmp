Feminist beer launched to prove it's 'not just a drink for blokes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Beer is promoted the world over with adverts full of women in bikinis or skimpy underwear.

They are rarely shown enjoying a pint and instead appear as glamorous window dressing.
A South American beer company, Feminista, wants to change that.
Thais Fabris is behind the branding and says women in the ads are "either the waitress in the bar, a girl on the beach, or a prize the men get for drinking that beer".
She says for them "it has many dangerous aspects, since it objectifies women".
Hannah Rhodes is the founder of Hiver, an award-winning beer that has marketed itself to men and women.
She agrees that beer needs a makeover when it comes to selling itself.
"There are already great beers out there that tackle some of the traditional issues; smaller serving sizes, more balanced and interesting flavour profiles and finally, more neutral branding.
"I'd suggest that many men would feel similarly uncomfortable selecting a beer with floral patterns on the label and an advert focussed on a man's groin.
"It's just not mature and we all, men and women, want to be respected a bit more in how we're marketed to."
She told Newsbeat that beer is in need of a general rebrand.
"Like the creative agency behind this beer are saying, much of the advertising is targeted at men and I've heard many women say no to a sample of beer on the basis that they prefer 'more girly drinks'.
"So I think they're right, the perception of beer and the advertising campaigns around put women off and even make them feel drinking a beer challenges their identity.
"It's just a drink!"
