A Londonderry councillor has said it is "disappointing" that details of a surprise police operation to combat dangerous driving were posted on Facebook.

The SDLP's Shauna Cusack said the operation, targeting late-night drivers gathering in car parks at Strand Road, had been scheduled for the "coming weeks".
But she said that was now under review after Sinn FÃ©in councillor Michael Cooper shared details of the "surprise operation" with local residents.
"Not surprisingly, this leaflet was handed to one of the car park users and was immediately uploaded onto their Facebook page as a warning," she said.
However, Mr Cooper said he fully expected the joint PSNI and Driver and Vehicle Agency operation to go ahead, adding: "A date has yet to be finalised."
A PSNI spokeswoman said police, in partnership with the Driver and Vehicle Agency, have a number of planned operations scheduled for the "coming weeks and months to address issues concerning public safety".
