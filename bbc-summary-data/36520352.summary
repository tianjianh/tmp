The Republic lost all three games at Euro 2012 without scoring a goal, but Coleman's cross set up Wes Hoolahan for a superb strike in Monday's 1-1 draw.
"We are disappointed not to win but after the goal we sat back a bit too much," said the Everton player.
"Now we can go into the Belgium game on Saturday looking for all three."
Hoolahan put the Republic in front on 48 minutes but Ciaran Clark's 71st-minute own goal denied them an opening victory in Group E.

Manager Martin O'Neill said his side were "fantastic" and deserved to win.
He said: "I don't know how we didn't come in maybe three in front at half-time. The players are disappointed but they shouldn't be. They were brilliant."
O'Neill praised Hoolahan for his spectacular half-volley that gave them the lead.
"Wes did brilliantly to keep it down, it's not his strong foot and it was a great goal," he said. "It was a great effort, but more than a great effort the play was really great.
"Then we had to weather a storm and defended as strongly as we could but overall there is real disappointment we haven't taken all three points.
"It was still a performance to be delighted with."

Hoolahan, meanwhile, said his goal was one of the highlights of his career.
"To get a goal for Ireland in the Euros is an achievement, and fair play to the boys, they were magnificent," said the 34-year-old Norwich midfielder.
"They should be proud of themselves."
