Snow has survived on a Glen Coe Munro for the longest time in living memory, according to the area's ski resort.

The snow from last winter lies on Meall a'Bhuiridh, the location of Glencoe Mountain's Flypaper run ski run.
The resort's Andy Meldrum said: "This is the latest that snow has ever survived on Meall a'Bhuiridh since skiing began here in 1956.
"But some of our old timers here, guys in their 90s, say snow has never lasted this long."
Mr Meldrum said the patch of snow had survived because of the summer's poor weather, and was clinging on through September's warm conditions.
He said: "The winter of 2013-14 was a record for snow depths with tows buried for many months, yet even then snow only persisted on the mountain until 28 September.
"The winter of 2014-15 was a reasonably average winter but unseasonably cold summer temperatures have meant that the snow has lasted even longer this year.
"This is the most southerly snow remaining in Scotland now."
