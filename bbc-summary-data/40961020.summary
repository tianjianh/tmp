Bogle, 24, left Grimsby for Wigan in January, but was transfer listed after boss Paul Cook said the player did not fit into his playing style.
Meanwhile Cardiff have rejected a Â£10m bid from Hull City for Denmark Under-21 striker Kenneth Zohore, who scored 12 league goals last season.
Manager Neil Warnock has said he is determined to keep Zohore in Cardiff, who are top of the Championship.
The 25-year-old Bogle has signed a three-year deal at Cardiff City Stadium, and joins for an undisclosed fee.
"I know how big this club is and the direction that we want to go in. I spoke to the gaffer and was excited by his plans," Bogle said.
"I've got pace, work rate and I want to entertain the fans. I'm excited and looking forward to scoring goals."
"I like his enthusiasm. He's raw, he's similar to Mendez-Laing in some respects, and he's got desire," Warnock said.
"With the right guidance and the right players we can bring the best out of him."
Left-back Joe Bennett is considering an offer from Fulham which triggered a release clause in his contract with the Welsh club.
Warnock, however, has said he would be happy for him to stay.
Bogle scored 19 goals for Grimsby in the first half of the 2016-17 season before joining Wigan.
