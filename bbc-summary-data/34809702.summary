Carneddau mountain pony annual health-check round-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual round-up of the wild Carneddau ponies in north Wales has taken place to check on their health.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are gathered to monitor their numbers but are otherwise left to roam the hills in Conwy county for the rest of the year.
Volunteers and spectators met in Llanfairfechan for the round-up which takes place over several hours.
A study in 2013 showed the Carneddau ponies were a unique breed.
Among those participating on Saturday was Peter Griffiths who said "everybody and no one" own the ponies.
"We check them and make sure they're OK and healthy," he said.
"They stay down here for one night. The next day we take them back up the mountain and they go back to exactly where they were."
He said there had been some criticisms on social media about the annual round-up with claims the ponies were being "chased".
But he insisted the safety of the ponies was paramount.
"Once we're up there, everything slows down," he said. "You'll never catch a horse going after it at 100 miles an hour."
