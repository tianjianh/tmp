[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-1 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-haunted Coventry won for the first time since Mark Robins returned as boss to increase the threat of relegation to League Two for Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City ended a run of 422 minutes without a goal when Kyel Reid superbly fired them ahead with a dipping 20-yard volley in the 37th minute.
The hosts took just another four minutes to score again, from Kwame Thomas' clever close-range backheel.
All Vale could muster in response was Nathan Smith's deftly flicked header.
It leaves Vale still in the bottom four, two points behind 20th-placed Shrewsbury, although with two games in hand.
Coventry's first win in seven games leaves them still with a very slim chance of beating the drop, still 14 points adrift of safety but with only another 21 to play for.
And although it might not be long before relegation to League Two is confirmed, it might at least not now happen before City walk out at Wembley on Sunday week.
However, if they lose at home to Bristol Rovers on Saturday, they would be within one defeat of dropping into English football's bottom tier for the first time since 1959.
After a nine-game winless run since the turn of the year, successive home victories had given Vale, still under the caretaker management of Michael Brown, a better chance of avoiding the drop.
But they have only won once away from home this season. And, even against a struggling Coventry side who had not scored in their past four matches, they were cruelly found out.
An hour had gone before Vale had an effort on target, but home keeper Lee Burge saved Ryan Taylor's deflected shot.
By then, City were well in control thanks to their mini first-half goal flurry when, shortly after Reid's flick and volley, they confidently doubled their lead with another good strike.
Thomas got to the rebound first and finished with a stunning backheel after Deniz Mehmet had only parried Stuart Beavon's shot.
Vale rallied late on but all they had to show for it was centre-half Smith's fourth goal of the season from Taylor's neatly floated free-kick.
