What's happening with the FA?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs have voted to say that they don't believe the biggest organisation in English football, the FA, can make the changes needed to keep it modern and relevant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Football Association, known simply as the FA, is the organisation that looks after all football in England. Similar organisations play the same role for football in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
It was formed in 1863 and is the oldest football association in the world. As the first ever football association, it does not need to call itself the "English" FA. The FA is based at Wembley Stadium in London.
It controls many different competitions, the most famous of which is the FA Cup. It is also responsible for appointing the manager of the men's, women's, and youth England football teams.
Although it does not run the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, it does have some say in English football's biggest league.
The FA has been accused of being old fashioned and out of date in the way it is run, and the people it has in power.
The government has repeatedly called for the FA to be more of a reflection of modern society, and those who play the game. It also wants the organisation to change the way it makes decisions.
The FA is run by a group of people called the FA Council, which has 122 members. Just eight of these members are women and only four are from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60.
This is a big area where some people believe the FA needs to change. The government wants more women and people from ethnic minorities to have a say in how the FA is run.
Other areas that the government wants to change are for fans to have more input, and changes to limit the power and influence of the Premier League.
On 9 February, MPs in the House of Commons, had a debate about whether they believed the FA can change itself, or whether the government needs to step in to force changes.
They voted that they had "no confidence" in the Football Association to make the changes.
The vote itself does not have any powers or immediate effect on the FA, but it will be seen as a warning to the organisation that the government could force them to change if they don't act soon.
The FA faces losing getting money from the government, but is confident they can make the changes themselves to keep the government happy.
