Tries by Chris Sandow and Kevin Penny secured a 12-10 victory at Headingley, but Wolves spent long periods of the game without the ball.
Smith named five debutants in the squad after they finished sixth last season.
"We've got to better than that with the ball, we did it the hard way," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"You give a team like Leeds that much ball most of the time they're going to beat you.
"I feel for my boys, they were just defending all night - they've come up with an effort and a few really special plays as well.
"You have to come up with a super effort defensively and fortunately we did that."
