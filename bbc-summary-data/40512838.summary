The reigning world, European and Commonwealth champion suffered an ankle problem competing in Italy in May.
Rutherford, 30, was also one of many high-profile absentees from the British trials last weekend.
"Obviously this isn't ideal, but I am doing everything to give myself the best chance of success at the World Championships in London," he said.
Rutherford, who has only competed twice all season, is looking to defend his long jump world title at the 2017 Worlds which run from 4-13 August.
"After some really excellent training this year, the start to the season has been riddled with a series of troublesome injuries, most recently a problem with an ankle ligament," he added.
"As a result, I am absolutely gutted to say that I am unable to compete at the Anniversary Games this weekend - one of the greatest events in our sport."
