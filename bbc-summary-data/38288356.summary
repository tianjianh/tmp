The 39-year-old previously worked alongside Neilson's assistant manager Stevie Crawford at Falkirk.
Former Hearts midfielder McFarlane has since worked as assistant to Steven Pressley at Coventry and Fleetwood.
He watched MK win their first league game under ex-Hearts boss Neilson on Saturday, a 1-0 win over AFC Wimbledon.
"Neil's got really good experience of the league, having been at both Coventry and Fleetwood as assistant," said Neilson.
"He's a great character and he works hard - that's what you need. He'll be hands on, helping with training and taking certain aspects of it. He'll be a positive addition."
