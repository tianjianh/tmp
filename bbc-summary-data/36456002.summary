After Everton striker Lukaku's fiercely struck opener from outside the box, Bournemouth's Joshua King levelled.
Veton Berisha profited from static defending as Norway then led, but Hazard deftly headed in an equaliser and Laurent Ciman got the winner.
Meanwhile, Russia, who begin their Euro 2016 campaign against England on Saturday, drew 1-1 with Serbia.
They were denied victory by an 88th-minute equaliser from Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, having taken the lead through Artem Dzyuba in the 85th minute.
Earlier, Czech Republic suffered a 2-1 home defeat by South Korea in their final warm-up game.
Yoon Bit-garam and Suk Hyun-jun gave the away side a 2-0 half-time lead before Marek Suchy got one back and Theodor Gebre Selassie was sent off for a second yellow card.
