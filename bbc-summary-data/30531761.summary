An airline passenger told to calm down on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow by Boris Johnson has admitted assault and being drunk on an aircraft.

David Morris, 43, of Ash Vale, Surrey ranted at the 3 December flight crew.
The London mayor reportedly urged Morris to calm down, warning him he would be arrested when they landed.
A witness at the time said Malaysia Airlines cabin staff eventually handcuffed Morris, tied his legs together and strapped him in his seat.
At Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, Morris pleaded guilty to assault by beating and being drunk.
A third count of behaving in a threatening, abusive or insulting manner towards a member of the crew in an aircraft has been dropped.
Lance Whiteford, defending, told the court: "Appearing before you is a gentleman who is absolutely horrified at how he behaved on that occasion.
"He knows that staff, when carrying out their duties, should feel safe and do it without being abused or threatened. He has no recollection of this flight."
Sentencing will take place on 16 January.
Chairman of the bench Bob Fishwick said: "The matters for which you have been charged and pleaded guilty to seriously endangered the safety of the aircraft."
The mayor had been on his way back to the UK following a six-day trip to the Far East promoting bilateral trade and investment.
