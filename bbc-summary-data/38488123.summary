The couple - aged 59 and 56 - were reported missing on Sunday after failing to return from a walk with their dog.
Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team searched the Cairngorm Plateau overnight in freezing temperatures and deep snow.
They were found with their black Collie at around 12:00 and they were walked to safety.
Mountain rescue team leader Willie Anderson said the couple spent the night in a bivvy bag - a move that "saved their lives".
He said: "They misjudged how long their walk would take them yesterday and then the cloud closed in and it started snowing.
"They were a bit disorientated but at least they had a bivvy bag to shelter them. That probably saved their lives."
Mr Anderson said rescuers walked the couple to a track vehicle which took them to the funicular railway.
They are to be checked over by medics but Mr Anderson said they were safe and well.
The couple are believed to be from England and had been staying in the Glenmore area.
Conditions in the area have been described by Cairngorm MRT as "Arctic".
