[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inquest into the death of a woman who crashed to the ground in a housing estate during a charity skydive has recorded a verdict of misadventure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pamela Gower, 49, from Hebburn, South Tyneside died while taking part in a jump at Peterlee Parachute Centre.
A video of her jump shows her trying to deploy her parachute but being unable to do so, the inquest in Crook heard.
She was spinning and would have been exposed to greater G-forces than a fighter pilot, it was told.
Instructor Michelle Meakins told the inquest Miss Gower had wind tunnel training, designed to help her cope in a spin, but, on the day, "it all happened so quick".
Her reserve parachute did deploy but Coroner Andrew Tweddle heard she lost consciousness during the 15,000 ft (4,500 metre) fall and sustained fatal injuries hitting the ground.
Miss Gower, who had dwarfism, was an employment advisor at Remploy's Newcastle branch and supported disabled people into work.
She had a specially adapted harness because of her restricted height.
She was found on a road close to the airfield at Shotton Colliery where her plane had taken off.
It is understood residents tried to save Miss Gower after she landed close to a parked car.
