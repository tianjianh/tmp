Goalkeeper Patrik Carlgren's save from William Carvalho proved decisive.
Portugal dominated possession for much of the game and Sergio Oliveira hit the bar, but the teams could not be separated after two hours of football.
Both sides had each missed a penalty in the shootout before Carlgren dived to his right to deny Carvalho.
Sweden were just minutes from elimination earlier in the tournament, before a late equaliser against Portugal saw them progress from a group in which England finished bottom.
A final victory had looked unlikely for most of the first 90 minutes, as Rui Jorge's Portugal team underlined their status as favourites.
But they failed to take their chances, despite dominating possession and creating the more clear-cut openings in a contest that took time to come to life.
Sweden struggled to cope with their opponents' pace and movement, as Ricardo hit the side netting with an early left-foot shot from the edge of the area.
Oliveira came even closer inside the opening 10 minutes, the midfielder striking the bar with a long-range free-kick after a foul on Carvalho by Abdullah Khalili.
Joao Mario saw a goal-bound effort blocked by Alexander Milosevic after the forward connected with a cross from Ricardo Esgaio, as the Swedes were forced back for long periods.
The best they could manage in reply was a tame header from Isaac Kiese Thelin, as the unmarked forward met Khalili's cross at the far post but failed to test keeper Jose Sa.
Sweden began to assert themselves more in the second half, Thelin providing a neat lay-off to John Guidetti, whose volley flew narrowly over from the edge of the box.
Carlgren remained the busier keeper, and was forced into a hurried save by Toze. Within seconds, Iuri Medeiros cut in from the right to send a low curling effort inches wide.
The Swedes finished the 90 minutes strongly, and Sa had to spread himself well to keep out a low close range shot from Guidetti after the forward found a way past two defenders with five minutes left.
Thelin's curled effort almost brought the game's first goal in the first period of extra-time, as the chances dried up and penalties loomed.
After the first five were converted, Carlgren saved from regular Portuguese spot kick taker Esgaio.
Khalili failed to press home the advantage when his effort was saved, but after Victor Lindelof restored Sweden's lead, Carlgren comfortably kept out Carvalho's tired penalty to settle the contest.
