HMRC tax evasion investigation requests Belfast law firm client files

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has made a request to access client files held by a Belfast law firm as part of its investigation into four KPMG partners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The four men were arrested on Wednesday in connection with suspected tax evasion.
The Irish News reports HMRC has asked to see files held by C&H Jefferson. The firm says it is "complying with this request".
C&H Jefferson is not accused of any wrongdoing.
The four men arrested are Jon D'Arcy, Eamonn Donaghy, Arthur O'Brien and Paul Hollway, KPMG's most senior staff in Northern Ireland.
They have been placed on "administrative leave".
KPMG said it did not have "any indication" that the investigation related to the business of KPMG or its clients.
Aside from their KPMG roles, the four men are directors in a property investment company called JEAP Ltd.
