Owners of a pub have attacked activists who they claim were behind online "mob attacks" and abusive phone calls over their decision to sell foie gras.

David and Samantha McHattie, who run The Bridge Inn in Derbyshire, said they have been "bombarded" with "fake reviews and hateful messages".
They said they will continue to serve the dish, produced from livers of ducks or geese which are often force-fed.
About 40 protesters gathered outside the Calver pub on Easter Sunday.
They said they have also been targeted online.
The McHatties said they were forced to remove their Facebook page after it was filled with hundreds of negative reviews from users who, they claim, had never visited the pub.
"No-one ever tried to speak to us privately," Mrs McHattie said. "This has been hundreds of fake, one-star reviews within days.
"Mob attacks online have a devastating effect and it's not acceptable."
Mr McHattie added: "Do I like my team taking phone calls of people being abusive? Do I like them threatening members of our community and abusing them? No, I don't.
"It's perfectly legal, and if it wasn't legal, we wouldn't touch it."
Protest organiser Corinne Longman claimed animal rights activists have been threatened online from people in the restaurant trade.
"Foie gras is classed by governing bodies and the RSPCA as cruel and unnecessary and just for a delicacy, that's not good enough," she said.
"It isn't just the individual we're targeting, it is any restaurant that sells foie gras.
"We don't blame The Bridge Inn for all the chefs that have been sending us threats of violence, just as much as I can't control any of the other activists who have decided to use the wrong kind of tactics by getting personal and abusive."
