Verlinden joined Featherstone Rovers in 2015 after spells at Newtown Jets and Cronulla Sharks, but ended the campaign at Doncaster.
The 28-year-old played 14 games in total in the second tier and Challenge Cup last season, scoring two tries.
"'It's another quality addition which will further improve our playing squad," director Garry Mounsey said.
