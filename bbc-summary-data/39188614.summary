[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Woods netted the winner 18 minutes into the second half, prodding beyond Will Norris after being played in by Padraig Amond.
That came shortly after Norris had clawed out a header from his own defender Leon Legge, who had miscued an attempted backpass.
Cambridge saw substitute Paul Lewis' header cleared off the line by Scott Harrison as they looked to respond, but their task was made more difficult 19 minutes from time when Max Clark was shown a straight red card for a late tackle on Nicky Deverdics.
The home side had enjoyed the majority of the chances in the opening period but failed to test goalkeeper Joe Fryer, Legge heading a free-kick narrowly wide before Luke Berry volleyed over from a tight angle after a clearance fell to him.
Lewis came closest to salvaging a point for Cambridge late on, seeing a shot deflected wide by Liam Donnelly five minutes from time.
