[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Asaph Cathedral improvements granted £36,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Denbighshire cathedral believed to be the UK's smallest has been given £36,000 to improve facilities and make it more accessible.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Asaph Cathedral will develop new interactive activities and displays and have an officer to run school visits.
It could be awarded a further £243,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
It houses one of only 20 known copies of the William Morgan bible from 1588, but needs the new facilities to preserve the manuscript.
The cathedral is waiting for planning permission to create a tearoom, new toilet facilities and community meeting rooms.
