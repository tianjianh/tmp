Mobile phone footage captured Calista, a female rescue llama, fleeing the field in Littleborough after being scared by a dog on Monday evening.
The terrified creature was then spotted running amok in the town's streets.
Calista was eventually tracked down by her owner near Hollingworth Lake several hours later, before being led back home.
