Russell Slade: Charlton Athletic part company with manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton Athletic manager Russell Slade has left after less than six months in the job, BBC London understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 56-year-old's departure follows a 3-0 defeat at Swindon on Saturday in only his 16th league game in charge.
Slade is the sixth manager to leave the Addicks since January 2014, although Jose Riga had two spells as boss.
Charlton are 15th in League One in a season which has seen continued protests against owner Roland Duchatelet's running of the club.
A group of supporters from the Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD) have taken a taxi to Belgium to mark the owner's 70th birthday by delivering a petition urging him to leave The Valley.
Charlton were relegated from the Championship last season, prompting the resignation of Riga after returning to the head coach role for two months.
Slade was appointed just three days after leaving Cardiff, having been switched to a head of football role, but Charlton have won only four league games this season and are three points above the bottom four.
