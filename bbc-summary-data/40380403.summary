"From there, it has gone across the whole of London and the whole of the UK," he said.
Around 100 balloons were released at Fulham Cross Girls in memory of those who lost their lives in the fire.
Pupils from three other schools, dressed in green, were invited to be part of the balloon-releasing ceremony.

Meanwhile, Belmont School in Chiswick, west London, tweeted that it raised Â£705.40 for the Grenfell Disaster Fund.
