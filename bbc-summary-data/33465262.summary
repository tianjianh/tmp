The public relations firm run by the son of First Minister Peter Robinson says it has not been involved in any way in the controversial sale of National Asset Management Agency's (Nama) Northern Ireland properties.

US investment firm Cerberus bought the entire portfolio from Nama for more than Â£1bn last April.
The Irish News revealed that Verbatim Communications worked for Tughans, the legal firm involved in the Nama affair.
The company is run by Gareth Robinson.
It organised an event about Tughans' association with Queen's University's postgraduate and executive education centre in 2012.
But in a statement, Belfast-based Verbatim Communications said that "at no time" has the firm been employed by Nama, Pimco or Cerberus.
Verbatim said none of its "employees or representatives facilitated or were in any way involved in the sale of Nama assets to Cerberus".
"Neither the company nor anyone representing the company benefited from the Cerberus/Nama transaction nor did they ever expect to".
The statement added that the company "fully supports all investigations into the matter whether in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland".
It confirms that "on one occasion, three years ago, Verbatim Communications Ltd was engaged by Tughans to assist with a very successful event relating to third level education".
Verbatim Communications said it "acts in a professional and ethical manner at all times and any suggestion to the contrary will be vigorously challenged".
Gareth Robinson, a former DUP councillor in Castlereagh, is listed as the only director of Verbatim Communications.
In October, Justice Minister David Ford raised questions about whether Peter Robinson should have declared an interest when inquiring about the costs associated with policing a world title boxing match in Belfast involving Carl Frampton.
The Irish News had reported that Gareth Robinson played a role in promoting the fight.
However, the first minister rejected the suggestion that he should have declared an interest, and said a discussion at the Stormont executive had related to the general policy of police charging for events.
