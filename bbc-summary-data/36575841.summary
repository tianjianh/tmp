Driving for the new Ford Chip Ganassi team, Guernsey's Priaulx and team-mates Harry Tincknell and Marino Franchitti finished ninth in their class, having hoped to get onto the podium.
"It was a tough race," he said. "We had a gearbox issue at the start, so we were unlucky from the outset.
"Considering what happened to us, just finishing was an achievement."
Priaulx and his team-mates qualified fourth-fastest in their class, but saw fellow Ford drivers Joey Hand, Dirk Muller and Sebastien Bourdais win on the 50th anniversary of the manufacturer's first victory at Le Mans.
"I have already been on a World Endurance Championship podium at Spa and sort of hoped to achieve the same here, but it was not to be," added Priaulx.
"The team did a great job and we have all learnt a lot for next year."
