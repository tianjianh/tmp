Sarah and Jem Burrows from St Agnes in Cornwall said they were "still buzzing" after capturing the bright pink glow in the early hours of Tuesday.
Experts said it had been predicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
They said the couple were "very lucky" to see it so far south. There were also reports of the Northern Lights being seen on Exmoor.
Mrs Burrows said she and her husband, a northern lights - or Aurora Borealis - enthusiast, had got "very excited" at space conditions and he persuaded her to go with him to St Agnes Beacon.
"We couldn't believe we were stood in Cornwall witnessing a phenomena we have travelled to Norway to see", she said.
"She put on an amazing show. I was very emotional".
Brian Sheen, from the Roseland Observatory in Cornwall, said the Northern Lights could be seen around once a year in Cornwall but were rarely noticed or captured.
"We don't get it so brilliantly down here as they do in the north. I've only see it three or four times in my life", he said.
Mr Sheen said the display was caused by a burst of gases kicked out from sun spots that interact with the Earth's magnetic field and hit the atmosphere creating "these lovely colours".
Dr Chris Arridge, of Lancaster University Physics Department, said: "If there is greater solar activity, they can, on rare occasions, be seen further south, if the conditions are favourable."
The Met Office, based in Exeter, said on its blog that the country could have another night of "spectacular aurora views" on Wednesday.
"To see the northern lights, wait until at least half an hour after sunset, go outside away from artificial lights, let your eyes accustom to the dark and look towards the north," the Met Office said.
