The homeless man made headlines after he was declared dead by a senior doctor in Mumbai and sent immediately to the mortuary - against hospital rules.
Patients pronounced dead are supposed to be kept on the ward for two hours in case the doctor has made an error.
Cause of death is unclear. A post-mortem will be held later on Wednesday.
Dr Suleman Merchant, the dean of Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, told the BBC that the 50-year-old man, named as Prashant, died on Tuesday night.
"He was treated for having maggots in his right ear and was unconscious. We treated him for electrolyte imbalance and transfused blood because he was anaemic," he added.
Earlier, doctors said the man had a metabolic disorder and was delirious when police brought him in on Sunday.
He was brought to the hospital after he was found unconscious at a bus stop, local media reported.
Dr Merchant said the hospital had launched an inquiry into the breach of protocol that led Prashant to be taken immediately to the mortuary.
