The Czech world number 233 edged Estonia's 99th-ranked Kontaveit - who beat Britain's Heather Watson in the first round - 6-4 7-6 (8-6).
Vondrousova had beaten Czech compatriot and world number 18 Barbora Strycova in the semi-final.
Sunday's victory moves her close to the top 100 for the first time.
Croatia's Borna Coric saved five match points to defeat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 to clinch his first ATP title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech.
Coric, the 20-year-old world number 79, trailed 3-0 in the second set and 4-2 in the decider before he rallied to beat the third-seeded Kohlschreiber, who was bidding for an eighth title.
