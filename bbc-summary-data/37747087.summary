The 22-year-old Ivorian picked up the problem when he tangled with Chelsea's Eden Hazard and was substituted in the 52nd minute as a consequence.
"I am afraid it is a bad injury," said United manager Jose Mourinho. "It is in his knee, the ligament area. He feels it is really bad."
Bailly had played every minute in the league for United coming into the game.
The defender signed from Spanish side Villarreal for about Â£30m in the summer.
