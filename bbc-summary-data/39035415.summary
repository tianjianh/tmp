[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 1-0 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby revived their League Two play-off hopes with victory over Colchester at Blundell Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Jones grabbed the only goal of the game as the Mariners completed a second straight win on home turf.
Chances were few and far between in the opening stages, although the game did almost spark into life on 12 minutes.
Colchester forward Tarique Fosu took aim from 25 yards, and he had James McKeown beaten with a strike that cannoned back off the post.
At the other end - with their first real attack - the Mariners took the lead on 43 minutes when Jones bundled home from Calum Dyson's clever assist.
It was equally lifeless after the break, although Colchester went close to an equaliser when left-back Matt Briggs was denied by McKeown.
