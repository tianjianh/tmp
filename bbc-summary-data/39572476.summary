Warrington Wolves forward Ben Westwood has been banned for four games after admitting striking Leeds Rhinos half-back Liam Sutcliffe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old England international was sin-binned for the challenge on Sutcliffe a minute into Friday's 25-14 Super League victory over the Rhinos.
Sutcliffe, 22, was taken off with concussion and was unable to return.
Westwood was also fined Â£300 and will start his suspension by missing Thursday's derby at Widnes.
Back-rower Westwood was charged by the Rugby Football League's match-review panel with a grade D charge, which carried a ban of between three and five games, and entered a guilty plea at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday.
Leigh forward Gareth Hock, 33, was also handed a one-match ban after admitting using foul and abusive language towards a match official and will miss his side's trip to Salford on Good Friday.
Catalans prop Sam Moa, St Helens centre Mark Percival and Leeds centre Jimmy Keinhorst will be free to play in their sides' respective fixtures against Huddersfield, Wigan and Hull FC after submitting early guilty pleas to grade A offences.
Moa was charged with raising the knee in a tackle, Percival with disputing the referee's decision and Keinhorst with dangerous contact.
