The 28-year-old has nine caps for his country, appearing in the 2015 World Cup and as a replacement at Twickenham against England in November.
Tight-head Alec Clarey, 23, will join from Bristol, with Jordan Brodley, 23, and Roy Godfrey, 27, also signing.
Meanwhile, fellow prop Jake Armstrong has signed a new deal after initially joining Jersey last summer.
South Africa-born loose-head Godfrey has played for French side Perpignan, while Brodley has represented a number of lower league sides while completing his studies in Bristol.
"Jersey has become known for having a strong pack, and although we've developed more of an all-court game this season, our forwards still play a vital role in what we do," said head coach Harvey Biljon.
"There is a great mix of experience in Roy and Lee Roy, and younger players like Alec and Jordan with genuine potential."
