[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said it was with great sadness that it announced the death of Flying Officer Kenneth Astill Wilkinson AE.
Mr Wilkinson, of Solihull, West Midlands, was "a true gentleman", the statement added.
Battle of Britain pilots were dubbed "the few" by wartime leader Winston Churchill.
Mr Wilkinson once told off Prince William for "flying choppers instead of proper aeroplanes".
The light-hearted comments came during an event to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 2015.

Mr Wilkinson leaves a daughter, Penny, and a grandson, Piers.
The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said he had been an active member of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association (BBFA).
"We shall miss him dearly," it added.
Retired group captain Patrick Tootal said Mr Wilkinson was "one of the first to join the BBFA in 1958".
"It was for all the navigators and pilots. He was one of the most junior members having joined us later on in the war," he added.
"He always had a twinkle in his eye, and he liked a glass of red wine. We would always have a joke about it."
He said there were ten members left in the association, ranging from the age of 95 to 99.
The Battle of Britain has become known as a turning point for Britain during World War Two when, in 1940, Germany launched an attack on Britain's sea defences. The RAF withstood the attack and Germany called off its invasion plans.
