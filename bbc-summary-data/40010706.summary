"I won't call them monsters because they would like that term. I will call them losers," he said in a speech during a visit to the Middle East.
World leaders have been sending messages of grief and solidarity to the UK city after the explosion at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night.
Twenty-two people have been killed.
Police have named Salman Abedi as the suspected suicide bomber. The 22-year-old was Manchester born and from a family of Libyan origin, the BBC understands.
One of the most poignant reactions came from Polish President Andrzej Duda, who laid flowers at the British embassy in Warsaw as it emerged that a Polish couple were missing.
Angelika and Marcin Klis had gone to the Manchester Arena to pick up their daughter Alex and have not been seen since. She has appealed for help in finding them.
French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe called on people to be vigilant.
"The most cowardly form of terrorism has struck once again, targeting - as in Paris more than a year ago - a concert venue," he said in a statement, referring to the attack at the Bataclan music venue in Paris in November 2015.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who also expressed condolences, plans to speak with UK Prime Minister Theresa May.
Mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi, told French television that the attack had reopened wounds for victims of the 2016 truck attack in the southern French city, which was claimed by the so-called Islamic State group and killed more than 80 people.
He said the people of Nice relive the pain "every time some of our friends are hit".
In an interview with France Info, Mr Estrosi assumed an Islamist motive, saying: "We must wage war against the fifth column which crawls like an octopus through underground networks."
In his remarks in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Mr Trump also spoke of an "evil ideology [which] must be completely obliterated".
"Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed," he said during his his press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was ready to increase security co-operation with the UK after "this cynical, inhuman crime", adding that he expected that those behind it would "not escape the punishment they deserve".
But Viktor Ozerov, who heads the defence committee of Russia's upper house of parliament, called the bombing a "lesson" to British intelligence for refusing to share information with their Russian counterparts.
