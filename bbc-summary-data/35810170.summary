Marvel at Scotland's baby names

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The full list of names given to babies last year has been published by the National Records of Scotland (NRS).

The most popular were Emily and Jack, as reported last year when NRS released its list of top names.
The new list gives the complete details of forenames given to boys and girls in 2015.
And while the inspiration for them is not provided, popular culture such as film, TV and music appears to have played a part in the choices.
Thor and Loki, figures both from Norse mythology and the Marvel Comics universe, pop up on the list.
Loki, the trickster god of Norse legend, was the most popular choice with six boys named after him to the one Thor.
Roman mythology also seems to figure in the names with one boy being named Remus.
It could be suggested that Game of Thrones, the hugely popular TV fantasy drama, influenced the four Kits among the male names.
Actor Kit Harrington plays Jon Snow in the show. There are two boys named Jon on the list.
Another of Game of Thrones' characters figures among the girls' with three named Khaleesi, the title of a Dothraki queen played by Emilia Clarke. There are 79 Emilias on the list.
There are 13 girls called Leia. Were Star Wars fans among some of the parents? There are no boys called to Han, but 167 Harrisons - Harrison Ford played Star Wars' loveable rogue Han Solo - and more than 140 Lukes.
From the world of music, there is girl who was named Shakira and another Paloma, and among the boys a Bowie and two Axls.
Other eye-catching names from the list of those given to girls include December-Lee, Texas, Wolf, Diamond and two Briar-Roses, while among the boys there is a Sonnyboy and Tennessee and Testimony listed.
Away from popular culture, the forenames of some of politics' well-kent faces feature.
Conservative Ruth Davidson can find 12 baby Ruths in the data and SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon nine Nicolas.
The data revealed that the year after the independence referendum, there was one boy and four girls named Indy, 23 girls called Indie and another six named Indi.
The UK Labour leader would also be able to spot a boy named Corbyn.
Place-names also feature with boys called London and Lomond and girls who were named Paris.
There were also a number of unique baby names, with one girl called Surely, one Avana-Solaris, one Awesome and one Bliss.
Other unusual choices for girls included Forest, Fox, Pebbles and Rogue.
Some parents were perhaps inspired by cars, with one girl named Mercedes and another called Porsche.
There was also a girl named Snow, as well as one named Sunshine.
There were four baby girls called Sunny, while 74 newborn females were named Summer.
There was one boy called Bowie and four who were named Ziggy, perhaps inspired by David Bowie and his Ziggy Stardust alter-ego.
Six baby boys were given the name Buddy - the name chosen by TV chef Jamie Oliver for his son - and there was also one who was called Bully.
Journey, Karma, Lazarus, Peace, Panache, Pepper, Winter and Wisdom were among the other names chosen by parents for their new sons.
