A man with a rare type of leukaemia whose wife raised £400,000 to cover his medical costs in the USA will begin treatment on Thursday.

Kate Brandon, 33, set up a social media campaign two weeks ago for her husband Mike, 31, after his consultant said all NHS routes were "exhausted".
She hoped to raise enough money to send him for "revolutionary" cancer trials at the University of Pennsylvania.
The target was reached within days and the couple flew out on Tuesday.
Mrs Brandon said: "We have had some preliminary tests done and have met with Mike's medical team.
"All being well we are hoping to go for cell collection on Thursday."
She added that she was "overwhelmed and grateful" for the support of the public and the media, and wanted to thank everyone "from the bottom of our hearts".
Mr Brandon was diagnosed two years ago with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
An earlier social media campaign found a stem cell donor for his condition, but he relapsed in February and was told there was "little" his consultant could do.
Mr Brandon said his "family and friends have had to bear the true load" of his illness, and described his wife as his "ultimate superhero".
Mrs Brandon said £400,000 was the minimum needed to cover medical costs, flights and general living costs.
The CAR T-cell therapy treatment will be carried out at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Centre.
Any extra money raised by the #donate4Mike appeal will be donated to Bristol's oncology unit.
