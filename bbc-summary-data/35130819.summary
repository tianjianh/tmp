A retiring police chief has warned against confusing extremism with religious conservatism, when tackling terrorism.

Chief Constable Chris Sims is retiring from his post at West Midlands Police after six years.
He said damaging views had affected investigations into the so-called Trojan Horse plot about an alleged Muslim takeover of Birmingham schools.
"It would be utterly wrong to label everything as extremism," Mr Sims said.

"We need to be really careful that in using this term 'extremism' we don't alienate the vast majority of law-abiding Muslim people in the West Midlands, who want to go about normal lives with normal aspirations.
"We absolutely need their support to combat the tiny minority of violent extremists who are their enemies and our enemies and who collectively we need to work to combat."
He said the force was able to respond effectively to a terror attack, despite cuts of about Â£130m in the five years since the government's 2010 Spending Review.
"It's very difficult to be ahead of it," said Mr Sims. "Even in Paris with the huge numbers of officers and troops that they had on the ground. But we've got very skilled armed officers, we've got good plans as to how to deploy them and we would put on a very effective response."
Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) has rated West Midlands Police as 'outstanding' in its preparation for policing to 2020 and beyond.
Mr Sims, 57, received an OBE in 2003 and Queen's Police Medal in 2010 for "distinguished police service".
