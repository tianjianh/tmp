Michael Martin, 25, was last seen at his home in Sidmouth Drive, Blackley, in the early hours of 7 August.
Greater Manchester Police have searched four properties across the city and a room at the Premier Inn in Higher Blackley, while Mr Martin's car was discovered in Vermere Avenue.
The force said it was treating the investigation as a "non-body murder".
In an earlier appeal, officers said they believed Mr Martin may have been assaulted.
Det Insp Andrew Naismith said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who may have any information about what has happened to Michael Martin.
"We are investigating a number of possibilities, however a non-body murder investigation has now been launched.
"Our specialist support officers are supporting Michael's family through this incredibly difficult time and my thoughts are with them."
