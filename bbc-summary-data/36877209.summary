[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pars appealed for a penalty when Joe Cardle went down in the box under a Lewis Toshney challenge, but the referee waved the claim away.
United took the lead just after the break when Murray headed in Tope Obadeyi's flick on from close range.
Fraser fired home a superb free-kick to seal the win seven minutes from time.
Dunfermline knew they needed a win to keep alive their own hopes of making it through to the next round, and may feel aggrieved at the failure of referee John McKendrick to award them a first half penalty.
Cardle was being held back by Toshney as he drove into the box, and the United defender certainly made contact with the attacker's ankle as he went to ground. The referee was unimpressed, with Cardle's delayed fall perhaps influencing his decision.
Ray McKinnon's new look United took control from the start, with veteran midfielder Willo Flood pulling the strings.
Murray and Fraser both went close early, but for all their control, the home side failed to create many meaningful chances in the opening period.
The breakthrough came just after the break, with 18-year-old left-back Jamie Robson's cross flicked on by Tope Obadeyi, leaving Murray to nod home from seven yards.
Lee Ashcroft met Kallum Higginbotham's free-kick as the Pars searched for a leveller, but the defender's downward header was scooped off the line superbly by United goalkeeper Cammy Bell. The goal would not have stood in any case as the flag was up for offside.
Dunfermline could have been reduced to 10 men late on, Kallum Higginbotham fortunate to escape punishment for a wild swing on Toshney having been booked earlier in the match.
United continued to push forward and sealed the win on 83 minutes.
Fraser curled a superb free-kick past Pars goalkeeper David Hutton from 20 yards into the roof of the net.
McKinnon's men now look forward to a last 16 tie with Partick Thistle.
