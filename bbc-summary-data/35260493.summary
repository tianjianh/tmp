Police negotiators were called to a building in Silkhouse Court - believed to be a solicitors' office - in Tithebarn Street at about 10:30 GMT.
Staff working there referred on Twitter to a "bomb scare on the fifth floor" and then evacuated the building.
Police said nobody was injured in the incident, but warned the area would remain cordoned off until a full search of the premises had been completed.
Several streets were sealed off while police tried to negotiate with the man.
Tithebarn Street and Old Hall Street at the junction with Union Street were closed and there was also disruption in Chapel Street, George Street and Exchange Street.
