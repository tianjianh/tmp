[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Archbishop of Wales has announced he will retire next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Barry Morgan has spent almost 14 years at the helm of the Church in Wales, making him the longest serving archbishop in the worldwide Anglican Communion.
He will also retire as Bishop of Llandaff after more than 17 years, having previously been Bishop of Bangor for nearly seven years.
Dr Morgan said it had been an "enormous privilege to serve".
"It's been a rollercoaster ride but all along I have been sustained and inspired by the people I meet, day in day out," he added.
During his time as archbishop, Dr Morgan has championed many changes in the Church in Wales, including a change in its law to enable women to be ordained as bishops.
He also apologised "unreservedly" to gay couples for prejudice in the church.
Dr Morgan lost his wife Hilary to cancer earlier this year.
He said: "I would like to thank all those who have supported, shared and upheld me in my ministry over the years, particularly since Hilary's death - the loss of her love, encouragement and friendship has been enormously hard to bear."
Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Dr Morgan had been "an extraordinary servant of those places where he has ministered".
First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, said: "He has had such a positive impact on the lives of so many people from Wales' religious communities and has encouraged the establishment of good community relations across the country.
"I am grateful for his advice and wisdom on matters affecting the economic, social and cultural life in Wales and for his unwavering commitment to promote interfaith work across Wales."
