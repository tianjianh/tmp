Spurs are second in the table, two points behind leaders Leicester after coming from behind to beat Swansea 2-1 at White Hart Lane on Sunday.
"Nobody speaks about the title in our dressing room," Pochettino told Sky Sports.
"We believe we can win every game and we'll see what happens at the end of the season."
The Argentine added: "Now, we need to focus again. We have a strong squad and we will try to manage it in the right way."
With 11 games remaining, Tottenham are three points and a league place above north London rivals Arsenal, who lost 3-2 at Manchester United.
"For me, it is not important that Arsenal lost," said Pochettino. "What is important is our own performance and there are still 11 Premier League games ahead."
In Sunday's game, Italian striker Alberto Paloschi capitalised on a fortuitous deflection to open the scoring for Swansea, who held their lead until the 70th minute thanks largely to a string of saves from goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.
Substitute Nacer Chadli turned Kyle Walker's cross in to bring Tottenham level before Danny Rose's drive from the edge of the box won the game for the home side.
"It was hard because we conceded early," Pochettino told BBC Sport. "Sometimes in football it is difficult, but the good thing is that the team fought, tried to score and played well. It was a fantastic win.
"Fabianski was great. He was man of the match. But I have to congratulate our players because of the energy we showed and the way we kept trying was fantastic.
"In the end we fully deserved out victory."
