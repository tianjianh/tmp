Premier League predictions: Lawro v ex-F1 driver Mark Webber

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is former F1 driver Mark Webber.
The Australian is a Manchester United fan and thinks Old Trafford cult hero Eric Cantona is the football star who would make the best racing driver.

"He's a nutter isn't he? Us racing drivers are all nutters too so you can't have anyone sensible behind the wheel," Webber explained. "So I've got to go for Eric. He's a legend."
Webber has been a United fan since their dramatic win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.
"That was pretty much the first football match I watched in its entirety," he said.
"It was a pretty special game and you couldn't help but be drawn to the team that never gave up. That was my first experience of 'Fergie time' but I saw lots more of that from that day onwards.
"It is still my favourite game of all time. I've been to some live matches which were great but watching them win the treble on TV was the real emotional spark for me to start watching football."
You can make your predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the last round of games before the international break, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including two perfect scores.
His score of 110 points saw him beat sprint star Darren Campbell, who picked three correct results with no perfect scores, for a total of 30.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
