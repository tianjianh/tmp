[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bishop of Truro says Church of England has 'six years'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Bishop of Truro has said the Church of England has only "five or six years" to save itself.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Right Reverend Tim Thornton said "radical changes" were needed to halt a "steady decline".
Bishop Thornton previously said the Church of England would struggle to exist in 10 years.
Speaking on Radio Cornwall, he said: "I'd been saying that for a while now so I think we have to come down and say it's five or six years."
Bishop Thornton said analysis of attendance figures was "all showing one thing".
He said: "I fear that we are on a steady decline at the moment."
The Diocese of Truro voted on 8 November 2014 for a 28% increase in the amount of money it needs from local churchgoers to reduce a Â£1.2m deficit over the next year.
