Presidential election debate: All our best material in one place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first US presidential debate is over after a frenetic 90 minutes - now it's time to get your breath back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We had teams all across the US, including the venue in Hofstra University, New York, on the night.
Here's a one-stop shop for all our best material from the debate, including all the latest reaction.
by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
While Mr Trump had a strategy - and pursued it on occasion - he was often blown off course by the former secretary of state and torpedoed by his own sometimes badgering performance.
While Mrs Clinton was occasionally prone to know-it-all-ness - particularly in her repeated appeals to outside fact-checkers - she largely maintained the upper hand.
Read Anthony's analysis here of the three ways she scored points, the two times Mr Trump gained an edge and one very important wildcard.
Here's our pick of the most important parts of the evening.

Ahead of time, many wondered if Donald Trump - who in past debates with his mostly male Republican rivals used insults and personal attacks - would use the same tactics with Hillary Clinton.
But Trump never openly insulted Clinton, never called her "Crooked Hillary", nor did he cross the stage at any point, as a former senate opponent famously did with Clinton in 2000 - a move that was seen as physically intimidating towards a female candidate.
Despite that, gender and sexism did feature prominently during several exchanges in the debate, and in the initial feedback on the candidates' performance on social media.

We sat with supporters of both camps in Seattle to see how they responded as the debate went on.

On Twitter the debate racked up numbers more commonly seen during international sporting events or shocking breaking news. Nearly five million tweets were sent out using hashtags #DebateNight and #Debates2016.
To put that into perspective, that's about 20 times the comparable number sent during the  first big showdown of the UK 2015 general election - considered at the time to be a massive online political event.
And one candidate dominated the majority of the conversation: Twitter's communications team estimated that 62% of tweets were about Trump.

During the debate Mr Trump said African-Americans were "living in hell" in the US due to gun violence.
We asked voters in Harlem what they made of the debate.
(Actually, he did support it, sort of, and moderator Lester Holt tried his best to point this out.)
In general, the debate was a bonanza for fact checkers - you can read more from BBC Reality Check here.
Much of the pressure was on NBC anchor Lester Holt - half the country demanded he take a firm hand, and the rest were worried he might interfere - so how did he perform on the night?
At least one did. Walt in Philadelphia told the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan that before the debate he was leaning towards Trump but now believes Clinton has the better plan.

Most large US media outlets awarded victory to Mrs Clinton.
But columnists also noted that Republican Mr Trump had the ability to "adapt after failure" and said there was a risk Mrs Clinton could become "cocky" after her assured performance.

We can't speak for the whole world, but this is how it went down with young people in China.
Quite a bit, including the Syria conflict and Trump's Mexican border wall. (But don't worry, there are two more presidential debates to come).
