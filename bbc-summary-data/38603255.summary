The 21-year-old former Bolton Wanderers man will be eligible for the Stags' trip to Notts County on Saturday.
A former Sheffield Wednesday trainee, he has played nine times in all competitions for Posh this term.
"I have been looking at a number of right-backs and kept coming back to his name," said Mansfield boss Steve Evans.
"I had a conversation with (Peterborough's director of football) Barry Fry and (chairman) Darragh MacAnthony and the option was for Mansfield to take the boy on loan with a view to doing something more permanent."
