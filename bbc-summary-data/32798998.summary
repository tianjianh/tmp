Matthew Cherrington, 32, from West Bromwich, murdered 26-year-old sex worker Lidia Pascale, who was last seen on 19 November 2014.
Her body was discovered more than two weeks later in Hope Street, West Bromwich.
Cherrington must serve a minimum of 19 years, Birmingham Crown Court was told.
The electrician arranged for Ms Pascale, who had been working as an escort, to visit his flat where he attacked and killed her, West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Ms Pascale, who had been staying in Smethwick, West Midlands, and Coventry, had suffered at least 11 blows to the head.
Judge Melbourne Inman told Cherrington he was "a very dangerous man capable of extreme unprovoked violence" who had "never shown any remorse or regret."
The CPS said Cherrington, of High Street, tried to "evade detection" and had blamed an associate for Ms Pascale's disappearance.
Mobile phone analysis showed he had contacted several escorts including Ms Pascale on the day of the murder, the CPS said.
Emily Lenham, from the CPS, said: "A very dangerous man has been convicted of a brutal and senseless crime."
A West Midlands Police spokesperson said the force was supporting Ms Pascale's family, who are from Tulcea in Romania.
