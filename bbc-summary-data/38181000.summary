Adam Mitchell disappeared after a night out in the city on 9 November.
His family were told on 28 November that a body had been found at St Fergus, Aberdeenshire. Police have confirmed that it is Mr Mitchell.
His family have asked that those attending the celebration wear band T-shirts as a tribute to the teenager's love of music.
The date and venue for the celebration are to be confirmed at a later date.
In a death notice in the Inverness Courier, his family said: "In honour of Adam we wish all who attend to wear band shirts.
"Dig them out from the back of your wardrobe and wear them with pride as he did."
