Three workers killed when Didcot Power Station collapsed suffered "multiple injuries", a coroner said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains of Chris Huxtable, Kenneth Cresswell and John Shaw were recovered in the past three weeks following the partial collapse of the boiler house at the Didcot A plant in February.
The inquest was opened and adjourned until November.
A fourth victim, Michael Collings, was recovered shortly after the collapse.
Fingerprints, dental records, tattoos and clothing were used to identify Mr Huxtable, 33, from Swansea, and Mr Cresswell, 57, and Mr Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham.
Mr Creswell and Mr Shaw were demolition workers and Mr Huxtable was a burner.
The coroner said they all died on 23 February when the building collapsed.
The death of Mr Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was confirmed shortly after the collapse. He also died from multiple injuries.
Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety executive are investigating the cause of the initial collapse.
The remaining section was brought down using explosives in July.
