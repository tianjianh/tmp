Aston Villa v Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Birmingham City boss Harry Redknapp takes charge of his first game with an away Championship derby against Blues' fierce rivals Aston Villa.

The hosts are without suspended top scorer Jonathan Kodjia, whose ban for kicking an opponent in Monday's defeat at Fulham has been reduced to one game.
Blues may have to give goalkeeper Adam Legzdins a first start in three months.
He came on at half-time in Monday's home defeat by Burton to deputise for the injured Tomasz Kuszczak.
Legzdins will continue in goal if Blues' first-choice keeper fails to recover from the knock which forced him off against the Brewers.
Top scorer Lukas Jutkiewicz recovered from a hamstring injury to play 90 minutes in Gianfranco Zola's final game in charge on Monday, and should keep his place.
Although Villa are without their talismanic top scorer Kodjia, they do have a dangerous potential replacement in fit-again Gabby Agbonlahor, who has not scored in 14 months but has a prolific derby record against Blues. They also have January signing Scott Hogan who, although having so far netted just once for Villa, did score in both this season's meetings with Birmingham for previous club Brentford.
While Agbonlahor has been sidelined for three months with a torn hamstring, boss Steve Bruce - up against his old club - will also monitor the fitness of Wales international full-back Neil Taylor, who has missed the last two games with a groin strain.
Redknapp starts with a derby, just as Bruce finished his Blues career with a derby, in November 2007 - a game that ended in a 2-1 Villa away victory, thanks to Agbonlahor's late winner.
Villa manager Steve Bruce told BBC WM:
"I did think Kodia's red card was harsh. The fourth official got involved and he was the one who made the decision. But it was pretty obvious there was no real malice. It should have been two yellow cards and get on with the game. It's a shame we haven't got him but at least he's now available for the last two games.
"Just when Gabby had got himself in good physical nick, he did his hamstring. But he's got a good record in derby games and is desperate to do something.
"Scott Hogan has not had the best of starts with us, but he has been a bit hampered with injury."
Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp:
"I've got what I've got here. You can blame who you want. You can blame Zola - and I wouldn't blame Franco because he's a fantastic guy - but it comes down to the players.
"I knew it was three points (above the relegation zone) and saw the goal difference and thought 'that's not good either'. It's a risk but what can happen? No one has a magic wand in football.
"You could put (Sir Alex) Ferguson in the same position and he's not going to walk in the door and make them play like Manchester United."
Villa will hold a minute's silence before the game in honour of their former defender Ugo Ehiogu, whose death at the age of 44 was announced on Friday.
"It's a tragedy," Villa boss Bruce told BBC Sport. "And it puts a game of football into perspective. All fans will show their respect to a really good player, whether you're claret and blue, or a blue.
"It's just unthinkable that he's passed away. Shocking news. He was so young, so fit and so athletic. And I believe he was turning into a very good coach too. The word on the grapevine was that he'd gone along very quietly working with Tottenham's academy and their Under-23s, and that he was making a very big name for himself.
"I played against him many times. The 1994 League Cup final springs to mind. He was a big, huge colossus of a man who took no nonsense. A very good player. He and Gareth Southgate were the cornerstone of this club for a lot of years and the envy of a lot of clubs. Two top-class players. And, when they left and went to Middlesbrough, they did very well there too."
