[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
hDaniela Musca slapped the woman twice in the face at Collamere Nursing Home in Lostwithiel, Cornwall in January 2014, a Nursing and Midwidery Council panel heard.
Ms Musca, 47, claimed the woman had hit her in the face beforehand.
But the panel agreed her response had been "excessive" and ordered her to be removed from the nursing register.
Ms Musca had told the panel: "I've asked this lady if she needs my help. Suddenly she punched me in the face.
"It wasn't my intention to abuse this lady."
However, a colleague at the home told the panel she "could not believe her eyes" when she saw Ms Musca slap the woman, and shouted at her to leave her alone.
The panel heard Ms Musca had been convicted of assault in February 2015 at Bodmin Magistrates Court following the incident.
No one from Collamere Nursing Home was available for comment.
