Bedfordshire policeman 'asked woman for naked photos'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A policeman urged a vulnerable woman he met in the cells to send him naked photos and videos, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Andrew Hurst admitted misconduct in a public office at St Albans Crown Court on Tuesday.
Hurst, 31, of Carmichael Drive in Shortstown, near Bedford, was told to expect a prison term when he is sentenced on 25 October.
Bedfordshire's Assistant Chief Constable Mike Colbourne said Hurst had shown "deplorable conduct".
The woman was in the cells after being arrested for shoplifting.
Hurst, who joined Bedfordshire Police in 2009, offered the woman assistance in getting mental health support, but then continued communicating with her by telephone and social media, the court heard.
Between May 2014 and March 2015, the communication took on a sexual nature.
The woman's partner became aware of their relationship in March 2015 and contacted the police.
