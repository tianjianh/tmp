Michael Wood, town crier for the East Riding of Yorkshire, came closest to the 112.3 decibel record - set by Alan Myatt in 1991 during a 48-hour endurance event - with a cry measured at 108.4db.
The event was organised to mark the 20th anniversary of the abolition of Humberside County Council.
The record for the loudest shout, rather than cry, was set by Annalisa Wray in 1994 when she achieved a shout of 121.7db.
