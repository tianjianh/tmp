Hampshire Police were called to Pier Street, Ventnor, shortly after midnight to reports a 57-year-old man had been assaulted outside the Rose Inn.
The force said a 26-year-old man was initially held. A further two men, aged 31 and 32, have since been arrested.
Hampshire Constabulary has appealed witnesses to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Dave Brown said: "Investigations are continuing today as we work to establish the exact circumstances of this man's death.
"We would like to speak to anyone who was in or in the vicinity of the Rose Inn on Christmas Eve night."
A section of Pier Street was cordoned off for much of Christmas Day but has since reopened.
