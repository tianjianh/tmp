Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished down 279.25 points, or 1.6%, at 16,955.73.
The dollar fell to below 110 yen. A stronger yen is generally seen as negative for Japanese exporters.
The moves came as Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, announced a delay to a planned rise in sales tax.
The increase in the sales tax rate to 10% from 8%, which had been planned for 2017, has now been pushed back to late 2019.
Among individual stocks, Softbank rose by 0.4% after the Japanese technology firm said it was  offloading $7.9bn (Â£5.4bn) worth of shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The transaction will reduce Softbank's stake in Alibaba from 32.2% to 28%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1% to 2,913.51, while in Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index ended 54.11 points lower at 20,760.98.
In Australia, the S&P ASX/200 index closed down 55.39 points, or 1% ,at 5,323.17.
South Korea's Kospi index was flat for most of the session and closed at 1,982.72.
