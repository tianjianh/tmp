Flood-hit Lough Neagh firms question agency measures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flood-hit businesses on the shores of Lough Neagh have questioned whether enough was done to prevent rising waters brought on by winter storms.

Water levels at the lake are at a 30-year-high after recent heavy rain.
At Oxford Island on the lough's southern tip, flood waters are knee-deep and several business properties have been badly damaged.
One MLA has said the Northern Ireland Executive must give more help to businesses damaged by floods.
A warning is in place from the Met Office for more heavy rain on Wednesday night and businesses at Kinnego Marina at Lough Neagh say they are worried they would face more problems.
The firms employ 20 people and are unable to trade due to floods at their premises.
The water level in Lough Neagh is controlled by flood gates at Toomebridge in County Antrim, which the Rivers Agency has said have been fully opened since early November.
But business owners at Kinnego Marina have said they want to know if that was done in advance of recent severe storms so that the lough could accommodate the additional water.
One man, Paul Quinn, said his business was "inoperable" and he had not seen the water level as high in over 40 years.
"This is going to take us months to clean up and get back on track again, and this is our busiest time of year," he said.
"It's really going to have a big effect on all four businesses.
"Our biggest predicament is the rainfall coming later this evening and tomorrow morning.
"And if the wind rises, we're going to get a wave effect off the lough, and that's really worrying us."
The SDLP's Dolores Kelly said an emergency executive meeting was needed to discuss how to help business across Northern Ireland affected by floods.
She said she had contacted government agencies to get help for the traders at Kinnego Marina but was told that "commercial properties were well down the pecking order" when it came to receiving assistance.
The businesses had lost stock worth "tens of thousands" of pounds, she said, and one of the shops had recently spent Â£10,000 on renovations.
"These businessmen have invested in these properties and they really are distraught as to what they're going to get in terms of help today and coping with the aftermath when [flood waters] recede," Ms Kelly said.
"I find it incomprehensible that in GB, [Prime Minister David] Cameron on St Stephen's Day held an emergency meeting regarding the floods in Cumbria, but it's my understanding that the next executive meeting isn't until 21 January.
"I've called on the executive to release additional funding to help commercial properties."
David Porter of the Rivers Agency said "repeated winter storms" were putting pressure on the lough and its outlets.
"The gates have been opened fully since early in November to let as much water out of the system as we possibly can," he said.
"But more rain keeps falling within the catchment."
