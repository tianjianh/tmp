It is understood that about 50 migrants in Calais boarded a P&O ferry named the Spirit of Britain, while it was unloading.
The incident happened during a protest at the port, in favour of migrants.
The port has since reopened, with sailing services returning to normal.
P&O Ferries said the "security incident" had been resolved but warned passengers to expect delays of up to 45 minutes.
The demonstration was held in support of migrants and, according to AP news agency, attracted a crowd of 2,000 people.
Some of the protesters at the demonstration carried banners saying "refugees welcome here". People from Britain were among the demonstrators.
On Saturday evening, a statement from the Port of Dover said: "The Port of Calais is currently experiencing migrant activity which has caused disruption to ferry services.
"Therefore services to and from Calais via the Port of Dover are affected, but DFDS Seaways [ferry] services are still running to Dunkirk as normal.
"The Port of Dover remains open for business, but the duration of this disruption to services remains unknown."
DFDS Seaways earlier tweeted that Calais had been closed due to a "migrant invasion".
Thousands of migrants are currently living in camps known as "the Jungle" on the edge of Calais.
The population of the camp has risen steadily in recent weeks to about 2,500, including about 250 children, according to medical volunteer group, Medecins Sans Frontieresâ€Ž.
In August last year, the UK and France signed an agreement on new measures to try and alleviate the crisis, including a new command centre to help tackle trafficking gangs.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn visited a migrant camp in northern France and spoken of the "dreadful conditions" there.
The Labour leader said conditions in the Grande-Synthe camp near Dunkirk would be a "disgrace anywhere", and Britain should be "part of bringing European support to people".
He said the long-term solution was to deal with the conflicts causing the crisis.
The situation in Calais comes amid an influx of migrants to Europe - caused largely by people fleeing war and oppression in countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea.
On Friday French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned that Europe's migration crisis was putting the EU at grave risk.
