Ryan Morse: Second GP cleared of boy's manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The second of two GPs accused of unlawfully killing a 12-year-old boy has been cleared.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Morse, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, died on 8 December 2012 from Addison's disease.
The jury at Cardiff Crown Court was dismissed and the judge acquitted Dr Joanne Rudling, 46, of Cardiff, of manslaughter on Friday.
Dr Lindsey Thomas, 42, from Tredegar, was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence on 27 May.
A new trial with a new jury will consider a second charge against Dr Rudling of perverting the course of public justice.
The doctors had been accused of not asking enough questions about Ryan's condition before he died. Both had denied the charges.
The court has previously heard Ryan's death could have been prevented if he had been examined at any point up until a couple of hours before it happened.
Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled there was insufficient evidence.
She said: "I had decided that there was no case upon which a properly directed jury could convict Dr Rudling."
