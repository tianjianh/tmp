The 28-year-old Scotland international has agreed a three-year deal and joins the Lancashire club for an undisclosed fee, thought to be about Â£3m.
The Clarets have also signed 19-year-old Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah on loan until January.
Chalobah has yet to make a Premier League appearance, but has impressed during loan spells with Watford, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough.
Boyd, who signed for the Tigers from Peterborough midway through their promotion campaign in 2012-13, has made one league appearance this season.
The deals bring the number of summer signings at newly promoted Burnley to nine.
Hull manager Steve Bruce had revealed on Sunday that the player was nearing a move to the Clarets, adding: "I wish him well. I've been in the game a long time and if all professional footballers were like George Boyd my job would be easy."
He came off the bench against Stoke last weekend and started in Hull's first Europa League qualifying tie against Lokeren, which they lost 1-0.
Burnley have yet to win a Premier League game this season, but held Manchester United to a 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Saturday.
