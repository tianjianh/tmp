Walsall: Saddlers hope to solve goalkeeping injury problem

Walsall are hoping to have first-choice goalkeeper Neil Etheridge back in action this weekend following a mini injury crisis between the sticks.

The Saddlers' keeper woes began when Etheridge gashed his knee in the 4-0 FA Cup fourth round defeat at Reading.
Craig MacGillivray, his replacement, then came in to keep goal in last Tuesday night's 2-1 win at Doncaster.
But he suffered a shoulder injury in training, forcing Liam Roberts into his debut in Saturday's loss to Millwall.
The Saddlers now anticipate changing their keeper for the fourth successive game, but hope to have Etheridge back as the cut to his knee is not as bad as the one he suffered in October.
Walsall expect a midweek update on MacGillivray but, with Etheridge expected to report fit, 21-year-old Roberts would then revert to bench duty for Saturday's trip to League One strugglers Crewe Alexandra.
Walsall debutant Liam Roberts was beaten three times in the home loss to Millwall, but still earned praise from head coach Sean O'Driscoll.
"It's always difficult for any third-choice keeper to come in at the last minute," O'Driscoll told BBC WM.
"It was a swirling wind, very difficult conditions. But he equipped himself well and can be pleased with  his debut. Maybe, looking back, he might be disappointed with the first goal, be he had no chance with the other two."
