[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 3-1 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley launched themselves off the bottom of the table with a rousing win against Boreham Wood at Nethermoor Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a cagey start, the Lions belied their lowly status at the bottom of the table and went toe-to-toe with their seventh-placed opponents.
The battlers took the lead early in the second half when Atkinson headed in Simon Walton's delicious corner.
Will Hatfield extended it when he received Jake Cassidy's lay-off and struck home via the post.
Boreham's talisman Kenny Davis however arrived in the right place at the right time to nod one back.
Cassidy restored Guiseley's two-goal lead, netting on the rebound after a Hatfield effort had been saved.
