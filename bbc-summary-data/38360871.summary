[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 2-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby halted a run of three straight defeats with a victory over Accrington thanks to goals from Tom Bolarinwa and Ashley Chambers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals in each half proved enough for Marcus Bignot's Mariners, who had gone into the game on the back of defeats to Crawley, Portsmouth and Doncaster.
Grimsby broke the deadlock when Bolarinwa took advantage of a slip from Accrington's Omar Beckles to go through one-on-one with goalkeeper Aaron Chapman before slotting the ball home.
Accrington came out well for the restart and went close to pulling level, but Grimsby goalkeeper Dean Henderson, on loan from Manchester United, blocked Billy Kee's shot on the goalline.
As the second-half wore on, Accrington pushed for an equaliser with John O'Sullivan's strike clipping the side-netting and substitute Shay McCartan forcing Henderson to kick away a low effort.
But, as the visitors chased the game, Grimsby sealed the points when top-scorer Omar Bogle set up Chambers and after touching the ball past the last defender, he slammed home the Mariners' second.
