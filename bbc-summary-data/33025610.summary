Delays expected on A55 and A483 in Wrexham for road works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers have been warned to expect major delays on the A55 and A483 on the Chester-Wrexham border as carriageways are closed for ongoing improvements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The closures from 22:00 BST on Friday at the Posthouse roundabout are part of Â£6m layout changes.
The A55 under the roundabout will be closed in both directions until 07:00 BST on Sunday, while the west bridge will be shut until 05:00 on Monday.
The roundabout will also be partially closed until Monday morning.
Work began last summer and was expected to finish by March but it has now been pushed back to 28 June.
