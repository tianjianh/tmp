A "few" policymakers were of the opinion economic data may support a hike in interest rates, the statement said.
Rates have been at record lows since December 2008.
Those at the meeting were divided over whether the US economy's sluggishness over the winter was just a blip.
Market reaction was muted.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.06% to 18,301.12 points, the S&P 500 rose 0.03%, to 2,128.51 points, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.15% to 5,077.79.
