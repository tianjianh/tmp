MLA expenses: Panel 'did not make mistake'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The panel that sets MLAs' allowances has said it believes it did not make a mistake in a ruling in 2012 which is at the centre of a row over expenses.

There has been a public disagreement this week between the Stormont expenses watchdog, the Independent Financial Review Panel (IRFP) and the cross-party group which manages the Assembly.
The panel says the Assembly Commission was wrong to pay £150 000 in expenses to a company which Sinn Féin MLAs had claimed for on the basis that it was doing research.
In response, the commission insisted it had applied the panel's rules correctly.
However, on Thursday night in a statement to the BBC, the panel again rejected the commission's position.
The IRFP said: "It remains the panel's view that these expenses should not have been claimed and should not have been paid."
The statement also said that it is incorrect to suggest the panel "made a mistake" in a ruling of March 2012 and "sought to amend it" in another determination in December 2012.
The assembly has claimed that the payments of £150 000, which were made between April and December 2012, were allowed because the contract for the work pre-dated the ruling.
But the IRFP has said: "The panel is absolutely clear that its March 2012 determination allowed MLAs to employ staff to provide research and/or secretarial services, but that that determination did not allow MLAs to seek payment for contracts with third-party providers for such services."
