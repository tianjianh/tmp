The reigning Olympic flyweight champion, who sealed her spot in Rio on Thursday, beat Bulgaria's Stanimira Petrova by split decision to take gold.
Adams is now targeting gold at May's World Championships, the only major title the 33-year-old is yet to win.
British heavyweight Lawrence Okolie and super heavyweight Joe Joyce also picked up gold medals in Samsun.
Okolie was awarded the gold after his French opponent, Paul Omba Biongolo, withdrew, while Joyce beat the Olympic bronze medallist from Azerbaijan, Magomedrasul Majidov, by split decision.
Both London fighters had booked their places in Rio by winning semi-finals on Friday.
Welshman Joe Cordina had to settle for silver in his lightweight final after a split decision favoured French number one seed Sofiane Oumiha.
A jubilant Adams told BBC Sport she was now focused on the Women's World Championships in Kazakhstan, which take place from 19-27 May.
"Winning this gold shows I am still a strong force in Europe and it has set me up nicely for the World Championships. I want to go there and win a gold medal," she said.
"Hopefully I can become a European champion, world champion and Olympic champion all in one year."
