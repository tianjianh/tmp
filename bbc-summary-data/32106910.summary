Jan Hansen, who made the giant egg plans to sell it in pieces to raise money for charity.
But it's not the tallest chocolate egg; that world record was set in Italy, back in 2011.
It was made by Tosca chocolatiers and weighed 7,200 kg and was 10.39 m (34 ft 1.05 in) tall.
That's as high as a double-decker bus and heavier than a full size elephant. Yum!
