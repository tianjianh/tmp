'Risk' doctor delivered Samantha Cameron's child despite warnings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gynaecologist helped deliver David and Samantha Cameron's daughter Florence despite warnings to NHS chiefs he posed a risk, it is claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rob Jones, who was an obstetrician and gynaecologist, continued to practise despite eight reviews into his work.
His boss, Dr Paul Upton, now faces misconduct allegations at a medical tribunal.
Mr Jones treated Mrs Cameron when she went into labour with her fourth child whilst on holiday in Cornwall in 2010.

Mrs Cameron was taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro, where she had an emergency caesarean resulting in the successful birth of Florence, weighing 6lbs 1oz.
Eight months earlier a premature baby Mr Jones delivered died due to pre-eclampsia, the tribunal heard.
He was partially excluded from clinical practice in October 2011 following concerns expressed from senior colleagues.
Mr Jones had been the subject of a string of complaints over many years but Dr Paul Upton did not investigate them properly - and allowed to him carry on working, it was said.
It is claimed Dr Upton failed to get a report about complaints relating to Mr Jones and also failed to obtain a report about legal actions being taken against the gynaecologist.
He is further accused of failing to arrange meetings with colleagues who had raised concerns about Mr Jones and also of failing to restrict him from clinical practice.
Other charges include him allegedly making misleading statements to television and radio reporters in which he claimed he did not have enough evidence against the obstetrician and gynaecologist.
Mr Jones, who worked at the hospital from 1997, was suspended in May 2012 and retired the following October after it emerged he had continued to practise despite eight reviews into his work over a 12-year period.
More than 200 former patients of Mr Jones, who also practised as an obstetrician, are taking legal action against the trust for the harm they say was done to them under his care.
A report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found his patients had had more than five times the number of surgical complications during hysterectomy operations than would "usually be expected" in a consultant's career.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has already said it "apologised unreservedly" to its patients.
Senior consultant Dr Upton quit the board of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust in 2013 but still works for the trust as an anaesthetist.
The hearing convened by the Medical Practioners Tribunal Service in Manchester continues.
