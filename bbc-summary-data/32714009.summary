A man left with life-changing injuries following an unprovoked drunken attack says he will dedicate the rest of his life to ensuring the same thing does not happen to anyone else.

Paul Pugh, 34, was in a coma for two months after four men beat him during a night out in Carmarthenshire in 2007.
He has rebuilt his life over eight years, requiring bouts of brain surgery.
Now, a video detailing his story will be shown in schools.
Hundreds of people have already taken Paul's Pledge - a campaign led by Mr Pugh and Dyfed-Powys Police to never condone violent behaviour.
"It's something I needed to do, both for myself - to help me get better - and to try and prevent the same thing happening to anyone else," he said.
"I don't care how many times I have to tell my story, how long it takes to get the message out there, I will dedicate the rest of my life to making people understand that drunkenness is never an excuse for violence."
The documentary starts with the 999 call made after Mr Pugh's assault.
It goes on to show harrowing CCTV footage of Paul on the ground surrounded by his attackers.
"I wanted to tell my story and educate people on how attacks like this devastate lives, but if the message was really going to hit home it had to do more than that, it had to shock people," he said.
"It takes these really chilling images to cut through the bravado and force people to stop and think.
"There's no point in demonising them, as that just makes people think that they're not the sort of person who'd do something like that. The point is anyone could be 'that sort of person' unless they're careful."
Mr Pugh said his next challenge was to carry on with intensive physiotherapy so he can one day lead an independent life again.
