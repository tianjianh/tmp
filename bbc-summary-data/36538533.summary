The 16-1 chance, trained by Clive Cox, just overcame Found as Japanese favourite A Shin Hikari disappointed.
Earlier, American filly Lady Aurelia sprinted to a stunning seven-length triumph under Frankie Dettori in the Queen Mary Stakes.
Dettori called her "breathtaking" after she left her rivals trailing in the five-furlong contest.
The 2-1 chance, trained by Wesley Ward, stormed to victory from the front, with Al Johrar second.
Dettori enjoyed more success in the final race of the day, riding 11-4 favourite Persuasive to victory in the Sandringham Stakes.
Meanwhile, Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin team celebrated a treble with winners trained in three different countries.
Usherette, trained in France by Andre Fabre, won the Duke of Cambridge Stakes after Ribchester landed the Jersey Stakes for North Yorkshire-based Richard Fahey and Portage took the Royal Hunt Cup for Irish trainer Michael Halford.

Kirby will not want this week to stop - doubling his career tally of Group One winners in the space of just 24 hours, with the arrival of a child for good measure.
On Tuesday he triumphed on Profitable, also trained by Cox, just hours after girlfriend Megan gave birth to their son Charlie.
On Wednesday, A Shin Hakari - the highest-rated Flat horse in the world - was sent off the odds-on favourite but failed to get away from the field.
Ryan Moore produced Found and looked sure to give Aidan O'Brien his 50th Royal Ascot winner, but Kirby was just starting his run on My Dream Boat.
There was shades of the legendary Frankel in the manner of sprinter Lady Aurelia's runaway success.
The daughter of Scat Daddy provided a seventh Royal Ascot win for American trainer Ward, who said she would stay in Europe this summer.
"She's an amazing filly and she'll have a big future," he said after the second US-trained win of the week, following Tepin on Tuesday.
"I've got the Molecomb (Goodwood) or the Morny (Deauville) in my mind, but I'll talk to the owners and see if they agree."
Dettori said: "It was breathtaking. To win a sprint by seven lengths at Royal Ascot, I've never seen anything like that - especially from a two-year-old."

"This was a prolific day for Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation, which has thrown plenty of darts at the board this week and found a satisfying number of them sticking.
"They don't always, and considering the amount invested in this - its biggest ever challenge - there was a real sense of relief.
"On a smaller but still significant scale, owner Paul Rooney has put in much and hasn't always reaped the rewards he deserves, but they now have a Group One winner in My Dream Boat, who won as Japanese star A Shin Hikari flopped, with the ground and course taking the blame.
"Outstanding Queen Mary winner Lady Aurelia was described by Frankie Dettori as the easiest and fastest of his 54 Royal Ascot wins. Big words."
The day's feature race (16:20 BST) signals a landmark year with the contest renamed the Gold Cup in Honour of the Queen's 90th Birthday.
A field of 18 is due to line up for the £400,000 contest, headed by Order Of St George as trainer Aidan O'Brien seeks a seventh win in the race.
Meanwhile, the Queen will be hoping for a few fireworks in the concluding King George V Stakes, with her horse Guy Fawkes among the runners.
