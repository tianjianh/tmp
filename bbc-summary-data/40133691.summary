The Welsh Government said it was extending the T1C pilot, which connects Aberystwyth and Cardiff via Aberaeron, Lampeter, Carmarthen, Cross Hands, Swansea and Bridgend, by six months.
It said this would allow it to better assess customers' travel patterns and needs.
It will then make a long-term decision on the service.
Infrastructure Minister Ken Skates said it was "no secret" the service was not as popular as expected.
