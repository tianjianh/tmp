Streets are being newly paved in Havana and the cathedral is being renovated.
On the city's iconic Revolution Square, where Pope Francis will celebrate a Mass on Sunday, workers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir.
Pope Francis will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the US, on his first visits to both countries.
Similar makeovers are taking place in other Cuban cities on the Pope's itinerary.
Workers in Havana have re-laid the cobbled streets where the Pope mobile will pass and have upgraded the traffic lights.
The airport terminal where the Pope will arrive has also been renovated.
In the city of Holguin where the pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.
Officials say nearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists are expected to cover the visit.
On Thursday the Vatican said it hoped Pope Francis's visit would help bring to an end the 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the island.
The Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin said the Vatican hoped for "a flowering of these fundamental aspects for the life of persons and peoples".
The Pope himself praised Cubans' "spirit" in the face of adversity.
"It does me a lot of good and helps me to think of your faith in the Lord, of the spirit with which you confront the difficulties of each day," he said in a message relayed on Cuban state television.
Pope Francis's trip will also take him to the US. The thaw in relations between Cuba and the US in recent months is partly due to his crucial mediation between Havana and Washington - something Mr Castro thanked the Pope for during a visit to the Vatican in May.
On Friday the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations with the country.
