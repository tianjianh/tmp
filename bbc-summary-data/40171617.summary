Mohanna Abdhou, 20, was shot in Malvern Road, Kilburn, and died at the scene.
Ms Abdhou, known as Montana, was approached by "two males" on bicycles who fired "shots at her group of friends".
Police said nothing in her background gave "any suggestion she would have been a target" in the shooting, which took place on Friday, 26 May.
CCTV images of the men believed to have carried out the shooting have also been released.
Footage shows the two suspects at 20.53 BST cycling along Malvern Place, seconds before turning into Malvern Road where the shooting took place, police said.
They are described as being of slim to medium build, both wearing dark clothing and concealing their appearance through the use of face coverings.
A 21-year-old man who was arrested at the scene on the night of the attack has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
A 19-year-old man and a man, aged 20, were arrested in west London on suspicion of murder in the early hours of 31 May. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.
Ch Insp Andy Partridge said: "Valuable information has been passed to us but we are certain that people in the local community know who has committed this horrific attack.
"These individuals should not be shielded by friends or family, or supported in any way.
"No right-minded person would want those responsible for depriving Mohanna's family from ever seeing her again, to evade capture.
"Mohanna's family deserve answers and that will only happen if the local community tells us who carried out this attack."
