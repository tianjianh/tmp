The former trawler company offices at the old St Andrews fishing dock in Hull have stood empty for a number of years and have featured on urban explorer websites.
Police said they had been called to the building a number of times and were concerned somebody might be killed while exploring the two-storey structure.
Manor Property Group, which is planning to redevelop the site into a "maritime educational campus", claimed the building had now been made secure.
In a statement, the company said: "As yet we do not have a complete solution, accordingly the detail remains private."
