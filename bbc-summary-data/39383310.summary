A Flintshire church has invited 164 couples married within its walls to a celebration of its 150th anniversary.

St Bartholomew's Church in Sealand asked all the couples for whom it has hosted a wedding ceremony in the last 50 years to attend its service on Mothering Sunday.
There will also be a special exhibition.
Stephen Smith, one of the organisers, said the church had been a "beacon of hope" over the years.
He added: "Many of the couples will be in other parts of the country and world, and their circumstances may have changed, but we would welcome all who attended marriage services in the church.
"Our biggest task is contacting as many of them as we can."
St. Bartholomew's first opened on 15 October 1867.
A grant from the Cadwyn Clwyd rural development agency has allowed new lighting to be installed and the congregation is now working towards upgrading the heating and building a kitchen and toilets.
Mr Smith said: "Sealand has changed dramatically over the years, but St Bartholomew's has been there as a beacon of hope for all its community during the significant times in their lives.
"We have big plans for this to continue in the future and want to involve as many people as possible in the journey."
