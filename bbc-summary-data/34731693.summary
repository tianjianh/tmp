[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High-flying Connacht recorded a 33-19 victory over Treviso in Galway on Friday night to go top of the Pro12.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Henshaw, Tom McCartney and Matt Healy scored second-half tries as Connacht won a fifth straight league game for the first time since 2002.
Three Craig Ronaldson penalties helped the home side lead 9-5 at the break with Jayden Hayward scoring the first of two tries for the visitors.
As Connacht chased a bonus point, Edoardo Gori scored a late Treviso try.
Two Ronaldson penalties put Connacht 6-0 ahead after 20 minutes but Treviso hit back with Hayward sprinting clear for the opening try after 26 minutes.
Ronaldson's third penalty gave Connacht a four-point interval lead before Henshaw, playing at full-back in his first Connacht appearance since the World Cup, went over in the corner two minutes after the restart.
Hayward scored a second Treviso try soon after but replacement hooker Tom McCartney rumbled over after a good Connacht line-out in the 51st minute.
Healy grabbed a third try with five minutes remaining and though Connacht chased a fourth-try bonus point in the closing minutes, they lost possession and Italy scrum-half Gori grabbed a consolation try for the visitors.
