[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luis Suarez ensured Barcelona did not lose any more ground on La Liga leaders Real Madrid by striking a second-half winner against Sevilla.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Uruguayan converted in the 61st minute from Lionel Messi's pass for his 95th goal in 112 Barcelona games.
Vitolo gave Sevilla the lead when he slotted home in the 15th minute before Messi equalised from 18 yards.
Barcelona now have 25 points from 11 games, just two behind Real, with Sevilla back on 21 points.
Luis Enrique's Spanish champions created numerous chances after the break as they started to open up their opponent's defence.
Sevilla keeper Sergio Rico made two good saves to keep his side in the game. He kept out a stinging effort from Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic and then tipped over a shot from Messi, who had received the ball from Suarez's sublime backheel volley.
Suarez also produced another brilliant piece of skill when he rounded keeper Rico and then rolled the ball across the six-yard area. The ball eluded Messi, who had failed to read his team-mate's intentions.
Sevilla were overawed in the second half but did go close when former Blackburn player Steven Nzonzi headed narrowly wide of Marc-Andre ter Stegen's left-hand upright.
