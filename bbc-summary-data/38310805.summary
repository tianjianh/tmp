[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP has been reported to Scottish prosecutors after a police investigation into allegations of mortgage fraud.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edinburgh West MP Michelle Thomson is one of five people named in the report.
Mrs Thomson, 51, resigned the SNP whip when an investigation into the allegations was launched last year. She denies any wrongdoing.
Last week, she reduced MPs to tears when she described how she had been raped as a 14-year-old.
A Crown Office spokesman said: "The procurator fiscal has received a report concerning four men aged 48, 56, 59 and 59 and one woman aged 51" in relation to alleged incidents between June 2010 and July 2011.
The spokesman said the report remains under the consideration of the procurator fiscal.
Police Scotland confirmed it had submitted a report to the fiscal in "in relation to an investigation into alleged mortgage fraud".
It is understood one of the men named in the report is solicitor Christopher Hales, who was struck off by the Law Society after being found guilty of professional misconduct over 13 property deals in 2010 and 2011.
All 13 of the transactions Mr Hales was struck off for were reported to have involved Mrs Thomson or M&F Property Solutions, a firm in which she was said to be a partner.
Mrs Thomson has been sitting as an independent MP, with her former SNP colleagues giving their unanimous backing in September to calls for the party to consider reinstating her.
A spokeswoman for the MP said Mrs Thomson had "voluntarily attended an interview with Police Scotland on 13 October to assist in the ongoing investigation into solicitor Christopher Hales".
She added: "No charges were brought and, as is standard under Scottish legal procedure, a report has now been submitted to the Crown Office.
"She looks forward to a conclusion on this matter at the earliest opportunity."
