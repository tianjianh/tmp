[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three teenagers have been jailed for stabbing a young rapper to death in a fight over a stolen bicycle in south-east London.

Myron Yarde, 17, who was also known as Mdot, was attacked in New Cross on 3 April 2016.
Fauz Richards, 19, Lucus Risch, 16, and Junior Lukelo-Mami 16, were acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey.
They were all given jail sentences.
Myron was stabbed five times in the leg as a form of "punishment stabbing", intended to teach the victim a lesson by maiming, rather than killing him, Judge Nicholas Cooke said.
During the attack, his femoral artery was slashed, leading to massive bleeding.
Myron collapsed at the scene in Camplin Street and was later pronounced dead at hospital, the court heard.
Richards, 19, known as Mags or Maggie, who admitted stabbing Mr Yarde four times, was sentenced to 13 years.
Lukelo-Mami, who told jurors he dealt the victim the fatal blow, was jailed for 12 years. Risch was also jailed for 12 years.
The court heard Myron had lent his bike to 16-year-old Leoandro Osemeke, another promising rapper who was known as Showkey.
He would have been a witness at the trial but he too was fatally stabbed in an unrelated attack at a party in Peckham, south-east London, in August.
The court heard he had ridden the bike to buy pizza in the rival Monson neighbourhood where it was snatched.
When Myron - who was said to have been armed with a machete - went to get it back, he was attacked in Camplin Street after being cornered.
A court order had been in place to protect the identities of Risch and Lukelo-Mami due to their age, but Judge Cooke lifted restrictions in the hope he could "facilitate an informed debate" about gang violence.
