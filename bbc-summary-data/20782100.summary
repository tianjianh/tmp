[SN]TITLE[SN]
Commitment to new Aberdeen Don bridge reaffirmed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen councillors have reaffirmed their commitment to a new bridge over the River Don at the proposed site near Tillydrone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Supporters of the project insist the bridge would ease traffic congestion.
However, Labour has long been opposed to the route currently planned at Tillydrone.
There was a lengthy debate on Wednesday, and councillors voted to reaffirm their commitment to the so-called third Don crossing.
