Cape Verde profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Press freedom is guaranteed by law and is generally respected. Much of the media is state-run, but there is an active private press and a growing number of private broadcasters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reporters Without Borders ranked Cape Verde 24th among 180 countries in its 2014 world press freedom index - the second-highest-placed African nation.
Portuguese public TV and radio for Africa and Radio France Internationale are relayed across Cape Verde, and Portuguese and Brazilian newspapers are available. Local newspapers reach overseas-based Cape Verdeans online.
Some radio and TV programmes are presented in Crioulo - an African-Portuguese hybrid tongue.
There were 200,000 internet users by 2014 (Internetlivestats.com).
