A court in India has delivered a guilty verdict against a man for plotting a bomb blast at a German bakery in the western city of Pune in 2010.

The blast targeted the bakery when it was full of tourists and students, killing 17 people and wounding 64. Five foreigners were among the dead.
Mirza Himayat Baig, who belonged to a banned militant group, will be sentenced on Thursday.
Six other suspects are still at large, police said.
The prosecution said the blast was planned at a meeting in Colombo where Mr Baig, a resident of Maharashtra state, was given bomb-making training.
The defence had maintained that Mr Baig was not in Pune when the explosion happened on 13 February 2010.
He was arrested the following September after investigators found a cache of explosives at his home in Latur in Maharashtra.
The German Bakery is located near the Osho Ashram, a mystic centre popular with visitors to Pune.
Reports said an unattended package exploded when a waiter in the restaurant attempted to open it.
The bombing was the first major strike of its kind in India since the deadly Mumbai attacks of 2008.
The blast came a day after India and Pakistan agreed to meet for talks in Delhi - their first formal negotiations since the 2008 attacks.
