Sussex Police said plans had been reviewed after recent events in the likes of Orlando and Nice.
He said while the UK's terror threat level was the same as last year, contingency plans and security measures had been increased.
Ch Supt Nev Kemp said stewards and security staff had undergone additional training.
"[But] most people are unlikely to notice any difference from previous years and none of the changes that we have made should affect the enjoyment of people involved," he said.
Pride, a celebration of the Brighton and Hove's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population, attracts more than 200,000 people each year, according to organisers.
The carnival parade will start at Hove Lawns at about 11:00 BST, followed by a ticketed event in Preston Park. The Pride Village Party will be held in the evening in Kemptown.
The Pride flag would be flying at John Street police station and police vehicles would also be showing the rainbow colours.
Ch Supt Kemp urged people to take care of belongings during the event, follow safety advice and flag any issues or suspicious behaviour to event staff or police.
