Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has reaffirmed Britain's commitment to defend the Falkland Islands during a visit there.

He confirmed the Ministry of Defence would spend Â£180m on improving the islands' defences over the next decade.
He claimed the Falklands' greatest threat was Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said the UK and Argentina should discuss the islands' future.
It is the first visit by a UK defence secretary in more than a decade.
The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said there were fears that the visit "could inflame tensions with Argentina" but Mr Fallon said he hoped relations would improve under President Mauricio Macri - Argentina's new leader.
But Mr Fallon insisted there would be no negotiation about the Falkland Islands' future.
Mr Fallon laid a wreath at the memorial in Port Stanley to the 255 UK service personnel who died helping restore British control following the Argentine invasion in 1982.
The chairman of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly said Argentina remained the greatest threat to security, not the Labour leader.
