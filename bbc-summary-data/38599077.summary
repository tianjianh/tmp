A poor 14-year-old boy in Kenya has been flown to school in a helicopter after air force veterans offered to pay for his secondary education.

Kelvin Muriuki was top of his class in 2016, but poverty forced him to go and work in a quarry, his family said.
The Kenya Air Force Veteran Officers Association then stepped in to pay his school fees and to give him a helicopter ride to his new school.
Kelvin's dreams are now back on track - he says he wants to become a pilot.
Many children regularly drop out of school in Kenya because of poverty.
The association said it would pay Kelvin's annual school fee of $530 (Â£430) until he completes his secondary education in 2020.
He arrived at his new school in the central Kenyan town of Karicheni after a helicopter ride of about 20 minutes from his previous school, reports the BBC's Abdinoor Aden from the capital, Nairobi.
