[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man suspected of committing a knifepoint rape on Tuesday has been released without charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A woman was held at knifepoint by a man wearing a balaclava between 19:45 and 20:10 GMT in Harcourt Hill, Oxford.
She was then taken to Raleigh Park and raped by the man who was about 30, muscular, white and under 6ft (180cm).
Thames Valley Police are still on the hunt for the rapist after they released a 38-year-old man on Wednesday evening.
The police are no longer linking the rape to a car crash in Wytham on Tuesday evening.
Detectives have asked anyone who saw any suspicious activity around Raleigh Park or Harcourt Hill, near the Oxford Brookes University campus, on Tuesday evening to come forward.
They have also asked the public to notify police of vehicles "being driven erratically" on the A34 northbound and near Botley or Wytham after 20:30 GMT on Tuesday.
Detective Inspector Jim Holmes said: "Perhaps you saw items being thrown from a vehicle on the A34 during that evening.
"If you did then we also want to hear from you."
Police have said there will be an "increased police presence in the area" and officers will be conducting house-to-house inquiries.
