He died at Myton Hospice and Ms Matthews has so far raised more than Â£9,000 for the charity.
She thanked the hospice for the "dignity and love" given to her husband and said the support for her family, including her daughters had been "incredible".
Ms Matthews said: "On Saturday July 29, just as the final whistle was blowing for the end of Saturday football, my incredible husband took his last breath.
"He was surrounded by me, his mum (Dionne Blair), dad (Andy Blair) and sister (Ashley Blair), peacefully and with the support of the incredible Myton Hospice staff.
"The loss we are feeling is unfathomable right now and breaking the news to my daughters was extremely tough, but we are supporting each other and taking it one step at a time."
