Eastern EU workers in UK 'up post-Brexit vote'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of workers in the UK from eight eastern European Union countries increased following the referendum, official estimates suggest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Those from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia  and Slovenia numbered 1,053,000 in July to September - up 46,000 on the previous quarter.
But the Office for National Statistics found a reduction in workers from other EU countries during the same period.
The Brexit vote was on 23 June.
The ONS's labour market data suggests 1,053,000 people from the group of eight states that joined the EU in 2004 - known as the A8 - were employed in the UK in July to September.
But the number of employees from 14 other EU member states - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden - showed a quarterly fall for the first time in two years, down from 944,000 to 937,000.
The number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers also dipped, from 266,000 in the previous three months to 258,000. Restrictions on people from the two countries working in the UK were lifted in January 2014.
Overall, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU, also including Cyprus, Malta and Croatia, working in the UK was 2.26 million  in July to September.
This was up 221,000 compared with the equivalent period last year.
The Office for National Statistics said evidence suggested the referendum outcome had had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force.
Authoritative data on the flow of foreign workers would not be available until migration figures were published in February, the ONS added.
