Emergency services were called to Station Road near the junction with Howard Park Corner at 05:47 BST.
The woman, 30, who was driving an Audi A4, had head injuries and was taken to hospital in Stevenage.
The crash caused major damage to the brickwork and glass front of the Ifix Computing store on Station Road. Footage from the shop's CCTV cameras will now be passed to investigators.
Manager and father-of-two Saifur Chowdury said the impact had also damaged computers and furniture inside the shop.
"I'm relieved that we weren't open at the time, that my family or my customers weren't in there," he said.
"I was so shocked about what happened. I had worked so hard to establish my own business."
Mr Chowdury said the business had been up and running since February 2016.
He confirmed CCTV cameras may have captured the crash and the images would be forwarded to Hertfordshire Police.
