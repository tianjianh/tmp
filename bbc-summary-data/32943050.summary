[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reading Bridge reopens after repair work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading Bridge has reopened following a two week closure which has disrupted traffic around the town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge is the town's main River Thames crossing and has been shut for strengthening, resurfacing and waterproofing.
It reopened to traffic after the top layer of resurfacing was carried out on Saturday.
Reading councillor Tony Page said: "Reading Bridge is now in a strong condition to carry on its vital role".
Off-peak lane closures are due to continue to allow the remaining concrete repairs and carbon fibre strengthening work to be carried out.
The bridge which normally carries about 24,000 vehicles a day, was closed on 18 May for its first major strengthening work since it opened in 1923.
The work left Caversham Bridge as the only crossing point across the Thames in the town.
