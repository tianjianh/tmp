American bulldog spared death after Kinmel Bay attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An American bulldog which attacked a man at a holiday park in Conwy county has escaped a destruction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dog called Kilo left an ex-soldier in hospital after the incident in June at Kinmel Bay near Rhyl.
The animal was spared after an expert at Caernarfon Crown Court said measures could be taken to prevent a repeat attack.
Owner William Robinson, 73, of Merseyside, received a three-month suspended prison term.
Robinson pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control which caused injury.
He was also ordered to pay Â£1,000 in compensation to victim Barry Williams from Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.
Mr Williams was attacked as he was walking his border collie at Palins Holiday Park.
Kilo was not on a lead, and grabbed Mr Williams by the arm, dragging him along the ground.
A security man had to use a metal broom to prise the dog's jaw open to free Mr Williams.
But Judge Niclas Parry said an animal behaviour expert, who was also a police dog instructor, felt that if measures were taken, the dog was suitable for a conditional destruction order.
The order means Kilo must now be muzzled, not be left unaccompanied in public, and kept under the control of Robinson's son.
"By your guilty plea you admitted responsibility for an extremely serious incident that resulted in shocking injuries," Judge Parry said.
But he said Robinson's blame was "at the very lowest end of the scale".
