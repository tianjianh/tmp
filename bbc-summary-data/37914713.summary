Lindsay Jo Rimer, 13, was last seen on November 7 1994 when she went to buy cornflakes from a shop in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.
Her body was found in April 1995 a mile upstream from the town centre in the nearby Rochdale Canal.
A 63-year-old man from Bradford has been arrested and is in custody, said West Yorkshire Police.

Two canal workers found the body, weighted down with a stone, in the canal.
Andy Glover, from Mytholmroyd, was checking for debris when he spotted something in the water.
He said: "We thought that it was a sheep.
"As we pulled it towards us, the body rolled in the water. There was no mistaking who it was, we saw the strands of hair on her face and knew we had found Lindsay Rimer."
Ms Rimer left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT and met her mother at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge.
The last known sighting of her was caught on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes on Crown Street.
In April, police said a new DNA profile had been identified which it hoped would lead them to identify the killer.
