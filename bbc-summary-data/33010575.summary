The Borders' Common Riding season begins in Hawick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hawick will kick off the Common Riding season in the Borders this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the first of 11 towns which will be at the centre of the traditional festivities over the summer.
The Hawick festival celebrates the capture of the English flag by a group of local youths at Hornshole in 1514.
It also recreates the "Riding of the Marches",  a tradition dating back to the 12th century when the town's boundaries were checked on horseback.
The towns of Selkirk, Melrose, Peebles, Galashiels, Jedburgh, Duns, Kelso, Langholm, Lauder and Coldstream will also host Common Ridings in June, July and August.
