[SN]TITLE[SN]
Farhan Mirza denies blackmailing women with intimate photos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of blackmailing women has told a court he threatened to send "embarrassing" photos of one of his victims "just to shut her up".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farhan Mirza 38, of Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, claimed he was "scared" of the woman, who had been sending him abusive messages.
He told Cardiff Crown Court he eventually sent her a message saying "I will make you famous".
He denies voyeurism, theft, fraud and blackmail.
Mr Mirza said one of his alleged victims became "very angry" when she found out he had married a woman in Pakistan and threatened to publish information about him there and in the UK.
Mr Mirza denied he had ever kept £60,000 to £70,000 in cash at his home in Abertillery, and said the most he kept was £1,500 to £2,000 from his earnings as a taxi driver.
Earlier in the trial one woman, a doctor, claimed Mr Mirza tried to force her to provide a medical certificate for lower back pain so he could be signed off work.
He denied the allegation and said he instead got sick notes from his GP and did not need or want to ask the woman.
He told jurors he had not stolen anything from the alleged victim and said: "I never blackmailed her."
Later, Mr Mirza cried as jurors were shown an allegedly threatening video he had sent to one woman, which included images of car crashes.
He admits sending the video and said it was made up of clips he had received from friends he had met on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
The trial continues.
