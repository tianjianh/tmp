The 24-year-old ex-American footballer from California, who can play hooker or prop, has come to Sixways on a deal until the end of the season.
"He is a big, strong ball-carrier," said Warriors head coach Carl Hogg.
"He's a hungry young forward with a lot of potential, which can allow us to get on the front foot. We look forward to helping him reach the top of his game."
On top of Canada fly-half Connor Braid and Samoa international forward Chris Vui, injury-hit Warriors have now signed three internationals in the past six weeks, as well as Australian scrum-half Michael Dowsett, and Bristol full-back Auguy Slowik.
Since making the switch from American Football to rugby union in 2011, Taufete'e has gone on to represent his country.
Following on from his international debut, against South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup at London's Olympic Stadium, he has made nine appearances for the Eagles, scoring three tries.
"I've always wanted to play rugby overseas," said Taufete'e, who has also played in New Zealand with Otorohanga RFC, in Waikato, where he played alongside current Warriors centre Jackson Willison.
"I've heard great things about the club from Jackson Willison. I'm genuinely excited about the prospect of playing Premiership rugby."
