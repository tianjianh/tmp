Hopes are rising that new plans will prevent further erosion at one of Wales' most popular beaches.

It is believed a flood defence built to protect Dinas Dinlle near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, from coastal flooding in 1994 has made the problem worse.
Environment Agency Wales was outlining its plans for tackling the problem on Wednesday.
The agency said this would include moving a section of the Wales Coast Path.
Wyn Williams, chair of the of the Dinas Dinlle regeneration group, said the community was originally told work would not be carried out for at least 10 years but was now scheduled for autumn.
"I think there's been an admission, certainly by the agency who I don't think carried out the work 20 years ago, that probably the groyne was built slightly too high so the northern end of the beach was... not being replenished," he said.
"We hope to convince the agency to start the work and to get it right."
He said he did not yet know the full details of the plans but the agency had already released some information.
The proposals include realigning part of the existing shingle beach and moving a section of the coastal footpath, which is being damaged by erosion.
And the large rocks on the beach would be replaced by natural shingle "to make the beach more user-friendly".
Mr Williams said Dinas Dinlle was "one of the most popular beaches in Wales and is a longstanding blue flag award beach and is of international repute".
"We have people from all over the world to visit our wonderful beach but I think more importantly, Dinas Dinlle is used widely by local people," he added.
Environment Agency Wales is holding drop-in sessions on Wednesday explaining the plans to the public.
David Edwell, from the agency, said: "Coastal erosion is a natural process, but at Dinas Dinlle this seems to have been disrupted by the coastal defences and we need to correct the imbalance.
"These new plans we are proposing will help to reduce erosion from impacting further on the area, and at the same time safeguard the Wales Coastal Path and local tourism which the area is dependent upon."
The public sessions will take place at Bwyty Lleu cafe, Dinas Dinlle, from 14:00 to 19:30 GMT. A presentation about the proposals will be held at 18:00 GMT.
