[SN]TITLE[SN]
Armenia 0-3 Albania

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Albania qualified for a major tournament for the first time in their history as victory in Armenia secured their place at Euro 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Kamo Hovhannisyan own goal set them on their way, with Ledian Memushaj adding a second from a free-kick and Armando Sadiku tapping home a third.
The win means Albania leapfrog Denmark into second place in Group I.
Portugal - who had already qualified as group winners - won 2-1 against Serbia, who had two men sent off.
Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov was shown two yellow cards and Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic was given a straight red for violent conduct after taking a frustrated swipe at Portugal's Andre Andre.
Portugal rested captain Cristiano Ronaldo for the game in Serbia, having already secured top spot in Group I and qualification with a game to spare.
Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Luis Nani gave them an early lead with a left-foot finish, but Zoran Tosic equalised for Serbia with a powerful first-time strike in the second half.
Substitute Joao Moutinho scored Portugal's winner with a shot from the edge of the box 12 minutes from the end.
Albania's win means Denmark finish third in the group, and will face a play-off to qualify for France next summer.
