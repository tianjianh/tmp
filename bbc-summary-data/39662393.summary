The two-time Masters champion, 38, carded a six-under-par 66, which included an eagle and five birdies, before play was suspended.
Five players are one shot behind Watson in China.
England's Tommy Fleetwood is three shots back after a three-under-par 69.
The 56 players who still have to finish their opening rounds will do so early on Friday before the second round takes place.
