Gloucestershire University plans submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for the University of Gloucestershire to develop sites in Gloucester have been submitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An outline planning application to develop the Oxstalls/Plock Court sites in Longlevens has been handed in to Gloucester City Council.
It includes proposals for new sports facilities at the sites and accommodation for 200 students.
The university's business school will relocate from Cheltenham to the Oxstalls site as part of the scheme.
The allotments at Estcourt Park would be relocated to Debenham's Field, and traffic lights would be installed at the junction of Cheltenham Road and Oxstalls Lane.
A controlled parking zone on residential streets around the campus has also been proposed.
The plans have been submitted to the council after months of consultation.
Vice-chancellor, Stephen Marston, said: "This outline planning application presents an ambitious vision for the university, working with our partners, to achieve a major development of academic, sporting and amenity facilities for the city of Gloucester.
"The university is committed to playing an active part in promoting the economic, cultural and social wellbeing of the city and the county.
"These plans would enable us to achieve a step change in the contribution we can make."
A public consultation into the plans has been launched by the city council.
