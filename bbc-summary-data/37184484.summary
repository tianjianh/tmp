Ledson, 19, made one senior appearance for the Toffees in the Europa League against FK Krasnodar in 2014 and has been capped by England Under-19s.
He spent the second half of last season on loan at Cambridge United.
"To move away from Everton is a massive step, but I've got to do what's right," Ledson told BBC Radio Oxford. "I'm looking forward to getting started."
