Simon Berry, 24, became a Guinness World Record holder after completing the unusual challenge in Bray, Berkshire.
His technique involved clasping one wrist over the other to offer greater stability and precision as the biscuit surged towards its small target.
Mr Berry, who attempted the feat as part of Guinness World Records Day, said: "It was pretty difficult - the team helped by getting me roughly in there in the right place, but going down and having to nail that cup of tea was pretty tricky."
