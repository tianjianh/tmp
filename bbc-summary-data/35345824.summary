[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Rochdale have signed midfielder Dave Syers on a deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old left Scunthorpe at the start of the month after the club agreed to cancel his contract.
He suffered a serious knee injury last season that kept him out for eight months and has made just three substitute appearances this term.
"He has pedigree, he scores goals, he is an effective midfield player," boss Keith Hill told the club website.
Syers, who is available for Dale's game at Barnsley on Saturday, started his career in non-league and has also played for Bradford and Doncaster.
