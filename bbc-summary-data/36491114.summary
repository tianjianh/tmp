The 19-year-old made his debut for the Championship side in the 1-1 draw with QPR in April.
"It's a massive club and it's a great privilege to be a part of it moving forward," he told the club website.
"I was never in doubt about where I wanted to be or where my future lies. It was just about getting the final pieces sorted - now it's all done."
