The Republic of Ireland winger's deal includes an option, in the club's favour, to extend it by a further year.
McClean, 27, has had his deal confirmed six days after goalkeeper Ben Foster signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract.
"He's been a good signing for the club," Baggies head coach Tony Pulis told BBC WM.
"He's solid. He's scatty at times but he's good in the dressing room. He's a great lad to have around the place."
The midfielder signed for Albion from Wigan Athletic in June 2015 for a fee in the region of Â£1.5m.
Pulis said that getting both McClean and Foster to commit to the club before the opening of the January transfer window represented excellent work.
"We've got a really good spirit in the dressing room," he said. "We don't give up now."
Albion lie ninth in the Premier League, a point behind Southampton, who they visit on New Year's Eve.
