[SN]TITLE[SN]
National Theatre of Scotland headquarters opens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Theatre of Scotland will open its new headquarters later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new base, beside the Forth and Clyde Canal at Spiers Wharf in Glasgow, will replace rented facilities.
Since the theatre company was set up in 2006 it has created hundreds of productions, including the award-winning Black Watch.
The new headquarters will have no performance space as the organisation was founded as a theatre company without a theatre building.
The new look of the canal-side building has been designed by Gareth Hoskins Architects.
A spokeswoman for the NTS said: "The National Theatre of Scotland is delighted to be part of an emerging cultural hub in this area of Glasgow.
"Other cultural tenants include Scottish Opera, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow Sculpture Studios, The Glue Factory and the Whisky Bond."
