The cyber-attack on French broadcaster TV5Monde is on "a different scale", a terrorism expert has told Newsbeat.

Hackers claiming to belong to Islamic State targeted the TV network.
TV5Monde said all 11 of its TV channels, its website and social media accounts were hit.
"It's not the first time people claiming to be part of Islamic State are targeting websites," said Jean Charles Brisard, an expert on terrorism and terrorism financing.
"Usually they take control of a website and change its home page.
"But now we see a different scale with cyber-attacks targeting a TV network. Regarding the scale of the attack it's totally new."
The French government has condemned the attack.
The prime minister, Manuel Valls, called it an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of information.
Earlier, French government ministers visited the channel's Paris headquarters in a show of solidarity.
"We are analysing and we are working with experts and specialists from the French government to try and find out where from, how, and who did that, and for what purpose was TV5Monde especially targeted," said the company's director, Yves Bigot.
A message posted by the hackers on TV5Monde's Facebook site read: "The CyberCaliphate continues its cyberjihad against the enemies of Islamic State."
They also posted documents purporting to be ID cards of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-IS operations.
France is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria.
TV5Monde's digital director, Helene Zemmour, called the hack "unprecedented and large-scale".
The Paris prosecutor's office says it has opened a terrorism investigation into the attack.
Hackers claiming to work on behalf of the Islamic State have seized control of the Twitter accounts of other media organisations before, such as Newsweek.
In January they hacked into the Twitter page and YouTube site of the US military's Central Command.
