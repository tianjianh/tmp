[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted racially abusing a US Army veteran on a tram and abusing two other men has been given a suspended prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
When Juan Jasso challenged the trio's use of foul language, he was verbally attacked and had beer thrown at him. The incident on 28 June was filmed.
Aaron Cauchi, 19, of Little Hulton, Salford was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for two years.
He was also banned from Manchester's Metrolink tram network for two years.
Cauchi was the last to be sentenced at Manchester Magistrates' Court over the incidents, which were widely viewed on social media.
Jobless Robert Molloy, 20, of no fixed address, was jailed for six months earlier this month for abusing Mr Jasso and two other people in separate incidents.
A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named because of his age, was given a six-month referral order.
Sentencing of Cauchi, of Spa Crescent, was adjourned earlier this month when he was taken to hospital complaining of stomach pains.
He had previously admitted using threatening words or behaviour to Mr Jasso and another man, as well as the assault of a third man.
