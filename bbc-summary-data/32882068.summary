Royal County Down in Newcastle is hosting the 28-31 May European Tour event, with a practice day on Tuesday and pro-am on Wednesday.
There will be enhanced bus services between Belfast's Europa Buscentre and Newcastle every half hour, at peak times, from May 26 to 31.
Enhanced bus services will also run from Newry to Newcastle.
Translink said special golf Goldline coaches will operate from towns and cities across Northern Ireland with tickets available to purchase online.
Ulsterbus Tours will also operate special day return services from Belfast to Newcastle.
A free park-and-ride shuttle bus service to and from the event will operate from the Northfield site on the Castlewellan Road, on the outskirts of Newcastle.
This service will drop-off passengers near the Castlewellan Road Roundabout, a five-minute walk to the Irish Open welcome pavilion.
The star-studded line-up at the event include Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, recent Players Championship winner Rickie Fowler and  current US Open champion Martin Kaymer.
Ernie Els, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood will also join McIlroy's fellow major winners from Northern Ireland, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, in the field.
The Irish challenge includes three-time major winner Padraig Harrington while other big names who will tee up at Royal County Down are Miguel Angel Jimenez, Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson.
The Irish Open was last staged in Northern Ireland in 2012 when it was held at Royal Portrush.
