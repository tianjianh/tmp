[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doughty brought down Marcus Maddison, who converted from the spot to give Posh a 12th-minute lead.
Nicky Ajose levelled for the visitors with his 20th goal of the season with a fine free-kick that had Posh keeper Stu Moore well beaten on his debut in goal.
Late on, Doughty struck a left-footed shot to seal three points for Swindon.
Moore went straight into the Peterborough side after signing on a 28-day loan deal from Reading, but could not stop Posh losing a fourth-straight game.
Graham Westley's side slip to 15th in the League One table, while Swindon move up three places to 12th following the victory.
