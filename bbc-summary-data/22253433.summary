Cold case detectives investigating the murder of a Norfolk man almost 30 years ago have identified "a person of interest".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Peter Miller was found in the kitchen of his home in Camden Place, Great Yarmouth, in 1984.
He died of a single stab wound to the chest. No-one was ever charged with the 24-year-old's murder
Police said they have received and are pursing "several significant pieces of intelligence" after an earlier appeal.
Det Insp Gary Bloomfield, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Major Investigation Team, said: "These include a person of interest that has been highlighted to the inquiry team and we are currently pursuing this to establish if that person had any involvement in the original offence."
He added: "I should point out that this is one of a number of lines of enquiry we are following up and enquiries are still at a very early stage."
Earlier this month officers identified a sharp implement which they believed might have been used to kill Mr Miller.
Forensic tests on the item are under way, police said.
Police have not stated exactly what type of item has been found.
Mr Bloomfield said: "The overall investigation remains on-going and we still have plenty of work to carry out."
