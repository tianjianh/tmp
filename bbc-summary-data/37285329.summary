Rio Paralympics 2016: Medal alerts and the latest news headlines in BBC Sport app

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If you've already got the BBC Sport app, you might already be getting alerts for football scores or sport news.

For the Paralympics you can also add medal alerts, meaning you will know when ParalympicsGB win a gold (or every time Brazil win a bronze, if you prefer).
You can also receive news alerts for all the big stories from Rio, so we'll let you know when the top stories happen - such as Wimbledon champion Gordon Reid winning tennis gold, or Ellie Simmonds reigning supreme in the pool once again.
First, make sure you have downloaded the BBC Sport app on Android or iOS (Apple).
Once installed, visit the MyAlerts section from within the menu, choose "Add alerts" and follow these steps.
