A man who tried to kill his wife as they walked their children to school has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvan Parry, 46, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, attacked mother-of-six Fiona Parry on the first day of the school year on 3 September.
He was found guilty of attempted murder by a jury on Thursday following a trial at Mold Crown Court.
He must serve a minimum of seven-and-a-half years before he can apply for parole.
Mrs Parry was left with a brain injury, physical difficulties, memory loss and impaired speech.
Sentencing Parry, Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees said his attack was ferocious and he posed a risk of harm to all who crossed him.
She said mothers and schoolchildren "looked on in horror" as Parry punched his wife to the ground as she pushed their baby in a pram, accompanied by two of their other children.
The court heard he stamped on her head and face up to 10 times and kicked her as she lay motionless on the floor.
Witnesses saw him kick her "like a footballer taking a penalty" and he had to be stopped from stamping on her head.
Judge Rees said had fire officers from a nearby fire station not intervened "you would have continued and you would probably have killed her".
The court was told it was the fourth time he had attacked his wife and he had been involved in serious violence for more than 20 years.
Mrs Parry had said she hoped he would get a life sentence and is now divorcing him.
In a victim impact statement, she said she spent several weeks in hospital after the attack in an induced coma and would need her house adapted because of her poor balance.
"I want to move on and have a happy life for me and my children," she added.
Det Sgt Gary Williams, who led the investigation, said: "This was a horrific act of violence witnessed by members of the public and in particular young children on their way to school."
