An airport will rip up former Wales striker Dean Saunders's huge parking fee if his home nation wins Euro 2016.

Saunders, working in France as a pundit for the BBC, left his car in a short stay area at Birmingham Airport thinking Wales would go out early.
But they have reached the semi-finals and Saunders said he expected to see his parking charges rise to Â£1,000.
The airport said on Twitter that if Wales win the tournament, it would "waive his parking fee".
Wales came from a goal down to beat Belgium 3-1 on Friday and reach the semi-finals of a major tournament for the first time.
Captain Ashley Williams equalised, before Hal Robson-Kanu, a striker without a club, gave them the lead and substitute Sam Vokes added a third to set up a last-four clash against Portugal on Wednesday.
Saunders, who won 75 Wales caps and whose former clubs include Liverpool and Aston Villa, also said he was running out of clean clothes.
The airport posted: "We can't help Dean with his clothes situation but if Wales win #EURO2016 we'll waive his parking fee!"
