A firm that has helped "build Nottingham" including the construction of about 6,000 houses is celebrating 150 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Bow City Asphalt built landmarks including the Raleigh factory extension and the University of Nottingham's Trent Building.
It was set up after founder Lawrence Bow arrived in Nottingham in 1867.
Chairman Alistair Bow said the company's connection to the city was a source of pride for the family.
Mr Bow, who is among the sixth generation to run the firm, said: "You can't drive more than a quarter of a mile without going past an old Thomas Bow landmark.
"It's something I'm immensely proud of and I know my dad would have been, to think you could still be working and operating with the same company name 150 years later."
The company, which was named after the founder's son, is trying to track down former employees to help extend the Thomas Bow archive.
Commercial manager Andrew Jackaman said: "It could be as simple as a picture of a relative on a building site or it could be anecdotes.
"All this pieced together to give us a bit more of a history."
The firm was responsible for the Raleigh factory extension, which was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1952, and the extensions to the former Wilford Power Station.
The company also built a number of smaller buildings all over the city including the former branch of Barclays Bank in the Old Market Square.
Thousands of homes and some schools were also built by Thomas Bow in Nottingham city between 1921 and 1960.
