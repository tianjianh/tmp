The 29-year-old made 39 appearances for Dover last season and had been offered a new deal by the club after they just missed out on the play-offs.
But the out-of-contract defender has moved to Bromley on a free transfer.
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Ross Flitney has left Bromley and manager Neil Smith said the club had signed a replacement, but are yet to release the details.
