[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are asking for the public's help to find 38 pythons stolen from a flat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The non-venomous snakes, which are unlikely to pose any threat to humans, were taken from the property on Greenfield Road, St Helens on 16 March.
Two men were seen leaving the flat with two sacks before driving away in a dark-coloured vehicle.
Officers said they believed the snakes, including eight pregnant females and 11 babies, would be offered for sale to experienced snake handlers.
DC Neil Henry said: "This is a large collection of snakes that the victim had been gathering for a while. Clearly, there is a specialised market for such snakes.
"We would appeal to anyone involved in the buying and selling of snakes to look out for any royal pythons that they may be offered and consider whether they may have come from this address.
He added: "These snakes, in particular the pregnant and young snakes, need specialist care and can grow to around 5ft (1.5m) in length."
Anyone with information is asked to contact St Helens CID on 0151 777 6843 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
