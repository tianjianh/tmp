Speaking in the Irish parliament, Mr Flanagan said that Northern Ireland has been "mired in deadlock over budgetary and financial issues".
"Serial brinkmanship must be replaced by generous, courageous and effective partnership government," he said.
"We need politics in Belfast to inspire again," he added.
Mr Flanagan was speaking during debates on events in Ballymurphy in 1971, legacy issues and a statements on Northern Ireland session.
During the debate on the Ballymurphy killings of 1971, Sinn FÃ©in Fein president Gerry Adams called on the Irish and British governments to implement those elements of the Stormont House Agreement that deal with the past and legacy issues.
He said there was no need to wait for the local political parties.
