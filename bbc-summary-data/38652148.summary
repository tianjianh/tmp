Ross Monaghan, 35, was shot after dropping his child off at St George's Primary, Penilee, at about 09:05.
He was treated in hospital for a shoulder wound but has been discharged.
The buggy was a new collapsible model with four wheels and had a rain hood attached. The gunman was pushing it as he approached his victim, police said.
The attacker is thought to have been in the area with the buggy on Friday.
Mr Monaghan was acquitted of a gangland murder in 2012. He was cleared of killing Kevin "Gerbil" Carroll after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict him.
Forensic officers are still examining the scene of Monday's shooting and police are also carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
Det Ch Insp John Kennedy said: "There's no doubt that this incident has shocked local people and the wider community, but people can be assured that every effort is being made to trace whoever is responsible for this crime.
"Our inquiries so far have shown that the suspect is believed to have been in the area, outside the school, on Friday 13 January 2017, with the buggy, so I'm appealing to parents, local residents, or anyone who was in the area that day and who may have seen something to contact us.
"It's possible the suspect made off in a vehicle and I'm asking people in the surrounding areas to think back and consider if they noticed anything unusual or suspicious.
"Did you see the man with the buggy, did you see him get into a vehicle?  Any small detail could prove significant to our inquiries so please do pass it on."
Police said they would continue extra patrols in the local area.
