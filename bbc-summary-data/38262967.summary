Santa stopped throwing sweets at Christmas switch-on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Santa no longer throws sweets for children when he switches on the Christmas lights in County Fermanagh.

Why? It is all down to health and safety, or should we say 'elf and safety?
At previous events in Enniskillen, Santa and his little helpers have thrown sweets into the crowd.
But the Impartial Reporter said it had been contacted by candy-loving parents who noticed that this year there were "no flying sweets".
However, Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said the practice had been discontinued for the past number of years.
In a statement the council said: "The practice of throwing sweets into the crowd at the Enniskillen Christmas lights switch on event has not taken place over the last number of years in the interest of health and safety.
"More than Â£300 worth of sweets were distributed to children, as is customary, by Santa and his helpers at this year's Enniskillen Christmas lights switch on event.
"The barrier at this year's event was also extended to enable Santa to meet as many children as possible."
Looks like there will be no danger of anyone ending up in hospital after being wounded by an errant flying bonbon.
