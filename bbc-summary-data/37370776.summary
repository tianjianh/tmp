[SN]TITLE[SN]
Suspended sentence for former accountant who managed brothels

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former accountant has been given a six-month suspended jail sentence for managing three brothels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Ervine, from Ballymacash Park in Lisburn, pleaded guilty to a total of seven charges, including controlling a prostitute and having more than £3,000 in criminal property.
He was fined £2,000 at Antrim Crown Court on Thursday.
Ervine also admitted to inciting a woman to become a prostitute.
The court heard the 62-year-old attempted to recruit an undercover reporter who secretly recorded him speaking of the thousands of pounds that she could make as a call girl.
The report by former Sunday Life journalist Patricia Devlin led to a police investigation into his activities.
Ervine later claimed he thought he was doing nothing illegal, believing he was acting as an agent for the girls.
In all, the former tax advisor was involved in the management "or assisted in the management" of brothels in Belfast's Kitchener Street, Connsbrook Avenue and University Court between January and December 2014.
When he was initially arrested by police in May 2015, officers also recovered £3,210 in cash.
The judge told Ervine that in determining the appropriate sentence, the court had to look at the nature of his offending - in particular whether or not any young women were trafficked so that they could be exploited.
However, the court heard that the woman he "intentionally controlled" was already an "established prostitute".
Nevertheless, the judge said Ervine was operating for "pure profit", organising clients and running the brothels.
The judge said that the appropriate sentence under current guidelines was one of six to 12 months, but that given Ervine's guilty pleas, cooperation with police and his limited record, he could suspend any custodial sentence.
He added that there was nothing to suggest that Ervine posed a danger to the community, and as he was assessed as being at a low risk of reoffending, the proper sentence should be one of six months suspended for two years.
However, the judge added that Ervine accepted that the money recovered by police was from his criminal activity.
