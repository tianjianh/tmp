The break-in at Harmony House in Melrose happened during the early hours of Monday morning when staff had left to join the after-festival party.
Several laptops, tablet devices, a two-figure sum of cash and bank cards were among the items stolen.
Police have asked anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area to contact them.
Festival director Alistair Moffat said: "They have taken items totalling thousands of pounds.
"As well as all our IT equipment, cards and money, we lost our records which is a real blow.
"But we will not let it spoil the open, friendly and welcoming nature of the Borders Book Festival which has made it such a success for this region for more than a decade."
An estimated 25,300 visitors attended the four-day book festival to see dozens of events featuring some of the UK's top authors and politicians.
Police Scotland have appealed for information about the raid which happened at Harmony House in St Mary's Road, Melrose, between midnight and 02:30 on Monday.
Det Con James Harrison said: "Anyone who may have seen suspicious behaviour in the area during this time is asked to come forward.
"I would urge all business owners to remain vigilant and ensure that simple security measures such as the locking of doors and windows overnight are taken."
