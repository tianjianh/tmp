Singapore country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Singapore is a wealthy city state in south-east Asia. Once a British colonial trading post, today it is a thriving global financial hub and described as one of Asia's economic "tigers". It is also renowned for its conservatism and strict local laws and the country prides itself on its stability and security.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chinese account for more than 75% of Singapore's multi-racial population, with Malays and Indians making up much of the remainder.
Densely-populated, most of its people live in public-housing tower blocks. Its trade-driven economy is heavily supported by foreign workers. In 2013, the government forecast that by 2030, immigrants will makeup more than 50% of the population.
The People's Action Party has dominated politics since the country declared independence from Malaysia in 1965. Issues such as the rising cost of living, immigration and income inequality are major challenges facing the government.

President: Tony Tan
Tan, a former deputy prime minister, won the 2011 presidential election by a narrow margin. He was seen as the establishment candidate.
All four candidates in the election - the first of its kind for 18 years - shared the same surname, Tan.
Presidential candidates run as individuals because Singapore's head of state is supposed to be non-partisan.
Prime minister: Lee Hsien Loong
The eldest son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Hsien Loong has been in office since August 2004.
A former army officer and Cambridge-educated mathematician, he followed his father into politics in 1984 at the age of 32.
As prime minister, Mr Lee has launched policies to build a competitive economy, introducing new programmes to upgrade the education system, investing in research and development and transforming the city-state.
As the media hub for south-east Asia, Singapore is a strategic centre for the region's English-speaking audience.
Its tightly-controlled media environment means self-censorship among journalists is common. There are also curbs on online content.
