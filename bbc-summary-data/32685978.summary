The case was removed from the Grand Union Canal near Delamere Terrace in Little Venice, with police called at about 14:30 BST on Sunday.
Officers said it was too early to say how long it had been in the water.
No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination is due to take place later. Detectives are trying to identify the woman.
Police have been speaking to nearby houseboat residents to try to establish a sequence of events in the area on Friday and Saturday.
Natasha Widowson, 23, who lives on a boat near where the body was found, said: "We heard the body was found by some walkers passing by.
"Police told us there had been an accident and no-one was allowed to go past the bridge."
A Met Police spokesman said detectives from homicide and major crime command are investigating.
