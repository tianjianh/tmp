The Ladies Scottish Open will be held from 27-30 July, with a record prize fund and a switch from a pro-am format to a regular 72-hole strokeplay event.
It will have the highest prize fund - Â£1.5m - on the Ladies European Tour outside of a major.
The men's Scottish Open will be held at the Ayrshire course from 13-16 July.
Taking place the week before The Open at Royal Birkdale, the men's event is part of the new Rolex Series, announced on Tuesday.
The series, which will feature a minimum of seven tournaments around the world, begins in May with the PGA Championship at Wentworth, followed by the Irish Open and Scottish Open in July.
The Italian Open is the fourth event, while the remaining three are in November - the Turkish Open, the Golf Challenge at Sun City in South Africa and the World Tour Championship in Dubai.
The Ladies Scottish Open will be held the week before the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns.
VisitScotland director Paul Bush said: "The huge success of the men's Scottish Open taking place the week before The Open provided the inspiration for us to achieve similar success with the Ladies Scottish Open ahead of the Ricoh Women's British Open and these outstanding two weeks will now rival anything the world of golf has to offer."
