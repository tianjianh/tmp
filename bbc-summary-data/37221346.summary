A trial jury was directed to find Asif Aurangzaib, from Derby, not guilty over the botched robbery of a fast food warehouse in Birmingham.
Judge Philip Parker said there was "insufficient evidence" against the 25-year-old, and he was found not guilty of conspiring to rob Direct Source 3.
Two others are still on trial accused of murdering Akhtar Javeed, 56.
Suraj Mistry, who is accused of being one of two gunmen, and Lemar Wali, who is alleged to have been the getaway driver, deny murder, conspiracy to rob the warehouse and two counts each of possession of a pistol with intent to cause fear or violence.
A third man, Tahir Zarif, of Osmaston Road in Derby, is said to have "played a central role" by the prosecution, with the Crown's barrister alleging it was he who shot Mr Javeed as he tried to flee the scene.
At the start of the Birmingham Crown Court trial earlier this month, the jury heard that Zarif was believed to have fled to Pakistan after the 3 February raid in the Digbeth area of the city.
Mistry, of Laundon Way in Leicester, and Zarif owned a ran a bodyshop in Derby called ATS Detailing and Wrap, while Wali, of Osmaston Park Road, Derby, knew both men.
Meanwhile, jurors have been told by the prosecution that "inside man" Sander van Aalten, of Kyrwicks Lane in Birmingham, has already admitted conspiracy to rob the warehouse.
The trial continues.
