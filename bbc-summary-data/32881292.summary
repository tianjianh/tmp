Toby Fairclough had "suffered a medical condition" on playing fields at North Marston, Aylesbury, early on Saturday, police said.
He was taken by ambulance to Stoke Mandeville Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
A post-mortem examination due to be carried out will include toxicology tests, Det Insp Brendan Murray said.
"It is likely to be several weeks before the results of these tests are known.
"Late on Friday night or in the early hours of Saturday morning, we believe that Toby digested a substance which he believed to be the illegal drug MDMA," Det Insp Murray said.
In a statement, his family said: "Toby Fairclough was a cherished, sporty, ebullient child who we both loved dearly.
"Toby has left a huge hole in all of our lives. He was brilliant.
"He also was a caring and loving big brother to Xavier."
