[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 2-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strugglers Guiseley won just their third National League game of the season with a 2-0 home success against Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lions did the damage early on as full-back Connor Brown embarked on a foray down the right and crossed for Jordan Preston to turn in his third of the season.
Luck played a part in the second when Will Hatfield's shot deflected kindly towards the head of Jake Cassidy, who nodded home.
Guiseley could even afford to miss a penalty - Luke Young fouled Hatfield in the box but Cassidy was denied from the spot by Brendan Moore.
Showing increased confidence, the hosts held on to their lead comfortably in the second half.
