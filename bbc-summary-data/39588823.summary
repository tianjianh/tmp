On Sunday, BBC 6 Music DJ Mark Radcliffe explores the history of the football chant to find out what makes a hit in the stands.
Before the programme goes live, we want to test your chant knowledge. Listen to these seven terrace chants and work out which club's fans are singing them.
You can listen to 'From Doris to Depeche: The football fans' songbook' on BBC Radio 5 live from 19:30 BST.
