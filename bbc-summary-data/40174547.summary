Rangers fraud trial: SFA to seek £200,000 from Craig Whyte

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Football Association is to consider pursuing former Rangers owner Craig Whyte for a fine of £200,000 for bringing the game into disrepute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whyte, found not guilty of taking over the club by fraud in May 2011, was fined by the governing body in 2012 but the money was never paid.
SFA chief executive Stewart Regan confirmed the body will take advice about how to recover the money.
Regan declined to comment on the High Court verdict concerning Whyte.

"Clearly, the trial verdict is a matter between Craig Whyte and the Crown," he said.
"The verdict is the verdict. It's not a matter for the Scottish FA.
"It has had a telling effect on Scottish football. We found Craig Whyte not to be a fit and proper person several years ago. He won't be involved in any football club or any member of the Scottish FA.
"That money (the £200,000 fine) has never been recovered. That will be something we will take advice on and should the opportunity present itself then we would certainly consider that."
Regan intimated that the SFA had not previously chased payment of the fine through the courts because the cost of doing so might outweigh the sum owed.
And although he described the Rangers story over the past five years as "regrettable" he said he himself had "no regrets" over the way he and the SFA handled the situation.
