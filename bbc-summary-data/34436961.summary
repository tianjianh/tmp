The Beechcraft King Air 200 came down in a field off Gravel Lane and Miller's Lane in Chigwell on Saturday, killing both people on board.
The fire service said the plane - an eight-seater - was "100% alight" when crews arrived at about 10:20 BST.
Essex Police and the Air Accident Investigation Branch are investigating.
The plane was owned and operated by London Executive Aviation (LEA), which said it had just taken off from nearby Stapleford Airfield and was heading for Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.
A spokesman for the company said the plane was manufactured in 1981 and had its most recent scheduled maintenance inspection on 12 June.
A statement described both crew members, who have not been named, as "highly experienced professional pilots".
Managing director George Galanopoulos said: "Everybody at LEA is shocked and deeply saddened by this tragic accident.
"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of our colleagues who lost their lives.
"We will also co-operate fully with the authorities charged with investigating the causes of the accident."
