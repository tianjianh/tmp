Search for stolen bulldog puppy worth £16,000 in Oxford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are still searching for a rare bulldog puppy worth £16,000 which was snatched from its breeder's home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man interested in buying the pup ran away with the eight-week-old lilac bulldog, known as Lila, from a property in Tadworth, Surrey, in October.
Five men aged between 24 and 27 from Oxford have been arrested on conspiracy to commit robbery.
It is thought the puppy - high in demand because of its colour -  is somewhere in the Oxford area.
The thief ran from the property with the animal, allegedly assaulting a relative of the breeder in the process.
Det Con Eloise Lock, from Surrey Police, asked the public to watch their neighbours for "unusual behaviour".
She said: "We still need to find the puppy and return her to the rightful owner.
"If you have noticed any unusual behaviour by your neighbours, or anybody you know in relation to any new pets they have, we need to hear from you."
Four men - aged 24, 26 and two aged 25 - were arrested on 28 November. A 27-year-old man was arrested on 23 December, Surrey Police said.
The men have been released on bail until 19 and 20 February.
