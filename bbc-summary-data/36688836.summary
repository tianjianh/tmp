Taylor, 30, who has a further 12 month option with the Seasiders, played 160 games for Walsall following his move from Sheffield United in August 2012.
He started his career as a trainee with hometown club Blackburn and previously had a loan spell at Blackpool in 2006.
"It's nice to be back in the north west where all my friends and family are," Taylor told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"That was one of the main factors in the move, but it is also about the challenge ahead - it's a big club."
