Real's victory moved them into second place with one game to go, still one point behind leaders Barcelona, who routed Espanyol 5-0.
Atletico Madrid's 2-1 loss at Levante means only Real and Barca can prevail.
Ronaldo's goals either side of a Karim Benzema strike made it 3-1, but Andre Gomes' goal added to Rodrigo's earlier effort to make it a nervy finish.
Relive how the title race developed
Defending champions Barca will take the title if the teams finish level on points thanks to their superior head-to-head record.
Ronaldo took his goal tally for the season to 49 with two excellent finishes, firing low into the net from 20 yards with his right foot to give Real the lead half-way through the first half.
After Rodrigo had pulled one back early in the second half, Ronaldo then restored Real's two-goal advantage as he ran clear to beat Diego Alves with a left-foot shot.
The hosts' cause was aided when goalscorer Rodrigo was dismissed on 83 minutes.
Barcelona have the destiny of the title in their own hands but should they drop points at Granada, Real will secure their first championship since 2012 with a win at Deportivo de La Coruna.
Deportivo would still have been in relegation danger going into the last day but for a 2-0 win at Villarreal on Sunday.
However, that was only their second league win in 21 games.
