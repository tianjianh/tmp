Appearances at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association in Washington on 27 September and 18 October will earn him £69,992.
He was also due £28,454.40 for a speech on 17 October to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California.
Mr Osborne signed up with a US speakers agency after being sacked in July.
The total earnings of £98,446.40 was for four-and-a-half hours of work.
The parliamentary register also shows travel and accommodation expenses were covered by Mr Osborne's hosts.
Mr Osborne, who was chancellor between 2010 and 2016, is also paid £74,962 a year as the MP for Tatton in Cheshire.
He returned to the back benches after new Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle.
Former prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, as well as ex-US president George W Bush, are also on the books of the Washington Speakers Bureau.
The company, which offers after-dinner speeches, describes Mr Osborne on its website as "a principled leader who served as the chief financial minister in the British Government" who was responsible for a "dramatic improvement" in the UK economy.
It says he is a "modern and renowned global leader" who offers audiences "authentic and forward-thinking analysis of the world's most complex economic issues, and the way forward for Britain and the world economy".
