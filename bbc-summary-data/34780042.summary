Funeral services have been held in Chicago for nine-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who police say was executed for his father's gang affiliations.

The Reverend Michael Pfleger told mourners it was "a new low for Chicago" and that the city "has to face itself".
Police believe members of a rival gang lured Tyshawn away from a park near his grandmother's home and shot him.
Officers have called the crime "unfathomable" and are offering rewards for anyone with leads on the suspects.
His small red casket arrived at St Sabina's Church on Chicago's South Side, where the city's mayor, Rahm Emanuel was among those paying their respects.
Police say Tyshawn's death can be attributed to two gangs fighting and retaliating against one another for months.
The Faith Community of St Sabina has raised at least $54,000 (Â£35,000) in reward money.
Tyshawn's father Pierre Stokes told ABC7 in Chicago his son's death had nothing to do with gang affiliations and is frustrated the police are focusing on him.
"I don't want to harm nobody, I just want to see justice for my son by seeing the person who did it - whoever did it - locked up. That's all I ever want," he told ABC7.
