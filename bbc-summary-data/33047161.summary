[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scuba divers are being sought to help clean an outdoor pool in Cambridge.

Staff at Jesus Green Lido - claimed to be one of the largest outdoor pools in Europe - said fallen leaves had become too difficult for them to clear.
"We realised we just can't hold our breath long enough to get rid of them all," said duty manager Sophie Wing.
"Because it's been so windy we have far more leaves than usual and they are clogging up our filters and messing up the pool.
"We thought a group of scuba divers might like to help out as we know they use indoor pools for training."
She said she had not heard of other pools asking for scuba-diving cleaners, but was hopeful a group would come forward.
The outdoor pool - which is managed by Cambridge City Council and social enterprise GLL - is just over 90m (295ft) in length and between 1.2m (4ft) and 2.5m (8.2ft) deep.
It is open between May and September each year.
