The RSPCA said the three-feet-long (1m) female snake was probably abandoned by its owner.
Kim Greaves, who is a reptile expert for the animal welfare charity, said the snake would not be able to survive in the wild.
She said the RSPCA would prosecute the person who dumped the snake if they were found.
Ms Greaves said the problem of abandoned animals in the area was "getting absolutely out of hand."
"This is a happy ending for this particular snake," she said.
"But more and more of my colleagues are faced with abandoned animals, not just snakes and reptiles, but rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets and cats and dogs.
"It is a sign of the times, I'm afraid,"
The non-venomous royal python is found in Africa and survives on a diet of rodents.
