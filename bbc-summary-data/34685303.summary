Crewe had been reduced to 10 men just after the hour mark when goalkeeper Ben Garratt was sent off for bringing down Yemi Odubade outside the box.
Eastleigh went ahead when substitute keeper Dan Nizic tripped Ross Lafayette and Strevens stepped up to score.
Crewe's best chance saw Ben Nugent's header from a corner fly wide.
The victory was a deserved one for Eastleigh who had enjoyed the better of the game at Gresty Road even before Garratt was dismissed.
The lively Odubade almost put the Spitfires ahead in the first half but saw his effort cleared off the line by Nugent.
Andy Drury's angled shot flew inches past the post and Odubade twice more went close as Eastleigh finished the stronger before the break.
The turning point in the match came when Odubade raced onto Drury's through ball, but Garratt misjudged his challenge and upended the striker a yard outside the area and was shown a straight red card.
Strevens made Eastleigh's dominance count when he sent Nizic the wrong way from the penalty spot 15 minutes from time and the visitors held on to reach the second round.
Eastleigh manager Chris Todd told BBC Radio Solent:

"I'm very proud of my players, they've put in an incredible shift and deserve to be in the second round.
"When he [Ben Strevens] stepped up to take that, I was praying he scored because he's such a nice guy and he loves football and he deserved that glory today.
"It was a great performance and we deserved to win the game."
