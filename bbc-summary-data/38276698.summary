Olympic champion Jones beat Egypt's Hedaya Malak 7-0 in the final of the -57kg category just days after the Welsh fighter said she was open to a future switch to mixed martial arts.
Rio bronze medallist Walkden beat Zheng Shuyin of China for the +67kg title.
"It's extra special when we both win titles because we push each other so hard," said Jones.
The pair live together, and Jones said they would "celebrate" after their joint success.
"After winning the Olympics I felt so much more relaxed coming into this tournament," said Jones, who also won gold at London 2012.
"People don't realise how hard it is to come back from an Olympics and fight again. It can be an anti-climax so I'm really pleased to get gold because I couldn't do that after London."
Earlier, Briton Rachelle Booth was beaten by South Korea's Lee Ah-reum in the -62kg bronze-medal match.
