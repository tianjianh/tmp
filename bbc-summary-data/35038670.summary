Neonatal unit at Cardiff hospital closes due to infection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The neonatal unit at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff has closed to new admissions because of an infection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board closed the unit after three babies tested positive for the highly-contagious Acinetobacter baumannii.
The exact cause of the infection is not known and investigations are ongoing.
Fourteen babies are being cared for in the unit and those who have received treatment are responding well.
The unit was closed in August when 12 babies tested positive for infections and reopened a few weeks ago.
The health board said  at the time enhanced infection prevention control measures had been put in place.
Ruth Walker, the executive nurse director for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: "I know staff are continuing to work hard and show a high level of commitment to resolving this.
"But we are continuing to do all we can to keep these babies safe and are working with our colleagues across the neonatal network to make sure expectant women are properly cared for."
