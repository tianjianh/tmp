An early try by Craig Kopczak put the visitors ahead, but scores from Maurice Blair, Iain Thornley, Graeme Horne, Ken Sio and James Greenwood put Rovers in control at 30-6 at the break.
Josh Griffin's two tries and one from Greg Johnson gave the Red Devils hope but Ryan Shaw extended the hosts' lead.
Kopczak got his second try before Matty Marsh scored Rovers' seventh.
The win moves Hull KR off the bottom of the table - above Wakefield and Huddersfield - into 10th place and is James Webster's first victory since being appointed interim head coach.
Winger Josh Mantellato returned after a five-match absence with a torn retina and scored 16 points with the boot as well as impressing in the loose.
Salford centre Griffin has now scored in five Super League games in a row but the Red Devils have lost three of the past four games.
Hull Kingston Rovers interim head coach James Webster told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I was nervous the last 20 minutes. But I thought in the first half we were really good. We worked hard on our ruck control from last week and I thought we were really good with that.
"I can't remember the last time we were 20-odd points ahead with another half to play. But the first 10 minutes [of the second half] we were a little bit off and I thought they were very good and put us under some pressure.
"We need to play to our strengths - we were missing some people especially in the halves and we need to come up with a gameplan somehow that we're able to get the best out of what we have."
Salford head coach Ian Watson: "We didn't start the game well at all.
"Certain individuals weren't doing their role in the team. If certain individuals are not prepared to play, that's what happens.
"They started completing their sets at 100 per cent and that makes it hard to defend against.
"We're an honest group and we spoke honestly about the first half where people were letting us down. We put it to the players and they agreed."
