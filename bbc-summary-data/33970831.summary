'Hundreds' could lose jobs in Legal and General Kingswood closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people will lose their jobs if insurance company Legal and General goes ahead with plans to close its Surrey office, a union claims.

The company has said the Kingswood campus, which employs 1,700 people, could close in 2017 - years before the lease runs out in 2025.
It said the "vast majority" of the jobs will be transferred to its Hove and Cardiff offices.
But the Unite union said it would not be possible for members to relocate.
"There will be a minimum of 250 job losses, but we think it will be much higher than that," said regional officer Ian Methven.
"Their partners will have jobs and their children will be going to local schools so the idea that these people can just relocate to other parts of the country is a bit ridiculous.
"There is not enough space at the Hove site to transfer hundreds of jobs and it is highly unlikely that several hundred people are going to uproot and go to Cardiff."
The Kingswood campus is set in 50 acres of countryside and has a sports hall, staff gym, swimming pool and tennis courts.
Mr Methven said it was unclear which jobs would go first, but some staff would be affected within six months.
"A lot of these people are highly skilled," he said.
"They are key people within the pensions industry and those skills are going to be lost.
"This could have a knock-on effect on the ability of L&G to provide services for their customers."
The company said it had started consultations with Unite.
"The Kingswood office lease is up for renewal, and therefore it is sensible to see if the work cannot be done in our other offices, in a way that could benefit our customers," it said in a statement.
