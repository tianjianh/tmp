Kemal Bulut was one of at least 37 people who died on Sunday when a car bomb exploded in the Turkish capital.
"Our capital was shaken by the fatal attack which targeted innocent people and we've once again been devastated by the news we received," the club said.
"We have learned with sorrow that Umut Bulut's father Kemal Bulut was one of the people to lose their lives."
