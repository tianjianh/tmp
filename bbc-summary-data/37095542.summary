An investigation has begun after a trawler caught fire in Peterhead harbour.
More than 30 firefighters tackled the blaze on Ardent II after being called out at about 05:40 on Tuesday.
The boat's crew have all been accounted for and there are no reports of any injuries.
The fire took nearly four hours to bring under control.
