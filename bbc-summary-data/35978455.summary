[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Racing 92 will face Leicester in the Champions Cup semi-finals after beating reigning champions Toulon in a tense last eight meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The French Top 14 sides were level on 77 minutes after Charles Ollivan cancelled out Juan Imoff's opening try for Parisians Racing in the first half.
But a late Maxime Machenaud penalty edged Racing in front and they held on to defeat the three-time champions.
Racing will play Leicester in the last four in Nottingham on 24 April.
Tigers joined fellow Premiership sides Saracens and Wasps in the semis after beating Stade Francais 41-13 on Sunday.
Racing, who sit one place and two points above Toulon in the French league, were kicked in front by former New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter, and Imoff put them 10-0 up when he intercepted a loose ball and ran 40 metres to touch down.
But Ollivan went over in reply after a sensational break from Josua Tuisova, and a conversion and penalty from Pellissie brought Toulon level at the break.
Carter, the all-time leading points scorer in Test history, suffered a leg injury and although he stayed on the field, France scrum-half Machenaud took over kicking duties and landed two penalties before Pelissie levelled matters once again.
Delon Armitage and Machenaud both missed chances in the final 10 minutes, as the windy conditions sent long-range penalties wide.
But Machenaud was handed another chance and his 20-metre penalty sent Racing through and ended Toulon's three-year reign as champions of Europe.
