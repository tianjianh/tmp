Tall Ships: New £12m vessel for Ireland 'dependent on 60% government funding'

A proposed new tall ship for Ireland is dependent on governments on either side of the Irish border paying 60% of cost, the organisation behind the project has said.

Plans for the cross-border project were announced at Belfast's Tall Ships maritime festival earlier this month.
The Atlantic Youth Trust has been planning the £12m ship for three years.
It has taken a step closer to being realised with the unveiling of concept drawings of the vessel.
The ship is planned as a youth development legacy project to the Tall Ships festival, and would take 40 young people at a time on 10-day sail training voyages.
Neil O'Hagan, the Atlantic Youth Trust's executive director, described the proposed ship as "considerable" at 48m long.
"[The project] is primarily trying to develop teamwork, leadership, communication and life skills among the young people that come onboard," he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
"Over the 10 days they will have to do everything from steer the ship, to clean the toilets, to chop potatoes, to climb to the top of the mast, to do the navigation onboard."
The trust has said about £12m is needed to build a modern, low-maintenance steel vessel that would have an expected life-span of 30 years.
After that point, the ship would be refitted or rebuilt.
Mr O'Hagan said it was "vitally important" that both governments supported the project as it would offer a "cross-border, cross-community, cultural integration" for 1,000 young people a year.
About 30%, or £4.8m, is expected to come from what the trusts calls "Northern Ireland Inc" - that could be a combination of government and corporate funding.
The Irish government has been asked provide the same total, while the remaining 40% will be made up of European peace funding and philanthropic donations.
"Until both governments come out publicly and say: 'We're going to support this provided you guys come up the rest of the funding,' we can't really push the button to move on," Mr O'Hagan said.
He added that the trust expects to know within a year whether the project can go ahead.
