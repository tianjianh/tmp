With penalties looming, Lasse Vigen Christensen turned in Malone's low cross for a place in round three.
The Whites will take on Bristol City in round three.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"I never had any plan to leave Fulham.
"If I complain about something it is because I want the best for my team, my team-mates, the supporters too and I was very clear what is my opinion about this situation and that is it.
"I am still in the same position and believe we need more people to be stronger in the future."
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka:
"I'm disappointed because I said before the game this trophy is very important for the club.
"I have to apologise to our crowd because they came here midweek and it's an important trophy for this club, we respect this trophy a lot. So this has been difficult."
