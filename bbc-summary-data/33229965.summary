Guid Nychburris behaviour praised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have praised the "good family atmosphere" among the thousands of people who turned out to watch Guid Nychburris events in Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In previous years crime figures have seen a significant rise during the annual celebration.
Good weather on Saturday meant a larger number of spectators than usual turned out to the event.
However, Insp Stuart Wilson said that other than a "few minor incidents" it had passed peacefully.
He said: "The annual Guid Nychburris celebrations started early with police cyclists escorting about 200 horses through the traffic in Dumfries.
"The good weather meant that there were a large number of spectators out to watch the horses, the crowning ceremony and the parade in the centre of Dumfries but it was a good family atmosphere and there were no policing issues.
"Local police were assisted by police horses and Operational Support Division from Glasgow to make sure the crowds were safe."
