Marina Litvinenko will have private talks with Theresa May a week after the official inquiry report was published.
At the time Mrs May said the murder was a "blatant and unacceptable" breach of international law.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has said the public inquiry was "politicised".
One of the two men accused of killing Mr Litvinenko, 43, Andrei Lugovoi, branded the inquiry's conclusions "nonsense".
Mr Litvinenko, a Russian dissident who became a British citizen, died in November 2006, three weeks after he drank tea laced with polonium 210 at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, central London.
Ahead of the meeting, a Home Office spokeswoman said: "The home secretary made clear that she would meet Mrs Litvinenko and listen very carefully to what she has to say."
Mrs Litvinenko called on Prime Minister David Cameron to impose "targeted economic sanctions and travel bans" against individuals, including Mr Putin.
The government has announced financial sanctions against the two men whom the inquiry identified as Mr Litvinenko's killers - Mr Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, Both deny any involvement.
