County Championship: Lancashire draw with Warwickshire at Old Trafford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire pair Liam Livingstone and Haseem Hameed made hundreds but it was not enough to avoid an ultimately tame draw with Warwickshire at Old Trafford.

Having led by 215 overnight, Hameed, who resumed on 81, reached his maiden first-class century (103) as the hosts batted on until just before lunch.
The defiant Livingstone was still there on 106 when Lancs declared on 266-8.
But, set 312 to win on a spinner's wicket, the Bears made no attempt to go for the runs as they finished on 195-2.
Ian Bell and his former England team-mate Jonathan Trott saw out time in an unbroken 111-run third-wicket stand before hands were shaken at 17:30 BST.
After the loss of fellow opener Andy Umeed, caught behind, Varun Chopra made 48 before failing to read Matt Parkinson's top-spinner.
But he proved the only victim for the teenage leg-spinner, who sent down 30 overs but could not match his first-innings heroics when he took 5-49.
Bell's unbeaten 55 was the third time he has passed 50 in eight Championship innings for the Bears this season - but his first half-century in two months in first-class cricket.
The morning session belonged to Hameed, who took 291 balls to reach three figures for the first time, and Livingstone, who faced just 115 balls for his ton.
Having got there with a six over long-on and a straight-driven four off Rikki Clarke, Livingstone now averages 97.2 in first-class cricket this season.
The draw keeps Lancashire top, as third-placed Durham's home game with second-placed Yorkshire ended in a draw.
Lancashire director of cricket Ashley Giles told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was a really good game of cricket and a good test for us against a very good Warwickshire team. Again we've shown that we are not here to be pushed about by some of the big teams.
"Most importantly our youngsters have come through again and produced big performances. We have a core of players who could be around for a decade or more and that's a really good position for this club to be in.
"We had Matt Parkinson bowling like that on his debut, Haseem Hameed scoring his first hundred and Liam Livingstone scoring a run-a-ball hundred.
"Haseem is going to be a star, I'm sure. Some of Livingstone's strokeplay is just different. He's a modern player who hits the ball very cleanly and has very quick hands. And the most impressive thing about Matt Parkinson was his composure. He spins the ball. He has variations and today he bowled at two of the best players in the country."
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell told BBC WM:
"It was a really good few days of cricket. It very hard, really scrappy cricket.
"The wicket was not particularly easy for any batter who wanted to get in and play fluently and score at a good rate and then it spun later on.
"We're really happy with the way it went. It ebbed and flowed.
"We had opportunities and Lancashire had a couple of key partnerships that got them back on track."
