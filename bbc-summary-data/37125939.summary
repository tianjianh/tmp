The man in charge of the Olympic boxing tournament has been "reassigned" after criticism of judging decisions in Rio.

The International Boxing Association (Aiba) said its executive director Karim Bouzidi would be given "a new role within the organisation" and and another official put in charge.
It comes a day after Aiba dropped some referees and judges after reviewing their performances at the Games.
Aiba accepted "some decisions were not at the level expected".
Aiba executive board vice president Franco Falcinelli will take charge of "operational responsibilities" for the remainder of the Olympic boxing competition.
The organisation added: "Aiba will not shy away from its responsibilities and will continue to ensure a level playing field and a fair and transparent sport."
The reaction to Irish fighter Michael Conlan's controversial defeat prompted action from Aiba.
Conlan lost by unanimous decision to Russia's Vladimir Nikitin when many observers felt he had won comfortably.
Similarly, Russian world champion Evgeny Tishchenko was awarded all three rounds in his favour against Kazakhstan's Vassiliy Levit in the men's heavyweight final, despite suffering a cut to his head and spending much of the bout on the back foot.
Tishchenko was booed by the crowd after being given the unanimous points decision.
