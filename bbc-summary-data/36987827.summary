The animals have made themselves at home at Scottish Power's visitor centre on the banks of Loch Awe near Oban.
They have attracted the attention of staff who have been feeding them home-made treats.
Cafe assistant Shona Mcleman said: "There have been a few sightings over the years but this family in particular seem well and truly settled in now."
