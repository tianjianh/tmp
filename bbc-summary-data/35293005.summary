Eighties acts Rick Astley, ABC, The Stars from The Commitments and The Rezillos will also perform at the event on 4 June.
Last year the Doonhamers hosted their first concert when Status Quo were the headline act.
The Championship club said they had shown that their ground was "ideally suited" for such events.
Chairman Billy Hewitson said they had "dipped their toe" in music promotion last year and it had been so well received they had decided to host a whole day of "retro musical acts".
Queen of the South commercial manager Victoria Thomson added: "Some of the things our audience really enjoyed about the venue last year was the fact that there was no mud and that they did not have to camp or stay overnight.
"It seems as if we have hit upon a line-up and venue that offers both a rock-and-roll experience and a few creature comforts for our attendees.
"We felt after the success of our inaugural concert that the stadium is ideally suited for staging events of this type."
