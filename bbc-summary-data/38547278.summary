Two women were assaulted after three men forced their way into a house in a "cowardly attack", police said.

The intruders, one thought to be armed with a shotgun, entered the house in Goldcrest Close in West Derby, Liverpool at about 00:05 GMT on Saturday.
One woman, 21, suffered slash wounds to her arms and another, 48, was hit on the head with the butt of the gun.
Both women were taken to hospital where they are in a stable condition.
Police believe it was a targeted attack.
The men, described as being in their late teens or early 20s, were wearing black coats with their faces covered and left in a dark-coloured Audi car.
A shotgun appeared to have been fired causing damage to the front door and a wall in the hall area of the property, police said.
Det Supt Richie Salter said it was "a nasty assault" and the offenders were "incredibly reckless" to use a firearm in the street.
He appealed to anyone who witnessed "the cowardly attack" or saw people "acting suspiciously in and around Goldcrest Close" to contact officers.
