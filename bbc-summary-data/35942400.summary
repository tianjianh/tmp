[SN]TITLE[SN]
Arrest warrant for boy, 11, guilty over firearms offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 11-year-old boy who pointed an air pistol at two people before firing at a parked car has been convicted of a firearms offence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Youth Court heard he was 10 when he fired the weapon on a Derby street on 17 August.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, failed to appear at court and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
He was found guilty of possessing an imitation firearm and a public order offence and will be sentenced later.
The court heard how the two victims, a man and a woman, had met on the day to discuss the problems they had been having with the then 10-year-old.
They told the court he pointed the weapon at them, while verbally abusing them, before firing it at a car parked across the street.
The woman said she had "never felt as vulnerable" and that the boy was "blasÃ©" after he had fired the pellets.
The man told the court they "didn't know if he was to going to fire it or not".
He added: "I felt worried and afraid because you did not know with him.
"Sometimes you could talk to him if you were one to one, he was a nice little lad and you could talk sensibly. But then he would change and you didn't know what he was going to do next."
They said he shouted "I'm going to get you for this" from his bedroom window.
The police were called and the boy was taken away "kicking, screaming abuse and crying".
A firearms expert confirmed the gun was a "Chinese made, 6mm, plastic pellet firing, soft air pistol" which was coloured blue and in "normal working order".
Lead magistrate Tim Court said the boy would be sentenced at a later date.
