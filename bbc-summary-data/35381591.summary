Wolves have completed a deal to sign teenage striker Aaron Collins from League Two side Newport County.

Collins, 18, who becomes the second signing of the January window for Scott Sellars' Wolves Under-21 squad, moves to Molineux for an undisclosed fee.
The Wales Under-19 international has scored three goals for Newport, for whom he has made the majority of his 22 appearances from the bench.
Collins was wanted by another Championship side Burnley last summer.
After rejecting a bid of £40,000, plus add-ons, the Welsh club then also turned down an improved £65,000 transfer deadline-day offer from the Clarets.
Collins ended up working in McDonald's, after initially being released in 2014 by Newport, following the reformed club's promotion back to the Football League.
Wolves have also added teenage Swindon Town winger Will Randall to their under-21s squad this month, also for an undisclosed fee.
The up-for-sale club, who lie 10th in the Championship, sold Benik Afobe to Bournemouth in January for close to £10m, having previously added Polish forward Michal Zyro to the first-team squad.
