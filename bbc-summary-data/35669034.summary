Los Che, who saw off Rapid 10-0 on aggregate, have won their last two La Liga games - having failed to win any of Neville's first nine league matches.
"That was the big thing, to keep the momentum going," he said.
"We have a very big week - Bilbao, Malaga and Atletico Madrid. But the confidence going into it is good."
Valencia, 11th in the table, are at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday (15:00 GMT) as they try to make it five consecutive wins, before visiting Malaga on Wednesday and hosting title-chasing Atletico Madrid on Sunday, 6 March.
They were goalless at half-time in Vienna, before goals from Rodrigo, Sofiane Feghouli, Pablo Piatti and Ruben Vezo sealed the win.
They have been drawn against Athletic Bilbao in the last 16.
Neville said: "The professional attitude and mentality were the things I was most happy with. The performance was very good.
"I told the players we had two jobs - one was to complete the tie and also I wanted the momentum to keep going and I wanted a good performance. Thankfully we got both.
"All the players are fresh. We left six or seven players behind with [assistant] Pako Ayestaran and our fitness coach to prepare them. I'm happy with the players who played tonight - they played well."
