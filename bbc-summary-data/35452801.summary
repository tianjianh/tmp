The 19-year-old shot a four-under 69 to move to 12 under, alongside Sweden's Anna Nordqvist, who carded a 68.
Hull, who has shared the lead after each of the first three days, looked set to lose ground until a late rally that included a birdie at the last.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew is tied in eighth on nine-under after firing a 71.
