Some 48 students, from across the country and Europe, embarked on the five-year degree in veterinary medicine and science at the University of Surrey earlier this week.
Their base, the Â£45m School of Veterinary Medicine - one of eight in the UK - is still under construction.
Work began earlier this year and is due to be completed in summer 2015.
Once finished, a university spokeswoman said it would be made up of three state-of-the art new buildings, a pathology facility, an anatomy laboratory, and a clinical skills centre for large and small animals.
