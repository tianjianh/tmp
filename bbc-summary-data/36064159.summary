Carlin, 25, won in four minutes 4.33 seconds, 0.33 secs inside the qualification mark, which she had missed in her 200m and 800m successes.
"I can't believe it," said the Welsh swimmer. "It means so much to me."
Siobhan-Marie O'Connor (200m individual medley) and Ben Proud (50m freestyle) also secured Olympic places.
Carlin missed London 2012 after suffering with glandular fever in the build-up to the Olympic trials.
Since then she has gone on to claim world, European and Commonwealth honours, but admitted the fear of missing out on another Olympics had led to stress and hampered her performances in the 200m and 800m finals.
After a powerful swim in the 400m freestyle final, she broke down in tears at the realisation she had achieved her dream.
"I've been a recluse - a bit moody, emotional and just not myself," she said.
"I've had so much support from everyone and I had to do it on my last swim, so it's just a massive relief."

The stand-out performance of the night arguably came in the men's 1500m final, as 18-year-old Tim Shuttleworth produced a breathtaking display to claim gold.
His time of 14:55.23 was just 0.12 seconds outside the automatic qualification mark.
However, it is within the 2% margin required for consideration for the Games, with second-placed Stephen Milne also in contention.
"It's an unbelievable feeling that I just can't describe," said Shuttleworth after knocking over 20 seconds off his personal best time to win the 1500m final. "It's an absolute dream come true."
Proud lowered his own British record to 21.65 seconds in the 50m freestyle heats.
Although he went slower in the final (21.73), it was still enough to secure an Olympic berth, and 17-year-old team-mate Thomas Fannon (22.24) should also be in contention.
"I've still more improvements to make, but I'm happy with the way I'm going," said Proud. "Hopefully I can get to the Olympic final this summer and then prove myself there."
World bronze medallist O'Connor delivered a dominant 200m individual medley to beat 400m IM specialists Hannah Miley and Aimee Willmot into second and third respectively.
Her time of 2:09.66 was inside the qualification mark of 2:10.19.
"I'm absolutely over the moon to get on the plane for Rio," said O'Connor, who competed in London aged only 16.
"Four years ago it was a bit of a pressure-cooker situation because it was a home Olympics, but this time I'm trying to be more relaxed."
Roberto Pavoni secured victory in the 200m individual medley final, but his time of 1:59.20 was more than two seconds outside the qualification mark and he will not follow London 2012 with a second Olympic appearance.
Eight British swimmers have guaranteed their places at the Rio Olympics, with the prospect of more on Sunday, the final day of the GB trials.
