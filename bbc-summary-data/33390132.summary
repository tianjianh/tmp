[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bethan Owen, from Bodelwyddan, started Bethan's Karate Academy after becoming an instructor at just 12 years old.
She has been caring for her mother Julie, who has epilepsy, since she was five, helping her father Garry.
Her parents introduced her to karate when she was seven to give her a focus away from the responsibilities at home.
Bethan, a pupil at Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan, Abergele, teaches children between the ages of six and nine at the club, which is run not-for-profit.
Lorna Fenwick, from Wrexham, Conwy and Denbighshire Young Carers project, said: "To actually do this at such a young age, she is an inspiration."
