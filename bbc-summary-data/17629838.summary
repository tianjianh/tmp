Jobs to be axed in North Yorkshire fire control room

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four posts at the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service control room look set to be axed as part of measures to save £2.5m by 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire service said it was proposing to cut four full-time posts from the current 27 positions.
Area manager Owen Hayward said it was hoped the cuts would not be compulsory and a consultation was under way.
The fire service said improved control room technology meant there was a reduction in control room staff work.
The measures should provide savings of £400,000 per year, it is claimed.
Mr Hayward said that under the proposals, three staff would be on duty at all times, rather than between three and five at present.
