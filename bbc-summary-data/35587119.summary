The 31-year-old made his first-class debut for Durham UCCE in 2005 and spent eight years with Hampshire before joining Surrey at the end of 2014.
Balcombe signed a two-year deal with Surrey but did not make a first-team appearance for The Oval side.
He took 196 wickets at an average of 32.83 in 67 first-class appearances.
The right-armer's best bowling figures came when he took 8-71 for Hampshire in the first innings against Gloucestershire in April 2012, and he added a further three wickets in the second innings to give him a best match haul of 11-119.
"To play professional cricket was a dream come true and I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute," he said.
"I have made lifelong friends, experienced some wonderful career moments and it provided me with 10 seasons of immense enjoyment."
