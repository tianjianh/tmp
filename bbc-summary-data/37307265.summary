The 38-year-old Para-cyclist caught fellow Briton Crystal Lane, who took silver, after only 1,375m of the C5 3,000m individual pursuit final.
Steve Bate - with pilot Adam Duggleby - and Megan Giglia also won cycling gold, as did swimmer Ollie Hynd.
Those victories mean Great Britain have four gold medals at the Rio Games.
Swimmers Harriet Lee and Stephanie Millward won silver and bronze respectively to take the overall total to seven medals.
Storey had shared the record of the number of Paralympic titles with former wheelchair racer Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, but was expected to easily defeat Lane in Thursday's final. With less than half of the distance completed, Storey caught her team-mate to add to the tally which began aged just 14 at the 1992 Games.
"I'd thought about being the most decorated Paralympian until two days ago - but Tanni's still a hero to me," said Storey, who competes in the C5 category in which athletes meet the minimum impairment criteria.
"To go quicker than London after having my daughter Louisa is the icing on the cake.
"You can never underestimate anyone on the other side of the track. It's amazing and I don't think it will sink for a very long time."
She will now aim to win a further three gold medals at Rio - in the C4-5 road race, C5 time trial and C4-5 500m time trial.
Storey started out as a swimmer and won two gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at Barcelona 1992. She competed in the pool at three more Games before a series of ear infections eventually saw her switch to cycling in 2005.

Earlier on day one, Giglia won Britain's first gold with a stunning win in the C1-3 3000m, catching American Jamie Whitmore after 1,875m.
The 31-year-old, who had a brain haemorrhage and stroke at the age of 27, told Channel 4: "It hasn't sunk in yet. I wouldn't be here without my team-mates, and my back-up team behind me.
"I didn't think I would make it to Rio and I thought it was a bit ambitious but I wanted to give it a go.
"Within the British camp everyone is hyped up and ready to go. I have another three events to go so I will enjoy the races with my legs pedalling as fast as I can."
Bate and Duggleby defeated Dutchmen Vincent ter Schure and pilot Timo Fransen in the B 4,000m individual pursuit final as GB enjoyed a successful first day on the track.

Mansfield-born Hynd set a world record time of four minutes 21.89 seconds to win the S8 400m freestyle final - and fulfil his dream of going one better than silver in 2012.
"There isn't a day that's gone by where I haven't thought about London and it's all been about putting it right," said Hynd, who has neuromuscular myopathy - a condition which weakens their legs
"I knew I needed to go out and do my own race. Although I'm a little bit disappointed not to go quicker, the gold is the most important thing."
Lee, 25, took silver in the SB9 100m breaststroke final won by Dutchwoman Lisa Kruger. Millward added bronze to the total as she finished behind 17-year-old Australian Lakeisha Patterson in the S8 400m freestyle final.
In wheelchair basketball, GB's men beat Algeria 93-31 but the women's team lost 43-36 to world champions Canada.
Britain's men's seven-a-side football pushed hosts Brazil hard but eventually lost 2-1.
Brazil won their first gold medal of the Games as T11 long jumper Ricardo Costa de Oliveira's final-round leap of 6.52m beat American Lex Gillette.
The first gold of the Games went to Kenya's Samwel Mushai Kimani in the men's T11 5,000m with Brazil's Odair Santos taking silver.
Meanwhile, a Belarus official who carried a Russian flag into the opening ceremony has been banned from the event by the International Paralympic Committee.
Belarus' neighbours Russia are banned from the Games for state-sponsored doping.
