The actress and comedian died last month aged 52 after a battle with cancer.
Wednesday evening's Gogglebox: Brexit special concluded with the words "In loving memory of Caroline Aherne" written across the screen.
Half The World Away by Oasis, the theme song to The Royle Family, which Aherne wrote and starred in, was then played over the end credits.
Aherne was also well known for appearing in The Fast Show and as the host of The Mrs Merton show.
At the time of her death, Gogglebox creator Tania Alexander tweeted she was "beyond sad about the loss of my dear pal Caroline Aherne".
Craig Cash, who appeared alongside Aherne on The Royle Family and co-wrote the show, has taken over as the narrator of Gogglebox.
