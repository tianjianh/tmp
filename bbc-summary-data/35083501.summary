Actor Michael Sheen and Miriam Gonz치lez Dur치ntez - wife of ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg - will also take the reigns of Today during the guest week.
The guest editors will be live in the studio and will take responsibility for about half the programme's output.
Sir Bradley, who won the 2012 Tour de France, said he wanted to shine a spotlight on "stuff that interests me".
Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP, architect David Adjaye, and human rights campaigner Baroness Campbell of Surbiton will also each edit a programme.
Former No 10 adviser Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur, will take over the role of business editor across the week.
Sir Bradley, who will act as editor on Tuesday 29 December, will meet children inspired to start cycle racing by his victories.
During the programme he will also speak to former footballer, and Match of the Day presenter, Gary Lineker about his career after retiring from sport.
"I don't know anything about politics or economic policy. But I've listened to a lot of people having a good old moan over the years. You meet interesting characters when you're out on a bike," Sir Bradley said.
"I told them I'd do this show if I could shine the spotlight on stuff that interests me.
"Like did London 2012 do any good? Where is the next generation of Bradley Wiggins going to come from? What actually happens to you when you retire? And why should anyone bother to vote for politicians?"

Tuesday 29 December - Sir Bradley Wiggins

The guest editors will take responsibility for their edition of the show with the support of Today producers and reporters.
Jamie Angus, editor of the Today Programme, said: "It's fantastic to have Bradley leading out the programme and to hear his take on the impact of sport on British culture."
He said guest editors were "a great Christmas tradition" for the show.
Public figures have been invited to run the current affairs programme between Christmas and New Year since 2003.
Previous guests include Sir Lenny Henry, Prof Stephen Hawking, Yoko Ono and Sir Richard Branson.
