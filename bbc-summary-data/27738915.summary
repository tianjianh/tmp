Hundreds of people had to leave their homes after officers were alerted to a suspicious car in Fishponds at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
A bomb disposal team carried out a number of controlled explosions on the car. No explosives were found but the car had been "doused in fuel".
Avon and Somerset Police said the man was in custody for questioning.
A police spokesman said they were "continuing to support the local community" and said 13 police cadets had taken part in "reassurance foot patrols" in the Cassell Road area on Wednesday.
