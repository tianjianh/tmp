The 25-year-old Guinea international has agreed a three-year deal with the Championship club.
"This was not easy, but we are very happy to find this boy and do this business," R's boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told the club website.
"I see him as an out-an-out striker. He is going to come in and fight against Sebastian Polter and Conor Washington."
Sylla, who has previously had spells with Le Mans and Zulte Waregem, becomes QPR's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.
Meanwhile, 21-year-old Rangers goalkeeper Joe Lumley has signed a new three-year contract at Loftus Road.
