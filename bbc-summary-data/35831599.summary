The investment will fund an Economics Centre of Excellence and a Data Science Campus at its headquarters.
The ONS said the money would support the initiatives over the next two years.
The new hub would "cement the status of the Welsh site as the home of the UK's economic statistics", it added.
The Economics Centre of Excellence will enable the ONS to work with leading academics and experts on "cutting-edge research" while the Data Science Campus will act as a hub for the whole of government.
