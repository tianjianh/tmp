James Ward-Prowse scored a brilliant 25-yard curled free-kick and a penalty for his first goals of the season as Saints cruised into a half-time lead.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis made two attacking changes at the break but the home side remained in charge.
Serbian forward Dusan Tadic sealed the three points from a tight angle after a clever pass from Matt Targett.
Ronald Koeman's Southampton move up to 10th in the Premier League table, while the Baggies stay 13th.

Reaction to all of Saturday's games
Shane Long and Sadio Mane sparkled up front for Southampton, Tadic made a brilliant contribution with his goal, while last season's top scorer Graziano Pelle was on the bench.
Before you even get to midfielder Ward-Prowse's two goals, the signing of Charlie Austin from QPR certainly leaves the Saints with plenty of scoring options.
Austin was watching on from the stands, and will have been delighted with what he saw from his new team-mates, who played with real fluency and verve going forward.
The only minor concern for Austin could be over how regularly he will fit into a team that appears to have rediscovered the qualities that drove them into a seventh-place finish last season.
"We like to make the squad stronger, and that means Charlie in, nobody out," Koeman said.
"We're looking forward to having more competition. That will be good. Will someone be sold? No. Nobody is for sale in January."
The Baggies' showing at St Mary's was a world away from the dogged away performance that earned a 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Wednesday.
There was little of the determined harrying that unsettled the home side at Stamford Bridge, with Southampton at times afforded far too much time on the ball.
The highlight of the away side's opening 45 minutes was a back-heeled clearance off the goalline by James McClean to block Targett's low shot - denying the 20-year-old a deserved goal for his excellent overall performance.
In West Brom's defence there was an improvement after Pulis' attack-minded substitutions at the break, but Southampton were intelligent in the way they protected the lead, and ruthless in the way they extended it.
Southampton manager Ronald Koeman: "Ward-Prowse's early free-kick opened the game. It gave us confidence, meant we could control the game.

"It's important to score early against a side like West Brom, as it gives you the patience to try and score the second. At 1-0, we could be more patient.
"Now we are back playing our own way, how we like to play. Everyone looked very comfortable today - that's the most important thing. The players looked more confident than they have done recently. We totally deserved the win."
West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "You've got to give Southampton credit, they were the better team and deserved to win the game.

"It would be interesting to see how many teams played away midweek and then picked up points away from home this weekend, because our players did look leggy.
"It just wasn't our day. All season we've done well away from home. Today we didn't and got punished."
West Brom play away at Bristol City in an FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday before hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.
Southampton's next match is at Manchester United in the league, also on Saturday.
