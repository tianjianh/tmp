[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers are investigating the possibility of constructing up to 14 turbines on a site between St John's Town of Dalry and Carsphairn.
North Galloway Wind Energy, a subsidiary of West Coast Energy, claims Knocknalling wind farm could generate 44.8MW of energy over its 25-years.
A scoping report for the project has been submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
It has laid out plans to erect the 150m (492ft) tall turbines over a 12-month construction period.
A spokesman for West Coast Energy confirmed that they have begun to survey the area.
He added: "This is a standard procedure that is carried out by the business on a range of sites across the UK to assess the viability or otherwise of developing a project on that site.
"The carrying out of this work in no way constitutes a statement of intent regarding future development.
"Any local people who are affected by the assessment activities are urged to contact West Coast Energy by email at communication@westcoastenergy.co.uk."
