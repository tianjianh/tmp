Ahmad, currently the head of Madagascar's FA, had already outlined his intention to challenge long-standing Caf ruler Issa Hayatou in March's elections in Ethiopia.
Cosafa announced their backing for Ahmad following a meeting of FA Presidents in Johannesburg on Saturday.
In a statement, Cosafa also announced they would only support sitting FA presidents vying for Caf or Fifa elections.
"This was our first meeting since the new executive was voted into office and we are happy with the resolutions taken by the Council which I think will change the face of the region," said Cosafa President, Dr Phillip Chiyangwa.
Issa Hayatou, who has presided over African football since 1988, is seeking an eighth term.
The Cameroonian was re-elected unopposed during the last Caf presidential elections in 2013.
He had previously stated this term would be his last until a change of regulations altered his stance.
In 2015, Caf voted to change the statutes which previously stopped officials serving past the age of 70.
