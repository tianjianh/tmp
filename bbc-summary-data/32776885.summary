Campaigners opposing a wind farm in a north Wales forest have vowed to fight on after being told their judicial review bid was put in a day too late.

RWE Innogy wants to build 32 turbines in Clocaenog Forest near Llyn Brenig in Denbighshire.
The 'late' technical challenge to the legal hearing was raised only after the judge spent two days listening to arguments at Mold Law Courts.
Resident Michael Williams and 10 other people are looking at their options.
A RWE Innogy spokesman said: "The project will create an opportunity for significant community, environmental and energy benefits.
"Clocaenog Forest Wind Farm could support an injection of up to Â£40m into Wales' supply chain during construction alone.
"We are aware that a legal challenge against a decision by the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change to grant planning permission, was dismissed by The High Court.
"However, we understand that a request to appeal that decision has since been submitted."
The judge had reserved judgment when he received a letter from lawyers representing the energy company claiming that Mr Williams had put his claim in too late.
The campaigner said he has now been told that the date has been amended but the judge in the case has refused to reveal what his ruling would have been.
The legal action was launched after the UK energy secretary approved the turbines last September.
