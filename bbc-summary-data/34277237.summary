Eastleigh train derailment: Services return to normal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail services have resumed after passengers faced hours of disruption caused by a derailed train in Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An empty CrossCountry passenger train came off the tracks at Eastleigh and blocked lines through the station.
It was eventually cleared and moved to a nearby depot. Services are returning to normal with small residual delays.
South West Trains had feared cancellations and delays would continue until 18:00 BST.
The operator said fewer services were able to run while the derailed train was recovered.
CrossCountry said its train, which had not yet entered service, was involved in a "minor low-speed derailment" that caused issues with signalling arrangements in the area.
It was eventually put back on the tracks and taken to a nearby depot. An investigation has been started .
