Casey, 39, fired a five-under-par 66 to go 10 under overall at the halfway stage alongside American Jimmy Walker, while Justin Rose is on seven under.
Rory McIlroy made seven birdies in a four-under-par 67 to lie four under, while Graeme McDowell missed the cut.
World number one Jason Day joined Luke Donald and nine others on one under.
Open champion and automatic Ryder Cup pick Henrik Stenson made the cut despite a round to forget.
He started with a double bogey followed by dropped shots on the fourth, fifth, 11th and 13th for a round of 70, and finished on four under overall.
The cut, at one under, also claimed the likes of Americans Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson, and Scotland's Martin Laird.
The Championship is the second of the four that make up the season-ending FedEx Cup.
The tournament features the top 100 players in the world. The top 70 after this weekend will progress to next week's BMW Championship, where the field will be whittled down to 30 for the Tour Championship on 22-25 September.
