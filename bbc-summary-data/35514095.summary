Chelsea: Guus Hiddink says possession statistics are overrated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink is more concerned about what his team does with the ball than how much possession they have.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Sunday, Chelsea play a Manchester United side managed by Hiddink's fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal.
United have been criticised by shirt sponsors Adidas for their possession-based tactics this season.
Hiddink said: "You must not overrate the amount of possession. Most teams want the ball. What do you do with it?"
Hiddink added: "Say we had 65, 67 and 70% possession, but our opponents said, 'We don't care how much possession you have, we have the score on our side'.
"Do you secure your way of playing? Or do you go as soon as possible into the attack? I prefer the latter option. The first thought must be vertical."
