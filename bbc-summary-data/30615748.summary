[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Businesses in part of Shrewsbury have been flooded for the second time in as many weeks after a water main burst.

It happened shortly before 08:00 GMT on Roman Road, causing several properties to flood around the junction with Upper Road.
Dozens of homes in the area were also left without water, but Severn Trent said they had since been reconnected.
The firm apologised to those affected and said the pipe would be repaired overnight.
Robin Philpott, from Pritchards vehicle rental, said it was the fourth time the road had flooded in recent years and something needed to be done to prevent future problems.
As well as damage to the property, Mr Philpott said repairs also meant diversions and road closures, leaving the area like a "ghost town".
Two weeks ago, Clive Pratt, the owner of E A Downes & Sons Ltd, said damage caused by the pipe was expected to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Sarah McArthur, from Severn Trent, said its loss adjustors would be in touch with businesses and roads would remain passable throughout repairs, although there would be lane closures.
Local resident Steven Kirby said: "We've got two kids and have no water at the moment.
"This is the third or fourth time it's probably happened in a year.
"Last time they said they would sort it out as soon as they can. And fair dos they did, within a day. But it keeps happening in the same place, so obviously there's an inherent problem there."
Ms McArthur said the latest burst was in the same section of pipe and there was a long-term plan to replace it.
