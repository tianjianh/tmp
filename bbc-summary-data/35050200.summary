An explosion at a bungalow may have been caused by an aerosol canister catching light, firefighters have said.

The property in Elliots Drive, Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, was almost completely destroyed in the blast at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday.
A man in his 80s was left with burns.
The lighter refill, which contained butane gas, "exploded with enough force to take out an entire corner of the wall," Essex Fire and Rescue Service said.

John Mann, the son of the man caught up in the explosion, said at first he thought his father had died.
"My dad was sitting in his chair with his hair on fire," he told the BBC.
"I could see right inside the house, the roof was on the ground and my dad was just sitting there... I realised he was alive, but it was horrific."
Firefighters believe there was a small fire which involved the canister, causing it to explode.
"The man has had a very lucky escape. He suffered burns but it could have been a lot worse," said Assistant Divisional Officer Costa Olymbios.
"We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the cause but at this stage the fire appears to be accidental."
