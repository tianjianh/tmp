He returns to the bus, and the two men continue to trade insults.
Andy Campbell, managing director of Stagecoach East, confirmed a bus driver had been suspended.
"We understand on-street video footage of part of the incident has subsequently been posted on social media", he said.
The company will launch its own investigation, and help police with their enquiries, he added.
Norfolk Police said they were called to Prince of Wales Road just before 16:00 BST on Wednesday.
They located one of the men when they arrived at the scene and were appealing for witnesses.
