East Riding of Yorkshire report into December tidal surge accepted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report into December's tidal surge has said the Environment Agency should consider a "thorough review" of flood prediction and warning procedures.

East Riding of Yorkshire Council's Flood Investigation Report said it should look at "possible improvements to the timeliness" of warnings.
On the east coast, 1,400 properties flooded and 18,000 people evacuated.
Joe Noake of the Environment Agency said: "We are continually reviewing how we respond to such incidents."
The tidal surge saw "exceptionally high levels" not experienced for at least 60 years and the agency's defences and warning systems helped "reduce the impact significantly", he added.
The recommendation was one of eight in the report, accepted by the council's cabinet.
In the East Riding, 300 properties (69 commercial and 231 residential) were directly affected by flooding and an estimated 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) of agricultural land flooded, it said.
The estimated damage was less than 1% of what it could have been without flood defences, the report said.
The water level at the Hull tidal barrier reached a record level during the surge - just 16ins (40cm) below the top.
The report also recommends property owners in the affected areas should develop a personal flood plan.
During the surge, there was significant flooding at various locations including Bridlington, Skipsea, Hornsea, Tunstall, Easington, Kilnsea, Paull, Hessle, North Ferriby, Faxfleet, Blacktoft, Yokefleet, Saltmarshe, Skelton, Old Goole and Reedness.
Hull city centre was also flooded.
Mr Noake said the Environment Agency had undertaken "significant works" to many flood defences including Riverside Quay in Hull, Swinefleet and Reedness, Yorkfleet Clough and Kilnsea.
Most flooding occurred when the water rose higher than the defences at high tide.
Flooding first affected commercial properties in Bridlington Harbour, as the high tide passed south down the coast.
