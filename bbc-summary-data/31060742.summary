High-powered cannabis factory lamps seized by police have been put to use by Leeds Rhinos to grow some grass of their own - on the pitch.

The rugby league club was given about 50 lights and transformers that were confiscated in a raid on a cannabis farm in north-west Leeds on Tuesday.
West Yorkshire Police said the move would save the force and club money.
Head groundsman Ryan Golding said: "The lights will certainly be put to good use, especially at this time of year."
He added: "We have a great relationship with the police, especially through the work of the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and this just further grows those links."
If they had not been given to the club, the lamps would have been thrown away, PC Kevin Hussey said.
"When I found that we could donate equipment seized from cannabis farms to local groups I discussed it with their head groundsman to see how we might be able to help them out," he said.
"Previously, we would have to pay to hire skips to dispose of all the equipment but this way we can save money and see something that criminals have been using in the illegal drugs trade put to a positive use in the local community."
Unused soil and pots from the raided house were donated to Brudenell Primary School for its community garden.
A man has been charged with cannabis production and immigration offences.
