There has been little improvement in the maternal mortality rate over the past few decades and according to Unicef, 732 mothers die for every 100,000 live births.
In one hospital in the capital, Mogadishu, a group of young female surgeons are fighting to save one mother at a time.
The hospital lacks basic resources and staff have not received salaries since April but they are still determined to do what they can to save Somalia's mothers.
BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre.
