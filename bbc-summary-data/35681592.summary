[SN]TITLE[SN]
Researchers seek Henry VII's Pembroke Castle birthplace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Details of the exact location of Henry VII's birthplace at Pembroke Castle could be uncovered by researchers using geophysical techniques.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Much of the interior of the castle, which dates from the 11th Century, was destroyed after the Middle Ages.
Archaeologists hope methods such as aerial photography and radar will reveal its secrets, including a chamber block where Henry may have been born.
A Castle Studies Trust grant will help pay for the research.
Aerial photographs taken in 2013 have given glimpses of what lies beneath the surface, with parch marks showing the outline of a number of possible buildings.
Dyfed Archaeology Trust will carry out the work.
