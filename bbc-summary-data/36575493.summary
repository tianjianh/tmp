[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Sheen has said he has not infected any sexual partners with HIV since his diagnosis.

The actor discussed his sexual history in an interview with Piers Morgan during a one-off show at London's Theatre Royal Drury Lane.
Asked if he had had unprotected sex since finding out he was HIV positive, Sheen said: "I never did.
"Because I wouldn't do that to someone. I would not. How could I explain it later?"
His claims contradict allegations from previous sexual partners that he had unprotected sex with them despite knowing he was HIV positive.
But the actor told Morgan: "No one has been infected by me. No one."
Referring to previous partners, Sheen said: "They claim the sorrow and the pity or whatever, but that's on them, and again I know the truth."
The former Two And A Half Men actor only went public with his diagnosis in November, but confirmed he had been diagnosed several years ago.
Asked what his immediate reaction to the diagnosis was, Sheen said: "I thought no, no, wrong, please double check all the tests. Even among all the chaos you always think 'that'll just happen to somebody else'."
But despite claiming not to have had unprotected sex since his diagnosis - Sheen admitted he had not always told his partners about his sexually transmitted infection (STI).
"The only couple of times I didn't tell somebody was because the last 25 times I'd told somebody, they used it against me, and they used my medical condition for their own folly and financial gain," he said.
Programmes handed out to audience members on the night claimed the actor has spent more than Â£7m on "hush money" in recent years - paid to former partners who alleged they contracted HIV from him before threatening to go public.
Sheen told Morgan: "The number of despicable charlatans that I thought were allies, that then turned against me, they were coming out of the woodwork, it was crazy."
The son of Hollywood veteran Martin Sheen got his big break in 1986 in Oliver Stone's Vietnam movie Platoon.
He later appeared in Two and A Half Men, a sitcom for which he was reportedly paid around $1.8m (Â£1.23m) per episode towards the end of his run on the show.
An Evening With Charlie Sheen saw the actor in conversation with Morgan, a former editor of the Daily Mirror, before taking questions from the audience.
The show started late, only lasted an hour and had a technical hitch when the opening video montage of Sheen's career did not play.
Morgan asked him about his career and recent troubles, before handing the questions over to the floor.
The audience questions were mixed- ranging from "What's your next big project?" to "Will you marry me?"
His declined the latter offer by saying: "Nothing personal when you suck that badly at something, like I do with marriage... I wouldn't do that to you."
Asked by Morgan what the best movie he has ever made is, Sheen replied he "hasn't made it yet".
When one fan asked: "Are you still winning?" Sheen replied: "I mean, you all showed up tonight didn't you?"
One audience member asked what he would want written on his tomb stone. Before Sheen had a chance to answer, an audience member shouted: "Winning!" - a reference to the series of interviews the actor gave in 2011, where he claimed to be a "warlock" with "tiger blood" who was "winning" in life.
Sheen agreed this would be an appropriate epitaph.
The actor abruptly left Two and A Half Men in 2011 during a breakdown. He was replaced on the show by Ashton Kutcher for a few years before the series ended last February.
Admitting his regret about his sudden departure from the show, Sheen told Morgan he would behave differently if he had his time again.
The actor also touched on US politics, and in particular the prospect of Republican candidate Donald Trump becoming president in November.
Sheen suggested Trump's current success is down to "people responding to something different, fresh, innovative and maverick."
"No judgement. If he gets in I've got to support him and hope he does the best job he can," the actor said.
"If he doesn't, then that was a hell of a run... I guess the people will get what they deserve."
