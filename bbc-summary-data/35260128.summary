When Geoff Bainbridge joined the RAF, he didn't know what a crucial part he would play as a pilot.

Geoff, who is now 92 and lives in Portrush, served as a wireless operator on a number of different aircraft, including the very first Vulcan Bomber.
He was also a crew member of the plane which was loaded with an atomic bomb during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
"We were sitting close to the runway loaded with an atomic bomb ready to go," he said.
"One always has at the back of one's mind that you would never have to go, but in those four minutes there is no telling what you were thinking," he said.
"It horrifies me to think that I might have been involved should it have occurred over here."
Geoff was also part of the team which saw the Vulcan Bomber go through the sound barrier.
"The day after we delivered the first Vulcan into service 60 years ago, we did intensive flying trials.
"It meant when we broke the sound barrier we had to do it way off the Scilly Isles so we didn't break any glass," he said.
"An inexperienced pilot could lose control, but in experienced hands you don't go beyond that."
