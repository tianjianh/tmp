Tour de Romandie: Britain's Simon Yates second as Richie Porte wins on final stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Simon Yates had to settle for second place overall in the Tour de Romandie after Sunday's final stage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bury-born rider went into the 17.9km time trial leading by 19 seconds from BMC's Richie Porte after victory on Saturday.
But Orica-Scott rider Richie Porte took 40 seconds out of Yates in Lausanne, to clinch the overall title by 21 seconds.
Team Sky's Chris Froome, who fell out of contention on Saturday, finished 18th overall.
Australian Porte's time of 25 minutes and six seconds in the battle against the clock was good enough for second on the fifth and final stage, with LottoNL-Jumbo's Primoz Roglic winning in a time of 24:58.
Time-trialling is a major weakness for Yates, 24, as he aims to mature into a Grand Tour contender, and his time was only good enough for 12th place.
The six-day, five-stage race is regarded as an early indicator of form before the Tour de France in July.
