Glenavon had taken the lead on 34 minutes when Kyle Neill's corner went straight in at the far post.
Kirk Millar and Andrew Waterworth scored two to put Linfield 3-1 up with Kris Lindsay pulling one back.
Glenavon pulled level when Andy Kilmartin's shot was deflected by team-mate Eoin Bradley but Mark Haughey got the winner with a deflected header.
Linfield's Kirk Millar: "We made it hard for ourselves in the end but Mark Haughey dug us out with a header for the winner.
"We should have had the game won before that and we made it harder than it should have been.
"It was about time I hit the net. I had to make the run because you know a player of Niall Quinn's quality will deliver the ball.
"Andrew Waterworth is just a natural goalscorer and he gave us the edge in the first half."
