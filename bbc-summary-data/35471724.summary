A new BBC series, Earth's Greatest Spectacles, explores three of the most seasonally changeable landscapes on the planet - Svalbard, Okavango and New England.

The first episode looks at the colourful forests of New England, on the east coast of the US, where the vivid greens of summer give way to the golds and reds of autumn.
This programme revels in the full glory of the spectacle, and reveals how this vibrant fiesta is created by the battles between the trees and the forests' inhabitants.
Moose, chipmunks, rattlesnakes and a bizarre mixture of caterpillars all play a crucial role.
But, surprisingly, the forest itself was made so colourful thanks to the hard work of a combination of beavers, ants and humans.
Here, we present a few images of some of the moments explored in the film.
Earth's Greatest Spectacles can be seen on BBC 2 on Friday 5 February 2016.
