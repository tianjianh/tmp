75 people attend a pro-Europe gathering in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 75 people have gathered in Cardiff city centre calling for stronger ties with the European Union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Organisers March for Europe said a stronger connection "makes Britain stronger".
Geraint Talfan Davies, of Wales Stronger in Europe, said Brexit had caused "uncertainty" but Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said everyone needed to "come together".
Similar events were held across the UK.
Those attending the event sought to put pressure on the UK Government to pause invoking Article 50 following the vote for Brexit.
It comes two days before Parliament reopens after summer recess, with MPs set to debate a petition calling for a second EU referendum.
