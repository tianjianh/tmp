The Great Farm Challenge encourages pupils at agricultural colleges to tackle environmental issues.
The latest competition, encouraging students to look at protecting water courses from pesticides, ends in December.
The Environment Agency, which organises the event, has been encouraged by its success and hopes to roll it out.
Pupils at Warwickshire College, South Staffordshire College and Walford & North Shropshire College are taking part.
Severn Trent Water and Natural England also support the competition which is in its second year.
