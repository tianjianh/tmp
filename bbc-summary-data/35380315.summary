The FTSE 100 index added 126.22 points, or 2.2%, to close at 5,900.01, after rising 1.8% on Thursday.
Markets had been lifted by hints from the European Central Bank on Thursday that it might introduce fresh measures at its meeting in March.
Speculation of more stimulus action in Japan also lifted sentiment.
Reports that the Bank of Japan could introduce fresh measures helped Japan's Nikkei index to jump by nearly 6% on Friday.
Markets have also been encouraged by a recovery in oil prices, which had hit 12-year lows earlier in the week.
Brent crude was up $2.19 at $31.44 a barrel, while US crude was $2.06 higher at $31.59.
The rise in oil prices lifted shares in energy-related firms in London. Royal Dutch Shell was up 5.2% and BG Group climbed 5%.
On the currency markets, the pound was up by nearly a cent against the dollar at $1.4305, and it rose by more than one euro cent against the euro to â‚¬1.3212.
