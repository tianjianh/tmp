The 29-year-old returned to her club in Edinburgh after her success in the -70kg judo class.
"Tokyo is definitely on my mind," she told BBC Scotland.
"But I am just going to take every year as it comes, be the best I can be and just enjoy the moment."
Bristol-born Conway is looking forward to taking a rare break from competitive judo.
"I am just giving myself time to relax and soak up the atmosphere and just enjoy it," she said.
"We compete so often and don't get to enjoy our wins too often because we are always looking towards the next competition.
"But this was the biggest one for me - it is my dream come true - so I am going to enjoy it and concentrate on next year when it comes."
Conway was delighted with her reception at Edinburgh Judo Club.
"I didn't expect to be that emotional," she said. "I am so happy with the support and messages I have had and this just tops it off.
"When I walked in with all the bagpipes playing and saw everybody, I just welled up. That support is unbelievable."
Conway said her medal was a team effort and praised the role of her coach, Billy Cusack.
"He and I have gone through a lot together and I am so happy I could bring home this bronze medal, not just for myself but him and everyone else who has supported me," she added.
"It is like a family here. Everyone is so friendly and so happy when you do well.
"It is such a fantastic club to come into. The atmosphere is so good and I am just happy to come back."
