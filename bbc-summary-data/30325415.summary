South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire people have festive cash worries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than half of people in South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire are worried about the cost of Christmas, a survey suggests.

Figures indicate that 15% of people were very concerned while 37% were fairly concerned, about their spending.
The average cost in the area is expected to be £497.23, the highest after North Yorkshire at £508.82.
The figures also suggest 13% of people could resort to borrowing, more than twice the level in other areas.
Across the county, North Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, 50% of people surveyed for the BBC said they were concerned about their festive spending.
Concern is highest amongst those aged 18-34 and those with children under 18.
Jane Symonds, money expert at the Money Advice Service, said: "Christmas can be an expensive time of year, but it's important to know that you don't have to live beyond your means to make it a fun time. A big financial hangover is the last thing anyone wants to start the new year with.
"Planning ahead by looking carefully at costs will help you to take control of your spending and reduce some of the pressure. It's best to avoid credit if you can, but if you need to borrow there are more options if you think ahead."
Across all the areas surveyed, of those planning to borrow 68% said they would use their credit card, 18% plan to ask friends and family for help, 18% will use their overdraft, 6% will go to a pay day lender, 6% will take out a loan, and 2% say they will go to a credit union.
On average people said they expected to borrow about £180.
On average, men said they were likely to borrow £214.76 while women said they expected to borrow about £146.36.
More than half of all borrowers said it would take them between a few weeks to a year to repay their debt.

Financial advisers say it is never too late to draw up a budget for your Christmas spending.
Those who get into trouble often forget to factor in those little extras that add to the festive bill.
So, as well as presents, food and travel, advisers urge families not to ignore the cost of replacing decorations, calling relatives and even taking the children to Santa's grotto.
They suggest shopping around on the internet for all these things to get the best deal.
Those who turn to credit may be deferring the pain, but missing repayments in the new year could start or continue a debt spiral that may be difficult to pull out of.
Instead, advisers say, keep things under control this year, and start saving now to bring some Christmas 2015 cheer to your family and your finances.
Market research agency ComRes interviewed 1,270 people across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, of which 501 were in West Yorkshire, 305 were in South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, 335 in North Yorkshire, 179 in East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire and 189 in Lincolnshire.
The online survey was carried out for BBC Radio Sheffield between 27 November and 1 December.
