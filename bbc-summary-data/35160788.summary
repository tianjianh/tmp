The 57-year-old's body was found at about 08:55 GMT close to the foot of an open staircase which led to the roof at the Halewood plant on Merseyside.
He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics, police said.
A spokeswoman said a post-mortem examination would take place but his death was being treated as "explained" and was not believed to be suspicious.
A file will be prepared for the coroner and relatives of the man, who has not been named, have been informed.
An investigation led by Merseyside Police and involving the Health and Safety Executive has been launched.
A police spokesman said: "It is believed the victim may have been on the roof of a building prior to being found injured on the floor."
A statement from Jaguar Land Rover said the victim was working for a "contractor organisation", but declined to reveal the name of his employer or the nature of his work.
"We can confirm that a colleague from a contractor organisation was found seriously injured on site at Halewood operations," the statement said.
"The circumstances surrounding this incident are not yet clear and is now the subject of an investigation by Merseyside Police.
"We can confirm that this incident was outside the factory and is not related to vehicle manufacturing."
