Thousands of leaflets containing life-saving information are being given out to inexperienced fell walkers.

Last year teams carried out 480 rescues - a fall of 10% compared to 2015,  but the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association (LDSMRA) said the figure is too high.
This week its volunteers have been giving out 9,000 copies of Stay Safe on the Cumbrian Fells.
Volunteers are giving out 2,000 more copies over Easter.
They are also leaving copies in tourist offices and shops.
Richard Warren, chairman of LDSMRA, said: "These safety leaflets are primarily targeting those people who perhaps need a little bit of help in preparing themselves for their outings onto the fells, many of whom won't have been high up on a mountain before."
He said the leaflet is a simple, step-by-step guide to remind people what they should do before they set out on the fells - and what to do if they have an accident.
It costs around Â£500,000 a year to run the county's 12 rescue teams which are funded through voluntary donations.
