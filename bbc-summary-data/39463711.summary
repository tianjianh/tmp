[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-1 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton maintained their place in the League Two play-offs following a 1-0 victory over a youthful Barnet side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hatters claimed a first away win in a month thanks to Olly Lee's strike midway through the second half.
Both sides created early half-chances in an open game but it was Bees striker John Akinde who spurned the two best opportunities of the first half.
He twice found himself one-on-one with Stuart Moore and on both occasions failed to roll it past him, and the sides went in goalless with Barnet in the ascendancy.
Moore had to be his very best to deny Mauro Vilhete with an hour gone, clawing the diminutive midfielder's header out of the top corner.
But Luton took the lead against the run of play in the 65th minute, the ball falling kindly for Lee in the penalty area and the former Bees midfielder slotted the ball home from 12 yards.
Barnet's best chance of an equaliser fell to Akinde again with just two minutes left but the striker headed wide from eight yards out.
