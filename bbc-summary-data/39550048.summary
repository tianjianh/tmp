[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ellis Harrison's 75th-minute winner was enough for Bristol Rovers to deny Oldham Athletic League One safety as they recorded a narrow victory at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker hammered home a low right-footed shot from 15 yards out after Byron Moore's pass across the box had created the opportunity. It proved the decisive moment of a low-key contest.
Both goalkeepers made fine second-half saves, Oldham's Connor Ripley keeping out a stinging drive from Stuart Sinclair and Rovers' Joe Lumley diving to keep out a Lee Erwin volley.
A drab first half featured nothing more than long-range efforts from both teams. Rovers midfielder Billy Bodin produced two of them, but on each occasion was denied by Ripley.
Harrison also brought a save from Ripley, while - at the other end - Oldham's Tope Obadeyi fired straight at Lumley and as Erwin shot wide.
Rovers edged a close contest and left Oldham with nothing to show for a spirited performance.
