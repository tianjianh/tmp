[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Edward Heath's Arundells home in Salisbury reopens to public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Salisbury home of former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath is to reopen to the public later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arundells in Cathedral Close, where Sir Edward lived for the last 20 years of his life, was left to the nation and first opened to the public in 2008.
The foundation which owns it then wanted to sell it but the sale was blocked by the Charity Commission.
In February, Wiltshire Council granted permission for the house to reopen for three years from 26 March.
After opening in 2008, Arundells attracted more than 45,000 visitors in less than four years but trustees of the Edward Heath Charitable Foundation said it was not financially viable to keep open.
The foundation agreed to test the "feasibility of a three-year business plan" following the Charity Commission's ruling in September.
