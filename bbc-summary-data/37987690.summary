Queensferry Crossing towers all connected

The Queensferry Crossing is a step closer to completion after engineers connected all three of its towers.

The latest decklift means the remaining gap is about 50m - the equivalent of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
The next stage of work involves using ballast and adjusting cables to ensure the height is aligned and ready for the final closure of the two sections.
Work on the final stage is set for January with the bridge connecting Edinburgh and Fife due to open in May.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: "Connecting all three of the Queensferry Crossing towers, from Fife right over to the south deck fan is another example of the good progress being made on the project.
"Despite the huge size and weight of the units being lifted, lifting them into place is a very precise operation.
"This is truly world class engineering taking place to bridge the Firth of Forth for the third time in consecutive centuries.
"Successfully building the new bridge and the road network requires careful planning and delivery of over 10,000 operations.
"The workforce continue to do an excellent job in often very tough conditions."
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) project director, said: "In total, we will have four principal deck closures on the Queensferry Crossing.
"Earlier this year, we closed the gap between the North Tower deck span and the northern approach viaduct.
"Then, in October, we achieved closure between the Centre and South Tower deck spans.
"We have now lifted the Centre Tower/North Tower closure section into place and work is on-going to fix it permanently into position.
"We are continuing to make considerable progress on the project as a whole. In fact, for the first time we can say that the three towers and their decks are now connected directly to Fife.
"The focus now is on achieving the technically challenging final closure between the South Tower and the southern approach viaduct which is planned for early in the new year."
