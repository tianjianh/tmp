[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Day three wash-out for Leicestershire and Gloucestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rain prevented any play on the third day between Leicestershire and Gloucestershire at Grace Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Umpires Steve Garratt and Nigel Cowley took the decision to abandon play shortly before 12:30 BST.
Gloucestershire are 69-0 in their first innings, replying to a score of 334 all out by the home side.
A draw now seems inevitable unless the two teams agree on declarations to leave Gloucestershire with a second-innings target.
