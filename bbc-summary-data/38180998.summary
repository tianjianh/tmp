CalMac ferry 'turns on' Ullapool's Christmas lights

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry has "switched on" Ullapool's Christmas lights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MV Loch Seaforth's horn was sounded as it left the village late on Thursday afternoon, signalling the turning on of the lights.
Ullapool has not had a community Christmas lights display before.
The village's display has been organised by community group Ullapool Fire and Light Fund and will feature a Christmas tree created from creels.
The creel tree stands about 16ft tall and has been constructed almost entirely of creels normally used for catching prawns or crabs.
Thursday's switch-on included lights appearing on yachts, dinghies and fishing boats in Ullapool harbour. The display has been funded by a grant and donations.
