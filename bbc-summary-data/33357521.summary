Former Met chief Blair warns of 'lone wolf' threat

The threat of a terror attack by a "lone wolf" is "a huge problem" for the UK security services, a former Met Police commissioner has said.

Lord Blair, who was in charge at the time of the 7/7 bombings, told the BBC "a single individual with no previous contact" was now the biggest concern.
He said it made it all the more vital to work with the Muslim community.
"Only the community can give the police that first clue that there is something odd going on in that house," he said.
Lord Blair, who is now a crossbench peer, was the country's most senior police officer between 2005 and 2008.
He oversaw the Met's response to the 7 July 2005 attacks in which 52 people were killed by suicide bombers on three Underground trains and a bus.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the attacks, Lord Blair said the threat had "in some ways lessened" since then "because the security services and the police have been able to develop techniques which have thwarted a lot".
"But as it evolves into what is sometimes called 'lone wolf', 'clean skin', that is a huge problem, because the more people you have in a conspiracy the more chances are somebody is going to find out about it," he continued.
"If you are just a single individual with no previous contact, then that is a very big problem to solve which is why the role of the community is so important because only the community can give the police that first clue that there is something odd going on in that house."
He added: "It is still this horrible sense of a random threat sitting out there somewhere, as in Tunisia, if you just happened to be on the beach, in the wrong place at the wrong time."
Lord Blair said he did not believe the West would be able to defeat the threat from Islamic extremism in his lifetime.
David Cameron has accused some Muslim communities of "quietly condoning" extremist ideology instead of confronting it, and said they must shoulder some blame for young Britons choosing to join Islamic State.
The prime minister said the UK should be more "intolerant of intolerance".
However, Lord Blair cautioned against taking a firmer line on religious fundamentalism - although he denied he was criticising the government's approach.
"Some people might argue we must take a much tougher approach, but I couldn't agree less with them," he said.
"We have to take a very resolute approach, be resolute in actually requiring and demanding this community works with us... But you don't do it to them, you do it with them."
He continued: "It seems to me we have to accept there are people who live their lives by fundamentalist rulesâ€¦ Fundamentalism in itself is not a matter for the state to interfere with - it's when it slides into violent extremism it is."
