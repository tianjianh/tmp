He was Eamonn Morgan, who was in his early 20s.
Both Qatar GAA club and Bosco club in Newry have paid tribute to Eamonn and his partner Charlotte Sant, from Manchester, who also died.
It is believed they were on a sand buggy that crashed.
In a statement on the Qatar GAA Facebook page, the club's chairman Peter Crowe said: "It's with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of two of our members, two of our friends, two of our family.
"I had the privilege of playing with Eamonn for the past year, an absolute gent, never to be seen without a smile on his face and the definition of a 'character' as we'd say back home.
"I also had the pleasure of training Charlotte for the past year, a sweet girl, who took to a new sport with more enthusiasm than you could ever ask for.
"Eamonn and Charlotte were very much central to the community that is Qatar GAA, and it will be hard to imagine it without them."
Mr Morgan had recently moved to Qatar from Boldon, South Tyneside in England, where he was a PE teacher.
Sinn FÃ©in MP Micky Brady said "a dark shadow hangs over the city" of Newry.
"Our prayers are at this time with both sets of families and friends of the deceased as they try to come to terms with this terrible news," he said.
