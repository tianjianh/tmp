The tweets from the Police Scotland account @InvernessPolice urge people not to fight, drink and drive or steal.
The words include: "He sees you when you're thieving, he knows when you're gonna breach."
Written in the 1930s, Santa Claus is Coming to Town features in Elf, a hugely popular Christmas movie.
It has also been sung in the past by US rocker Bruce Springsteen.
Police Scotland is known for tongue-in-cheek tweets.
They have included a posting about a visit to the Isle of Skye by musician Kanye West and internet craze Pokemon Go.
