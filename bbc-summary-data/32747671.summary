[SN]TITLE[SN]
US surgeon Jayant Patel banned from Australia medicine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Controversial US surgeon Jayant Patel who was at the centre of a high-profile legal case has been banned from practising medicine in Australia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A civil tribunal in Queensland found Dr Patel had lied in order to be registered in the state.
It said he had concealed the fact that he had been sanctioned in the US for unprofessional conduct.
Dr Patel was jailed in 2010 for causing three deaths at a Queensland hospital but was freed in 2012 on appeal.
He received a two-year suspended sentence for fraud in 2013 and later moved back to the US. The Medical Board of Australia had applied for Dr Patel's ban after criminal proceedings ended.
Dr Patel's case stemmed from his time working at a hospital in Queensland between 2003 and 2005.
There were complaints from hospital staff that he had botched operations, misdiagnosed patients and used sloppy surgical techniques.
He was arrested in the US in 2008 and extradited to Australia to stand trial.
He was jailed for seven years in 2010 after being convicted of criminal negligence leading to the deaths of three patients. He was also found guilty of causing harm to another patient.
But in 2012, Australia's highest court quashed the convictions on appeal and retrials were ordered. He was subsequently acquitted in one case and the jury failed to reach a decision in another.
In 2013, prosecutors dropped outstanding charges. He received the suspended sentence for fraud after he admitted to dishonestly obtaining his medical registration.
