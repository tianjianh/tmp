[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Emma Baum was found in her back garden on Llwyndu Road, Penygroes, Gwynedd, on 18 July. She had suffered head injuries.
David Nicholas Davies, 25, of Clynnog, near Caernarfon, admitted the charge at Mold Crown Court, but said he did not accept the full prosecution case.
A hearing where evidence will be called before the judge will take place at Caernarfon Crown Court on 7 November.
The court heard Davies denied using a knife in the attack and said he did not take a weapon to Miss Baum's home.
Judge Keith Thomas told him he would be remanded in custody until the evidence is called in three weeks' time.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating North Wales Police's response to Miss Baum's body being found.
