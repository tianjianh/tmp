An Isle of Man school has paid tribute to an "articulate and confident" teenager who died last Sunday.

14-year-old Harrison Cushing was found hanged at his home in Peel and died later at Noble's hospital in Braddan.
An inquest in Douglas on Friday heard that the child, a Year 9 student at Queen Elizabeth II High School, died from "asphyxia due to hanging".
A school spokesman said Harrison was an "articulate and confident young man" and a "pleasure to teach".
He added: "Harrison had a very keen and quick sense of humour, appreciated by his classmates and teachers alike.
"Anyone who knew Harrison could not fail to like him and he will be very deeply missed by his close friends, his classmates in Year 9, his teachers and the wider school community.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Harrison's family at this very sad and difficult time".
Coroner John Needham has adjourned the inquest to a date yet to be fixed.
Education psychologists are providing professional support at the school for students and staff.
