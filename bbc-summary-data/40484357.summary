The 24-year-old utility back player, who prefers to play at centre, has scored 14 tries in 15 games so far this campaign.
"We're really excited to have captured his signature," Red Devils head coach Ian Watson said.
"He's got a great try-scoring record and deserves the chance to have a crack in Super League."
