The Venezuela international, 25, has agreed a four-year contract to become the Baggies' fifth summer signing.
He will not be eligible for Monday's Premier League match against Manchester City at The Hawthorns (20:00 BST).
"We feel with age on his side and the prices English clubs are asking for their players, it's a deal worth doing," said West Brom boss Tony Pulis.
The club's previous biggest transfer outlay was the £10m they spent on Brown Ideye last summer.
West Brom have already added James McClean, James Chester and Rickie Lambert to their squad, as well as Arsenal's Serge Gnabry on a season-long loan.
Rondon scored 20 goals in 37 appearances for the Russian club last season, and has also played for Rubin Kazan and Malaga.
Pulis said he had spoken to Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini - who managed the striker at Malaga - and former Zenit boss Andre Villas-Boas and that Rondon came "highly recommended".
"He's got a fantastic goalscoring record in some of the top leagues in Europe and for his country," said Pulis. "He's 25 years of age and still to fulfil his full potential.
"We hope he hits the ground running of course but understand it might take him time to settle."
Rondon said: "The club showed a lot of interest in me. That's what is important for a player, what you take into account, and there are expectations of me."
