The Portadown drive took victory in race two from Ash Sutton and team-mate Rob Collard.
Turkington came home second in race one, after struggling to get past the Subaru of Ash Sutton.
Carrying maximum ballast for race three, Turkington held ninth early on before problems for cars ahead saw the 35-year-old collect sixth place.
Sutton won the opening race and took victory in the third race.
Turkington charged past Sutton on the run to the first corner in race two, holding the lead to the end of the race.
The Team BMW driver is now third in the standings, 12 points behind Honda's Gordon Shedden despite being 36 behind at the start of the weekend.
It was a weekend of frustration for Carrick driver Smiley, starting at the back of the grid after qualifying despite showing top-10 pace in practice.
In race one, Smiley  made good progress in race one, moving from 27th up to 20th place.
He continued to make progress in race two, running as high as 16th but he was forced off the track by Jack Goff which resigned the 25-year-old to another 20th place finish.
However, Smiley claimed his best BTCC finish to date by crossing the line in 13th place in the final race with a fantastic drive from 19th on the grid.
Daniel Harper had a muted weekend  in the Ginetta Junior class, collecting a trio of finishes in ninth, sixth and eighth.
James Turkington, younger brother of Colin, was close to making it a double podium success for the family but he could only finish fourth in the MINI Challenge race at Silverstone after sliding wide on the final lap.
He finished 5th in race two with youngster Reece Barr collecting eighth and sixth place finishes.
Fellow Portadown driver Adam Carroll had a quiet weekend in Formula E's double  header in Berlin with 16th and 17th place finishes.
