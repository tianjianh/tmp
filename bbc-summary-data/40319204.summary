A six-year-old boy has gone to the site of the Grenfell Tower fire to donate his pocket money, saying he felt "sad" for the people who had lived there.

Alfie Lindsey visited the west London estate to donate his superhero-themed tin filled with up to Â£70 in cash.
Alfie's dad Arthur said his son wanted to help after watching news about the tragedy on television.
He handed the money over to the Bishop of Kensington, Graham Tomlin, who said the gesture was "absolutely amazing".
"He brought out of his bag this tin... and I said, 'have you been collecting?' and he said, 'no, it is my pocket money'," the bishop said.
"It was absolutely amazing. It is just a little sign of the incredible outpouring of compassion there has been in London as a result of this.
"And in some ways, that is actually what we need, because we are now in a situation where we probably have enough clothing, food and so on, but cash - money -really does help.
He said when he accepted the donation, he promised Alfie it would get to those who needed it.
Alfie, from Hounslow, said he felt "sad" for the people who lived at Grenfell Tower and a "little bit worried".
At least 58 people are now presumed dead or missing, presumed dead following the fire that ravaged the 24-storey tower block in the early hours of Wednesday.
Many others have lost their homes as a result of the blaze, which has gutted the tower and left it charred and virtually destroyed.
Government staff have now been drafted in to bolster the official response to the disaster, following widespread criticism of the local council's performance.
