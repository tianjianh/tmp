Michael Johnston has suffered a vote of no confidence at the annual general meeting of the Kilmarnock Football Club Supporters Association.

Only two of the 80 supporters who attended Saturday's event backed the Killie director to remain in his role.
It comes as a group of disgruntled shareholders are calling for an extraordinary general meeting to vote on Johnston's position at the club.
However, Johnston claimed those efforts would not succeed.
He also reiterated he must remain at the club until 2019 as part of the refinancing deal that saw the club's debt wiped out two years ago.
In a statement KFCSA secretary Iain Sherry said: "In a show of hands, only two supporters from those in attendance indicated their support of him, with the vast majority of the view that Mr Johnston's continued presence at the club is a hindrance to Kilmarnock Football Club moving forward in a united, positive and progressive fashion.
"Mr Johnston stated that, due to the bank deal for debt reduction, even if he was offered Â£1 for every share he owns, he could not sell the shares and leave the club. He categorically stated he could not sell his shareholding until 2019 without significant tax consequences for the club and he planned to continue as a board member.
"He stated that the Board were totally united in opposing any call for an EGM and confirmed that he was speaking on behalf of the other board members as the matter had been discussed at a Board meeting on Tuesday 21st June."
Johnston, who suffered a hostile reception from shareholders at the club's AGM in April, participated in a question and answer session with supporters which lasted almost two-and-a-half hours where he addressed numerous topics including his own position.
The KFCSA statement continued: "He expressed his surprise at the reception he had received at the club's AGM in April this year and could not understand why the instigators of the proposed EGM were seeking such a meeting as it would not succeed in having him removed from the board.
"He gave a long protracted answer stating his achievements at the club during his tenure, both as chairman and director of the club.
"It is the fervent hope of the KFCSA Committee that an amicable solution can be found to this long running situation and that a potentially embarrassing EGM is not required, although this looks increasingly unlikely.
"The Association will actively lobby the board in this regard in the hope that the manager, players and supporters of our great club can concentrate on the team winning football matches rather than being concerned about off-field activities."
