Not enough pilots' for Syria attack, says Madeline Moon

A MP has questioned whether the RAF has the capability to attack so-called Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq.

Bridgend's Madeleine Moon, who sits on the House of Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Wales there were not enough pilots, engineers or navigators to sustain a large air campaign.
She said: "The first question we should ask isn't 'should we do it?' It's 'can we do it?'"
The Ministry of Defence said the RAF could sustain the campaign.
Parliament voted in favour of carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria last week.
Ms Moon will travel to Iraq in the new year with other members of the defence committee as part of a review into the fight against IS.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics show, she said: "We have a lack of pilots, we have a lack of engineers and we have a lack of navigators to actually get the planes in the air.
"People talk about the Typhoons (fighter jets) but the Typhoon can't carry the Brimstone missile which the Americans are so keen to utilise."
The UK has been carrying out air strikes against IS fighters in Iraq since 2013 and according to Ms Moon, 30% of the ground occupied by IS has been won back.
But she has concerns the other 70% is now being discounted as attention turns to Syria.
She said: "We made that same mistake in the past. We were in Afghanistan and in 2001 we went into Iraq and we divided our forces; we split our capability.
"Since then we've had a 30% cut in our armed forces and our armed capabilities and yet we're still thinking we can fight on two fronts. And for me that's not acceptable."
An MoD spokesman said: "The prime minister has already indicated we face a long and challenging campaign against Daesh.
"The RAF has the equipment, skills and personnel to sustain the campaign and will continue to deliver success for as long as it takes.
"Since parliament voted to extend air strikes into Syria, RAF deployment of Typhoons and Tornados has doubled the number of British fighter jets taking the fight to Daesh. The UK is part of a wider international coalition, whose forces have now damaged more than 13,500 targets and taken 30% of Daesh's territory."
