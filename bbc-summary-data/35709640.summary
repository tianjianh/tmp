The Channel Islands' most famous aircraft could be put on display at a Guernsey tourist attraction.

The yellow Trislander G-Joey was retired from service in June after serving the islands, Southampton and Dinard for almost 40 years.
Originally it was thought the aircraft would end up in a museum in England, but late last year talks began to keep it in Guernsey.
If planning permission is given, the plane will be kept at Oatlands Village.
The attraction was bought by Chris Coles last year and he has already asked for planning permission for a refurbishment including repairs to the brick kilns, which date back to the 19th Century, and extending the restaurant.
A further application for three barns, including one to house Joey, will be made if planners agree to remove a 35-year-old planning condition.
Mr Coles said the aim for Joey's World was to provide an "inspirational and educational message to young people" and to "reimagine Joey so that he has universal appeal".
He said he hoped to have a simple simulator for children to try flying between Guernsey and Alderney and provide supervised access to the plane's cockpit.
Mark Darby, CEO of the aircraft's owners Aurigny, said Mr Cole's "enthusiasm for displaying Joey was infectious" and he felt it would be the "perfect home".
He said: "The proposal to store Joey undercover is important because the aircraft must be protected from the elements."
Paul Belben, who is behind the 5,700-strong Save Joey Facebook group, said: "Interesting news that Joey will be housed in a new purpose-built barn, if permission is given.
"[I'm] also looking forward to seeing the arrangements for keeping Joey preserved. It will certainly be a very unique attraction for Guernsey."
