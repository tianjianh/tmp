Europe's largest trainer festival, Crepe City, has been taking place in east London.

Thousands of trainer fans - or sneaker heads - have been braving the cold and rain to queue up at Truman Brewery just off Brick Lane.
They've been buying new shoes from dealers and showing off their favourite pairs with DJs playing hip-hop to the crowd.
Crepe City was founded by trainer fanatics, Ronal Raichura and Paul Smyth, in 2009.
The first event held that year at Notting Hill Arts Club had 10 sellers and around 200 visitors.
Around 2,500 were expected to attend the one-day event in London this year with trainer prices going from anywhere between £20 and £3,500.
There were more than 200 stalls with around 2,000 different shoes for sale.
Jim travelled from the US to attend the event.
He said: "I wear sneakers because I used to look at the basketball players and liked their style. I like to look good and be comfy."
Amar Hayer, 23, was also there looking for a new pair of trainers.
"I like wearing what other people can't get," he told Newsbeat. "I sell trainers too.
"I have a pair worth £3,500 and still wear them. At the end of the day they are still a trainer."
"My name is Pins and I'm an artist and customise trainers. I like doughnuts and I like trainers."
Nikki is 28 and said: "I like to be different and have a pair for every occasion. I have around 80 pairs.
"I also love heels. I have a heel fetish too."
Simian is 25 and said: "It's a lifestyle thing for me."
Louis and Daniel, both 13, go to the same school.
Louis said: "I have four pairs and would have loads more if I had the money. My parents get it but not as much as me."
Daniel said: "I'd love more trainers. My parents don't get it."
Vish, 19, is with Linda, also 19, and said he'd bought her matching shoes.
"When I was young my mum bought me fake trainers so when I got cash of my own I started collecting and now I run a business selling sneakers."
Lawrence, 28, said: "I deal in trainers that are all sold out in the shops. It's the hype of the shoe that dictates price. These ones are £450."
Carly, 25, dad Ollie, 43, Oscar, 11, Quinn, eight, Jess, 23, and mum Lisa, 44, are at the event as part of a family outing.
Ollie said: "I'm old school and have always loved trainers. My kids do too."
Quinn said: "I have just got these today because they're skateboarding shoes."
Ashton, 16, is on a day out at the trainer festival with John, who is 40.
Ashton said: "John is my homie. We are different ages but both love shoes. These are the most expensive shoes in here. They are £3,500.
"They are Back to the Future 2 shoes. They were auctioned off to raise money for the Michael J Fox's Parkinson's Foundation.
"They are from the film and even light up.
"In the film they are from the future 2015 - next year."
Matt, 21, Daniel, 28, and Sam, 20, are all at the event together.
Daniel said: "I customise and sell trainers. I strip them down with nail varnish remover, dip them in paint, dye the sole, add lacquer and then add designs to them."
Aeron, 19, Dammy, 19, and Daniel, 18, are also at the event together.
Daniel said: "I have 15 pairs and think that trainers make an outfit. No matter what you're wearing, if you're wearing good trainers you will look good."
Dammy said: "It's a lifestyle thing."
Aeron said: "Trainers make an outfit."
Father and son, Zizzi and Ifty, said: "Our feet are the same size. "We pass shoes to each other now. I got my son into trainers."
