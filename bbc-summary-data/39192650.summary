A man has been jailed for 10 years after being convicted of raping a girl and sexually abusing four other girls 25 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Kemp, 64, denied all the offences which took place in Sutherland between 1988 and 1992. He accused the victims of lying.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that one of the women reported the abuse to police in 2015 after becoming a mother.
She said "keeping quiet made the world a worse place", the court heard.
After she came forward police traced Kemp's other victims.
Praising the women's bravery, Judge Norman Ritchie QC told Kemp: "These women were strong.
"It is a testament to their character they made their complaints and gave evidence against you."
Kemp raped one of his victims on one occasion when she was aged eight. He also sexually abused her and four other girls.
He has been placed on the sex offenders register.
The court heard that Kemp was "run out" of where he lived in Sutherland in 1992 after being convicted of having indecent images of children.
The word "pervert" was daubed on his home and public outrage forced him to flee.
In 1998 he was jailed for 11 years at York Crown Court for raping girls under 16 and sexually abusing girls under 14, the court heard.
He had been arrested after an appeal was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme in 1997.
Kemp was also jailed in 2010 at Hull Magistrates Court for 15 counts of making indecent photographs of children.
