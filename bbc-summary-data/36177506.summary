Network Rail said the closure between Oxenholme and Windermere would mean "short-term pain for long-term gain."
Spokesman Simon Evans said work across the network costing Â£33m was taking place nationwide.
While engineers renew the track, bus services will be in place between Glasgow and Carlisle, and Carlisle and Preston until Monday.
Mr Evans said: "Far fewer people travel on bank holidays, so we are taking this opportunity to get on and do important work.
"We are renewing some of the track and replacing overhead equipment - it is short-term pain for long-term gain."
