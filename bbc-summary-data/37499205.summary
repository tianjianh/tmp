[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rain, more rain and no Brexit at Labour Party Conference

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Like the weather there was sunshine optimism here. Talk of moving on, taking the fight to the enemy.

There was also constant drizzle and several soak-you-to-the-skin rain showers. Gloom.
When the delegates in Liverpool voted not to debate Brexit at the conference, former shadow transport secretary and MP for Nottingham South, Lilian Greenwood, didn't disguise her frustration on social media.
Her  #HitsHeadRepeatedlyAgainstBrickWall hashtag said it all.
She was back in her constituency knocking on doors again, speaking to voters by the time Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage for his second leader's address.
There was no mention of targets for cutting immigration in his speech, despite the Brexit vote when the nation probably gave its opinion on immigration more than anything else. Especially in the Labour heartlands.
Instead he promised a new fund for high-migration areas to address what he called "the real issues of immigration".
I was walking in the rain down Bold Street in Liverpool on the last morning of the conference when I witnessed one of those deeply disturbing encounters that have been reported more since the June referendum result.
"Speak English you foreign...," yelled a young man, rucksack on back, at a man of Middle Eastern appearance who was talking to a friend.
"Go back to your own country," was hurled at him next.
Then, and this explains a lot: "You with your Mercedes and your four bedroom house....".
He cannot have known that. He was assuming. He looked homeless. Without hope. With envy for others. Especially, in his eyes, foreigners.
Just around the corner is Hanover Street where BBC Merseyside is based. In the few yards from the radio station, I counted five men in doorways. Sleeping. Begging.
And Labour didn't debate Brexit.
