Clacton Brookfield care home resident's ulcer left bone visible

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home let one resident's ulcer get so deep her bone was visible, a tribunal has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hearing was told Brookfield Residential Home in Clacton, Essex, lacked "the most basic level of care".
Essex County Council removed all of its 11 residents last year after a series of inspections.
Brookfield's managers have now lost a tribunal appeal against a Care Quality Commission (CQC) decision which banned them from running the home.
The Care Standards Tribunal heard the appeal brought by Lystra and Jos Dorval, who were the managers and care providers.
The CQC's inspection in November 2014 concluded the home was inadequate and "even the most basic level of care was not being provided".
The tribunal judge outlined the concerns raised by inspectors, who reported that a female resident had an open ulcer on her left buttock which was "about 1.5ins (4cm) in diameter".
The report said she also had a black eye, was inadequately fed and one of her lower limbs was oozing a liquid which soaked her bed sheets.
Concerns were also raised about poor food hygiene, poor management of medicines and inadequate staffing levels and staff training.
The Dorvals challenged the CQC's ruling by claiming its inspector was "biased" against them and had either "invented or exaggerated" the problems in the final report.
In rejecting the claims, Judge John Burrow said: "Mr and Mrs Dorval had not shown insight, had not shown a commitment or ability to drive change and did not display the managerial ability to bring about the necessary improvements."
He concluded the commission's cancelation of their registrations was "necessary, proportionate and correct".
Speaking after the tribunal, Mrs Dorval said the loss of the council contract was because the authority "found a cheaper contract in a bigger home".
She said: "There was one lady who had a fall that morning [of the inspection] - she had a black eye and had a doctor and social worker seeing her and her relatives were told about it - and they [the CQC] were fully aware of all of that.
"There was not one person in the community said a bad word about the home."
Dick Madden, councillor with responsibility for adult services at Essex County Council, said it "acts to safeguard residents if failings come to light and deals with failings appropriately".
