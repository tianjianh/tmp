Around 1.5 million devotees have turned out for a huge annual Roman Catholic procession in Manila.
Each year, a centuries-old wooden statue of Jesus Christ, called The Black Nazarene, is paraded through the Philippine capital.
This year, police and foreign embassies advised attendees to be on alert for possible terror attacks.
