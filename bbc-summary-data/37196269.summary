The match dates for the group stage are 15 and 29 September, 20 October, 3 and 24 November, and 8 December.
United boss Jose Mourinho said he knew little about Ukrainian opponents Zorya, whose home ground is close to the Russian border, meaning they will play their fixtures 500 miles away in Odessa.
But welcomed being drawn with Fenerbahce and Feyenoord, who will have a reduced capacity at their De Kuip stadium due to trouble at previous games.
"We all know the competition is not the same as the Champions League but to have Manchester United playing against clubs with tradition like Fenerbahce and Feyenoord is good for us," he said.
