William Batista and Leko Nelson were caught in crossfire in Juba between forces loyal to the country's president and vice-president at the weekend.
Batista was secretary general and Nelson was team manager of the club.
South Sudan Football Association president Chabur Goc said: "We have lost two colleagues of football - may the Lord rest their souls."
Troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and first Vice-President Riek Machar began shooting at each other in the streets of Juba last week.
Relations between the two men have been fractious since South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011.
Their forces have fought a civil war. But despite a peace deal last year ending the conflict, both sides retain their military capabilities and have continued to accuse each other of bad faith.
