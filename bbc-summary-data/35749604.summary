Birmingham ex-scout leader jailed for Leicestershire child abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former scout leader has been jailed for five years for sexually abusing boys in the 1980s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Medhurst, from Birmingham, pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to 10 counts of indecent assault and one charge of gross indecency.
He attacked four scouts, aged between eight and 11, on camping trips in Hinckley and Castle Donington, both in Leicestershire, between 1981 and 1987.
Police believe there may be more victims who have yet to come forward.

Medhurst, 65, from Coney Green Drive, was jailed in 1991 for child sex offences but went on to become the leader of a scout group in Birmingham.
Some of the attacks took place on a campsite at Donington Park, during a trip to the 1984 British Grand Prix and a visit to Mallory Park race track, police said.
Medhurst insisted he share tents - and on occasions sleeping bags - with boys on camping trips, said officers.
Police say he also lured boys to his home, where he plied them with alcohol and forced them to watch pornography and play games with cards with explicit images on them.
He was jailed for five years and four months on Monday.
Det Con Jamie Carr of Leicestershire Police said: "I have no doubt there are more victims who are still bottling up what happened to them.
"I would ask them to get in touch. Medhurst should face justice for each and every one of the children he abused so shockingly."
