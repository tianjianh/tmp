[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Advice to boil tap water before drinking it has been lifted for another 9,000 households in Lancashire.

The move in Chorley means supplies in all areas south of the River Ribble are back to normal, while 100,000 homes are still affected, United Utilities said.
Up to 300,000 homeowners had to boil drinking water for more than three weeks after cryptosporidium, a microbial parasite, was discovered.
The bug was found at a treatment works near Preston on 6 August.
Water has been treated with ultraviolet (UV) light to kill the bug, which can cause diarrhoea and cramps.
United Utilities said it expected to be able to lift the restrictions for the "vast majority of remaining customers" by the end of Sunday.
The remaining UV-dosing rigs will soon be up and running to remove the last traces of the bug from the water network, the firm added.
The warning had affected residents in Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble and Wyre.
Customers can check which areas have had restrictions lifted by visiting the United Utilities website or calling 0800 912 7241.
Those who have been affected are to be given up to £60 in compensation.
United Utilities said payments would range from £50 to £60 depending on when the advice was lifted. The move will cost the company more than £15m.
However, Conservative MP for Fylde Mark Menzies said the size of the payment was a "disgrace" and "woefully inadequate".
