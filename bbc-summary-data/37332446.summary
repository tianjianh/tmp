Police said the 33-year-old victim was playing on a fruit machine in the Rosevale Tavern in Partick at about 18:00 on Saturday when a stranger assaulted him.
The attacker fled via a side entrance and CCTV showed him heading down Dumbarton Road towards the city centre.
The victim was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for treatment to a serious facial injury.
Det Con Jen Adams, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a completely unprovoked attack which will leave the victim scarred for life.
"Officers have been conducting extensive enquiries including examining CCTV and speaking to people who were within the pub at the time of the incident."
The attacker is described as being aged in his mid 20s with brown hair which was longer at the top and shaved at the bottom.
He was wearing a black quilted waist-length jacket, dark blue jeans and dark trainers.
