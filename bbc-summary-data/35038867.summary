Following the conclusion of her 17-month Prismatic World Tour, she earned $135m (£90m), which saw her jump from 23rd place last year.
One Direction lead the British top-earners at number two after their On the Road Again Tour and album release, with earnings of $130m (£86.7m)
Last year's number one, Dr Dre, has dropped to 28.
Dre's earnings of $620m (£413m) in 2014 was the highest total amount by a musician ever, thanks to the sale of headphone maker Beats - which he co-founded - to Apple for $3 billion (£2 billion).
One Direction have been joined in the 2015 list by fellow Brits Calvin Harris and Fleetwood Mac.
Forbes has made the estimates based on industry information as well as interviews with managers and agents, along with data given by the artists themselves. It covers the period June 2014 to June 2015.
Many of the artists on the list have earned their place thanks to extensive live tours which have taken place across the year.
Here are the top 10 celebrities on the Forbes list:
1. Katy Perry: $135m (£90m)
2. One Direction: $130m (£86.7m)
3. Garth Brooks: $90m (£60m)
4. Taylor Swift: $80m (£53m)
5. The Eagles: $73.5m (£49m)
