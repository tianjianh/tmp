A 10-year project costing Â£500m will turn the rundown area - which will be renamed Paradise, without "circus" - into shops, offices, restaurants and a new hotel.
The work is due to begin next week, and in conjunction with the remedial work under way at Spaghetti Junction, drivers are expected to face delays and diversions.
BBC Midlands Today's Giles Latcham looked at what the future may hold for the city centre.
