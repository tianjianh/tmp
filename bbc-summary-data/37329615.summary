Royal Lancaster Infirmary: Third warning to avoid A&E;

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital has urged people to avoid going to its accident and emergency unit for the third time in six months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal Lancaster Infirmary has again blamed "a significant surge in demand" for the problem.
It comes three weeks after a similar appeal was issued over a lack of beds.
University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust said: "Yet again we are experiencing increased pressure in our A&E department at the RLI."
A trust spokesman said: "This is due mostly to patients that need to be admitted to our wards from A&E, however, due to delayed discharges and lack of bed availability, we are having to keep those patients in A&E."
Another appeal was made in March.
People who are not suffering serious illnesses or injuries are advised to dial the NHS advice line on 111, a pharmacist, Primary Care Assessment Centre, or GP.
