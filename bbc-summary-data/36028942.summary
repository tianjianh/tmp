Koke drove in the opening goal from 12 yards after Fernando Torres' shot had been blocked.
Former Blackburn Rovers forward Ruben Rochina hit the post for Granada before half-time, but Torres then ran on to Koke's pass to double Atletico's lead.
Substitute Angel Correa sprinted on to Saul's flick to slot in a late third for Diego Simeone's side.
Atletico moved on to 76 points alongside Barcelona, who lost 2-1 at home to Valencia later on Sunday; Granada remain one point above the relegation zone.
Simeone's team secured a first clean sheet in four La Liga matches, meaning they remain on course to beat the all-time competition record for the fewest goals conceded in a season.
Atletico have let in 16 league goals this season; the record low is 18, achieved by Deportivo La Coruna in 1993-94.
