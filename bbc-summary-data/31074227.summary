The internet is the new frontline as UK sets up army cyber-unit

The internet is officially the new frontline.

An Army unit, called the 77th Brigade, is being set up to help fight the cyberwars of the future.
It will launch in April and will be made up from reservists as well as regulars from all three services of the armed forces.
The team is being modelled on the Chindits, a specialist unit which fought in Burma during the Second World War.
But psychological warfare and cyberwar is already happening around the world.
Take a look at how different countries and police forces are dealing with online attacks.
While bullets are flying and people are being killed in Ukraine's war with pro-Russian rebels, Russian president Vladimir Putin used new psychological warfare (psy-ops) tactics to create chaos ahead of an invasion.
When the conflict broke out last year "little green men" (which Putin referred to as self-defence groups and said were local people who'd bought Russian uniforms and guns in shops) were sent into Crimea and eastern Ukraine to create dissent and spread confusion.
Using propaganda, the Russians built a case for military action.
Moscow denies direct involvement in the conflict but says some volunteers are fighting alongside pro-Russian rebels.
The so-called Islamic State (IS) has proved skilful at manipulating Western media with gruesome films of hostages being beheaded and locals being stoned.
There have also been crucifixions.
The videos have also been one of the jihadist group's main recruitment tools, with thousands of Europeans travelling to join the extremists.
They have also sent a clear message that the areas where IS operates are no-go zones for Western journalists, helping the group control what is and is not reported.
They also aim to create dissent in Western countries which refuse to pay ransoms for hostages.
In 2010 Israel and the US attacked Iran's nuclear programme using the Stuxnet virus, sending centrifuge machines used to enrich uranium out of control.
The computer worm reportedly ruined almost a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has also taken using social media to push its messages to another level.
It is active on 30 platforms including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - in six languages.
Other cyber-attacks have focused on "soft" targets, such as an attack on Hollywood studio Sony Pictures which the US blamed on North Korea.
Hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace scored a propaganda coup by forcing the release of satirical film The Interview, about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, to be cancelled.
North Korea denied being involved in the hack but described it as a "righteous deed".
South Korea claims North Korea has a digital army thought to be 3,000 strong.
Earlier this month Barack Obama referred to cyberwarfare in his State of the Union address, where US presidents get to set out their agenda and priorities.
"I urge Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft and protect our children's information.
"If we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable."
China has also admitted to having a cybersecurity military unit called the Blue Army.
The UK's biggest police force has gone for a more psychological approach on social media by trying to be as open as possible on Twitter.
As well as having a cybercrime unit, the Met set up 200 Twitter accounts so its officers could keep in touch with people in their area.
Alex Fedorcio from the Met told Newsbeat: "They just need to be transparent, get lots of images out there. And not shy away from the difficult questions.
"If someone asks a question, answer it. Be truthful and give as much info as possible. That will breed trust at the end of the day and that's what it's all about."
New York's NYPD police force set up Twitter accounts soon afterwards as well.
It's had a different experience and has got into trouble after using hashtags like #myNYPD.
Instead of getting pictures of New Yorkers with their friendly officers, they were sent photos of what users claimed showed police aggression.
The head of GCHQ had a go at social media companies on his first day in office last November.
Robert Hannigan described the likes of Facebok, Twitter and WhatsApp as having "become the command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals".
He accused firms of being "in denial" about the way in which the internet was being used in the battle against jihadists.
Mr Hannigan also said GCHQ and its sister agencies, MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service, could not tackle the cyber challenges "at scale" without greater support from the private sector, including the largest US technology companies which dominate the web.
