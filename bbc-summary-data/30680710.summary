Prof Michael Scott announced in November he was leaving some time in 2015. His departure had been agreed for the end of March but he has left his post.
The vice chancellor has been granted a leave of absence from 1 January.
Deputy vice chancellor Peter Excell will give "academic leadership" until an interim vice chancellor is appointed.
Sir Jon Shortridge and Derek Griffin, chair and vice chair of the board, will manage the administration of the university.
In a statement to colleagues, Mr Scott said: "The chairman and board of governors have kindly granted me leave of absence to pursue my research and other academic activities from 1 January 2015, although I will be on hand should there be issues which they feel need my involvement.
"I understand interim measures are being put in place to allow this to happen."
