[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere kept their perfect start to the National League intact with a 1-0 win at Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Jennings illuminated a standard affair after 33 minutes. The striker had a lot to do when he picked up the ball on the edge of the box, but shot the visitors in front with a fierce strike across the diving Grant Smith.
Jennings nearly doubled his side's advantage before the break, but his effort was cleared off the line.
Tranmere's James Norwood was also thwarted on the goal line, and Tranmere deserved the three points.
In the dying moments, the hosts' Conor Clifford was sent off for picking up a second yellow card.
