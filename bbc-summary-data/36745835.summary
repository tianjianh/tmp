New Reading carnival event planned after cancellation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A carnival event is due to be held in Reading, after the town's long-running Caribbean carnival was scrapped for a second year running.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reading Carnival of the World is set to feature international music, performances and a procession in the town centre in August.
Organiser Mary Genis said it would "celebrate the diversity of Reading".
A carnival, run by Reading's Caribbean community since 1977, has faced financial problems in recent years.
The new event planned for 20 August has organised by not-for-profit organisation CultureMix Art, with backing from the Arts Council, and is part of the town's Year of Culture.
It will include a performance stage in Broad Street, along with music and a carnival procession with West African, Asian and South American influences.
The Reading Carnival, held annually at Prospect Park, attracted up to 5,000 people, but was axed in 2013 and 2015 while a stripped-back event was held in 2014. This year's event was scrapped in April with organisers blaming a lack of funding.
