Adnan Januzaj is out with a hamstring injury, Marouane Fellaini is banned, while Bastian Schweinsteiger and Luke Shaw remain out through injury.
Bournemouth have no new injury problems but manager Eddie Howe says he might rotate his squad on Sunday.
Defender Sylvain Distin and Adam Smith both remain out with back and hernia problems respectively.
Guy Mowbray: "Like the whole country, Manchester United don't know whether they'll be in or out of Europe after the summer.
"All the options are possible, with their best-case Champions League (play-off round) scenario dependent on the double of a home win AND Swansea beating Manchester City.
"Bournemouth finally come to Old Trafford for a league game looking for a double of their own, having beaten United on the south coast in December.
"That's undoubtedly one of the highlights of their first ever top division season, with the fact that they'll be back again next year an achievement that has perhaps not had the recognition it deserves.
"Maybe one day Eddie Howe will be back at a big ground like this on a more fixed basis?"

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal:  "We are dependent on Manchester City, that's the difference and that's also frustrating when you had the chance two matches before the end to keep that advantage.
"We were 2-1 ahead with 15 minutes to play and then we gave it away [against West Ham].
"That is frustrating and now we are dependent (on what City do), but still it is possible so we will fight until the end."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "It is nice to be involved in a game that means something.
"The last few games have been difficult for us because we have not been a team that are used to not having that competitive edge.
"In the last few seasons there has always been something on every game and we have become very accustomed to it and embraced the pressure and relished it in some ways."
Manchester United still have an outside chance of a top-four finish. They should have no problems winning but I do not see Manchester City being beaten at Swansea with what is at stake for them.
The Cherries will not just be rolled over at Old Trafford, but I don't see them stopping United from ending the season with a win.
