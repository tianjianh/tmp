[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man leading Welsh Labour's campaign for the UK to remain in the EU has admitted there is confusion among the party's traditional voters about what its position is on Europe.

Lord Hain said while campaigning is under way, more could be done.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who will address a pro-remain rally in Cardiff on Friday, has faced criticism for his role in the campaign.
Vote Leave said Labour remain campaigners had lost the argument.
Ahead of the rally, Mr Corbyn said the impact of Brexit on Wales could be "devastating".
But Iain Duncan-Smith, who is in north Wales on Friday, said leaving the EU would be a "shot in the arm" for democracy.
Lord Hain told BBC Wales: "There is a great deal of confusion about what the Labour position is. There is a lot of activity going on but we need to do more.
"This is the right time to be really engaging people. We need to step up the pace.
"We need to have a major Labour drive, and that is what all our efforts are going to.
"Where that is happening, I am very confident about it. This is definitely winnable."
But he said this will depend on the extra work of Labour MPs, AMs and councillors getting out on the doorstep.
"If they do that then we will win this comfortably, if they do not it's going to be tough," he added.
Lord Hain's comments come after the GMB union's Tim Roache said Mr Corbyn has been a "half-hearted" supporter of the EU.
But he attributed the confusion among Labour voters to the dominance of Tory infighting in the campaign which he said had acted as a "complete turn-off".
Vincent Bailey, a spokesman for Vote Leave Cymru, said: "This is not a question of getting through to people or of better communication to Labour voters, this is about the fact that they have lost the argument.
"Labour are having problems motivating their own supporters to come out and vote, because people understand that as part of the European Union we have no say about how many immigrants come to the UK and we have no say over immigration policies from Europe."
Labour leader Mr Corbyn said Labour wants to "remain and reform the EU".
Prior to the rally in Cardiff, the UK party leader said if Britain left the EU the impact would be felt in Wales "more than anywhere else in the UK and could be devastating."
He added: "While there is a lot of uncertainty about what would happen if Britain votes to leave the EU, the one thing we do know is that it would be a Tory government intent on scrapping rights for working people, and that has slashed Wales' budget that would be charged with negotiating our exit."
Meanwhile, former secretary of state for work and pensions Iain Duncan-Smith, who is visiting Conwy Harbour, Llandudno, and Colwyn Bay, said a leave vote is a "chance to put power back in the hands of local communities".
"All too many laws affecting our everyday lives are being taken by unelected politicians from other nations - instead of by Welsh politicians, in the Welsh parliament," he said.
"The EU is a political project and if we stay things will only get worse. Instead, let's take a different path, deliver a shot in the arm for British democracy, and take back control of our own affairs."
