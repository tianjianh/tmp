A woman whose body was pulled from the Norfolk Broads at the weekend has been named.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Home Office post mortem test on Monday revealed Annette Creegan, 49, of Mitcham, south London, is likely to have died as a result of strangulation.
Ms Creegan's body and that of a man were found in the River Bure, close to where the holiday boat they had hired was discovered.
Police are treating the deaths as a "domestic incident".
No-one else is being sought in connection with the deaths.
The man, who died as a result of drowning, will be named once further formal identification procedures have taken place.
Their bodies were found on Sunday after the woman's 13-year-old daughter was found alone on a hire boat on Saturday.
The couple were found between Salhouse Broad and Wroxham Broad.
It is thought the man, who is a foreign national, had taken his own life and might have also used another method in addition to drowning, such as taking an overdose.
It is understood the girl, who was found unharmed, was cared for and fed throughout last week and it is not thought she was locked inside the boat.
She has been interviewed by officers and is now being comforted by family members.
The detective overseeing the investigation, Det Supt Jes Fry said: "We're continuing to investigate on behalf of the coroner.
"We believe this is a domestic incident and the woman was dead before she entered the water and the male died of drowning," he said. "The concerns of the child and the rest of the family remain our priority.
"It is a tragic set of circumstances and it is up to the coroner now to carry out his process and we will act on his behalf to gather intelligence and evidence to try and built a picture of what has happened and that will be dealt with at the inquest."
