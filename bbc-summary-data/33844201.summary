Police said he was armed with a stolen gun and they had been tracking him. They blamed the violence on a small group of people.

The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States.

He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle.
The gunmen "were criminals; they weren't protesters," he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras.
Photos from the scene showed a young black man lying bloodied on the ground. He was face down and handcuffed.
President Barack Obama announced a federal programme to help pay for lapel-mounted cameras for US police to record their interactions in the wake of the nationwide protests on perceived policing injustices.
There have been a number of high profile shootings of unarmed black men in US cities in recent months.
The most recent case involved 19-year-old Christian Taylor who was shot dead by a white police officer after he was spotted on surveillance footage vandalising cars in Arlington, Texas, on Friday.
