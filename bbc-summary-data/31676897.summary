[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP's Diane James has dropped her bid to become an MP at the next general election for "personal reasons".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MEP had been selected to stand in North West Hampshire, which is considered a safe Conservative seat.
Her announcement came just hours after she made a speech at UKIP's party conference in Margate, Kent.
Ms James, who is the party's home affairs spokeswoman, came to prominence after almost winning 2013's Eastleigh by-election.
A party spokesman said: "Diane James is standing down as a PPC in north west Hampshire for purely personal reasons."
Press Association reported that Ms James was believed to have stood down to spend more time with a sick family member.
