The deal will see its Inchinnan site, near Glasgow Airport, produce parts for engines which power Hawk trainer aircraft - also used by the Red Arrows.
The contract is expected to reduce the risk of job cuts through restructuring.
Rolls-Royce has also confirmed that it will now go-ahead with plans announced last year for a £60m investment at the Inchinnan site.
The £79m contract is part of a £372m investment announced by the Ministry of Defence for continued in-service support of Hawk fast jet training aircraft.
The MoD said this would secure about 700 jobs around the UK until 2020.
Under the terms of the contract, Rolls-Royce will provide support to all main operating bases where the Hawk is stationed.
Repair and overhaul activities will be carried out at the firm's plants in Bristol and Inchinnan.
Chris Cholerton, of Rolls-Royce, said: "This MissionCare contract will enable us to maximise the number of engines available to power training missions, driving higher levels of customer capability.
"The solution was developed in a partnered approach between Rolls-Royce and the UK Ministry of Defence, ensuring that we meet the operational needs of the training fleet while providing value for money for the UK."
Rolls Royce confirmed that it had now approved a competitive business case by the Inchinnan plant which will secure £60m investment there.
This will see the site become a Centre of Competence for making aerofoils and engine shafts.
Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said: "This significant investment is a tremendous news for workers and management at Inchinnan and also the broader Renfrewshire economy.
"First and foremost it will boost security of employment for the highly skilled workforce.
"It is also further confirmation of Renfrewshire's continuing ability to provide the location, workforce, and economic environment that can deliver long term business advantage for internationally renowned companies."
