Fenelon, 20, has made eight appearances since joining in November and scored in the win over Portsmouth in that month.
"Shamir has done well in his time here and I'm pleased to be able to keep him for another month," said Rovers manager Micky Adams.
"He's quick, lively, causes defenders problems and has given us something different in our attacking options."
The former Rochdale and Torquay loanee is available for the FA Cup tie against Swansea City on Saturday,
