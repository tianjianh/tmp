Brownlee, 27, had to carry his bike for a mile and finished 42nd in Japan.
The Yokohama race was his first triathlon since being carried over the line by brother Alistair in last year's World Series finale in Mexico.
"It means that Leeds is very, very important," the 2012 world champion said of his home race on 11 June.
He told the BBC: "It puts me on the back foot as there's been three races so far and I've not got anything from any of them.
"I missed the first two with injury and then crashed at Yokohama so it means I have no room for error.
"Every race I do, I've got to get points, top three really, to have a chance of becoming world champion."
The Japan event was won by Spain's Mario Mola, the defending champion who pipped Brownlee last year and leads the 2017 series from compatriot Fernando Alarza.
Brownlee, an Olympic silver medallist at Rio 2016 and a bronze medallist at London 2012, veered into the railings on his bike when trying to avoid a rider who had fallen in front of him in wet conditions.
"I'm very lucky I didn't break any bones. I'm disappointed more than anything, it's a long way to go not to race properly and I felt like I was in good shape but I'm looking forward to changing things in Leeds and making it right," he said.
You can watch coverage of the Leeds race live on 11 June on the BBC Red Button, Connected TVs, online and the BBC Sport app, with highlights on BBC Two and catch-up on iPlayer.
