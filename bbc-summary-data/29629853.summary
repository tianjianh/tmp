Experts at Sutton Coldfield sewage plant have developed a new way to treat waste and turn it into a useful energy.
The sewage plant uses big "digesters" that work a bit like a cow's stomach.
They heat the waste and add certain chemicals to make a gas called methane, which can be used to power your home.
It's hoped that if the plan proves successful, other sewage plants across the UK will do the same.
What a whiffy wonder!
