[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 4-2 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Sam Jones, Chris Clements, Scott Vernon and Jamey Osborne saw Grimsby to a comfortable win over Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Lawless and Francois Zoko were on the scoresheet for the Glovers on an entertaining afternoon at Blundell Park.
The game was only seven minutes old when Grimsby broke the deadlock from Jones' coolly-taken penalty after Osborne had been brought down in the box by visiting goalkeeper Jonny Maddison.
The Mariners got the second goal their first-half display had deserved when Clements drove home from the edge of the box.
The Glovers came out with renewed intent after the restart and halved the deficit after just four minutes when Lawless fired home with their first shot on target.
Grimsby re-established their two-goal advantage when Vernon bundled home from a 60th-minute corner and two minutes later it was four when Osborne ran the length of the field, under pressure, before coolly slotting home his first goal for Town.
Yeovil came back again and got their second of the afternoon after some slack marking from a corner allowed Zoko to rifle home from close range.
