The former Coronation Street set is to be demolished following the soap's move to a new site.

The set on the old Granada TV lot in central Manchester was turned into a visitor attraction after filming moved to Trafford in January.
But developer Allied London, which bought the Quay Street site for Â£26m last year, is planning to build flats, shops and offices in its place.
The set had been used since 1982 but was refused listed status in 2012.
English Heritage said the complex was not sufficiently historic or architecturally significant to be listed.
The set has attracted more than 200,000 visitors since opening as a temporary tourist attraction in April.
The attraction is due to close on 4 October, although it could be extended to allow it to remain open until demolition work begins. The redevelopment of the area is due to start next year.
An ITV spokesperson said: "Coronation Street's new home is at MediaCityUK and the tour at Quay Street was always for a limited time.
"Although we can't confirm the official closure date - once the tour has closed, ITV will return the site to Allied London with the Coronation Street lot removed."
Glenda Young, editor of the Coronation Street Blog, said it was bad for fans and urged the developers to retain something from the street.
"It seems a shame," she said. "Even if there's just a bit of the old cobbles left, or Maxine's bench, or something that we know, it would be ideal.
"Make it a place for people to go and sit and be a focal point for that piece of Coronation Street history and culture. Once that's gone, there's nowhere else for fans to go.
"The Hacienda [nightclub] has been turned into flats, but people still turn up and have a look to see a bit of the old Hacienda."
But she admitted a full tourist attraction would probably not be viable in the long term.
"I think something like that's got a shelf life, and now that we all know they film on a different set anyway, the novelty would wear off," she said.
