The Met Police has released a list of 10 of the worst calls, including one about where to get a bacon sandwich.
Devon and Cornwall Police received a call from a man complaining he was "ripped off" by a prostitute.
Police said inappropriate calls increased waiting times for callers who genuinely needed help.
Other nuisance calls to the Met included one from a woman who wanted officers to deal with a couple of noisy foxes outside her home and a man whose 50p coin was stuck in a laundrette washing machine and who wanted police to retrieve it.

Devon and Cornwall Police also spoke to a woman whose false nail had fallen off, another about a racing pigeon in her garden and a man who wanted the police to deliver a pizza.
