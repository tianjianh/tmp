Romeo Beckham could get to the top of tennis, says coach

Can you imagine the roar on centre court if an umpire was to announce "Game, set and match Beckham" at the end of the 2025 Wimbledon final?

Well it's not beyond the realms of possibility because apparently the boy Romeo has talent.
According to his coach, the middle of the Beckham boys has all the necessary tools to go a long way in tennis.
The 12-year-old's skills have been described as "extraordinary" for someone of his age.
Romeo's footballing skills have previously been noted; he's enrolled in the Arsenal academy just as elder brother Brooklyn was.
Unfortunately for David's first born, Arsenal didn't see a future for him at the club and decided to release him.
Seeing the media furore around that decision, and the inevitable football comparisons between Brooklyn and David, Romeo may just be prompted to go down the tennis route instead.
Tennis coach John Johnson had a chance to take a close look at Romeo's skills during a 10-day tennis camp in London recently.
"I'm not sure his parents realise how good he is," says Johnson. "Romeo really loves tennis. He is really into it and very talented.
"He has a lot of talent and very good hand-eye coordination. I'm going to have a meeting with his mother about it to reinforce that.
"Romeo has a natural swing and is very enthusiastic, he just loves it. He kept telling me and I could see how focused he was."
Now it's not unusual for a tennis player to have decent footballing skills too.
Rafael Nadal's uncle had the nickname "the Beast of Barcelona" when he played professional football for the Catalan giants.
Rafa himself had to choose between football and tennis when he was a kid. He clearly chose wisely.
So could Romeo be about to tread a similar path?
He wouldn't have to worry about funding himself during those early days on tour, meaning he could afford a coach and support team unlike so many up and coming players.
He would also be able to pick his dad's brains on enjoying a long and successful top-flight sporting career.
Basically all the cards are stacked in Romeo's favour, and there's no doubt he would be a huge hit with the Wimbledon crowds.
Henman Hill or Murray Mount could easily be renamed Romeo Ridge for example.
So clearly Becks junior has a big decision on his hands.
As well as being a dab hand at tennis and football, he's also in high demand as a model.
Romeo successfully fronted a Burberry ad campaign, was credited with boosting their Christmas sales and commended for taking to it like a duck to water.
But seeing as the talent production line in British tennis isn't exactly purring outside of Andy Murray's home town of Dunblane, frankly you have to hope he decides his future lies with a racquet in his hand and not on the catwalk.
In the words of the excitable centre court crowd: "Come on Romeo!"
