Play Newsround's Easter egg hunt!

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's Easter so it must be time for Newsround's Easter egg hunt!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hidden in different stories around the Newsround website are five Easter eggs that look like the one on this page - but this one doesn't count.
All you have to do is hunt through the different story pages and see if you can spot all of them.
Good luck!
