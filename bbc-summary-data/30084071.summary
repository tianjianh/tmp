In the wake of the Scots' crucial 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Ireland, on Friday, Strachan felt the intensity levels might drop among his players.
But he said: "They went into the game we put on in training and it was as intense as the first day at pre-season.
"I've got so many players wanting to play."
And he added: "Most of the coaches thought, the day before the game, they would take their foot off the pedal, but no.
"There are one or two bumps this morning but it didn't affect anyone. It was kind of old-fashioned - just rub it and get on with it."
Strachan's side continued their good start to Euro 2016 qualifying courtesy of Shaun Maloney's goal on Friday night.
But the manager says maintaining form is not at the forefront of his thinking. as he billed the Auld Enemy friendly as an occasion to savour.
"I haven't thought about momentum, I've just thought about beating England," said Strachan, who admitted picking his side will be a balancing act between trying to win the game and giving his squad experience of the fixture.
"We want to compete and make it as difficult for the other team to win as possible.
"I'd think most of the England players will be looking forward to this game. They know it's going to be competitive, they know there's going to be an atmosphere. Great players enjoy that and they have some great players."
Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson, who was a star performer in the win over the Republic, is hoping to be involved in his first match against England on Tuesday.
And he is convinced the game will prove a worthwhile test for both sides.
"We have a massive game tomorrow which everyone is looking forward to, so hopefully we can put in another good performance," the 20-year-old Hull City player said.
"When I grew up the Scotland-England game was a thing of the past, but we still grew up knowing about it and knowing the history of the game. The game returned last year and it will be a great occasion to be involved in.
"Both teams won't take it as a friendly, it will be a competitive match. There's no better friendly than against England."
