The exhibition game saw France great Thierry Dusautoir and his fellow back row Roger Wilson kicking conversions in their final games before retirement.
Ulster debutants Mark Keane and Callum Patterson both scored first-half tries.
But two tries from both Waisea Nayacalevu and Chris King helped the Baa-Baas fight back as they outscored Ulster by seven tries to four.
Ruan Pienaar was joining Wilson in making his final Ulster appearance before he heads to Montpellier to join a club that will be coached by Vern Cotter, in charge of the Barbarians in Thursday's game.
Pienaar, devastated to be leaving Ulster after seven years with the province, came off after 35 minutes but by that stage the Baa-Baas' bulk had already swung the game in the visitors' favour.
Three of the Barbarians' four first-half tries came after line-out mauls as the damp conditions in Belfast made slick handling an unrealistic prospect.
The visiting tourists were able to produce more running rugby as space began to open up in the second half and Nayacalevu and Tekori both ran in scores more in keeping with the Baa-Baas' proud history.
Out-of-favour Ireland centre Stuart McCloskey barged over for Ulster's first try in the sixth minute and his clever chip set up debutant wing Keane to score another touchdown five minutes later.
But former All Black hooker Corey Flynn rumbled over a reply in the 20th minute as the Barbarians pack began to bully the opposition.
After scores from centre Nayacalevu and prop King put the Baa-Baas 17-14 ahead, youngster Patterson finished off an Ulster line-out maul to restore the home side's lead only for prop King to drive over for another try in first-half injury-time.
A break from Pienaar's replacement Paul Marshall set up to Alan O'Connor to put Ulster ahead again after the resumption.
However as the Baa-Baas again began to overpower their opponents, the pressure yielded a penalty try and Nayacalevu's second score in a five-minute period to put them 36-28 ahead.
Marshall fumbled a glorious chance to reply in the 68th minutes with the line gaping after Dave Shanahan's perfect pass and Tekori's late score at the other end confirmed the Barbarians' win.
