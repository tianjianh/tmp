Wales and Newport Gwent Dragons number eight Taulupe Faletau says he hopes to sign a national dual contract.

Faletau, 24, has been linked with a move to English Premiership side Bath having not been among Welsh players to sign dual deals between the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and regions recently.
The British and Irish Lion says he has been offered one but that changing his agent had "delayed" things.
"I hope it's still on offer to be honest, but I don't know," he said.
Faletau returned from Six Nations duty to come off the bench for Dragons in last Saturday's 32-17 Pro12 win at Treviso.
They host Cardiff Blues in the European Challenge Cup quarter-finals this weekend and Faletau says he has no immediate plans to leave Rodney Parade.
"I've got another year here, so that's my plans for the future," he said.
Director of rugby Lyn Jones was non-committal over any dual contract for Faletau, but did say he was "100%" confident the player would still be at the region at the start of 2015-16.
