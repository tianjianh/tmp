The robbery, which happened at a Bank of Scotland branch in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on Wednesday, sparked a bomb scare.
The taxi driver picked up a man from The Avenue in Lochgelly and was then forced to carry out the robbery at the Mitchelston Industrial Estate branch.
Police had been told that some form of explosive device may be present, however nothing was found.
The robber fled with a four-figure sum of money following the incident which happened at 12:40.
Military specialists were called in and people told to stay in nearby homes and businesses as a precaution.
Police said a search of the area "confirmed that no explosives or bombs were present during this incident".
The suspect was described as being as white, 5ft 6in tall, of heavy build. He was wearing a dark green baseball cap, a dark green scarf, a thick, dark blue jacket, tracksuit bottoms and sunglasses.
He spoke with a distinctive Eastern European accent.
Det Insp Charlie Duncan, who is leading the investigation, said: "I want to speak to anyone who may have been in the area of the industrial estate in Lochgelly between 12.15pm and 12.40pm yesterday and saw the man described.
"I am particularly interested to trace any taxi drivers who may have taken a hire to the Lochgelly area yesterday who matched this description.
"We are not certain how this individual came to be in that area, but due to the location it is unlikely that he walked there.
"We would also be keen to trace any taxi drivers or members of the public who may have seen a man fitting this description leaving the Kirkcaldy area anytime from 1.30pm following the incident at the bank."
Supt Derek McEwan said: "I would like to offer a reassurance to the public that all actions of the police yesterday were done to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our communities.
"I would also like to praise the courage and bravery of the taxi driver and staff within the Bank of Scotland who remained calm during this entire incident.
"Officers will be in Kirkcaldy and Lochgelly offering further reassurance and carrying out more inquiries today, and will be available to speak to anyone who has any information which could assist our investigation."
