A group of amateur footballers have been warned about their conduct after footage emerged showing them shouting abuse at a homeowner in Lincoln.

Danny Wayte said his property has been turned into a target after goalposts were erected on a playing field nearby.
Mr Wayte said some players became "aggressive" when he refused to hand the ball back after it had been kicked on to his driveway.
The City of Lincoln Council said the men's behaviour was "unacceptable".
Mr Wayte said he has been at the property since 2011 but thought Yarborough Leisure Centre's playing field "got little use" until goals were put up close to his home.
He said in the following years only junior footballers used the field and it was "nice and peaceful".
However, this year, senior teams started using the pitches again and it has made his life a misery.
"It's turned my house into a target and my vehicles on the property... Everything's just being hit by the ball constantly.
"Most disturbing incident was on Sunday. I had half a football team standing at the railings being aggressive shouting abuse while my little girl's there [at the house]."
Simon Colburn, from the City of Lincoln Council, said the football pitches at Yarborough Leisure Centre have been in their current format since the 1980s but would review them and investigate the complaint fully.
He said: "We do not condone the behaviour of the footballers in any way and will be writing to the teams and Lincolnshire Football Association to tell them that their conduct was unacceptable, it will not be tolerated and must not happen again.
"We will take appropriate action against individuals or teams where this occurs."
Lincolnshire FA is also investigating the incident.
