The Poole Pirates rider - who was on loan at Swindon - suffered severe spinal injuries after he came off his bike during a meeting in August.
He told the Wimborne Road stadium crowd he would "keep pushing forward".
The race meeting was staged to raise money to help pay for Ward's rehabilitation costs.
Speaking from his wheelchair on the track, the 23-year-old said: "It's early days. The back injury is pretty severe but just got to keep pushing forward and see what we can do."
A club statement said it had been a "massive effort" for the rider to make his first public appearance in public since the crash.
"No-one could have anticipated the level of outpouring when the man himself appeared on track," the club said.
The Australian was riding for Zielona Gora against Grudziadz when he clipped the back wheel of a rider in front and fell awkwardly during a race on 23 August.
He was transferred to hospital where he underwent a two-and-a-half-hour operation before being transferred to the UK.
