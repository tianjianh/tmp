Donald Trump savaged by Republican rivals in 2016 debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump has come under attack from all sides in a fiery debate between the top Republican presidential candidates in the 2016 presidential election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The frontrunner, a billionaire businessman with no political experience, refused to apologise over comments about the wife of Jeb Bush.
And the biggest applause went to Carly Fiorina, when she responded to a recent jibe by Mr Trump over her looks.
There are 15 Republicans hoping to be the party's White House nominee.

Mr Bush and Mr Trump traded blows on a few issues, notably when the former Florida governor demanded the tycoon apologise to his wife for saying he was weak on immigration because she is Mexican. Mr Trump refused.
But the loudest audience response of the night came when Ms Fiorina was asked about an interview in which Trump was quoted as saying "Look at that face!" and said she could not be president.
She replied, to thunderous applause: "I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said."
Other highlights in the debate:
An undercard debate for the four other Republican candidates happened on the same stage earlier.
In a combative atmosphere, the four were split over the case of Ms Davis, who defied a Supreme Court ruling and refused to issue marriage licences to gay couples.
The Democratic Party will hold its first debate in Nevada in October, also hosted by CNN.
By next summer, each party will have a presidential nominee who will do battle in the race for the White House. Votes will finally be cast in November 2016.
