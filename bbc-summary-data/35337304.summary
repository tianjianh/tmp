Southern Water initially said 1,000 properties were affected for about four hours in the South Wonston area.
It later clarified that the same pipe was also damaged on Saturday evening, about 100 yards further along, with some customers cut off for 16 hours.
The water main in a field on Lower Stoke Road had "quite a long split along it", a spokeswoman said.
