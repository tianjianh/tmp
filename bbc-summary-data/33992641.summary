NI 1987 State papers: Paisley broke unionist 'no rates' campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The extent of unionist civil disobedience in 1987 in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been revealed in this year's releases from the Public Record Office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a memo to officials at the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) on 8 September, 1987, the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Ken Bloomfield, had made reference to Ian Paisley paying rates.
It noted that the DUP leader had paid the rates due on his Belfast manse and his office following a threat to refer the case to the Enforcement of Judgments Office.
In an earlier report, dated 20 August, 1987, Mr Bloomfield, now Sir Ken, reported that the DUP deputy leader, and now first minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, had been summoned to court the following month in respect of non-payment of motor tax.
"If he declines to pay any penalties which the court may impose, it is possible he could be committed to prison," the official commented.
Mr Bloomfield also noted that 14 of the 26 local councils in Northern Ireland were currently displaying "Ulster Says No" banners.
