The former Ivory Coast Under-20 and Under-23 international initially arrived at Huish Park on a short-term deal in November 2015.
Zoko, 32, then extended his deal in January until the end of the season.
"You do not win games without scoring goals and Francois played a crucial part in our relegation battle last season," said Yeovil boss Darren Way.
"He has been a superb signing. Last year he didn't have a full pre-season, so I am looking forward to working with him to get him a full pre-season under his belt.
"His family have been very supportive to him in allowing Francois to remain in sunny Somerset for another year."
Zoko said: "I hope we can put smiles on the supporters' faces next season."
He follows goalkeeper Artur Krysiak, and defenders Omar Sowunmi and Ryan Dickson in signing new deals following the Glovers' brush with relegation.
Way's side ultimately finished the season 14 points clear of trouble, in 19th place.
Zoko has scored 58 goals in 188 appearances, plus 63 as substitute, with Carlisle United, Notts County, Stevenage, Blackpool and Bradford City since first arriving in English football in August 2010.
