Nick Kyrgios has been fined for a foul-mouthed outburst at the Shanghai Masters, pushing the Australian closer to a potential four-week ban.

According to reports, Kyrgios was heard calling the tournament a "circus" and complaining about the ball kids during his win over Andreas Haider-Maurer.
The 20-year-old was fined $1,500 (Â£984) and could trigger a 28-day ban if he incurs $5,000 in fines before February.
It was his second code violation warning in a week.
The world number 32 will face a one-month ban if he receives another fine for verbal or physical misconduct, with the penalty stemming from the suspended ban he received for a sexual comment about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match in August.
Kyrgios had criticised the Shanghai surface on Monday, describing conditions as "crazy" when a cameraman was ejected for repeatedly talking during points.
"They were talking in the middle of the points. I was just expecting a lot more obviously from a Masters event," Kyrgios said.
"You're not going to see Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal playing on a court like that. They're always playing on centre court where things usually go pretty smoothly."
Kyrgios and his doubles partner Bernard Tomic entertained the crowd for different reasons on Tuesday when they had a putting competition on court during a medical time out and played rock-paper-scissors to decide who received during one sudden-death point.
The Australian pair beat  Vasek Pospisil and Jack Sock 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 to reach the second round.
Kyrgios also plays Japan's Kei Nishikori in the second round of the singles competition on Wednesday.
