The man fell when he went to explore the cave and dislodged a large boulder, estimated to weigh more than one tonne.
The Coleraine Coastguard went to the scene after 22:00 GMT on Monday along with the inshore lifeboat and the Ballycastle Coastguard team.
The man was located at the base of a steep slope in the sea cave.
He suffered a minor leg injury and was given first aid by the coastguard rope rescue technician who went down the cliff to assist him.
