Max Branning said: "You killed Lucy" not "Who killed Lucy?" at the end of EastEnders on Tuesday night.
Parts of each episode are live this week with a full show live on Friday to celebrate 30 years of the BBC One soap.
But there was some confusion online about what Jake Wood's character Max Branning said to Abi Branning (played by Lorna Fitzgerald) during a live segment just before the end credits.
BBC One and EastEnders have both confirmed what Max, played by Jake Wood, really said.
Lucy Beale was killed off in the show last year and viewers have been guessing who killed her ever since.
It's been confirmed the mystery will "finally be revealed" during Thursday's episode.
During Tuesday night's episode audience figures peaked at 9.6 million.
