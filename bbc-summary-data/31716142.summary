However Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee misses out on the 7 March race with an ankle injury.
And former world champions Helen Jenkins and Non Stanford have opted to continue with their winter training.
"It's a shame for Alistair that he's not racing," his brother Jonathan said.
"It's a big year for us all with Olympic qualification and it's still very early in the year at the moment."
Commonwealth medal winner Vicky Holland is is also missing the race in favour of completing winter training.
A British Triathlon spokesperson said: "With Olympic selection races set for August and September, many British athletes will place emphasis on performances later in the season."
Athletes must complete five of the nine World Series rounds, and the Grand Final in Chicago in September, to compete for the world title.
