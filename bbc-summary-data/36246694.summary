A horse trapped up to the shoulders in a pool of thick mud "for several hours" has been rescued by firefighters.

The exhausted animal was found on a farm at Arborfield, near Wokingham, on Sunday barely able to lift its head above the ground, the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
Firefighters worked for nearly four hours in soaring temperatures to free the horse.
It was dragged out with harnesses and left in the care of a vet.
The fire service said the 12-year-old horse, named Chrissy, had sunk into a metre-deep pool whose surface had dried out in the recent hot weather.
Watch manager David Newton said: "When we arrived the horse was quite exhausted and had clearly been there for several hours, thrashing around and sinking deeper and deeper."
Firefighters spent hours digging down in order to pass strops underneath the sedated animal before pulling it out sideways.
It was able to stand and was led back to stables by the owners.
