The firm said it was implementing contingency plans to bring home all its UK customers on additional flights at Banjul airport over the next 48 hours.
The Foreign Office now advises against all but essential travel, based upon the risk of unrest in Gambia.
A 90-day state of emergency has been declared over disputed elections.
In a statement, Thomas Cook said: "We will operate a programme of additional flights into Banjul airport over the next 48 hours to bring the 985 UK customers we currently have on holiday in Gambia home, including four additional flights on Wednesday 18 January.
"In addition, we have approximately 2,500 flight-only customers in Gambia, whom we are contacting to offer the earliest possible flight availability for return to the UK."
The travel company is sending a special assistance team on the first flight from the UK to provide additional support for customers.
"Our colleagues on the ground in Gambia will proactively contact all customers on holiday with us as soon as possible to prepare for return to the UK," the statement continued.
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh declared a state of emergency a day before his official mandate ends.
He decried "extraordinary" foreign interference in his country's affairs and in December's presidential election.
Regional leaders have been trying without success to persuade Mr Jammeh to hand over power to Adama Barrow, who won the vote.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises "against all but essential travel to the Gambia due to ongoing political uncertainty and potential military intervention following the presidential elections".
People should leave the country by commercial means if they have no essential need to stay, it adds.
Thomas Cook is offering free amendments or cancellations for holidays to Gambia scheduled until Friday, and free amendments after that date.
