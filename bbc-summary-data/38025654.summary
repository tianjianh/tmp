Why Haiti is going to the polls again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, is holding much-anticipated presidential and parliamentary polls on 20 November.

They come more than a year after a first attempt to hold the presidential ballot ended without a run-off round
The October 2015 presidential election was won by Jovenel Moise but opposition challenger Jude Celestin called foul and, after violent unrest, the ballot was annulled and a new election called.
It should have been held this 9 October but was postponed after Hurricane Matthew devastated parts of the country.
A second round is due in January if no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote.
Also on Sunday, Haitians will vote in the second round of parliamentary elections - the first was held in August of last year.
Jocelerme Privert was named as interim president by parliament in February 2016 to fill the power vacuum after the incumbent, Michel Martelly, stepped down at the end of his term.
Standing this weekend are:
The most pressing issue is the continuing humanitarian crisis which began with the 2010 earthquake. The United Nations has said it is struggling to assist Haiti because of insufficient foreign aid.
Almost seven years after the 2010 earthquake, about 1.5m victims still live in temporary shelter while cholera has caused nearly 10,000 deaths.
Massive deforestation has led to crops being washed away and many homes being destroyed by natural disasters.
Political instability and corruption have also contributed to rampant poverty.
Without effective government for decades, Haiti ranks 163rd out of the 188 countries on the UN Human Development Index.
