The Irish trainer also claimed the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2010 with Big Zeb.
Murphy made the surprise announcement after what he called "a difficult few years" financially.
"My accountancy background told me we just can't make it pay any more," said the Wexford-based Murphy, who began training in 2000.
"It's been a very difficult decision and not one we've made lightly, but in the end, it was a financial decision that was made for us."
Murphy enjoyed a Cheltenham Festival winner in March as Empire of Dirt, owned by Michael O'Leary's Gigginstown House Stud, took the Brown Advisory And Merribelle Stable Plate.
He said Black Zambezi could be his final runner at Gowran Park on 1 October.
