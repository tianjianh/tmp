Aberdeen: Simon Church, David Goodwillie and Scott Brown leave Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On-loan Wales striker Simon Church and David Goodwillie are among six first-team players leaving Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Goodwillie, who has been on loan to Ross County, and goalkeeper Scott Brown have been released along with defender Michael Rose.
Church, who scored six goals in 13 outings, and goalkeeper Adam Collin return to parent clubs Milton Keynes Dons and Rotherham United respectively.
Midfielder Barry Robson already announced his retirement, aged 37.
But Australian goalkeeper Aaron Lennox, who made his debut as Robson made his final appearance in Sunday's 4-0 defeat by Ross County, has signed a one-year contract to remain with the Dons.
Manager Derek McInnes admitted after the game that he "would like to get more options in forward areas, another goalkeeper and another defender - and maybe one or two others" as he re-shapes his squad for next season.
Goodwillie had left for Aberdeen's Premiership rivals in February to make way for the arrival of fellow 27-year-old Church.
His Pittodrie exit is the latest setback in the career of Goodwillie, who commanded a fee of more than Â£2m when he was transferred to Blackburn Rovers from Dundee United in 2011.
The Scot, who has won three caps for his country, failed to recapture his form in Dingwall, where he only started four times and had a further five appearances from the substitutes' bench, scoring once.
Brown, who signed after leaving Cheltenham in 2014, has played 13 times since Danny Ward was recalled from his loan spell by Liverpool in January.
He had found himself preferred to fellow 31-year-old Englishman Collin, who only played three times during his loan spell.
The 20-year-old Rose played seven times on loan to Forfar Athletic in League One before lasting 45 minutes of his debut in a 3-0 defeat by St Johnstone in April.
Meanwhile, four members of the under-20s squad have left the club - striker Kalvin Orsi and defenders Lukas Culjak, Sam Robertson and Liam Lambert.
