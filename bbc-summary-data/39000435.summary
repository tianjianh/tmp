[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 1-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Mowbray's first game in charge of Blackburn Rovers ended in a draw as Marvin Sordell's strike earned fellow strugglers Burton Albion a point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Matty Palmer own goal from a Rovers corner gave the visitors the lead in a first half which they dominated.
But Sordell curled in a superb equaliser to draw the Brewers level.
The result was enough to lift Albion above Wolves - who lost to Birmingham - into 19th place, while Blackburn remain 23rd, but have two games in hand.
Burton are now unbeaten in three matches thanks to two wins and two draws from their past five Championship games.
Their hopes of avoiding defeat were hit as Palmer's unfortunate own goal from Danny Graham's set-piece saw Mowbray's side take the lead after an impressive opening period.
But the hosts responded and Sordell's first Burton goal - a stunning 20-yard strike - changed the momentum.
And although Rovers remained good value for at least a point, Burton were only denied a dramatic win in injury-time when Lasse Vigen Christensen's shot hit both posts and was gathered by grateful visiting keeper Jason Steele.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough: "After the first half it is definitely a point gained.
"I thought Blackburn were magnificent in the first half and we couldn't get near them in any shape or form.
"We were hoping to get in 1-0 and, even after they scored, not concede a second. They were that good. We looked tired. It's been a hard week for us but we came out and changed it around a bit in the second half and deserved the equaliser.
"We were then an inch off winning it late on which we didn't deserve to do - but it would have been nice."
Blackburn Rovers boss Tony Mowbray: "My dressing room is sitting there disappointed that they haven't taken three points.
"We probably deserved more than a one-goal lead at half-time with the efforts that we had and the territorial advantage in the first half.
"I think you have to give credit to Nigel Clough for changing his [team's] shape, changing the direction of the football match.
"We got a grip of it in the last 20 minutes and I thought if anyone was going to win it then it was going to be us. Then they nearly scored right at the death, hitting both posts. It would have been an injustice if we hadn't taken something from this game."
