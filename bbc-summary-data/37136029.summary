The Michael Dods-trained filly, ridden by Paul Mulrennan, went clear of 2-1 favourite Limato to win by two lengths, to the delight of owner David Metcalfe.
Frankie Dettori finally got on the scoreboard for the festival, riding Rivet in the Convivial Maiden Stakes.
However, Dettori's win was upstaged by runner-up Contrapposto, a Clive Washbourn-owned 50-1 shot.
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
"Mecca's Angel - named after her father Dark Angel and owner David Metcalfe's long-term nickname - was simply outstanding here, winning a better-quality race than she did last year in one of the fastest times in the five-furlong (1,000-metre) trophy's distinguished history.
"She did it with total authority over a recent Group One winner in Limato, and though that horse is a six-furlong specialist, the winner wasn't stopping at the end, and had they gone further who knows what might have happened.
"Despite plenty of success, the likes of Dods and Mulrennan don't get masses of recognition in a competitive world so this was a personal triumph for both."
