The final of this year's Great British Bake Off is upon us, with only three bakers remaining.

The finale, which airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, looks set to become the most watched episode in the show's history, after 10 million tuned in to see last week's chocolate challenge.
Last year's final, won by Nancy Birtwhistle, was watched by 13.3 million viewers. That made it the biggest show of the year, beaten only by England playing Uruguay in the football World Cup.
More than 13,000 people applied this year, from which 12 hopefuls made it into the tent.
Here's a closer look at the last bakers standing:
Nadiya, 30, from Leeds, has been baking for 10 years after wondering why her father only served ice cream for dessert at his restaurant.
Her family is originally from Bangladesh, where desserts aren't a big feature of mealtimes, but she was encouraged to bake by a school home economics teacher.
According to bookmakers William Hill, Nadiya is favourite to win, with odds of 2/5. "It will take a strong soufflÃ© to knock her off the top spot," said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly.
Ian, 41, from Cambridgeshire is a renowned travel photographer and the Dalai Lama's personal photographer when he is in the UK.
Ian's passion for foraging and travelling the world mean he's never afraid to bake with an unusual discovery from his garden - or much further afield. Ian is looking like second favourite to win with odds of 7/2.
Tamal, 29, grew up in Hertfordshire where his parents moved to from India in the 1960s. Now a trainee anaesthetist working in Manchester, his older sister taught him to bake - even asking him to create her wedding cake.
Tamal is the current outsider, with 5/1 odds of coming out on top.
