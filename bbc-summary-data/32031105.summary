Phil Cook, of the Association of UK Course Measurers, re-measured it after runners questioned the distance.
Mr Cook said he could not pinpoint a specific location where an error was made by organisers.
He said: "This obviously doesn't affect people who ran for charity. But if it was for an official time, unfortunately you haven't got it."
The event, held on Sunday 1 March, was criticised by some runners after they found their personal best times were faster than expected.
After concerns were raised, St David's Hospice, which organised the race, said it believed the distance was correct.
Chief executive Emma Saysell said: "As far as we're concerned the course was measured by an accredited professional.
"The course length was accurate based on what they told us."
