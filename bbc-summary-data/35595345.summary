Braintree Town are performing a "football miracle" by being two points off the National League play-offs, according to Iron boss Danny Cowley.

The Iron's 2-0 loss to lowly Boreham Wood left them seventh, but with a game in hand over fifth-placed Dover.
"You have to remember we're Braintree Town. Look at the clubs around us, the infrastructure, the size, the fact that they're full-time," he said.
"I see what the boys have done thus far as being a football miracle."
Tuesday's loss to the Wood came after a run of three wins from four for a side that also took League Two promotion hopefuls Oxford to an FA Cup first-round replay this season.
Cowley, who took charge in the summer, has previously criticised the scheduling of National League matches.
He continued to BBC Essex: "We've got ourselves in a great position and given ourselves a foundation and we'll work very hard and see where it takes us.
"But I don't see the play-offs as being a reality, not for this football club. That's not to say we won't be trying very hard to be in and around it, but I always think there has to be a touch of realism."
