Leading Indian activist Kavitha Krishnan has become the target of internet ire after a disparaging tweet against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Ms Krishnan had tweeted, "Careful before sharing #SelfieWithDaughter with #LameDuckPM. He has a record of stalking daughters."
Mr Modi had, in his monthly radio address to the nation, asked people to send in selfies with their daughters.
He is fronting a movement to save and educate girl children in the country.
The tag #SelfieWithDaughter had begun trending soon after Mr Modi's radio address ended, with over 20,000 people submitting pictures.
A small village in Haryana had begun the campaign, asking people to send in selfies with their daughters to win a prize. Over 800 people had participated in the initiative.
Ms Krishnan's tweet enraged Mr Modi's supporters on Twitter, who tweeted back at her, condemning her for her remarks.
The sheer volume of tweets directed at her and referencing her, meant that Ms Krishnan's name began trending on Twitter, along with  #SelfieWithDaughter and #MannKiBaat which is the name of the prime minister's radio show.
Many of the tweets were highly abusive, sometimes accompanied with threats of violence. Ms Krishnan has taken to retweeting some of the most offensive.
Ms Krishnan told BBC Hindi that she "welcomed" these reactions because they "expose the mindset of these men who are actually anti-women".
She said she did not feel isolated or scared since she had also received a lot of support with Twitter users pointing out that the stream of abuse directed at the activist contradicted the #SelfieWithDaughter tag, that many of them had been using.
Ms Krishnan was not the only high-profile woman attacking Mr Modi's new initiative.
Actress Shruti Seth also delivered a salvo of scathing tweets at the prime minister, asking him to "be more than a photograph".
Like Ms Krishnan, Ms Seth was also at the receiving end of a wave of online abuse. She retweeted some of the more offensive ones and responded to a few.
Mr Modi has a huge army of online followers, who fight many battles on his behalf, and react violently to any criticism of him.
They were particularly active during his successful election campaign in 2014.
Ms Krishnan's tweet was in reference to a 2013 incident entitled "snoopgate" by local media.
Two news outlets said they had accessed audio recordings containing telephone conversations in which the president of the ruling BJP Amit Shah (then general secretary) was directing the illegal surveillance of a young woman in 2009.
According to the recordings, the surveillance of the woman had been ordered by someone called "saheb" (sir) which was assumed to be a reference to Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.
The matter of illegal surveillance was taken up by the Supreme Court, which directed the petitioner to drop the "scandalous charges" against the prime minister.
