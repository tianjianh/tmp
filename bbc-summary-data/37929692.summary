Keen mountain biker Keiran McKandie, 16, from Elgin, died after the crash with a car on the B9010 Forres to Kellas Road in March.
His parents Sandra and Gordon McKandie, and family and friends, have been fundraising to buy the defibrillators.
They will be installed in police emergency response vehicles.
North East Police Division officers have started being trained how to use the equipment.
Mrs McKandie said: "Because Keiran was in a rural area when his accident happened the police were first on the scene and had they had a defibrillator there is a chance his life might have been saved.
"This is about maintaining a legacy for Keiran. Our hope is that through his sacrifice other lives may be saved.
"It is appropriate that the police will now have these defibrillators installed and that is something positive from such a tragic event.
"Nothing can compensate for Keiran not physically being in our lives anymore but the fact that these defibrillators are located in emergency response police vehicles will enable others in a critical condition to have an increased chance of survival."
Ch Insp Louise Blakelock said: "We are extremely grateful to Keiran's family for the generous donation of ten defibrillator machines which will be carried in our road policing vehicles in the north east.
"The McKandie family are to be commended for their dedication to the fundraising campaign during such difficult times and these defibrillators will provide something positive from this tragic incident.
"A number of officers have been trained in the use of the defibrillators today, with more to follow and this will allow our road policing officers to provide enhanced medical aid if required when they are first on the scene of serious incidents."
Euan Esslemont, head of ambulance services for the area, said: "We will work with Police Scotland to quickly evaluate the success of this wonderful initiative from the McKandie family and seek opportunities to spread co-responding across Grampian and other remote and rural areas across Scotland."
