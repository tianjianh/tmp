Patients and their families affected by breast cancer, together with a charity, have asked MSPs to help stop women dying from the disease by 2050.

Breast Cancer Now Scotland said almost 10,000 Scottish women could die from breast cancer in the next ten years.
Colin Leslie lost his fiancee Sharon last year. He said: "From the outset we both knew there wasn't a cure."
But he added: "We remained hopeful that we would find drugs that would give Sharon a decent quality of life."
Colin started running marathons for breast cancer research and has asked MSPs to commit to holding trials to find breakthroughs in treatment.
The campaign has called for the Scottish government and MSPs to support the following aims:
It has been estimated that a woman is five times more likely to survive breast cancer if it is caught at its earliest stage.
Four in 10 breast cancers in the UK could be prevented by adopting healthier lifestyles.
Women taking part in a study funded by the Chief Scientist Office, were offered a one hour face-to-face consultation with a lifestyle coach when they attended their mammogram appointment.
The support also included follow-up calls for 12 weeks to help them in their chosen lifestyle goals. Some women were given pedometers to help monitor their progress.
The study found that it helped with weight loss, improved physical activity and reduced waist size.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "We are committed to enhancing research into breast cancer.
"We recently announced a Â£450,000 joint partnership with Breast Cancer Now which will allow for more Scottish-led research.
"Our Â£39m Detect Cancer Early programme is focused on diagnosing the illness at an earlier stage when chances of survival are higher.
"Currently the number of people in Scotland living for at least five years after a cancer diagnosis has reached a record high."
