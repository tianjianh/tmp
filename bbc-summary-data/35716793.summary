Northern Ireland actor James Nesbitt has admitted he had "a little bit too much hospitality" while attending boxer Carl Frampton's world title fight.

The County Antrim-born star was in high spirits during Saturday night's fight and appeared to slur his speech during a TV interview in the boxing arena.
Nesbitt said that the next day, he felt like he too "had been through 12 gruelling rounds" with Frampton.
He sent belated congratulations to the boxer via the BBC's Nolan Show.
"I was hoping to congratulate you on the night, but was unable to speak to you," Nesbitt said.
"But to be fair I was unable to speak - a little bit too much hospitality beforehand.
"What a performance, and indeed you weren't bad either," he joked.
Nesbitt was in the crowd in Manchester Arena to support Frampton, alongside some other well-known faces from Northern Ireland including County Antrim jockey Sir Anthony McCoy and Irish football manager Martin O'Neill.
The actor's impaired speech was the subject of much comment on Twitter, with comedian Jake O'Kane speculating: "The big question tonight is will Jimmy Nesbitt hit the canvass before Quigg or Frampton?"
Frampton beat Scott Quigg via a split decision in Manchester to add the WBA super-bantamweight title to the IBF title he already owned.
The actor recorded a video message to the new world champion, while taking a break from working on location in Singapore, saying it was as far away as he could get after his TV interview on Saturday night.
"We are incredibly proud of you, and indeed on Sunday morning I felt as if I too had been through 12 gruelling rounds with the world champion - Northern Ireland's very own Carl Frampton," Nesbitt said.
"Everyone is so proud, well done."
