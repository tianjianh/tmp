Torquay United 0-0 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere were forced to hold on for a 0-0 draw at Torquay after going down to nine men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Micky Mellon's side showed no signs of a hangover from May's National League play-off heartache as James Norwood and Liam Ridehalgh both went close within the first five minutes.
From there Torquay, who avoided relegation on the final day of last season, restricted Tranmere to half chances and deserved to go in 0-0 at the break.
But Tranmere's hopes of seizing the early initiative in the title race took a blow when Steve McNulty saw red after 55 minutes for a second yellow, before Norwood's red card after 85 minutes left them grateful for a point.
