RTÉ said Pegida, an "anti-Islamisation" group, announced an Irish branch at a protest rally in the city centre on Saturday afternoon.
However, it added that a counter protest also took place.
Protesters are reported to have pursued several men they believed to be Pegida members from O'Connell Street to North Earl Street before police stepped in.
RTÉ reports that there were a number of confrontations between police in public order equipment and protesters on Saturday.
It is understood an RTÉ cameraman was injured during one incident.
