The men were attacked while sitting in a parked Renault Megane at 19:30 BST on Sunday.
Officers found the car driver with stab wounds after reports of a disturbance in Braintree Road, Dagenham.
The man, who has not yet been formally identified, was treated by paramedics but died at the scene.
The CCTV footage shows the first vehicle smashing into the back of the car before a second vehicle pulls up alongside to block any possible escape.
The attackers can be seen wielding what look like baseball bats.
A Met spokesperson said no arrests had been made and officers were in the process of informing the next of kin.
One resident told BBC London he heard a commotion and saw a group of five people running off in the opposite direction from the scene of the attack.
