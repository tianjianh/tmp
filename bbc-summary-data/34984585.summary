The former world champions, who have had equipment issues in Melbourne, cannot be caught by third-placed Italy.
Defending world champions Liesl Tesch and Dan Fitzgibbon took gold with a day to spare in front of their home fans.
"I think realistically this morning we knew that [silver] was the best that could happen," said Birrell.
"We sailed over some weed on day two, and then we had a problem with Alex's canting seat.
"We have to respect the fact that [the Australians] sailed really well this week and deserve their world title.
"I think the scores would have been a lot closer had it not been for the seat issue and the weed.  That being said, they sailed really well and we're going to have to find some more."
