Stormont's health minister has invested an initial £175,000 towards setting up a "world-leading" mental health trauma service in Northern Ireland.

Simon Hamilton said Northern Ireland had a "wealth of experience" in dealing with mental trauma during the Troubles that the new service could build on.
He has been working on the plan since last year, but the funding announcement coincided with a mental health summit.
The cash will meet "early set-up costs" to get the service "off the ground".
The minister said the first aim of establishing the new service was to "comprehensively address the legacy of the Troubles and address un-met mental health needs".
Mr Hamilton will attend the opening day of the mental health summit, hosted by Action Mental Health.
He described the issue as an "absolute priority" for his department and added Northern Ireland was the "only part of the UK to see an increase in spending by trusts on mental health in the last two years".
"While our mental health services have come a long way in the last decade, we have much more to do and I am committed to further reform and innovation," the minister said.
In 2013, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt proposed that an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre in County Antrim.
Mr Nesbitt, who has campaigned for better mental health provision, made the suggestion after £18m in EU funding was withdrawn due to political disagreements over the peace centre on the former prison site.
