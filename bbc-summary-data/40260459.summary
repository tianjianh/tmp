British and Irish Lions: We're all in this together, says Dan Biggar

Fly-half Dan Biggar says there is no split in the British and Irish Lions' squad between players likely to play in Tests and those set for midweek games.

The Lions lost to the Highlanders on Tuesday, their second defeat from four matches on their tour of New Zealand.
But Wales' Biggar, who played 68 minutes in Dunedin, refuted the suggestion there is a divide developing between the Lions' weekend and midweek teams.
"We're all in this together," he said.
"Whether it's boys who play Wednesday or Saturday, boys who back it up on the bench, whatever it is, everyone's in this together.
"If we win on Saturday it's a 41 [original squad number] effort, if we lose on Wednesday it's a team effort as well.
"That's been the mindset from day one and it's certainly not going to change now. We've got to stick together and try to build momentum with an incredibly tough game on Saturday up in Rotorua [against the Maori All Blacks] as well."
Biggar, 27, has previously said his Lions fly-half rivals Owen Farrell and Johnny Sexton deserve to be a "fraction" ahead of him in the race for Test selection.
The Wales and Ospreys player returned from a head injury to produce a solid display against the Highlanders, despite the Lions' defeat.
Biggar's performance may have provided some food for thought for England's Farrell and Ireland's Sexton, who have been the subject of debate over who should start for the Lions.
But after Tuesday's defeat in Dunedin, the Welshman's overriding feeling was frustration.
"It's massively frustrating. We managed to build a positive lead, we were in a good position, playing some good stuff, but we let ourselves down by not closing the game out," said Biggar.
"Ultimately it's the Test series which is most important but it's frustrating for the squad, in terms of having to start again and build that momentum back up.
"There were lots of positives in the game but, ultimately, we've got to be harsh on ourselves in that last 14 or 15 minutes, whatever it was, in terms of tightening up things."
