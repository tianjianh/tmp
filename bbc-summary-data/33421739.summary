A 24-hour Tube strike is set to start from Wednesday evening after transport unions rejected the latest pay offer from London Underground (LU).

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and Unite are planning to walk out at 18:30 BST.
ASLEF drivers will strike from 21:30.
LU and the unions had been trying to reach a deal over the introduction of the new night Tube service.
It is unclear if talks will resume later. LU said it will be available for talks at ACAS but the unions have yet to decide whether they will attend or not.
On Monday LU made an increased but "final" pay offer in a bid to avert the action, including a 2% rise this year and £2,000 for drivers on the night Tube.
The service is due to start at weekends from mid-September.
Finn Brennan, a senior negotiator for Aslef, said unions were not given enough time to consider the proposals.
"This is playground negotiating. Having made no offer for three months they give four unions one afternoon to consider a new offer," he said.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT made it clear yesterday that we are prepared to continue the talks process in line with the normal industrial relations procedure.
"That of course means that the detailed offer submitted by LU yesterday must remain on the table as a key part of the talks framework, and the union issues on a coherent package that addresses work/life balance, equality and safety have to be on the agenda as well."
The TSSA union also rejected the offer and general secretary Manuel Cortes said: "This dispute is not just about pay but about how to run a safe and secure night Tube which serves the passengers as well as rewarding the staff."
LU chief operating officer Steve Griffiths said in a message to staff on Monday that a "full and final" offer had been made in an attempt to conclude five months of talks.
Mr Griffiths said he had set the deadline so if industrial action was called off LU could plan to provide the "best possible service" to customers.
He added: "We are not asking staff to work unlimited nights and weekends. Most of you will not be affected at all by night Tube when it's launched in September."
LU's latest offer included an average 2% increase on basic pay, RPI inflation or 1%, whichever is greater, in 2016 and 2017, a £500 non-consolidated "launch bonus" to all staff on night Tube lines or at stations serving these lines.
Transport bosses also offered a £2,000 "transition bonus" for drivers working on the overnight services.
Previously a 0.75% pay increase with an additional payment of £250 for drivers was offered.
Almost 20,000 workers are due to take part in the industrial action.
