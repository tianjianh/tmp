Middleweight world champion Gennady Golovkin is closing in on a deal to fight Britain's Chris Eubank Jr, his promoter says.

Tom Loeffler told the Associated Press that both camps were "working on finalising details".
The fight would take place in England in September, he added.
WBC, WBA and IBF champion Golovkin, 34, has won all of his 35 fights while Brighton's Eubank Jr, 26, has lost just one of his 24 fights.
He successfully defended his British middleweight title for the first time last week, with a fourth-round stoppage of the previously unbeaten Tom Doran.
