Motorists also made slow progress after the game, with stop-start traffic on the M4 eastbound between J29 and 26 and on the A48 Eastern Avenue in Cardiff.
An overturned lorry on the A470 north of Cardiff also affected traffic on the M4 at J32, highways officials said.
Arriva Trains Wales issued live travel updates online as fans headed home.
Australia beat Fiji 28-13.
Supporters arriving by car before kick-off endured eight miles of stop-start traffic which was reported on the M4 from junctions 23a to 25a.
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb told rail bosses to "fix" overcrowding problems after issues at Saturday's Ireland-Canada game.
He said: "I think Cardiff has already got a reputation as the best city in Europe in which to watch rugby and we don't want any transport-related issues undermining the hard-earned reputation that we're acquiring as a great host city for international events... there are loads and loads of big pluses, but let's fix this."
Lynne Milligan, of Arriva Trains Wales, said: "Based on travel demand data and on Saturday evening's experience, we are predicting around 35,000 people wanting to travel back by train after the match.
"We can move on average 10,000 people per hour through our queuing system but unfortunately for some of the busier queues, this could mean up to a three hour wait."
But Dan Panes from Great Western Railway said it was not putting on additional seats, on top of the 10 extra services.
This is after it apologised for underestimating passenger numbers on Saturday calling the situation "embarrassing". The firm put on 8,000 extra seats for Ireland's match against Canada, but had to add 1,500 extra seats.
