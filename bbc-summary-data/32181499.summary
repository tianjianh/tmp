Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell is "getting stronger each day" after being taken to hospital earlier this week, a statement published on her website says.

The 71-year-old was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home on Tuesday afternoon.
A statement released on her website late on Friday said the singer was "resting comfortably".
It is still not clear what Joni Mitchell is being treated for.
"We are encouraged by her progress and she continues to improve and get stronger each day," the statement said.
In December, Canadian-born Joni Mitchell told Billboard magazine that she had a rare skin condition, Morgellons disease, which prevented her from performing.
"I can't sing any more - don't miss it. I can't play any more - don't miss it. I've got all these instruments laying around and hopefully one day I'll pick them up," she was quoted as saying.
Morgellons is a controversial condition and is not recognised by mainstream medical authorities.
Sufferers say it is characterised by crawling and stinging sensations under the skin but many in the medical community believe it is a psychiatric disorder.
