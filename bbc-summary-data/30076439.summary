The highly-anticipated track had been the subject of countless discussions across the news over the weekend.
The updated lyrics were announced and the musicians went to the studio - all that was left was to see the new video.
So now that it has been revealed, what does everyone think? And will it go straight to number one, as Bob Geldof anticipates?
Speaking of Bob, he introduced the video from The X Factor stage, warning viewers that he and Simon Cowell had decided to show some graphic images, to illustrate what the Ebola crisis has done in West Africa.
"This is hardcore, to allow The X Factor nation to watch this," he said.
"This is the most anti-human disease but we can stop it and we will stop it.
"It could be here. It could be a British problem. Buy this thing [the song]. Don't get it free."
Appearing fifth in the video, Paloma Faith tweeted an appeal to her followers to help the cause.
"Honoured to be a part of #BandAid30 - join us to help our sisters & brothers," she wrote.
The YouTuber was in the chorus for the song and has already described the experience of recording the video as "surreal".
"How amazing was that track! Bob Geldof is one amazing guy," she tweeted after the track aired.
As well as featuring in the video for the Band Aid 30 song, Olly also performed his new track on The X Factor.
Bob Geldof apologised to him, saying that Wrapped Up would be "caned" in the charts by Do They Know It's Christmas?
Like a number of the people involved, Jessie Ware encouraged her fans to watch the ITV show to see the first play of Do They Know It's Christmas?
The video that was shown on The X Factor was the first cut and the final version will be shared on Monday 17 November at 8am.
Zoella's fellow YouTuber also appeared in the chorus for the song - they were seen in the video standing near to Ed Sheeran.
