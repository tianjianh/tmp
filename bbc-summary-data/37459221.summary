[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 2-3 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Colkett hit the stoppage-time winner as Bristol Rovers beat Northampton Town in a see-saw League One affair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had early chances in a frantic opening spell, Matt Taylor testing Rovers goalkeeper Kelle Roos with a free-kick while Ellis Harrison's overhead kick forced Adam Smith into action.
The Cobblers took a ninth-minute lead when Smith's long clearance caught out the Rovers defence and Alex Revell raced clear to lob the advancing Roos from the edge of the box.
Rovers responded well with Ollie Clarke firing wide but Northampton almost doubled their advantage through Sam Hoskins on the stroke of half-time.
Rovers improved after the restart and it took a goal-line clearance from Taylor to keep out Harrison's header. But Rovers equalised on the hour mark when Chris Lines found Rory Gaffney whose low drive flew into the net off Taylor.
Gaffney went close when his close-range effort was blocked by Gabriel Zakuani and substitute Billy Bodin fired wide from the edge of the box.
Rovers duly took a 71st-minute lead when Colkett's far-post corner found Peter Hartley, whose header was too powerful for Smith to keep out. But the lead lasted only five minutes as substitute Kenji Gorre released Revell who beat Roos with a neat finish.
The game opened up with both sides going for the winner. Bodin tested Smith who then thwarted Gaffney with a superb save while Roos tipped away Gorre's rasping drive.
Zakuani was sent off for a second caution and Smith palmed away Colkett's ensuing free-kick. But Rovers won it in stoppage time when the Cobblers failed to clear and Colkett fired home from 10 yards out.
