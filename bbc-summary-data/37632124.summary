The company said it was consulting workers about restructuring proposals to "ensure we continue to deliver a sustainable and competitive service".
BA expected to find volunteers to go from more than 700 workers at the base.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the proposals were "worrying" and feared for the firm's "long term future in the Vale".
"Just last year the operation received a boost when it was chosen to work on the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, so this news does come as something of a surprise," said Mr Davies, who represents the area as a South Wales Central AM.
Skills Minister Julie James told the Senedd on Wednesday that the Welsh Government was "working closely" with BA as it sought volunteers for redundancy, saying Jobcentre Plus and Careers Wales would be asked to support all staff affected.
Plaid Cymru's Shadow Economy Secretary Adam Price said it was "clearly unwelcome news in deeply uncertain economic times" and a "serious blow" to the aerospace sector.
