The family of a 59-year-old woman missing for two weeks have laid lowers at the place she was last seen on CCTV.

Sally Allan left her home in Ponteland, Northumberland, early on the morning of Boxing Day, wearing pyjamas and a waterproof jacket.
Three hours later she was filmed by CCTV on Newcastle's Quayside, and with no further sightings it is now believed she went into the water.
More than 100 people turned up for a minute's silence and to lay flowers.
The disappearance of the mother-of three sparked a major search operation, involving many local people, in her home town.
Then after CCTV images emerged, police divers searched a section of the River Tyne, but drew a blank.
Her family said it was possible she could have been suffering from mental health problems, and set up a fundraising page for the charity Mind, which has more than doubled the initial target of Â£5,000.
