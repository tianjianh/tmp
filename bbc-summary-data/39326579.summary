Ben Te'o: Worcester's England centre 'touch and go' to be fit for Wasps game

England centre Ben Te'o says he is "touch and go" to play for Worcester Warriors in Sunday's key Premiership game at leaders Wasps.

After coming off the bench in the 63rd minute of England's defeat by Ireland in Dublin, Te'o was then led off with concussion following a head injury.
"I'm following concussion protocols," Te'o told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"I need to get back out there as soon as I'm fit and ready, but this week will be touch and go."
The 30-year-old New Zealand-born rugby league convert has won more caps for England this season (eight) than he has played Premiership matches for Worcester (six).
He suffered another concussion injury early in the season, prior to England's autumn internationals, which ruled him out for three matches.
With five Premiership games left to play, 11th-placed Worcester are seven points clear of bottom club Bristol, who have the chance to close the gap when they host Gloucester on Friday (19:45 GMT).
Te'o said England's celebrations were muted in Dublin on Saturday as the Six Nations title winners missed out on a second successive Grand Slam and their long winning run under coach Eddie Jones was ended.
But he remains positive about his own international future, having played in all five of England's games in the Six Nations and scored two tries for his adopted country.
The first of them was his late game-changer as a replacement when England rallied to beat France in their opening match at Twickenham, before scoring in his only start against Italy.
"Ireland are a class team," Te'o added. "They're well coached and they played pretty well. But you could see the looks on our guys' faces at the presentation.
"They still had a good night but I had to settle for room service in my hotel room as I had concussion.
"And it's all still been massive for me. I got to go to Australia last summer, I've played in the Six Nations and now I'm going back to my club to keep trying to improve, then hopefully go on the summer tour to Argentina."
