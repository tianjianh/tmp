Smith, 19, made 25 appearances last season to help the Tykes win promotion to the second tier with victory in the League One play-offs.
The defender also played four games during a month-long loan to League Two side Crawley earlier this year.
"I'm delighted to bring Smith to Gateshead," said boss Neil Aspin.
"He's a player who has played a good number of games for Barnsley for one so young."
The signing takes Neil Aspin's tally of summer signings to 13.
