Clinton emails to be released in January

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US Department of State has told a federal court that it would like to release emails from Hillary Clinton's private email server in January 2016.

But the judge called for a rolling release of the documents and ordered the State Department to develop a timetable by next week.
Ms Clinton said on Tuesday she wants them released as soon as possible.
The timing for the release could prove tricky for her campaign.
Since launching her bid to be president, Ms Clinton has been on the defensive about her use of the server to conduct official business while she was secretary of state.
"I want those emails out," Ms Clinton told reporters while campaigning in Iowa.
The agency says it will publish some of the 55,000 pages of emails online.
The State Department proposed the date in court documents filed on Monday night. The documents were in response to a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) request made by Vice News.
The proposed date falls just a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses and other early state primary elections.
Ms Clinton's emails could be released at a highly combustible point on the US political calendar. Just over two weeks later Iowa will become the first of a long line of states to cast the votes that will eventually determine the identities of the two major presidential party nominees.
The pack of Republican candidates will certainly latch on to whatever nuggets they find in this new trove of information, hoping to prove to their voters that they are the most skilled at levelling attacks on Ms Clinton.
And while the former secretary of state will almost certainly still be the prohibitive favourite for the Democratic nomination come January, the media coverage of the email release and the political heat generated from Republicans could prove an unwanted distraction in the days leading up to her first appearance on a ballot in nearly eight years.
John Hackett, the state department official in charge of handling Foia requests, said the 55,00 pages of emails were delivered in paper form and would require time to review before their release.
"Given the breadth and importance of the many foreign policy issues on which the secretary of state and the department work, the review of these materials will likely require consultation with a broad range of subject matter experts within the department and other agencies, as well as potentially with foreign governments," he said.
Ms Clinton voluntarily turned over emails from the server after discarding the ones she deemed personal.
