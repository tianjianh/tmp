RNLI lifeguards at beaches across south and west Wales are now at their full complement for the summer season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From Saturday, there is full staffing of more than 170 lifeguards covering 32 beaches in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and the Vale of Glamorgan.
The summer season runs until September.
Lifeguard manager Stuart Thompson said people should "choose a lifeguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags."
