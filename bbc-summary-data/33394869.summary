Two charged over shotgun fired in Belfast playground

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two people have appeared in court charged in connection with a shotgun being fired at a playground in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Larmour, 26, of Rathvarna Drive in Lisburn, was charged with firing a gun and assaulting a police officer.
He was also charged with possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and having a loaded gun while drunk or under the influence of drugs, as was Tatjana Glusecenko, 34, of no fixed abode but originally from Russia.
They were both remanded in custody.
More than a dozen children were in the park at Dover Street, off the Shankill Road, on Thursday when it was reported that a shot was fired into the air.
The children raised the alarm, and a number of local residents detained the people that they believed were responsible until the police arrived.
A police constable told Belfast Magistrates Court he believed he could connect the pair to the charges.
Mr Larmour appeared in the dock with a severely bruised right eye and was using his jumper as a makeshift sling for his right arm.
No bail applications were lodged, and they were remanded in custody to appear in court again on Monday.
