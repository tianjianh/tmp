Chelsea midfielder Oscar says he is "90% certain" to move to Chinese Super League club Shanghai SIPG in January.

The fee for the 25-year-old Brazilian midfielder would be around £60m. He joined the Blues from Internacional for £25m in 2012.
Oscar started the first five league games under Antonio Conte but has only played four times since September.
"It just depends on a few bureaucratic details," Oscar told Sportv in his homeland.
Conte did not deny Oscar's claim when asked about the situation following Chelsea's 1-0 win at Sunderland.
"The situation with Oscar, I think it will be clearer in the next days," said Conte, who did not name the Brazilian in his 18-man squad for Wednesday's match.
"Oscar started the season very well with us when we played with a 4-3-3.
"Then when I switched to another system, another formation, he didn't play a lot. But I always counted on him because Oscar is a really good player.
"He's young, but sometimes there are situations that are very difficult to face."
The mooted move would reunite Oscar with former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas, who is now in charge at Shanghai.
Oscar has played 202 games for Chelsea, scoring 38 goals, and has won the Premier League, Europa League and League Cup.
