Norovirus closes another hospital ward at Weston General

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A further outbreak of norovirus has led to the closure of a fourth ward at Weston General Hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three wards - Uphill, Berrow and Kewstoke - were closed earlier this week because of the winter vomiting bug.
Kewstoke ward was reopened on Friday but another outbreak has now led to the closure of Cheddar ward.
Visitors have been asked to stay away unless absolutely necessary and restrictions have been put in place.
Director of Nursing and infection control Chris Perry said: "Norovirus is extremely infectious.
"It is bought into the hospital from the community and so people coming into the hospital carrying the bug can easily transmit it to our patients.
"This is why we are urging people only to come here if their visit is absolutely essential."
