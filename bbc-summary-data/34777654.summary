Night-vision goggles for Stafford dog poo patrols

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Night-vision goggles are to be used by council staff to catch dog owners who do not clean up after their pets.

The Â£200 "monocular", which has a built-in laser illuminator to improve viewing in the dark, will be used by Stafford Borough Council inspectors.
During winter months it is more difficult to catch irresponsible dog owners, the council said.
Staff members who use the monocular will be uniformed and wear a badge, a spokesman added.

"The only people who should be worried (about this) are the inconsiderate dog owners who are not clearing up after their dogs," a spokesman said.
Previous council schemes have involved people ringing a phone line to highlight the worst-hit areas.
Staff are already targeting these "hotspots", the council said, but have found it difficult since the clocks went back.
Councillor Frank Finlay, cabinet member for environment and health, said the council had tremendous support from the community to get rid of this "disgusting crime".
"These night-vision goggles will help us overcome this problem and let people know that, even under the cover of darkness, they cannot get away with showing blatant disregard to their fellow citizens," he said.
