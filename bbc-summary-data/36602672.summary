US election: Donald Trump's first 100 days in office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republican Donald Trump has set out what he will prioritise in office, if he beats Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"There is one common theme in all of these reforms. It's going to be America First," he said in a broad-ranging speech in New York.
Here is his plan for the first 100 days:
Mr Trump has pledged to appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution and thinks "radical" judges that could be appointed by Hillary Clinton would "virtually abolish" the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.
There is a vacancy in the Supreme Court because former justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, died earlier this year.
Mr Trump has said undocumented immigrants in the US take jobs that US citizens could have.
Controversially, he has also said repeatedly - although not in this speech - that he would build a wall on the southern border that Mexico would pay for, to stop Mexico's criminals and rapists from coming to the US.
He also wants to ban Muslims from entering the country in an attempt to prevent terrorism, a move that has provoked fierce criticism from within his own party.
Mr Trump has said there should be less regulation of energy production and that the US should drill more for oil and gas.
He said the country's energy potential remains "untapped".
Mr Trump has called Obamacare a disaster and that he pledges to repeal and replace it. He says it is a job-killer and ineffective.
Obamacare, which is actually the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is President Barack Obama's signature law and aims to extend health insurance to those in the country that do not have it.
He has threatened to raise taxes on US-based companies that have moved operations overseas, like Pfizer, Ford and Nabisco.
He said lowering taxes for all - businesses and people - would create millions of new jobs.
Mr Trump declared in his New York speech, wrongly, that the US has the highest taxes in the world. Politifact says it is actually ranked near the bottom among OECD countries.
His tax plan would not raise taxes on the top earners in the US.
He said Mrs Clinton ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund and that she is responsible for the death of American diplomats in Benghazi, and that she was a destabilising force in the Middle East.
Mr Trump has also criticised her use of personal email while working as secretary of state.
Mrs Clinton said the speech was "more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories".
Trade deals with other countries are "killing" the country, he has said, and that he will defend the US against countries that "cheat" on trade like China.
