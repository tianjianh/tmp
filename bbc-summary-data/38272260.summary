[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 3-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County will be the Football League's bottom club on Christmas Day after losing at Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles trailed to James Collins' third minute opener, before Joss Ladabie's leveller gave them hope.
However, the hosts took control with two quickfire second half goals, as Josh Yowerth and Jimmy Smith scored twice in four minutes.
Newport's Josh Sheehan missed a late penalty in a bad-tempered affair that saw 13 players receive yellow cards.
Newport County boss Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "We were ill-disciplined and I think that came from a lack of work ethic.
"When I walked in the door I knew it was going to be a difficult job. There hadn't been a lot of winning going on.
"You can't just turn off a tap when people are used to losing.
"We have spoken a lot of home truths in the dressing room. We have not been good enough this season."
