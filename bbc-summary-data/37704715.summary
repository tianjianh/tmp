Prosecutors say a review of possible charges in the case of a man found fatally injured at an ex-fashion executive's home has proved "extremely difficult".

Ricci Gallagher, 46, died in July 2015, a week after he was found at a farmhouse owned by Richard Glanville.
In April, Mr Glanville and another man arrested on suspicion of murder were told they would face no further action.
Prosecutors said the case's "specific circumstances" made it difficult.
Mr Glanville worked for Aurora Fashions, a holding company that owned high street brands Oasis, Coast, Warehouse and Karen Millen until 2013.
Police were called to Mr Glanville's home minutes after Mr Gallagher had reported a fire at his property, about half a mile away in Blind Lane.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) issued a statement in response to a "right to review" request of its decision not to charge the two arrested men.
"We have considered the original evidence, as well as further evidence provided by Essex Police, and advice from independent Queen's Counsel," said Chief Prosecutor for the East of England, Jenny Hopkins.
"This has been an extremely difficult case to consider owing to its specific circumstances.
"The further evidence provided by the police has not strengthened the case to make a prosecution possible."
The service found there was also not enough evidence to prove there was "an intention to kill" or "an intention to do Mr Gallagher really serious bodily harm or some physical harm".
Ms Hopkins said she appreciated it was "disappointing news" for the person who applied for the review.
