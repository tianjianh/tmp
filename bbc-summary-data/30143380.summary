[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Youngsters in North Tyneside have voted to make mental health provision a campaign priority.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A meeting of the Youth Council hosted a debate on which campaign it wanted the "young mayor" to take forward for the next year.
Three issues were considered: voting rights for the under 16s; better provision for work experience; and mental health services to be improved.
After a debate, young councillors voted for the mental health care option.
The motion passed in the Make your Mark event was: "Mental health services and education should be improved, young people should be consulted on how this is done.
"Mental health education should be compulsory in our curriculum to provide information on common clinical conditions and to challenge stereotypes."
The event, presided over by councillor Tommy Mulvenna, chair of North Tyneside Council, was also attended by senior councillors and representatives from North Tyneside's two MPs.
