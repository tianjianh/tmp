[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire residents back second homes council tax plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Pembrokeshire have backed a plan to double the council tax charge on second homes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is consulting on proposals to save £40m over the next three years.
These include charging second home owners council tax at double the current total rate, under plans due to come into force this year.
Of the 562 respondents to the survey, 73% supported the move, compared to 16% who opposed it. A further 9% said they had no preference.
A council report said there were an estimated 3,000 second homes in the county and the move could raise "at least" an extra £2-£2.5m per year.
If it went ahead, the new charges would come into effect in the 2017-18 financial year.
Other ideas being considered are increased car park fees, charging for library book hire, cutting bus subsidies and reducing highway maintenance.
