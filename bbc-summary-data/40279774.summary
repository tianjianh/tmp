[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire's television news programmes are being brought together for the first time in 49 years to honour the murdered MP Jo Cox.

The BBC's Look North and ITV's Calendar will broadcast jointly on the first anniversary of the Labour MP's death.
Look North's Harry Gration and ITV's Christine Talbot will present from the Market Place in Birstall on Friday.
The programme will be broadcast on ITV1 at 18:00 BST and on BBC One from 18:30 on Friday 16 June.

The broadcast comes as the Great Get Together takes place to celebrate the life of the Batley and Spen Labour MP, who was shot and stabbed in Birstall in June 2016.
People have been encouraged to come together with picnics, street parties and concerts to mark the mother-of-two's life, and more than 110,000 events are expected to take place between 16 and 18 June.
Mrs Cox's widower Brendan said: "Jo was a big fan of both Look North and Calendar. You might say she had to be as an MP in the region.
"But she knew about the importance of communication and your programmes have been keeping Yorkshire informed for almost half a century.
He added it was "very heart-warming" the news programmes were coming together.
Mr Gration said he was "very excited" to be teaming up with the Calendar team.
"It's the first time I'll present on ITV, which feels a bit strange, but it's great to join forces to report on these events taking place," he said.
Christine Talbot said: "We are really looking forward to getting ITV Calendar and BBC Look North together for a joint broadcast on Friday.
"Harry Gration and I have been friends for many years but it will be a great pleasure to share a screen with him and his team on Friday evening."
