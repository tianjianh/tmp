Preston Fishergate 'explosive device': Man remanded

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court accused of leaving an "incendiary device" in a busy shopping centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The homemade device, which was found in the toilets at the Fishergate Shopping Centre in Preston on 17 December, ignited but did not explode.
David Rutherford, 24, of Barry Avenue, Preston appeared at the town's magistrates' court accused of unlawfully making an explosive with intent to endanger life.
He was remanded in custody for 14 days.
Paolo Passerini, defending, told the court he did not object to his client being remanded in custody but told magistrates there were "issues" over the defendant's mental health and his ability to understand proceedings.
No pleas were entered and there was no application for bail.
There will be a further hearing by video link on 8 January before the defendant's next court appearance on 14 January.
