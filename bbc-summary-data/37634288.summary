[SN]TITLE[SN]
IPCC will not investigate David Crompton complaint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A complaint against the suspended South Yorkshire Police chief David Crompton over alleged instructions to his legal team at the Hillsborough inquests will not be investigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said Mr Crompton was alleged to have told lawyers to "pour blame" on Liverpool fans at the hearings.
Families of some of the victims had lodged the complaint.
The inquests concluded 96 Liverpool fans were unlawfully killed.
Mr Crompton was suspended after the inquests over "an erosion of trust".
The commission, which acts as the national police watchdog, said an investigation would be "significantly hampered" because a legal principle of confidentiality would prevent it from reviewing communications between Mr Crompton and his legal team.
The force declined a request from the Independent Police Complaints Commission to waive legal professional privilege, which makes communication between lawyers and their clients confidential.
The commission's deputy chair, Rachel Cerfontyne, said the evidence it assessed "doesn't indicate that a criminal or misconduct offence has occurred".
