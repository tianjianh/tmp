Police in Dumfries and Galloway have promised to take strong action against anyone flouting legislation banning the supply of so-called "legal highs".

The Psychoactive Substances Act - aimed at tackling their supply and distribution - is due to come into force in April.
Seminars on the issue are being held by the region's drug and alcohol partnership in Dumfries and Stranraer.
They hope to raise awareness of the subject and the potential health risks.
Substance misuse co-ordinator, Det Con Scott Jardine, said it was vital the warning went out to the wider community.
"Some of these substances are legal to possess," he said.
"It is just to reiterate to members of the public, or to persons who are likely to take these, about the potential dramatic health effects that may occur."
He said that once the legislation was in place, police would be able to target retailers and people "who are indiscriminately selling these substances" to vulnerable people in Dumfries and Galloway.
