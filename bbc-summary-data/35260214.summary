One of the latest drone prototypes on show looks a bit like a helicopter and allows a passenger to sit inside.
It's controlled by a tablet and the passenger can choose their destination on it.
The drone, which has 8 propellers, takes between 2-4 hours to charge and would last for around 23 minutes flying time.
This drone is said to be one of the safest drones on show at the exhibition, because the propellers aren't exposed.
Instead, they are encased in plastic, meaning owners can actually take hold of the drone.
It can even be switched off by turning it on its side.
