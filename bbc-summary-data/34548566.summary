The attack happened in the Whitethorn Drive area, Currynierin at 22:45 BST on Thursday.
The occupants, a couple and their young daughter, who were in the house at the time, were not injured.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor, Christopher Jackson, said: "There can be no place for guns on the streets of our city.
"The people who carried out this attack need to explain to the local community the rationale for their actions."
Mr Jackson added: "We are in a new era, we are creating a new society for the younger generation and the people of Derry just want these attacks to stop.
"I would appeal for anyone with any information on this attack to bring it forward to the PSNI straight away."
