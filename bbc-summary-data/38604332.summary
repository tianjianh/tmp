The incident happened in Malcolmson Park at about 16:45 GMT on Thursday.
The boy has been taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.
DUP Upper Bann MLA Carla Lockhart said: "My thoughts in the first instance are with the child, his parents and the driver of the car involved."
She said local residents were in shock.
"My prayer is that the child will make a speedy recovery," Ms Lockhart added.
"I want to commend our emergency services once again who were on site quickly and who treated the child."
Malcolmson Park was closed to traffic for several hours on Thursday night but has now reopened.
