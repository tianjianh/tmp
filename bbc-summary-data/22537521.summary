Campaigners protesting against plans to tarmac and widen a gravel cycle path have taken their case to court.

The group opposes the plans for a disused railway track in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, and wants to register it as a designated village green.
Vale of Glamorgan Council wants to widen a path to 2.5m (8ft) down the middle of the grassy verge between Sully Terrace and Archer Terrace.
The council said the application will be considered.
Residents claim obtaining protected status would stop the local authority carrying out its plans.
They have to prove a significant number of community members have used the land as a right - a piece of common land - for the past 20 years.
The path runs a couple of miles from Penarth town centre to Cosmeston.
Hazel Bransfield, of Sully Terrace, took the campaign to Cardiff magistrates court on Wednesday, which affirmed her request that the path be given village green status.
She said residents feared a tarmac path would attract competitive road cyclists.
"The ordinary cyclists don't want the path changed and we all get along together," she said.
Mrs Bransfield added that the magistrates were interested to hear of the path's use during filming for TV programmes including Doctor Who and the Sarah Jane Adventures.
The request for village green status has now been sent to the Vale of Glamorgan council which will decide on the matter.
A council spokeswoman said: "If an application for the registration of land as a town or village green is made it will be given appropriate consideration."
