[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joey Barton has requested extra time to consider his Scottish Football Association gambling charge.

The Rangers midfielder was given until Wednesday to respond after he was accused of placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September.
But he has asked for an extension to examine the paperwork in the case against him.
The 34-year-old's request is expected to be considered by the SFA's judicial panel on Thursday.
A hearing date was set for 27 October when the charge was announced last week.
SFA disciplinary rules prohibit players, coaches, club officials and referees in Scotland from betting on football anywhere in the world.
Barton was due to return to training on Monday after serving a month-long club suspension following an internal dispute.
But Rangers announced on Sunday that the player has been told to stay away for another seven days after launching a "formal disciplinary procedure".
Manager Mark Warburton's media conference on Wednesday was halted briefly by the club's PR advisor Jim Traynor after repeated questions on the Barton situation.
Warburton would only say: "I'm not going to make comment on it, I haven't made comment on it. It's being dealt with by the powers that be at the club.
"When there's news it will come out, but until then there's no comment."
