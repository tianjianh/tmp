Poulter, second at last week's Players Championship, thought he had lost his PGA Tour card in April as he was ranked 197th after struggling with injury.
The 41-year-old got a reprieve after a discrepancy in the points structure used for players competing on major medical exemptions was highlighted.
"Thanks for the invite and help, European Tour," said the Englishman.
"Excited to now be playing. Heard good things about the west course. See you in a week."
The PGA Championship is the European Tour's flagship event, while the PGA Tour is a season of tournaments played mainly in the United States.
World number two Rory McIlroy will decide early next week whether he will play at Wentworth.
A scan has revealed the back problem the 28-year-old Northern Irishman had at the Players Championship was a recurrence of a rib injury from earlier this year.
