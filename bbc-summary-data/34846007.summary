Edward Dorman, 51, and Hayley Miln, 49, appeared in private at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.
They were charged with producing a controlled drug and being concerned in the supply of cannabis.
Dorman, of Heriot, and Miln, of Galashiels, made no plea. Their cases were continued for further examination and they were released on bail.
Police officers discovered about 200 cannabis plants in a property near Heriot on 12 November.
Herbal cannabis weighing up to 4kg (8.8lbs) was also seized in the raid. The total value of the haul is estimated to be Â£175,000.
The cultivation at Heriot Mill is the third cannabis farm to be discovered in the Borders this year.
Large crops have also been found in Selkirk and Hawick.
Chief Inspector Andy McLean, local area commander for the Scottish Borders said: "Once again, vital information from the public has resulted in a sizeable drugs recovery and we are actively pursuing those responsible for the production of this cannabis.
"Our communities continue to make it clear that they do not want drug dealers operating in their area and through enforcement activity such as this we demonstrate that the Scottish Borders is no safe haven for those involved in drug crime.
"Rest assured that any information provided to us is treated with in the strictest confidence and appropriately acted upon."
