Neighbours Manchester United appointed Guardiola's old rival Jose Mourinho, who has his first official day at Old Trafford on Monday.
City Football Group's commercial chief Omar Berrada said: "Manchester is going to be one of, if not the biggest centre of focus in football.
"Two of the biggest clubs in the world - now it has two of the top coaches."
City won the Premier League title in 2012 and 2014, but only finished fourth last season and are marking Guardiola's arrival with the fan festival.
In addition to their manager's appearance at a question and answer session at the City Football Academy, they are also launching their new badge and next season's kit.
The badge was created after extensive consultation between the club and its fans and does not contain the words football club, or FC.
"It is based on the history of the club," said Berrada.
"We have incorporated the date that the club was founded and there are other iconic Manchester elements. Calling it Manchester City adds an element of a modern feel."
Guardiola won the Champions League twice as a manager with Barcelona, before winning the Bundesliga title in each of the past three seasons at Bayern Munich.
Mourinho, a three-time Premier League winner at Chelsea, was managing in Spain at the same time as Guardiola, in charge of Barcelona's fierce rivals Real Madrid.
City and United will meet in a high-profile pre-season friendly in Beijing on 25 July, which follows on from the visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping to City's facilities in December 2015.
"He outlined a vision of wanting to make football a core piece of the development of physical activity," said Berrada.
"There is a fascinating story going on in China and we want to be part of it."
