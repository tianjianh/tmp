Police investigating the murder of a dissident republican in Dublin last month have arrested two men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vincent Ryan was shot a number of times in Finglas, north Dublin, on 29 February.  He died later in hospital.
The 25-year-old Dubliner was a brother of the alleged Real IRA leader Alan Ryan, who was shot dead in 2012.
The two men who were arrested on Tuesday morning are both in their 30s.  Police also searched a number of premises in north and west Dublin.
Vincent Ryan was attacked as he sat in his car in McKee Road, Finglas, shortly after he had dropped off his partner and five-month-old baby.
The getaway car used in the shooting was stolen in County Kildare last year.
His murder is believed to be connected to a feud between dissidents and criminals in Dublin which also led his brother's murder three and a half years ago.
The Ryan family have said that Vincent Ryan was not an IRA member.
