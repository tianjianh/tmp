[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 50 firefighters have tackled a blaze which closed a busy road in Cardiff city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service was called to Crockherbtown Lane just after 12:30 BST on Monday.
Nearby buildings were evacuated amid fears the fire, which had spread to an electrical substation, could spread to neighbouring properties.
Greyfriars Road has been closed, diversions are in place and the public has been asked to stay away.
The fire was extinguished just after 15:20 but firefighters remain at the scene to damp down and check that the blaze has not spread.
The fire involved industrial bins and oil and a three-storey adjacent building was "heavily smoked", the fire service said.
Cardiff Bus has diverted all buses via Boulevard De Nantes and Stagecoach Wales said its 124 service for Maerdy would now start at the Hilton Hotel and the X16 service would terminate and depart from Dumfries Place until further notice.
Fire investigators are on the scene working with police to determine the cause of the fire.
