[SN]TITLE[SN]
IPCC inquiry after Gwent Police detainees injured

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation is under way after several detainees in Gwent Police custody suites injured themselves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe follows incidents where people attempted self harm or tried to take concealed drugs.
Three were taken to hospital from custody suites at Ystrad Mynach and Newport. They were not seriously hurt.
Gwent Police said it was cooperating fully with the IPCC. It referred the incidents to the watchdog.
The IPCC said the investigations will look at factors including the adequacy of searches carried out on individuals taken into custody and the level of observations and checks on detainees. The incidents happened last September and November.
Ian Johnston, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent, said: "None of the detainees concerned have made any complaint and these investigations follow referrals made directly to the IPCC by Gwent Police."
