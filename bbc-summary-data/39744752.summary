[SN]TITLE[SN]
General Election: Ex-Labour Clwyd MPs bid for Commons return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two former Welsh Labour MPs are hoping to return to Westminster in June as the party confirms its list of 40 general election candidates in Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Ruane will return to fight the Vale of Clwyd seat he lost in 2015 after 18 years in the Commons.
Gareth Thomas will contest Clwyd West, which he represented from 1997 to 2005.
The Conservatives currently hold both seats, being defended by James Davies and David Jones.  All 40 Welsh MPs - 25 of them Labour - will seek re-election.
