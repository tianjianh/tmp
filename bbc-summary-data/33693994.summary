[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first phase of a £927,000 project to transform a Pembrokeshire harbour into an international marine tourism destination has opened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project to revamp Saundersfoot has already been awarded £463,500 in European regional funds, as well as £200,000 in tourism development cash.
The rest of the funding is being met by the Harbour Commission.
Deputy Minister for Culture, Ken Skates, opens phase one - the new harbour decking area - on Wednesday.
The project also includes a new slipway, sea wall, visitor pontoon and dry boat racking facilities.
The harbour project is the first part of a £4m scheme to boost tourism and jobs in the town.
Mr Skates said: "Saundersfoot harbour has long been recognised as one of the jewels in the crown of Pembrokeshire.
"This development will help establish a reputation for the harbour as a high-quality international marine destination and make it an iconic tourism destination for Wales."
