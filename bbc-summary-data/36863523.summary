Thai police have questioned the wife of a Scottish journalist, hours after he shared images of the crown prince on social media.

Andrew MacGregor Marshall said about 20 police officers confiscated "evidence" at his wife's family home in Bangkok.
His wife was asked to go to the police station but not charged with any crime.
The military, which took power in 2014, has increasingly enforced strict and wide-ranging lese majeste laws which forbid any criticism of the monarchy.
Mr Marshall, who is currently not in Thailand, is the author of A Kingdom in Crisis which is banned in Thailand.
He recently shared what purported to be unflattering photographs of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 63, which were originally published by German tabloid Bild.
He also wrote a lengthy post speculating on the royal succession, discussion of which is also prohibited under the lese majeste laws.
The widely loved and revered Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej is in frail health.
On Friday, Mr Marshall said on Facebook his wife Noppawan "Ploy" Bunluesilp, who is a Thai citizen, was visiting Bangkok with their three-year-old son.
He said she was formerly a journalist for Reuters and NBC but currently not working.
"My wife and her family are not involved in my journalism and they should not be harassed by the Thai authorities."
He posted pictures of the items he said were confiscated by police which included passports, an iPad, and iPhone and a flash drive.
