[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peter Moores has been appointed as a coaching consultant at Nottinghamshire, seven weeks after being sacked as England head coach.

In May, Moores was relieved of his duties as England boss for the second time after a dismal World Cup and the drawn Test series with West Indies.
Twice a County Championship winner as coach - with Sussex and Lancashire - he first coached England from 2007-2009.
The 52-year-old joins Nottinghamshire for the rest of the season.
Notts are currently bottom of Division One of the County Championship, with only one win in first-class cricket this season.
Director of cricket Mick Newell, who has been an England selector for most of Moores' second spell as national coach, said: "We need to improve our four-day performances quickly and Peter, with his vast experience and proven reputation as a coach, can help us do that.
"Having such a knowledgeable and respected individual on our doorstep, who is available for the rest of the season, is a fantastic opportunity for us to take."
Moores was first sacked by England in 2009 after being involved in a dispute with then captain Kevin Pietersen.
He was reappointed as England coach in April 2014 and was in charge for the 2015 World Cup campaign, which saw them eliminated at the group stage after losing to Bangladesh.
After the World Cup, Moores then oversaw a drawn Test series with a West Indies side labelled "mediocre" by incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves.
He was then dismissed again in May as ex-England batsman Andrew Strauss was appointed the new national director of cricket.
Speaking about his new role with Nottinghamshire, Moores added: "The job is to help people play some good cricket, working alongside the players and the coaches to help Nottinghamshire win games. League positions look after themselves if you're playing well."
