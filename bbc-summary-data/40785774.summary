[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Accrington Stanley secured a dramatic late victory over Championship side Preston North End to seal their place in the second round of the EFL Cup.

The hosts led when Ben Richards-Everton volleyed home but Jordan Hugill slotted in to equalise for the visitors.
With four minutes of extra time left, Jordan Clark restored the lead but Hugill levelled again in added time.
But Billy Kee struck in the third minute of stoppage time to give Stanley victory over their Lancashire rivals.
Kee also scored in Accrington's 3-1 win against Colchester on the opening day of League Two.
They have now knocked out higher league opposition in the EFL Cup for the second successive year after they beat Burnley last season.
Accrington Stanley boss John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"I'm delighted with the result as it was a difficult game. It was a full-blooded derby and just to be competing against teams like this on what we believe is a level playing field is testament to how far the club's come.
"Preston are a good side and they showed that. They moved the ball really well and we knew that from when we played them in a pre-season friendly.
"We were a different animal tonight. We created far more problems for them."
Preston North End manager Alex Neil told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"To be honest we shouldn't have been forcing for extra-time. At 1-1 we looked like we were going to go on and win the game.
"When we conceded the corner I thought I've seen this a million times before. We conceded from a set piece which is really frustrating.
"If you look at the game, we had numerous opportunities and chances, we didn't take them or make them count and ultimately we got punished because of that."
