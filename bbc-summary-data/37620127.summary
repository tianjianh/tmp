Liverpool City Council criticised after approving tower block plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool City Council has been accused of putting the city's Unesco World Heritage status "in real danger" by approving a student tower block plan.

Unesco warned in July that the 22-storey building for 1,085 students could damage Liverpool's reputation.
But the planning committee, which voted by five to two in favour, denied the plans would be detrimental to the city.
Save Britain's Heritage (SBH) claims Unesco might now strip Liverpool of its status but Historic England disagreed.
SBH director Henrietta Billings said: "This planning approval deliberately flies in the face of serious international heritage concerns.
"Liverpool's World Heritage status is a badge of honour which is slipping through its fingers because of short-sighted planning decisions."
But Liverpool City Council pointed to the support of Historic England - the government's statutory advisor on the historic environment - which found the development would not have a "harmful impact".
The Skelhorne Street site is next to the Grade II-listed Lime Street station and is surrounded by other listed buildings and the Unesco site which includes the iconic waterfront and Albert Dock.
A council spokesman said: "Historic England have concluded that this scheme would not have a harmful impact on the outstanding universal value of the World Heritage Site.
"We do not consider it appropriate to delay decisions on applications for major developments in the site once they have been fully assessed and are ready to be determined as this would unreasonably stifle the regeneration of the city centre."
Liverpool was awarded World Heritage status in 2004, ranking the city alongside the Taj Mahal and Stonehenge.
There are currently 29 Unesco World Heritage Status sites in the United Kingdom - the Lake District hopes to join the list next year.
