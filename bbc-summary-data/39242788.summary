[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 17-year-old has yet to make his first-team debut for the Tractor Boys, but scored twice for their under-23 side against Bristol City last Monday.
Morris has been capped by England at both Under-17 and Under-18 levels.
Woking, who are 20th in the National League table, just two points above the relegation places, have not disclosed the length of Morris' loan.
