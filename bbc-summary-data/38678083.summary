Bala Chinda, 26, is alleged to have killed 36-year-old escort Nkechi McGraa - also known as Jessica - at a flat in Union Terrace in February 2016.
The jury began deliberations on Thursday morning at the High Court in Aberdeen.
They were sent home at lunchtime and will resume on Friday at 10:00.
During the closing speeches on Wednesday, advocate depute Paul Kearney said there was overwhelming evidence against Mr Chinda.
However, defence counsel Ian Duguid said the prosecution had not proved guilt of rape and murder.
