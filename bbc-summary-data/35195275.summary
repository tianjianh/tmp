Storm Frank: Power cuts and flooding as Scotland battered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Power cuts, widespread flooding and landslips have been reported as Storm Frank continues to batter Scotland.

Thousands of homes are without power in the north east, Argyll, the Borders, Highlands, Hebrides and Northern Isles.
Ten adults and two children were winched to safety by a rescue helicopter after a Stagecoach bus became trapped near Dailly, Ayrshire.
Two severe flood warnings (possible danger to life) have been issued for Whitesands in Dumfries and in Peebles.
Across Scotland on Wednesday evening  over 70 flood warnings and 12 alerts remained in force.
The emergency services worked throughout the afternoon to rescue 12 people from the Stagecoach bus which became stranded in deep water near Dailly cemetery.
Police Scotland said 10 adults and two children - a boy aged seven and a five-year-old girl - were airlifted from the bus.
They were taken to Dailly community centre where they were being assessed by medical staff.
One of the rescued passengers, Phyllis Young, later told BBC Scotland it had been a terrifying ordeal.
She said: "The water was in the bus. It was coming up and up.
"It got to the window, there was big waves. You could see the current. It was very, very scary."
The passengers were forced to move the rear of the bus as the front section of the bus was covered with water.

A landslip has closed the A83 in Argyll at the Rest and Be Thankful and a flood closed the M74 in South Lanarkshire.
The Scottish government's resilience committee has met to assess the response to what environment minister Aileen McLeod described as a "very serious situation".
She said: "The Scottish government's resilience team is closely monitoring the situation which is still developing as persistent rain continues to fall onto saturated ground - and is expected to deteriorate further as river levels continue to rise, even after the rain has stopped.
"It is imperative that people look for and take heed of the latest warnings, information and advice from Sepa, Police Scotland and Traffic Scotland.
"In particular, consider whether you need to travel and take all possible precautions to stay safe, particularly in the worst-affected areas."
Some of the worst flooding hit Ballater in Aberdeenshire, where a caravan was spotted being carried down the River Dee.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service issued advice for those who find themselves without power or experiencing flooding. They urged people to be extra vigilant when using candles and gas heaters.
Vincent Fitzsimons, from Sepa, said: "The worst of the rainfall has largely passed but larger rivers will take some time to react as the water moves down towards the sea.
"Some are reacting now but in areas like Dumfries the worst of the flooding is expected to coincide with high tide mid-afternoon today.
"Rivers further east will take longer to respond. Areas like Callander, Perth, Deeside and Spey will continue to see rising levels throughout the day and some will not peak until the 31st.
Mr Fitzsimons said that "the situation should start to improve for everyone" from Friday.
Morven Smith, head of project resilience at power firm SSE Hydro, said engineers were making good progress in restoring supplies
She said: "We've restored over 29,000 customers' power since Storm Frank hit. We currently still have about 6,000 customers without power.
"Access has been a particular issue for us today. We have to take account of safety of the public and our engineers before we can restore power there."
Forecasters at Meteogroup said Braemar in Aberdeenshire has been the wettest place in the Scotland since midnight after receiving 64mm of rain up to 14:00 on Wednesday.
Tyndrum in Stirlingshire received 58mm and 39mm fell in Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway.
