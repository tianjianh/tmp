[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth v West Ham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth will be without suspended pair Andrew Surman and Tyrone Mings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week's debutant Baily Cargill could keep his place because Simon Francis is still nursing a hamstring injury and may not be ready to return.
West Ham welcome back Michail Antonio after a one-match ban, and Winston Reid should have recovered from a leg injury he suffered against Chelsea.
Andy Carroll and Robert Snodgrass are expected to be fit despite both needing stitches after that game.
John Motson: "This is a game in which I'm expecting goals.
"Bournemouth have conceded 36 goals in their past 15 league games, while West Ham have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last six.
"The Cherries have let in three or more goals in 10 league games this season - they really need to tighten up at the back to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle.
"But they're missing Nathan Ake, and the absence of Tyrone Mings for the next five games won't help.
"Yet it's an important game for West Ham too, as they aren't going through a great spell either.
"In short, both teams need a win to turn around a very indifferent spell."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "West Ham have done well. They've picked up, got some good results and it coincides with some key players returning for them.
"They're a different team with Andy Carroll - he's got strengths and is a huge part of their game."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "They have had a few defeats and a draw but the last game [a draw against Manchester United] would have given them a big boost and confidence.
"It's a great result to get a point at Old Trafford, especially with 10 men.
"We are expecting a difficult game. [It's] a small pitch and a good atmosphere."
Eddie Howe's side need a win - they have not had one in their past eight league matches - and I think they might do it on Saturday.
I don't see West Ham's season just petering out, because they are chasing a top-half finish - but I am backing Bournemouth to edge this one.
