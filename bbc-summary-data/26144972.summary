[SN]TITLE[SN]
STV has broadcasting license renewed for ten years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
STV has had its Channel 3 licences renewed for another ten years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group, which has two licences in Scotland - Scottish Central, and Grampian in the north - has accepted the financial and programming terms laid down by the regulator Ofcom.
STV says it will keep the same level of public service broadcasting provision as it delivers currently, which is in excess of the license obligations.
Shares in the group rose by 5% after the renewal was confirmed.
The company is also increasing its broadcasting output with the launch of two local television stations.
City stations STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh are due to launch this year and will be transmitted as digital freeview channels.
