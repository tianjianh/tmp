Apples, eels and Northern Ireland's year of food and drink

Northern Ireland begins a year-long celebration of food and drink in 2016, hoping it will pay dividends for local tourism.

Industry leaders say the aim "is to improve the quality of the visitor experience".
Each month has a theme, and associated events have applied for a share of Â£300,000 funding from Tourism NI.
Its chief executive John McGrillen said the aim is to improve the experience of tourists.
"We do not have any specific targets in terms of driving up visitor numbers, but we would like to drive up the level of satisfaction," he said.
Research suggests only one in 10 people come to Northern Ireland for the food experience, fewer still from the Republic of Ireland.
"I do not think it is ever the sole purpose to come to any destination, with the exception perhaps of San Sebastian or somewhere like that in Spain," said Mr McGrillen.
"But it is a very critical element of people's experiences and about one third of what people spend is actually on food and drink."
Food and drink spend by external visitors was in the region of Â£140m in 2012.
Michelin stars
Two Belfast restaurants obtaining Michelin stars - and global brands like Bushmills Whiskey - have helped sell the concept of a promotional year of food and drink.
Caroline Wilson, who runs a tour business around the Northern Ireland food and drink experience, said visitor interest is growing.
She says: "The majority of people I get on the tours are locals, but I get a lot of tourists now coming in.
"They are intrigued by what Belfast and Northern Ireland generally has to offer.
"It is unique - where else are you going to get the Bramley apple or the Lough Neagh eel?"
