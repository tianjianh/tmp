Five homes in Glen Crescent and Bonnington Road in Peebles and properties in the Bellfield area of Eddleston were targeted.
A Ford Transit van, grey Audi A6, off-road motorbike and other items were taken between 21:00 on Tuesday and 06:00 on Wednesday.
Police said inquiries were continuing to see if the crimes were linked.
PC Ian Knipe said: "All of the victims are understandably upset following the break-ins to their properties and the theft of their various items and vehicles.
"Anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity around the affected streets on Tuesday or Wednesday is asked to contact police immediately.
"In addition, anyone who can help us identify and trace those responsible, should also get in touch."
