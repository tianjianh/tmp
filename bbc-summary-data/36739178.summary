The family was also sent a "hate-filled letter" containing threats.
The Polish Embassy confirmed a consul would visit the family and said "we are very saddened by this attack".
Insp Darren Green, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "I am appalled by this crime. Hate crime has no place in Plymouth and we will do everything possible to locate those responsible."
