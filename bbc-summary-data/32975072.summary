Russian punk band Pussy Riot have been confirmed to appear at this year's Glastonbury Festival, after the event revealed its full 2015 line-up.

The anti-Putin activists will appear in conversation twice during the festival, on the Park Stage on Saturday 27 June and the Left Field on Friday 28 June.
Burt Bacharach, The Proclaimers, The Cribs and Wilko Johnson have also been added to the bill.
They join Pyramid Stage headliners Foo Fighters, Kanye West and The Who.
Pussy Riot's Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were released from a Russian prison last year after 21 months, having been convicted of hooliganism over protests in Moscow.
They were among five members of the radical group to stage an obscenity-laced "punk prayer" in the city's biggest cathedral.
Singer-songwriter and activist Billy Bragg, who hosts Glastonbury's Left Field, tweeted: "Pleased to announce that Nadya and Masha from Pussy Riot will be speaking at Left Field @GlastoFest 1.30pm Friday."
The pair recently appeared as themselves in hit Netflix political series House of Cards, where they staged a protest against fictional Russian president, the Putin-esque Viktor Petrov, at a dinner party.
Glastonbury organisers revealed set times for all of the stages, including a mammoth slot for Friday night headliners Foo Fighters.
They will play the Pyramid Stage from 21:15-23:45 BST - an hour longer than rapper West is scheduled to perform for the following night and 30 minutes longer than Sunday night headliners The Who.
Surprise additions included a favourite of organiser Emily Eavis who tweeted: "And very excited about Burt Bacharach!"
He will play the Pyramid Stage, as will the Burtle Silver Band and ballet group the Michael Clark Company.
Last week BBC Music announced it would broadcast 30 hours of TV coverage from Worthy Farm in Somerset, as well as content for radio, the Red Button and online.
It will kick off with The One Show's Chris Evans and Alex Jones, with Lauren Laverne, Jo Whiley and Mark Radcliffe fronting BBC Two's coverage while Greg James presents on BBC Three.
