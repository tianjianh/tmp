"That was amazing. I'm gutted it's over to be honest but I loved every second," said Grace.
"I guess I saved my best until last. That's the good thing going in on a fresh page and taking each dive at a time, to walk away with that result is just amazing.
"My mum couldn't watch me dive when I was younger. She never liked me jumping off 10m and I think now she can finally watch me. She was in the crowd tonight and I'm really hoping she watched that otherwise I'm going to sit her down and make her."
