They face Jack Whitehall, who is a panellist on A League of Their Own, and The Last Leg's Adam Hills in the entertainment performance category.
Elsewhere, BBC Two's Wolf Hall and Channel 4's This Is England '90 picked up two nominations each.
Wolf Hall, the screen adaption of the Hilary Mantel novel, is also nominated in the drama serial category.
Claire Foy, who played the doomed Anne Boleyn - the second wife of King Henry VIII is up for best female actor.
She faces Suranne Jones who is nominated for her role in drama Doctor Foster and Claire Rushbrook, who has been given a nod for her performance in ITV's WW2 drama Home Fires.
Nominees in the male actor category include Adam Long for BBC Three's factual drama Don't Take My Baby, Anthony Hopkins for BBC Two's The Dresser, and Tom Courtenay for the ITV crime drama Unforgotten.
Peter Kay's Car Share is nominated three times, including in the newly-introduced breakthrough category, which recognises new talent in UK production.
This Is England '90 is nominated for drama serial and drama writer for Shane Meadows and Jack Thorne.
In addition to presenter Adam Hills' nomination, The Last Leg has also been nominated in the entertainment programme category.
It faces competition from The Graham Norton Show and ITV2's Release The Hounds.
The rewards honour actors, presenters, writers and production teams as well as the programmes themselves.
The ceremony takes place on 22 March in London. The full list of nominees is available on the RTS website.
Channel 4's Humans will compete for the title of drama series against No Offence, which is also on Channel 4, and BBC Two's The Last Kingdom.
One of the most competitive categories is for drama serial, where Wolf Hall and This Is England '90 are up against ITV's The Lost Honour of Christopher Jeffries.
The latter told the real life story of the man who was falsely accused of the murder of Joanna Yeates. It is also nominated in the drama writer category.
Three Channel 4 shows are nominated for single drama - Black Mirror: White Christmas, Coalition and Cyberbully.
Coronation Street, EastEnders and Emmerdale will battle it out in the soap and continuing drama category - which was won last year by Casualty.
Gary Neville from Sky Sports has been nominated a third time for the award he has won for the past two years running - sports presenter, commentator or pundit.
But he could be stopped from scoring an awards hat-trick by fellow nominees Alan Shearer and David Coulthard.
The judging panel this year has been changed to include more women and people from minority backgrounds.
Alex Mahon, who chairs the awards, said: "We have substantially changed the make-up of the judging chairs and the juries to a pattern that I feel is now more representative of Britain and of our viewers.
"This year, of the 200 or so jurors, we moved to 52% female and 27% BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic].
"Talking to the chairs it was clear that the tone of the conversations in the jury rooms changed for the better too."
The move towards more diversity comes in the wake of the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which saw a number of high profile Hollywood figures boycott the Academy Awards in protest at the lack of non-white nominees.
