A primary school previously rated "outstanding" has been placed in special measures over safety.

Safety checks were not carried out on some staff members at Barton Clough Primary School in Stretford, Greater Manchester, a report by Ofsted said.
School leaders also failed to keep children safe and were criticised for being "unaware of the catalogue of safeguarding failures".
Trafford Council said action has been taken to address concerns.
The report said the 250 pupil community school "has declined significantly since the last inspection" and "leaders, managers and governors are not demonstrating the capacity to improve".
It was also rated "inadequate" over concerns bullying was not being dealt with effectively and some pupils said they did not feel safe on the school yard.
Checks on staff and governors were incomplete and some pupils were prevented from making progress in class because disruptive behaviour was not managed well.
The report also highlighted the strength of the school's special educational needs provision and pupils' progress in mathematics due to additional teaching.
The council said it was disappointed at the findings and was "keen to reassure parents".
It added it was "confident in the current school leadership team" to "take the necessary steps to improve".
