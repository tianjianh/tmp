UFC 200: Amanda Nunes takes Miesha Tate's title as Brock Lesnar wins on return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Amanda Nunes stunned Miesha Tate at UFC 200 to win the women's bantamweight title as WWE superstar Brock Lesnar won on his return to the sport.

Lesnar, 38, beat Mark Hunt 29-27 on all scorecards in his first match since a UFC heavyweight title loss in 2011.
In a co-main event, Nunes locked in a rear naked choke to force a submission from a bloodied Tate in round one.
She shocked the 19,000 in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and is the first Brazilian woman to hold a UFC title.
The 28-year-old's win means the bantamweight title has changed hands three times since November, when Ronda Rousey - who held the belt for 1,074 days - lost to Holly Holm.
Tate could offer none of the grit she showed to defeat Holm in March and a looping right hand from Nunes early on dazed the American, who quickly tapped out when the submission hold was applied.
Lesnar, a four-time WWE champion, took Hunt down to the mat on several occasions but could not force a stoppage, later admitting "it took me a little time to get acclimated".
He is still a major draw for the sport and his main event with Frank Mir at UFC 100 in 2009 holds the record for the most pay-per-view buys in the UFC history.
When asked about his future after a sixth win in nine UFC contests, Lesnar was non-committal but the WWE have already said they expect him back for SummerSlam on 21 August.
Also on the UFC 200 card, light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier won a unanimous points decision against Anderson Silva, who took the fight at 48 hours' notice when Jon Jones was removed from the event after failing a drugs test.
