Nottingham Forest fans will get a say on their stadium's future should the ground ever be put up for sale.

The Nottingham Forest Supporters Trust (NFST) has successfully applied to register the ground as an Asset Of Community Value.
Elliott Stanley, the chair of NFST, said fans and the local community can now help safeguard the club.
The Reds moved to the ground, the site of a double European Cup win, in West Bridgford, in 1898.

The City Ground has been part of Nottingham life for about 120 years with many watching Brian Clough's team carry out their European Cup heroics in 1979 and 1980.
Mr Stanley said: "The City Ground is undoubtedly one of the most iconic grounds in the footballing world.
"The ground being formally registered an Asset of Community Value is something that we set out to secure, not only because it aligns with our vision of safeguarding the future of the club but, perhaps more crucially, it ensures that fans have a voice on that future."
Registering the stadium as a ACV means supporters can bid for the ground should it ever be put up for sale.
The stadium belongs to the club, but the land is owned under freehold by Nottingham City Council.
The authority has said it would never sell the land without the support of fans.
Nicholas Randall QC, Nottingham Forest's chairman, said the club had supported the move and that it underlined its commitment "to place the club at the heart of the community".
Nottingham Forest was facing a uncertain future before being sold to Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, in May.
Blackburn's Ewood Park stadium, Manchester United's Old Trafford and Charlton Athletic's The Valley have all been listed as ACVs.
