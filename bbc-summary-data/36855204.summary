Australian rugby league player Corey Norman has been banned for eight games by the National Rugby League (NRL) for a string of off-field incidents.

The NRL said the ban relates to Norman's conviction for drug possession and a police warning for consorting with known criminals at a casino.
The Parramatta Eels stand-off was also reprimanded for filming incidents involving apparent drug use and sexual activity and distributing video of those incidents to other NRL players. He was also fined $20,000 (Â£11,300).
Last week, Norman was stood down by the Eels for one game after he pleaded guilty to drug possession at the Star Casino in Sydney in May.
But the 25-year-old will now miss the rest of the season.
NRL head of integrity Nick Weeks said: "The message is clear... players cannot put themselves in a position where they may damage their own reputations and that of the game.
"Whether it is drug possession, criminal associations or social media use, players understand the consequences that can flow from illegal or other unacceptable conduct."
