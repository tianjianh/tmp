Borders General Hospital: Fall death family urges action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a woman who died after falling from an ambulance has said action is needed to avoid any similar incidents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fiona Barber, 71, was attending a routine appointment at Borders General Hospital in 2009 when she fell.
She struck her head on the ground and died at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh two weeks later.
Her son told a fatal accident inquiry that he believed her fall had been a "preventable accident".
Mrs Barber, of Lindean near Selkirk, never regained consciousness after her fall.
Her son, Jonathan, was giving evidence to an inquiry at Selkirk Sheriff Court.
Asked what outcome he was looking for from the hearing Mr Barber said: "We were only told there was not going to be a prosecution in June last year.
"The family have waited a very long time for this and want to see some effective recommendations.
"It is the family view this was a very preventable accident - it really devastated the whole family."
He said he wanted to find out what happened and see "effective recommendations" put in place to avoid any further falls.
The inquiry before Sheriff James Farrell continues.
