[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieran McGrath, 26, was attacked after leaving the Sheldon Arms, Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester on 4 October 2014.
He managed to drive to a local police station but collapsed and died outside.
Remi Adams, 34, was ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years at Manchester Crown Court. Three other men have received life sentences over the killing.
Adams, of Dartmouth Road, Whitefield, was convicted of murder at a retrial after the jury at the original trial in April was unable to agree on verdicts.
He was put on trial again with Scott Chapman, 28, of Leng Road, Manchester, who was cleared of murder.
The sentences of Anthony Henry, Troy Beckford and Jace Smith, who were all found guilty of murder, as well as Henry's girlfriend Bretony Gallimore, who was convicted of assisting an offender, could only be reported after the conclusion of the re-trial on Wednesday.
Henry, 32, of Kenwyn Street, Miles Platting - who orchestrated the shooting - was ordered to serve a minimum of 33 years by Liverpool Crown Court.
Beckford, 24, of Lowerfields Gardens, Warrington, must serve a minimum of 30 years and Smith, 32, of Charlestown Road, Manchester, at least 31 years.
Henry's girlfriend Bretony Gallimore, 25, of Stanhorne Avenue, Manchester, was sentenced to three years.
Police said Henry bought two mobile phones and Beckford fitted a tracker to Mr McGrath's Audi S3 as part of the murder plot.
On the night of his death Smith and Adams lay in wait on a motorcycle, said police, with Adams pulling the trigger when he left the pub.
Karen Tonge from the Crown Prosecution Service said Henry "orchestrated" the "premeditated murder" of Kieran McGrath and "recruited Adams as the gunman" because of their "longstanding dispute".
She said all the offenders "played an integral role in the murder".
Adams "pulled the trigger" with Smith the driver of the motorcycle and Beckford "assisting" Henry in the plan to kill Mr McGrath.
