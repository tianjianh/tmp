The enamel "two quails" vase, is thought to have been made at Beijing's Imperial Palace at least 220 years ago.
Auctioneers Woolley & Wallis said the owner only realised its true value after he put it on eBay.
It had been estimated as being worth up to £30,000, but sold at auction in Salisbury for £61,000, including the buyer's premium.
The seller, who did not wish to be identified, picked up the vase at a car boot sale near Lymington.
When eBay bidding reached £10,000 he withdrew it and took it for a valuation.
Woolley & Wallis Asian art expert John Axford confirmed the vase bore the four-character Qianlong mark - the sixth emperor of the Qing dynasty - and would have been made by Imperial command in the palace workshop between 1736 and 1795.
He said it had turned out to be an "excellent investment".
