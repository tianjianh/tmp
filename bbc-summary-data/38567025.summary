The 22-year-old will make his 50th appperance for the side if he plays in the Scarlets' European Champions Cup fixture against Saracens on Sunday.
Evans has started all but one of the region's Pro12 matches this season and has played 19 games so far this term.
"I've grown up supporting the region and it's an honour to wear the jersey and to represent the club," Evans said.
"I'm looking forward to continuing my development within the region over the next few years and hopefully one day push for international honours.
"My focus at the moment is the Scarlets and hopefully making the top four in the Pro12."
Evans can play on the wing as well as full-back and was on standby for Wales' tour of New Zealand in the summer of 2016.
"Steff has had a great start to the season and has played a lot of rugby for us. He's an exciting attacking player but has also put the time in on the training field on areas of the game that he needed to work on," Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac said.
"It's pleasing to see young local guys like Steff wanting to commit their future to the region and we look forward to see him continue to grow as a player."
