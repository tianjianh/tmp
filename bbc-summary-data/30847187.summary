A 27-year-old woman was attacked at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 18 December. The second attack happened on Wednesday and involved a 24-year-old woman.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said CCTV footage had been given to police and staff had been told to remain vigilant.
Police would not confirm if the same man was behind both attacks.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said inquiries into both incidents were ongoing.
In a statement, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: "Security patrols have been increased at Glasgow Royal Infirmary after two separate reports over the past month of assaults against two female members staff.
"The hospital site is covered by extensive CCTV and all relevant footage from both incidents has been supplied to Police Scotland who are investigating.
"Our security staff already carry out patrols regularly over a 24/7 period but these have been increased. We have also advised all staff to remain vigilant."
The health board said it had a "strict zero tolerance policy towards violence" against staff, who it said were "entitled to work free of threats, assaults and intimidation".
The health board said it took "very seriously any act of physical or verbal abuse".
It added: "All our staff deserve basic courtesy and respect and to be able to work without fear of abuse or violence."
