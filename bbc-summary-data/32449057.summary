Figures released to mark World Malaria Day show death rates have fallen by 40% since 2000 - but the disease still claims 600,000 lives every year.
Cardiff Met's African Partnership Initiative has been working to reduce levels of malaria, particularly among children, in rural areas of Uganda.
It has helped 40 households take measures to fight the disease.
The homes, all containing children under five or pregnant women, have received equipment, nutritional advice and repairs to their houses.
They are also used as training grounds for their home communities and people from other villages.

The African Partnership Initiative, which has received funding from the Welsh government and expertise from Cardiff and Vale Local Health Board, has also trained locals to act as community health workers.
Cardiff Met Professor George Karani said: "This work has delivered huge benefits and will continue to do so due in the long-term due to the sustainable elements such as community health workers."
