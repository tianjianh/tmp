Nine Welsh products could be awarded protected food status under new government plans.

Welsh laverbread and Carmarthen Ham are among the foods which could receive special designation under European law.
The UK government wants to increase the number of protected British foods from 63 to 200.
Wales' deputy minister for farming and food, Rebecca Evans, said the Welsh government is "proactively supporting" Welsh producers to achieve the status.
They will become part of the EU scheme, which already includes Welsh beef and lamb, Parma ham and champagne.
Chris Rees said his family have handed down the "secret recipe" for Carmarthen Ham for five generations.
He joked that "when the Romans conquered most of Wales, they settled in Carmarthen, pinched our recipe and took it back to Italy where they called it Parma ham".
He first submitted an application for protected status about five years ago.
"If it comes our way we are going to be very proud and it will be great for a small town like ours," he added.
Ashley Jones, manager of Selwyn's Penclawdd Seafoods in Llanmorlais, Swansea, believes protected status for Welsh laverbread "will put Wales on the map".
"I think it's great we can protect the way laverbread has been traditionally cooked and processed in this area," he said.
"It's great for Wales and for the people, who I guess would put it in their top 10 of favourite Welsh things."
