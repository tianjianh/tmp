Ireland will play the touring South Africans in four one-day internationals followed by three Twenty20 games.
"This is the competitive cricket we need on a regular basis to be able to compete with the world's top teams," said Ireland coach Aaron Hamilton.
Ireland have withdrawn from this season's County Championship because of their busy schedule in 2016.
The Irish will play in their second ICC World Twenty20 in India in March and compete in a World Cup qualifying campaign against the Netherlands and Scotland.
The ODIs against South Africa, who are ranked sixth in the world, will take place on 24 July, 26 July, 29 July and 1 August followed by the T20s on 4 August, 5 August and 7 August.
Venues for the matches have yet to be confirmed.
"These games will be another chance for our players to apply their trade at home in front of supporters and younger girls looking to aspire to play for Ireland in the future," added Hamilton.
"This series will continue to build the increasing profile of the women's game in Ireland."
