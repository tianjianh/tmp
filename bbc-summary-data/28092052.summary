Jack O'Neil, 19, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob at Hull Crown Court earlier. He had initially denied the charge and changed his plea before a trial was due to start.
Watches worth about Â£200,000 were stolen in the raid on Guest and Philips Jewellers in Beverley in August 2013.
Kevin Smith, 22, has pleaded guilty. The pair will be sentenced on 21 July.
O'Neil, of Haigh Gardens, Leeds, and Smith, of Thorne Road, Stainforth, South Yorkshire, are due to be sentenced at Hull Crown Court.
Senior Investigating Officer Mathew Hutchinson, from Humberside Police, said: "The offence took place at a busy time of day in view of numerous people who were out and about performing their normal everyday activities and to witness the scenes at the jewellery store that day will have been quite alarming.
"Similarly, the staff at the shop were faced with a very frightening situation and it is hard to imagine the terror they experienced throughout the ordeal."
