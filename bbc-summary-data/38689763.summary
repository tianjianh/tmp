The incident happened at Kilgallioch wind farm, which straddles the border between Dumfries and Galloway and South Ayrshire, early last Friday.
An investigation has been launched by developer Scottish Power Renewables and turbine manufacturer Gamesa.
The 96-turbine site is currently under construction and due to be fully connected to the grid later this year.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Power Renewables said: "We are currently investigating an incident relating to an installed turbine at Kilgallioch wind farm during the early hours of Friday 13 January.
"The turbine was not yet operational and no one was in the vicinity at the time."
Spanish firm Gamesa confirmed that they were also involved in the investigation.
A spokeswoman said: "We are currently investigating - jointly with the owner of the wind farm - the root-cause of this incident."
Scottish Power Renewables has previously said Kilgallioch wind farm would be the second largest in the UK once completed.
It said it could meet the energy needs of 130,000 homes.
