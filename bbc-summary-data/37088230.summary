The two girls were "touched inappropriately" during a visit to the attraction, in Windsor, on Thursday.
Detectives have urged others who visited the resort to check their photos to see if the man is in the background.
He is described as white, under 5ft 8in-tall, wearing dark slim-fitting trousers, a dark t-shirt and trainers.
The assaults happened between 12:15 BST and 12:30 at Castaway Camp in the Pirate Shores area of the attraction.
Det Insp Penny Mackenzie of the Thames Valley Police child abuse investigation unit said: "We really need the public's help to find the offender and I would urge anyone who recognises the man in the e-fit to contact police.
"If you went to Legoland on Thursday please check any photographs you may have taken to see if you can spot anyone who looks like the man in this e-fit. If you have any photographs you want to share with us please email them.
"I would like to reiterate that such offences are extremely rare. We are conducting a detailed investigation and working closely with Legoland in order to find the offender."
