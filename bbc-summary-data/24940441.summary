Dumfries and Galloway Council report runs to 700 pages

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A single agenda item in 42 separate sections running to more than 700 pages is to go before councillors trying to make savings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The report will be discussed by Dumfries and Galloway Council's planning, housing and environment committee next week.
The paper took four review teams of 20 staff in total to draw up.
It includes a range of saving levels ranging from 5% to 20% and detailed lists of how they could be achieved.
The report states that the south of Scotland authority is facing "unprecedented reductions in its financial resources".
It then goes on to outline how planning and environment services could take their share of that burden.
The largest single section of the report runs to nearly 300 pages on its own.
Councillors have until Wednesday afternoon to try to digest its contents and then agree their spending priorities in time for the budget-setting process next spring.
