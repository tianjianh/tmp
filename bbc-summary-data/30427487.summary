Thanet councillors reject Manston Airport compulsory purchase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thanet councillors have voted against pursuing the compulsory purchase of Manston Airport, which closed in May with the loss of 150 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vote came during a council meeting despite a demonstration outside by campaigners fighting to prevent the Kent airport's redevelopment.
Thanet District Council was considering a report which recommended no further action be taken on the site.
Proposals could now be sent to the transport secretary for consideration.
Earlier this week, Stephen DeNardo, chief executive of the US firm RiverOak Investments, which expressed an interest in buying the airport, said he was disappointed over the plans to drop the compulsory purchase order.
Manston was sold to regeneration specialists in September, which will see the former airport redeveloped for manufacturing, housing and schools.
Two local Conservative MPs earlier met a government minister to discuss the site's future.
Roger Gale and Laura Sandys held a private meeting with transport minister John Hayes.
