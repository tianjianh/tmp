Wales women want to bask in Welsh football's Euro euphoria

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
How much am I looking forward to watching the boys do the business at Euro 2016?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I'm super excited, not just for them but for the nation. It's going to be amazing watching a Welsh football team at a major tournament at last - it has only taken us 58 years!
It's great being back in Wales from the United States at this awesome time for football as me and the Wales women team get ready for a crucial game of our own on Tuesday in Newport.
Our match against Norway is a must-win - but more about that in a bit.
We'd love to cash-in on some of that euphoria around the guys going to Euro 2016 in France
It has been great sharing the Welsh FA's Vale of Glamorgan HQ with Chris Coleman and the boys and we hope to cash in on the euphoria around Welsh football against Norway.
You can sense the high spirits everywhere you turn and we are hoping that the fans who haven't yet left for France to follow the boys at Euro 2016 will come and cheer us on in Newport.
We need your support - Norway are usually a top-10-in-the-world team.
At such a monumental moment in Welsh football, I'd like to think people will really want to invest in the national teams of Wales, both male and female.
I'm so glad I made it back from injury after breaking a bone in my leg six weeks ago - and what are the chances, Wales' biggest injury worry before the Euros had a similar problem.
Joe Ledley broke a bone in his leg in early May and within four weeks, he's named in Wales' Euro 2016 squad. That's good going - as I know only too well.
My leg is feeling really good, I haven't missed a training session and everything has gone well with the recuperation - and clearly Joe has had the same fortune.
I watched Joe when the Wales boys were training the other day and I had a little chuckle to myself as I was thinking 'he is going to be fine'.
I was doing the same thing 10 days before and I have played one-and-a-half games since then with no ill-effects.
Joe is all right. Joe is fine. He's going to be great.
I travelled all over the place to get my leg fixed. When we got the diagnosis, my club Seattle were a little worried, not just because of the break itself but because of the fluid and the bone bruising around the knee and down the leg.
I called a guy I trusted called Nick, who I knew during my time playing in Melbourne, and he had just treated a very similar injury. He gave me a very good timeline for coming back so in agreement with Seattle, I flew to Australia and did some acute rehabilitation.
It is credit to Seattle and Nick for getting me back symptom-free in really, really quick time.
Playing in Tuesday's Wales game was always huge for me, it was a game I felt I needed to be back for and play my part.
Seattle are happy, Wales are happy and so am I. But I have that trust with Seattle and it is important as I could have easily been out for two months and that is something nobody wanted.
This Norway game is one of those must-win games. We would take a 1-0 win now. Absolutely 100%.
It is not going to be easy and probably isn't going to be pretty. It will take hard work, teamwork and lots of determination to get a result. Hopefully we can do just that.
We'd love to see you all in Newport. It'd be great if you could inspire us to victory and we could get you in that party mood for France.
