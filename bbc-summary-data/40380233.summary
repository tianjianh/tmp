Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire have said the building's cladding and insulation failed safety tests.
Welsh ministers said they wanted the same cladding tests conducted in Wales as have been announced for England.
At least 79 people are thought to have died in last week's London blaze with manslaughter charges being considered.
There are 36 blocks of flats of seven or more storeys used for social housing in Wales.
Tests on 600 high rises across England are continuing .
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: "We are in regular contact with all residential social landlords in Wales and are urging them to have samples from relevant tower blocks tested - using the same process and facility described by the prime minister in her statement."
A spokesperson later added the government was "taking steps to encourage landlords of all high rise buildings regardless of their tenure to carry out fire safety checks and where necessary have samples of cladding tested".
The Metropolitan Police confirmed on Friday that the Grenfell Tower fire had started in a fridge freezer.
On Tuesday, Welsh Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant told AMs no high-rise blocks used for social housing in Wales appeared to have Grenfell Tower type cladding.
