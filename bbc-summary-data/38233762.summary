Jesse Burgoine, 28, and Artjom Nepryahin, 26, are accused of "targeting" the then 23-year-old after meeting her in a club.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that two explicit videos were filmed as the woman slept on a sofa.
Mr Burgoine, of Bedfordshire, and Mr Nepryahin, of Liverpool, both deny two counts of rape.
Prosecutor Simon Ash said the pair saw the victim as an "object to be used for their sexual gratification".
He told the jury the victim - who cannot be named - "felt very drunk" as she went to the Coco Tang club in Bridlesmith Gate, Nottingham, in December 2014.
Later in the evening, she became separated from her friends and left with Mr Burgoine and Mr Nepryahin.
The trio took a taxi to Mr Nepryahin's flat near the city's railway station where the alleged rapes took place.
A 24-second video played to the jury appeared to show Mr Burgoine having sex with the victim.
Mr Ash said: "You can see she was unconscious. Arms hanging limply, hair hangs to one side, eyes closed, she doesn't move at any stage during the video."
He added: "She was not fully conscious, and she felt scared. She did not have the strength or control... to stop what was happening."
The prosecution went on to say a picture of the two accused "smiling at the camera with the victim unconscious between them" was sent to a WhatsApp group of at least seven other men.
The court also heard Mr Nepryahin sent a message to a friend after the alleged attack which read: "It was pretty fun mate - it could not have been easier to take her home."
The attack was reported to police and, after door-to-door inquiries, Mr Nepryahin was arrested. Mr Burgoine was detained later.
Mr Ash said that in interview both men claimed the sex was consensual and denied the woman had passed out.
The trial is expected to last two weeks.
