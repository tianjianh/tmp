Fylde fracking appeal: Recommendations sent to government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recommendations on whether fracking should be allowed in Lancashire have been submitted to the government to make a final decision on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energy firm Cuadrilla is appealing against Lancashire County Council's refusal to let it extract shale gas at Little Plumpton and Roseacre Wood.
Planning inspector Wendy McKay has sent her report to Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Greg Clark to scrutinise.
The decision is expected by 6 October.
Lancashire County Council rejected both planning applications for the Fylde sites last year on the grounds of noise and traffic impact.
Cuadrilla disputed those reasons at an inquiry chaired by Ms McKay in Blackpool earlier this year and said night-time noise would be short and affect only a handful of homes.
The secretary of state said he will make the final decision, as opposed to the planning inspector, because the proposals were "of more than local significance".
Anti-fracking campaigners claim the process is harmful to the environment.
