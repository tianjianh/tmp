Disruption on the line between the east Midlands, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and London could last all day, a rail operator has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thameslink and East Midlands train services are suffering delays after damage to overhead wires at Luton on Tuesday caused signalling problems.
Both operators are running amended services on Wednesday.
Govia Thameslink said Network Rail "still can't tell us when they expect to be able to repair it".
Spokesman Roger Perkins said: "That's understandable, they really are doing their very best, but it means that although we're saying [disruption] until at least 2pm, this could well continue right through to the end of the day."
A Network Rail spokesman said: "We apologise for the inconvenience this will cause and advise that passengers use an alternative route where possible and check with their train operator before they travel."

Network Rail added trains were being disrupted because of a "significant fault with the signalling system" at Luton which it had been working to fix through the night.
The problem was caused by a signalling wire coming into contact with the overhead electric lines on Tuesday afternoon.
Both Thameslink and East Midlands Trains are running amended timetables with Thameslink offering bus replacement services to link up with other lines where passengers can use their tickets.
