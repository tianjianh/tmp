The proposals include a contraflow cycle lane on East Street, widening of footpaths and improved bus stops on Osborne Street and Bethlehem Street.
People are being asked for their views and details of the plans are being displayed in Victoria Street until 16:00 BST.
North East Lincolnshire Council said it had secured £1.47m of government funding to deliver the improvements.
The authority said it would match fund an additional £768,000 to support the scheme.
Under the plans, there would also be footpath and highway improvements to East St Mary's Gate and West St Mary's Gate, a new cycle route across St James Square and allocated parking spaces for the Minster, as well as upgrades to Chantry Lane and the underpass to "better connect Cartergate with the town centre".
Councillor Ray Oxby said: "This is an important scheme for Grimsby, which will help join up the town centre with Abbeygate for pedestrians and introduce safe cycle ways across the town."
The proposals will also be displayed at the St James' Centre on Thursday between 15:00 and 19:00.
