[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A barge owned by Brains Brewery was "allowed to deteriorate" before it sank in Cardiff, a residents' group said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vessel, named Eben Haezer, sank at Bute East Dock, Cardiff Bay on Monday.
Bernard James from the Atlantic Wharf Residents' Association said it was a "very sad end to a vessel that was a feature".
Brains said the barge took on water following poor weather and ongoing works. It said it was working closely with Natural Resources Wales (NRW).
NRW was alerted to a diesel sheen on the water and a strong odour near the vessel on Tuesday.
Divers have visited the site to assess the damage and a boom has been put in place to stop pollution.
NRW said it would oversee the recovery and dismantling of the vessel.
