Virgin Kitesurfing Armada UK's attempt off Hayling Island, Hampshire, involved 423 participants parading over a one-mile (1.6 km) course on Sunday.
Guinness World Records has verified the attempt was a new record.
The previous record was set by Virgin Kitesurfing Armada South Africa when 415 kitesurfers completed a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) course off Cape Town.
Kitesurfers from around the world took part in the record attempt at Hayling Island, which took three-and-a-half hours to complete.
Event organiser Dan Charlish said: "It has been an amazing experience - 423 kitesurfers is a fantastic total and everyone should be really proud."
