A man who raped and badly beat an 18-year-old woman who was waiting at a bus stop has been sentenced to 20 years.

The woman was on Beeston Road, Leeds on 6 March when Zdenko Turtak dragged her into a garden and clubbed her 18 times with a rock, leaving her for dead.
The 22-year-old fled the UK to his native Slovakia, but was tracked down and extradited back to the UK.
He admitted rape and grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 14 years plus six on licence at Leeds Crown Court.
The court heard Turtak may have been high on a glue-like substance when he snatched his victim from the bus stop and brutally raped her.
The 22-year-old left his 18-year-old victim with serious head injuries during the "appalling attack" which has had a "catastrophic effect" on the woman's life, police said.
Turtak's attack on the woman, who had only recently left school, sparked a huge police inquiry.
The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC, said the attack would affect the victim, who is from a strict Muslim background, for the rest of her life.
He said: "She believes it will affect her whole life, including her prospects of marriage.
"In those short eight minutes you destroyed her young life", he said.
The attack was caught by a CCTV camera and footage was also found of Turtak following other women in Leeds in the hours leading up to this offence.
Turtak, from Velka Ida, Kosice, Slovakia, fled to his native country as a huge search was launched by West Yorkshire Police.
He was traced after a DNA match and extradited back to the UK.
Earlier this month, the Crown Prosecution Service accepted his admission of rape and GBH and decided not to put him on trial for attempted murder.
Judge Collier said Turtak was a "dangerous" offender. He said: "It is therefore necessary to impose a sentence for the protection of the public."
Turtak will have to serve at least two-thirds of the custodial sentence before being considered for release.
As Turtak was led from the dock, members of the victim's family shouted at him.
