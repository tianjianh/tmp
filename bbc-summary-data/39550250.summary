[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby have been relegated from the National League after Barrow came from behind to beat them 3-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reece Thompson gave the visitors a lifeline by tapping in at the back post after four minutes, but Richie Bennett headed Barrow back on level terms seven minutes later with his fifth goal in his last six games.
The hosts seized control through a superb solo effort from Shaun Beeley, who weaved his way past two defenders on his way to lashing in from close range after 40 minutes, before Jordan Williams made it 3-1 two minutes before the break.
North Ferriby, who missed a penalty through Connor Oliver late on, had needed to win all their remaining matches and hope other results went their way to avoid relegation.
