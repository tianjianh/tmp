North Wales Police added that from those tests, 60 arrests were made.
It follows a report earlier in December which said motorists are more likely to be tested for drink driving in north Wales than anywhere else in the UK.
Det Ch Con Gareth Pritchard warned motorists not to be tempted to drink and drive.
He said: "Officers will continue to carry out breath tests across north Wales as part of our campaign to reduce deaths on the roads."
