Chris Fredericks and Joanne Burns's unborn son Oliver died at week 20 of the pregnancy at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan.
The couple, from Rhyl, signed a consent form to allow Oliver to be cremated but say they were not told when or where this would take place.
The hospital is investigating.
Mr Fredericks said: "I feel like our baby has been taken from us. We are devastated, angry and in a whirlwind of emotions.
"The hospital asked me to sign a form to allow Oliver to be cremated but we were not informed where and when it would take place.
"They cremated my son on 13 April and scattered his ashes without informing us. Joanne only found out in May when she went to see her GP and asked him to ring the hospital to find out when the funeral was taking place."
The couple has been told that Oliver's ashes were scattered in the Garden of Remembrance at Colwyn Bay Crematorium.
Mr Fredericks, who has written a letter of complaint to the hospital, said: "I wanted to bring Oliver home. I wanted him here with us until we are ready to let him go. Now that choice has been ripped away from us.
"I just want to make sure this never happens again."
A spokesperson for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: "Firstly we wish to extend our condolences to Ms Burns and her partner for the loss of their baby.
"We can confirm that a written concern has been received by the health board on May 22 which is currently being investigated by our concerns team.
"Once our investigation is complete, we will respond directly to Ms Burns with our findings."
