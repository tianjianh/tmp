[SN]TITLE[SN]
Benfica v Napoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last 20 minutes of Napoli's Champions League game at Benfica could be decisive, says boss Maurizio Sarri as his side seek to avoid being knocked out in Lisbon.

Napoli are top going into the last Group B game but have not won their past three matches in the competition.
The Italian side will go out if they lose in Portugal and Besiktas win at Dynamo Kiev, who cannot advance.
"We've got to focus on winning and not defending a draw," said Sarri.
A draw will be enough for Napoli as they beat Benfica 4-2 in Naples on 28 September. Their other win came against Kiev on 13 September, but since then they have taken one point from two games against Besiktas and been held at home in the return fixture against Kiev.
Sarri added: "It's not going to be a walk in the park in Lisbon for us, but it's not going to be for them either. The last 20 minutes could be decisive."
