Six people were arrested after clashes broke out at Melton on Melbourne's outskirts on Sunday.
Police also subdued a seventh man, 29, with capsicum spray after he allegedly punched a horse. The anti-racism protester is expected to face charges.
Three men were arrested during separate protests in the states of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia.
The men, aged 36, 48 and 64 respectively, were detained in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane for alleged offences including damaging a memorial, affray and public nuisance.
Rallies were also held in Canberra, Perth and Hobart, but police said no incidents were recorded.
One man in Melton told the media he had joined the nationalist Reclaim Australia group's rally "for the right reasons".
"Some people might be here for the wrong reasons, and the right reason is making sure everyone assimilates and becomes Australian," the man told AAP.
"We don't want to be treated like we don't belong in this town and we don't want an organisation where people of certain origins have been making trouble. We don't want trouble in our town."
Darwin Police said no rallies were held in the Northern Territory.
"We're pretty tolerant, we love everyone here in Darwin," a police spokesperson told the BBC.
The Reclaim Australia group has held a series of rallies around Australia, some of which have turned violent in the past.
Clashes between anti-racist groups and radical nationalists broke out at a Melbourne rally in July.
