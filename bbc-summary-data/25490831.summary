New home for Weston-super-Mare's RNLI lifeboat

A temporary lifeboat station has been set up close to Weston-super-Mare's Marine Lake after safety concerns forced the closure of its existing HQ.

The RNLI has been using its Birnbeck Pier base since 1882 but the derelict pier has become increasingly unsafe.
It has set up a fundraising appeal to build a new station but the charity says this will take time to achieve.
The 50ft container has been extensively modified to house the D Class rapid response lifeboat.
A spokesman for the RNLI in Weston said the charity was committed to remaining in the town but added a new HQ would require "significant funds".
He added the lifeboats on Birnbeck would now only launch if there was "a known risk to life" which could not be covered by the temporary facility.
In the meantime volunteers have constructed an interim base on Knightstone Causeway but because of the tides it is not always possible to launch the lifeboat around the clock.
The charity is now "actively looking" for a second temporary base to house its remaining fleet from Birnbeck Pier - which would be able to launch at any time.
It would then be able to vacate the site it has used for more than 130 years.
