Launching on 10 November, it'll show a range of on-demand programmes including interviews, Live Lounge performances and documentaries.
There will also be a 15-minute weekly wrap up show hosted by Chris Stark called ICYMI (In Case You Missed It).
The Official Chart Bite will be another weekly show presented by YouTube stars Jack and Dean.
The station says the move will make the network's distinctive content available to even bigger audiences of young people.
Radio 1 and 1Xtra's controller Ben Cooper said: "If you love music, if you love star studded interviews, then you will love Radio 1's new programmes.
"I can't wait for us to represent visually the energy and diversity of young people's culture in UK society."
Each week, a Radio 1 DJ will also put together their top five things to watch on BBC iPlayer.
Other content available for the launch of Radio 1 on BBC iPlayer includes three track Live Lounge sessions and exclusive interviews from Royal Blood and Taylor Swift.
There will also be a 2011 Live Lounge special from Adele featuring six tracks from the archive as well as a 20-minute programme featuring highlights and never before seen footage of Zoella and ThatcherJoe during their recent Internet Takeover.
A collection of three programmes from Radio 1's Teen Awards, including Dan and Phil's round-up of the event, will also appear on the station's section of the catch-up service.
Performances from Radio 1Xtra Live in Birmingham and two special interviews, 1Xtra's Semtex meets Rick Ross and Trevor Nelson meets Mary J Blige, will also be made available after the launch.
