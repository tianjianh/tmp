[SN]TITLE[SN]
Union ballot over offshore catering pay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Offshore catering staff are being consulted on industrial action over pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a consultative ballot by the Unite union of members employed by companies represented by the Caterers Offshore Trade Association (Cota).
They previously rejected an offer in February.
Unite said staff had "had enough". Cota said it was "extremely disappointed" that Unite was pressing ahead with an industrial ballot.
