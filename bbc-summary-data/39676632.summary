Dundee United 2-2 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United's hopes of finishing second in the Championship suffered a blow as they could only draw with lowly Dumbarton at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Falkirk's 2-2 home draw with Queen of the South gave the Tangerines the chance to move above them, and Tony Andreu's header put the hosts ahead.
But Robbie Thomson nodded The Sons level before half-time and Lewis Vaughan's neat finish made it 2-1.
Thomas Mikkelsen tapped home to level but United couldn't find a winner.
They remain in third place, a point behind Falkirk, who travel to face Dumbarton next Saturday, while United complete their regular-season fixtures away to fourth-placed Greenock Morton.
Ray McKinnon's side must win at Morton and hope Falkirk drop points, or United will be consigned to an extra two-legged tie - against Morton - in the play-offs.
The Sons, meanwhile, have all but sealed their place in the Championship for another year after moving three points clear of Raith Rovers in the relegation play-off spot, but with a superior goal difference of nine.
Vaughan, who scored his fourth goal since joining Dumbarton on loan from Raith in January, finds himself in the tricky position of possibly sending his parent club into the relegation play-off.
"Obviously I am contracted to Raith next season and it's a bit of a strange one, as I think Rovers are far too big a club to go down," he told BBC Alba.
"But I am a professional footballer at the end of the day and I am just doing my job. I don't know if I could play for Raith if they end up in the play-off, but I would love to go back there and keep them in the Championship."
Rovers could still avoid the play-off if they beat bottom side Ayr United in Kirkcaldy, and St Mirren lose at champions Hibernian in their final game.
