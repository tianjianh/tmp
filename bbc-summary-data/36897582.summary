Workers at the Dow Corning factory in Barry were told last month about the potential impact on the site of a restructuring of the company.
The company stressed at the time the decision has "absolutely nothing to do with Brexit".
About 630 people currently work at the plant.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: "Dow Corning is a major employer in Barry and will continue to be an important part of the local economy.
"I am very disappointed that the headcount in Barry will be reduced as a result of Dow's decision to cut jobs globally."
Dow Chemical Company has announced it will cut about 2,500 jobs worldwide, or about 4% of its total workforce.
Silicone production began at the Barry site in 1952, initially by a company called Midland Silicones.
Dow Corning's website describes it "as one of the most advanced facilities in the world" of its type.
It said: "Silicone fluids, rubber and specialty polymers made in Barry are used in a wide variety of applications, from cosmetics to car airbag coatings and construction sealants."
