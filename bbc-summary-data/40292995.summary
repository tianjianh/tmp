The American, 25, moved to Fleetwood Town in February 2015 after rejecting offers from Major League Soccer clubs.
He failed to make an appearance with the Cod Army and was loaned out to the Gulls before he made a permanent move.
"Brendan has been on our radar and we're delighted to have secured his services," said assistant Chris Beech.
