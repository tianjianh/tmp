The men were being deported to Canada at the start of World War Two when their ship, the SS Arandora Star, was attacked. They never had a funeral.
A plaque was unveiled at St Michael's Church in the city on Thursday to honour them.
Dorothy Bradbury, who campaigned for 10 year to get the men recognised, said: "They have no known grave."
Antonio Santuz, grandson of one of the victims, said: "I don't think Birmingham wanted to acknowledge what had actually happened."
Rita Fantinel, granddaughter of Anthony Grego, who died aboard, travelled from Canada for the service.
BBC Midlands Today's Bob Hockenhull reports.
