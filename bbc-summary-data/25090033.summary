Take-away Pisa for busy people

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What are these Pisa tests?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Not keen on browsing 500+ pages of education test results? Reluctant to look at more tables than an Ikea factory....
Here's the short-attention span version.
Teenagers around the world take these tests, but it's education ministers who feel the heat.
Because these two-hour tests in maths, reading and science, taken by 500,000 15-year-old pupils, are used to create international league tables, comparing standards in different countries. Individual pupils don't get results, it's education systems.
The latest rankings run from Shanghai at the top to Peru at the bottom. The gap in scores between top and bottom is equivalent to six years of learning.
If you think you can do better you can try the test yourself.
The tests are run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. The "Pisa" name stands for the Programme for International Student Assessment, a name chosen so that the acronym spells the same in English as in French. Unlike the OECD.
It's not just countries taking part. It also includes regional administrations, like Shanghai, which is bigger than most European countries. Although for the next tests in 2015 there will be a wider entry from more Chinese provinces.
As more attention is paid to these tests, there's a mini-backlash of doubters questioning their validity.
There are claims against the methodology of the testing and more widely there are warnings against too much being read into the results.
Among the concerns are that political pressure to boost international rankings will force education systems to become more narrowly focused on these measures.
