The captain of UK-registered trawler caught fishing unlawfully for queen scallops in Manx waters has been fined £12,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vessel, named Tobrach N, was detained in Douglas after being caught fishing without a licence eight miles south east of Chicken Rock lighthouse.
Chris Thomson, from Kirkcudbright, Scotland, was also ordered to forfeit the catch, valued at £4,596.
Environment minister Geoffrey Boot said the case sounded "a powerful warning".
"Anyone flouting the law in Manx waters will be apprehended and prosecuted," he added.
Thomson admitted fishing without a licence after appearing at Douglas Courthouse.
He told the court he was new to the vessel, having only taken command two days previously, the Isle of Man government said.
He accepted that as captain, it was his responsibility to ensure he adhered to the law, but said the vessel's owners had informed him there was a valid licence.
A government spokesman said a licence to fish in Manx waters issued to the previous owners had expired on the sale of the vessel.
Minister Boot said: "Fishing is a multimillion-pound industry for the island and the long-term sustainability of stocks is vital to our economy, hence we licence activity."
Manx territorial waters extend 12 miles around the island's coastline and contain a number of restricted fishing zones.
