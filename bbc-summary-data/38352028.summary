RHI scandal: Gerry Adams calls for independent investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has said there needs to be an independent investigation into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.

The flawed heating scheme could cost Northern Ireland taxpayers £400m.
Mr Adams said if there is corruption it needs to be rooted out.
He was speaking to party members in Londonderry who met to discuss an expected vote of no confidence in Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster.
"There can be no compromise, let's be clear," Mr Adams said.
"There can be no compromise from us.
"If there is corruption in these institutions in the north, exactly as we have seen in the south, then that needs to be rooted out."
On Friday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness' called for Arlene Foster to "stand aside" as first minister while the 'cash-for-ash' scandal is investigated.
Mrs Foster set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in 2012 but an overspend could cost taxpayers £400m.
She said she would not be stepping aside.
Mrs Foster faces a vote of no confidence in the assembly on Monday.
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) have already called for her to step down.
Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) are in a power-sharing coalition and they hold joint office in the roles of first and deputy first minister.
Mrs Foster rejected Mr McGuinness' call for her to step aside and she "does not take her instructions from Sinn Féin".
Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams told RTÉ that Saturday's meeting will involve MLAs and regional leadership as the party considers its next move in the scandal.
He echoed Mr McGuinness' statement that Mrs Foster should step down as first minister while the scandal is investigated.
"This is about the integrity of the institutions, it's about trying to restore public confidence and the first minister should do the right thing.
With each day that passes this begins to look more serious.
Martin McGuinness' call on Arlene Foster to step aside came as a surprise.
On Monday, Arlene Foster will face a vote of no confidence in the assembly.
Sinn Féin must decide either to vote with the opposition parties or abstain.
Either way, the DUP have the votes to see off the challenge under Stormont's cross-community voting rules.
But, after Mr McGuinness' dramatic move, the honeymoon looks over for the two-party DUP-Sinn Féin coalition.
"The institutions are a very important, very pivotal, appropriately hard-fought part of the Good Friday Agreement. So, we value them but they need to deliver.
"They need to be capable of having the confidence of the public and when you see £400m disappearing in a scam and then the series of allegations about how that happened, then that needs to be looked at."
Mrs Foster became leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) a year ago this week and has been first minister of Northern Ireland since January.
She was responsible for introducing the RHI scheme in her former role as minister for enterprise, trade and investment.
However, overgenerous offers of fuel subsidies and a lack of cost controls meant the scheme overspent by hundreds of millions of pounds.
Earlier this week, former DUP minister Jonathan Bell claimed some DUP special advisers (SPADs) attempted to "cleanse the record" by removing references to Mrs Foster and her department from documents linked to the scheme.
Mrs Foster has denied any wrongdoing in the scandal.
