County Championship: Derbyshire solid after Sam Northeast career-best

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesney Hughes led a solid Derbyshire batting effort after Kent skipper Sam Northeast reached a career-best 191 on the second day at Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northeast was the last man dismissed, holing out at long-on as the home side were all out for 379.
Opener Hamish Rutherford made 65 in reply and Hughes and Wayne Madsen then shared a third wicket stand of 112.
Hughes (83) gave a return catch to James Tredwell (2-70), but Madsen was 73 no at stumps, with Derbyshire 291-3.
Kent began play on 354-7, but the early dismissal of Tredwell put the pressure on Northeast to try and reach a double century before running out of partners.
His innings included 22 fours and he passed his previous best of 189 before falling short in an attempt to deposit Hughes' left-arm spin into the crowd.
