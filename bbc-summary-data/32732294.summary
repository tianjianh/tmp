Members of the technicians' union Bectu and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) voted in favour of industrial action in protest at a 2% pay award.
Unions have been pressing for a bigger wage increase in view of the TV company's profits.
ITV said it was "confident" that viewers would be unaffected.
Good Morning Britain and the filming of soap operas are among the programmes could be hit.
ITV's pre-tax profits - including exceptional items - rose 39% to Â£605m for 2014.
Bectu general secretary Gerry Morrissey said staff were "very unhappy" with the pay offer.
"There is a huge disparity between the pay offered to staff and the bonus package to executives as well as shareholder dividends.
"Our members are helping to make the profits but are not sharing in them."
An ITV spokesman said: "We are fully prepared to maintain an open dialogue with union representatives following the ballot result, which saw 226 union members voting to strike out of a UK workforce of 3,000 employees.
"We have contingency plans in place to ensure that our programmes will continue to be broadcast and are confident that viewers will be unaffected by the proposed industrial action."
