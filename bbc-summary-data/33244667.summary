A court heard the car of Danial Saleem, 23, of  South Shields, broke down on the A74 near Eaglesfield in December.
He pulled onto the hard shoulder but his passenger Faranza Kousar, 39, was hit by another vehicle as she was getting out of the car and died.
Saleem was fined Â£500 for driving without insurance and with no L plates while holding a provisional licence.
He was also not accompanied by a qualified driver.
Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how Saleem had left the scene of the crash and made his way to a service station at Johnstonebridge.
A police search used CCTV footage to help trace him to the north east of England.
He admitted driving on the day of the crash and on the previous day without insurance.
As well as the fine he had seven points endorsed on his licence.
