Yorkshire moorland owners could help reduce flooding

Pressure should be put on Yorkshire moorland owners to reduce flooding downstream, a councillor has said.

The Yorkshire moors are cut to provide food for red grouse, boosting numbers for shooting.
But experts have said the land should act as a sponge, with vegetation soaking up rainfall and slowing water before it reaches urban areas.
Calderdale councillor Steve Sweeney said moorland owners should consider people further down the valleys.
The Calder Valley was particularly badly flooded in December, as was York below the North York Moors.
Mr Sweeney, who is also on Yorkshire Regional and Coastal Flood Committee, said: "Landowners are entitled to manage their estates in a way that is to their benefit.
"But they are not entitled to manage that estate in a way that threatens lives, livelihoods and properties of people further down the valleys."
Dr Mark Avery, an environmental campaigner, said the removal of vegetation means water runs off hills and into built-up areas more quickly.
"About 70% of UK rainfall falls on our hills, and the way we manage hillsides will affect how quickly that water gets down to the lowlands, where most of us live," he said.
"Forestry plantations, sheep farming and grouse shooting all have a part to play in reducing flood risk."
Moorland on the North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales has been burned to encourage new growth for around 150 years, because tender heather shoots are ideal food for red grouse.
A day's grouse shooting can cost Â£2,000 per gun.
Landowners said shooting is vital for the rural economy and delivers around Â£20m to Yorkshire's economy annually, with grouse numbers increasing in recent years.
Yorkshire flood envoy Robert Goodwill, Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said the view was "simplistic".
"Grouse shooting brings money into these communities and means people are out there managing moorlands," he said.
"It's simplistic to say to stop managing the moors for grouse [will reduce flooding]."
