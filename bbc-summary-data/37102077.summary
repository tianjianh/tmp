The 23-year-old Londoner lost on points in the semi-finals to Kazakhstan's Adilbek Niyazymbetov, who picked him off from range in a classy performance.
Defeated semi-finalists do not fight again and both receive bronze medals.
"I'm disappointed but a bronze medal surpasses all expectations," Buatsi said.
"Once I got here and I was winning, I was aiming for gold and nothing else, but coming out no-one expected a medal. I did the hard work and I gave it my best shot."
Buatsi secured stoppages in his first two fights, and gave Algeria's Abdelhafid Benchabla two standing counts in the quarter-finals.
After that quarter-final victory, he revealed former five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr had told him he could win a world title in the professional ranks.
"I know I am a very good fighter and this experience is only going to add more to what I have already got," Buatsi added.
Compatriots Nicola Adams and Joe Joyce are both guaranteed medals after reaching their respective semi-finals.
