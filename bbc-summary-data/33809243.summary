British police are to be sent to party destinations Ibiza and Magaluf to help Spanish police deal with victims and offenders from the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A two-week trial will see a sergeant and a constable from West Midlands Police working alongside officers from the Guardia Civil.
They will spend the first week in Magaluf in Majorca and the second in San Antonio, Ibiza.
The project is being paid for by the Foreign Office.
Police from France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Morocco have already taken part in similar initiatives in Spain.
Magaluf hit the headlines earlier this summer when holidaymakers defied new rules aiming to crack down on drunkenness.
The two British officers will patrol alongside Spanish colleagues in tourist hotspots including beaches, airport terminals and town centres.
They will wear full British uniform and work eight-hour shifts between 07:00 and 22:00 CEST (BST+1), starting on Monday.
The National Police Chiefs' Council said it would assist the Guardia Civil when British nationals were victims of crime, support any criminal investigations where Britons were victims, witnesses or offenders, and help British nationals who were victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse or other serious offences.
Simon Manley, British ambassador to Spain, said: "The presence of UK police officers will help to remind British holidaymakers of the importance of respecting local laws and customs, ensuring that everyone has a safe and enjoyable holiday, free from trouble and crime."
