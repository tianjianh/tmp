The Oscar-winning actor turned up with his wife Stella at Cardiff's Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, where he was given an impromptu tour and the chance to meet the students.
Sir Anthony, 78, also took part in a read-through of the Chekhov play, Three Sisters.
One student said it was "inspiring".
Joe Wiltshire-Smith, 21, said: "I've had Sir Anthony's autograph on my bedroom wall since I was 13.
"Suddenly he's there in front of me in a rehearsal and I'm doing an improvised scene where he's playing Natasha to my Andrey.
"It was mind-boggling, incredibly inspiring and I'll never forget it."
The star's appearance in Cardiff coincides with the premier of his latest TV show, Westworld.
The show got its first airing in the UK on Tuesday evening, after pulling in a three-year record premiere audience in the USA for the HBO channel.
Sir Anthony,  who won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of villain Hannibal Lecter,  also met with designers, stage managers and music students at the Cardiff institution, sitting through jazz rehearsals at the college's Dora Stoutzker Hall.
The star from Margam, in Neath Port Talbot graduated from the college in 1957 and found fame after being spotted by Laurence Olivier and joining the Royal National Theatre.
