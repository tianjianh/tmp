From 2008 to 2011, the girls were given drugs and alcohol and were abused and raped when "they could barely stand".
Shamin Uddin, 26, from Ardwick, Manchester was jailed for 19 years and Giash Uddin, 27, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, for six years.
Robert Jackson, 24, from Ardwick, was given 12 years at Manchester Crown Court. The girls were aged 13 to 15.
The victims, now both 18, would meet the group to go to parties in hotels, apartments and private houses across Greater Manchester.
Police said one of the girls was raped by Shamin Uddin after she went to lie down because she had drunk a large amount of alcohol and was being sick.
Jackson raped the same girl at another house party. She told officers she "gave up" as he attacked her.
On another occasion, the other victim was raped by Shamin Uddin after she had gone to sleep during a house party. She told police he did not check if she was awake.
Shamin Uddin was found guilty of two rapes, two attempted rapes and sex with a girl aged 13 to 15.
Giash Uddin was convicted of sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 15 and Jackson was found guilty of rape.
Det Ch Insp Pete Marsh said: "These two young girls have been emotionally manipulated by a group of older men into believing the sexual abuse they were subjected to was normal and acceptable behaviour.
"On numerous occasions, the girls were deliberately plied with alcohol to the point they could barely stand, before being raped by the men when they were not in a fit state to be able to even try and stop them."
He added: "This group exploited the fact their two young victims were vulnerable and impressionable, bombarding them with a constant stream of attention and gifts of alcohol."
In March 2011, police launched an investigation after social workers around Stockport became concerned young girls who were missing from home were at risk of abuse.
More than 40 girls were spoken to and police discovered a small number of the group claimed they had been raped by older men.
