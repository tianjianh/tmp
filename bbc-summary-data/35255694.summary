The 24-year-old, who joined Standard from Leicester City last summer, has agreed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the Seagulls.
"He was somebody I was interested in for a number of reasons," Albion manager Chris Hughton said.
"He is a good technical player and has experience of the Championship."
Knockaert spent three years with Leicester, scoring 16 goals in 106 appearances for the Foxes, before moving to Belgium.
"He is a different type of player to the wide players we have here," Hughton added.
"He can play in three positions; on the left, off the front man, but predominantly in his previous time here in England he played on the right side.
"He is used to having a responsibility in the wide areas but mostly it is [about] what he can bring us offensively in terms of goals and assists."
