Midfielder Byrne, 27, has attracted interest from former County boss Justin Edinburgh, who's pushing for promotion in League One with Gillingham.
Edinburgh confirmed to the BBC earlier this week that he considered moving for Byrne in the transfer window.
"It shows what a good player Byrney is. He's captain of this club for a reason," Feeney said.
"There are a few players who, I'm sure, there will be a fight to keep but we want to stay up first and cross that bridge when we come to it."
Feeney isn't taking the interest in the player personally, however.
"I'm disappointed Justin didn't want to sign me," laughed Feeney.
"Justin's a great lad, he was on my pro licence course.
"But that's football and it shows you Byrney's one of my best players."
Edinburgh signed Byrne from Barnet, who visit Rodney Parade this weekend.
Ex-Tottenham defender Edinburgh was Newport boss between 2011-15.
Feeney, who is Newport's third manager of the season, is now targeting more changes to his squad ahead of the re-opening of the loan window on Tuesday.
"There was one or two I was hopeful of getting before the [transfer] window so there could be stuff happening," he explained.
"We're speaking to potential loan players and those who may be unattached."
