Manager Neil Warnock hopes Cardiff City's dramatic win over Bristol City will encourage owner Vincent Tan to back his plans to launch a fresh bid to reach the Premier League.

The Bluebirds saw off  Bristol City 3-2 in the Championship at Ashton Gate to move clear of the relegation zone.
"He (Tan) will be as happy as anybody when he sees the result," said Warnock.
His first face-to-face meeting with Tan has been brought forward to Saturday night from Sunday.
Warnock added: "We are just going to have a chat about the club in general.
"It's an update, what we need to take the club forward and to see what is available really.
"Long-term, we need five or six players really in the squad, but short-term I think we need two, maybe three."
Bluebirds showed determination to fight back twice and took all the points thanks to a fine strike from Anthony Pilkington with five minutes left.
Warnock had nothing but praise for his men, saying: "I thought they were super.
"We had a couple of kicks in the teeth. I thought we were playing well at 1-1 and then we conceded a sloppy goal and it showed the character of the team to come back again.
"The third one was  surely as good a goal as Pilkington has scored, although he'll probably tell me he's got more of them. It was a super strike, good enough to win any game.
"You could see what it meant to the lads the way they all congratulated him.
"It's a tough derby so to come out on top with three goals I think the fans will have gone home happy.
"Winning at Bristol City is always nice for me. You've got to work hard to win here and we have done."
