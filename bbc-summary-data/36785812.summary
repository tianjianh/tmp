Exeter Chiefs: Thomas Waldrom and Harry Williams agree new contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter Chiefs pair Thomas Waldrom and Harry Williams have signed new deals until the end of the 2017-18 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Back-row forward Waldrom, 33, joined Exeter from Leicester in 2014 and has been the Premiership's highest try-scorer in both seasons at Sandy Park.
Former Jersey prop Williams, 24, broke into Rob Baxter's side last season and started their Premiership final defeat.
They join England Saxons players Don Armand, Alec Hepburn and Mitch Lees, who all agreed contracts on Sunday.
Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter said: "Tom has shown in the last couple of years that he's playing right at the top of the game, but we are still confident that physically and mentally he is still up to contributing a lot to the team and to the club.
"It's the same for Harry, he came in for his first year last season and he did extremely well.
"There are not many guys who have come out of the Championship and found themselves playing in European quarter-finals, Premiership semi-finals, a Premiership final and done as well as he has."
