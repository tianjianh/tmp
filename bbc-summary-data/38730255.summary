NHS Borders warned earlier this month that it was facing "exceptional" pressure on beds at the Borders General Hospital.
An update issued on the situation said the facility near Melrose remained busy.
It stressed that staff were continuing to work hard to ensure that patients were "kept safe and well cared for".
NHS Borders reminded the public that community pharmacists were available to provide advice and treatment for a range of common illnesses and ailments, and to give advice about medicines.
"If you have an illness or injury that won't go away and that isn't an emergency, contact your GP to make an appointment," a statement added.
"When your GP surgery is closed and you're too ill to wait, you can access medical care by calling NHS 24 on the free phone number 111.
"If the condition is immediately life-threatening, dial 999 for an emergency ambulance."
