Police said the material was found when they searched the home of Micah Johnson in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite.
Five police officers were killed and seven wounded in a hail of gunfire during a protest against the shooting of black men by police.
Johnson died following a long stand-off with police in central Dallas.
Police confirmed media reports that the 25-year-old army veteran was the person killed when they remotely detonated explosives they sent into his hideaway near the scene of the shooting.
They said he had no criminal history.
Earlier, Police Chief David Brown said the suspect had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police.
Mr Brown added that the man had said he was not affiliated with any groups and he had acted alone.
US Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared to confirm this in a statement later on Friday.
"At this time there appears to have been one gunman with no known links to or inspiration from any international terrorist organisation," he told a news conference in New York.
