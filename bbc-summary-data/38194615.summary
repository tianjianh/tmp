It is part of Small Business Saturday, which highlights the goods and services of smaller firms in the run up to Christmas.
The events take place on the first Saturday of December every year and organisers claim it has a lasting impact on small businesses.
But many claim competition from larger companies remains a challenge.
Aberdeen's city centre manger Geoff Cooper said nearly half of Aberdeen's high street was made up of independent retailers.
"I think there's room for everyone on the high street and I think the very fact that almost 50% of our retailers are independent shows that there's room for a thriving independent sector," he said.
"We've got lots of really good independent businesses who are expanding and are very sound financially."
He said small businesses cannot expect "special favours" but he encouraged them to work together.
"Small Business Saturday is a really good example of how businesses can come together and work together, so they can think big and help consumers think about the small independent retailers," he said.
