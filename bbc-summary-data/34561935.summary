[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronny Deila believes Celtic should have beaten Motherwell by more than just Nadir Ciftic's solitary goal.

The manager also felt his side were denied two possible penalties after Kieran Kennedy's challenge on Scott Brown and also a handball by Kennedy.
"For 70 minutes I was really satisfied," he said.
"We should have scored more goals, we should have had at least one penalty, maybe two. For the last 20 we should have been more brave on the ball."
Deila was satisfied with the three points, which took Celtic back to the top of Scottish Premiership.
"We are in a good run now. We go into every game to win. We look forward to it and now it's just about keeping the momentum."
It was a tough afternoon for new Motherwell boss Mark McGhee, starting his second spell in charge at Fir Park.
After taking the decision to start with experienced players Keith Lasley, Scott McDonald and Lionel Ainsworth on the bench, McGhee accepted culpability after asking defender Louis Laing to play an unaccustomed role in midfield.
"There was a 20-minute spell - 60 or 55 minutes in - where I felt we did a lot better," said McGhee. "But you're never sure that they're not going to get another goal.
"The first half felt like we were playing with a missing player. Young Louis Laing took up a role that wasn't the role we intended - but that's down to me, the instructions I gave him in training, the instructions I gave him before the game.
"It made him a spare player and it almost made us a man down defensively and a man down when we won the ball back, which made it very difficult for us.
"When we sorted that at half-time it was much, much better. And then I hope people saw why I put him in the middle of the park because in the second half he was terrific.
"He matched them, competed with them, he passed the ball, he ran with the ball - he did everything you'd expect of a midfield player and I think we have the makings of a decent midfield player.
"We might have nicked something but them winning 1-0 was just about the balance of the game."
