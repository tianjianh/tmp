Neil McDonald: Blackpool boss ignores Sunderland link

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool manager Neil McDonald has not had any contact from Sunderland about reuniting with their new boss Sam Allardyce as his assistant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McDonald worked under Allardyce at Bolton, Blackburn and West Ham and took over at Bloomfield Road in June after the pair left Upton Park.
Alladryce joined Sunderland on 9 October but yet to name a number two.
"There has been no contact and I'm happy with what I'm doing," McDonald told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I've got a brilliant relationship with Sam, so you put two and two together and get five.
"It's taken me a long time to become a number one after Carlisle and then helping Sam and myself to enhance our reputations, which we have done.
"This is my turn and I'm proud to be Blackpool manager."
