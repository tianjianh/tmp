As the phone lines closed on Saturday morning, the UK total stood at a record £37.1m.
On Friday night, Barra Best and Jo Scott presented BBC Northern Ireland's contribution to the UK-wide TV extravaganza, broadcast on BBC One.
The appeal currently funds 197 projects in every county across Northern Ireland, to the value of over £8m.
Highlights of Friday night's Northern Ireland fundraiser included performances from Shane Filan and Irish boyband HomeTown.
Former Westlife singer-turned-solo-artist Filan was in Belfast to perform his new single Right Here.
He said he was "delighted" to support BBC Children in Need.
"Over the years I've seen some of the great work they do locally for children's and young people's projects, both big and small," he added.
Another highlight was a nationwide live performance of Miley Cyrus song The Climb, with 175 children from Northern Ireland joining more than 2,000 others from across the UK to form a choir for the rendition.
BBC Radio Ulster presenters and staff were busy all week collecting donations.
An on-air charity auction held by the Hugo Duncan Show raised £31,500.
In London, Sir Terry Wogan missed Friday's fundraiser for health reasons, the first time he has not hosted it since its 1980 launch.
Last year, the Northern Ireland total on the night was £732,333, contributing to an overall UK total of £32.6m.
The final UK total was £49.1m.
BBC Children in Need spends the money raised by the appeal to make a positive change to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in the UK.
