Cat thrown out of 4x4 car in Kelty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat has been rescued after being thrown out of 4x4 car in Kelty, Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The female cat was thrown out of a stationary, dark-coloured 4x4 onto Oakfield Street in the early hours of Wednesday.
It is not clear whether the cat was purposely dumped or had climbed into the car.
It was picked up by a member of the public who looked after it before it was taken to the Scottish SPCA centre in Edinburgh.
SSPCA Ch Insp John Chisholm said: "She's been named Cleo by our centre staff in Edinburgh where she is now recovering from her ordeal.
"We are unsure if she was purposely dumped or climbed into the person's car accidentally.
"She's a friendly cat but is still slightly nervous, which is understandable as she's not had the best couple of days."
Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.
Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.
