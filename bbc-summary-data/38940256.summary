[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 1-1 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale dropped into the League One relegation zone as they were held by Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bob Harris's own-goal put Rovers behind, but a fine goal from Billy Bodin secured the visitors a share of the spoils.
That leaves Vale, still under the caretaker management of Michael Brown, without a win in seven games.
After a goalless first period, the away side almost went in front three minutes into the second haf when Vale old boy Chris Lines' charging run left him with only Fasan to beat, but he fired just wide from a tight angle.
Vale then took the lead on 54 minutes when Harris attempted to clear Kiko's low cross, but he only succeeded in slicing the ball past his own keeper.
But Rovers were level on 78 minutes when Crewe old boy Bodin worked himself some space on the edge of the Vale box before firing an unstoppable shot past Leonardo Fasan into the top left corner.
Vale almost snatched a 90th-minute winner when Callum Guy latched onto a through ball, but he could not lift the ball over Joe Lumley.
