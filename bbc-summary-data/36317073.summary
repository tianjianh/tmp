Luxembourg's Jungels, 23, took the lead from Etixx-Quick Step team-mate Gianluca Brambilla, with the Italian dropping to sixth overall.
Bardiani Valvole rider Ciccone finished 42 seconds ahead of Tinkoff's Ivan Rovny on the mountainous 136-mile ride from Campi Bisenzio to Sestola.
"Today I'm living the most beautiful day of my life," said Ciccone.
The 21-year-old, who only turned professional this year, added: "It doesn't feel real. It's like being in a bubble."
Team Sky's Mikel Landa began the day one minute and 18 seconds off the lead, but illness prevented him finishing the 10th stage.
"It was pretty clear that the illness had badly affected him and that he wasn't going to be able to continue," said team manager Sir Dave Brailsford.
Trek Segafredo's Fabian Cancellara, who was ill just before the start of the Giro, also pulled out before the start of the stage, as did Team Katusha's Alexey Tsatevich.
The 11th stage on Wednesday is the mainly flat 141-mile route from Modena to Asolo.
