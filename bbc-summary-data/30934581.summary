A "reckless" driver has been captured travelling along a motorway in Manchester with the car windscreen almost entirely covered by snow.

The car was filmed driving on the Barton Bridge section of the M60 earlier this week by another motorist's camera.
Greater Manchester Police said it was "incredibly reckless driving" and it was investigating the footage.
It is thought the driver was travelling at 50mph (80km/h) at the time.
A police spokesman said: "Not only is this motorist a risk to themselves and a risk to others, the driver is committing a criminal offence by driving with an impaired windscreen.
"It takes just ten minutes to defrost a windscreen but a split second to cause a serious accident."
