A minute's silence has been held exactly one year on at the scene of the Clutha helicopter crash in which 10 people were killed.

Friends and relatives of the dead gathered outside the Glasgow pub where a police helicopter crashed on 29 November last year.
They were joined by police and medics for the silence at 22:22 GMT, the time contact was lost with the aircraft.
Earlier in the day, a service was held at Glasgow Cathedral.
The service was attended by families and friends of the victims, as well as Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said afterwards that the crash was a tragedy that would "live in Glasgow's memory forever".
"But out of adversity last year came an incredible spirit as the city pulled together," she added.
"We saw from our emergency services and ordinary members of the public such an amazing response."
Dozens of floral tributes and candles were placed outside the Clutha to mark the anniversary.
The crash killed pilot David Traill and PCs Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis, who were on board the Eurocopter EC 135.
Those killed in the pub were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, and Samuel McGhee. Joe Cusker was pulled from the wreckage alive but later died in hospital.
A preliminary report into the crash found both engines on the aircraft failed but did not point to an exact cause of the crash. A fuller report is expected next year.
During Saturday's service, the Philip Tartaglia, the Archbishop of Glasgow, said victims of the crash "have never been forgotten, especially not by those who love them most and who miss them most sorely".
But he said he hoped people would become "better, more compassionate, more understanding human beings" following the tragedy.
The service and silence were among a number of events held to mark the first anniversary of the crash.
Also on Saturday, police officers faced firefighters in a commemorative charity ice hockey match at Braehead Arena.
On Friday night, a benefit concert was held at the Barrowland in Glasgow to launch a charity in memory of those who died.
