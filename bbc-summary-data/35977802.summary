The Onchan rider, 26, will represent Team Sky at the inaugural Manx International Cycling Grand Prix.
Co-director Richard Fletcher said it was "fantastic" to have the two-time national champion in a field which also includes Ben Swift and Ed Clancy.
The race will take place around the Isle of Man TT course.
Last year Kennaugh broke Chris Boardman's 22-year-old record for cycling a lap of the course.
Fletcher confirmed more than 140 elite riders will compete in the event designed to showcase the island ahead of a second bid to host the British Cycling National Road Championships.
The event, which starts in front of the TT grandstand at 13:25 BST on Sunday, will include both men's and women's races.
The three-lap men's race (113 miles) and two-lap women's race (75.5 miles) will form part of the British Cycling National Elite Road Race Series.
