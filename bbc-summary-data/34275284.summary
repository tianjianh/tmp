[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn on Europe, leadership and the Queen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Well we're only four days in and an awful lot has happened. Not only was there a totally new Prime Minister's Questions this lunchtime, tonight Jeremy Corbyn gave his first proper interview since winning the leadership and had some extremely interesting things to say, and some surprises.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But for what it's worth, here's what surprised me.
1. He says it's not a change of heart, but his position on the EU has now changed and is clear. Days ago he refused to assure colleagues he'd never campaign to leave the EU. Tonight, he came up with a new position. He told me he can not see a situation where he'd campaign for exit, and said that staying in the EU, even if it meant staying in to change it, would be in Labour's manifesto.
2. Despite his much vaunted belief in "discussion and persuasion", he was abundantly clear that in the end, he will have the final say. This might be news to the making it work brigade, those members of the shadow cabinet from the centre of the Labour party who have decided to stay and who have enjoyed so far, not having to be bound by Mr Corbyn's ideas.
3. Although he told me the row over the national anthem was "very strange", he's unafraid to stray into other potential controversies, refusing to say whether he would kneel to the Queen, if and when he becomes a member of the Privy Council.
