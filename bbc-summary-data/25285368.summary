Uruguay will now play Colombia at the Maracana on Saturday in the last 16 of the World Cup, but controversy is likely to rumble on.
Italy left the field furious at the manner of their defeat and having to come to terms with a second World Cup in a row in which they have failed to get beyond the group stages - in 2010 they finished bottom of their group with only 2 points.
Italian coach Cesare Prandelli said before the game it was "the most important match of my professional career" and after the defeat offered his resignation.
This was a tense and turgid contest that was bad-tempered both on the field and the touchline.
On a number of occasions the officials had to step between the two benches, the referee's whistle interrupted play constantly and the players spent as much time on the turf as they did running with the ball at their feet.
That suited Italy, who only needed a draw to go through. The Azzuri, in a 3-5-2 formation, lacked cohesion, tempo and sustained threat. But if their system was designed to disrupt Uruguay's attacking flow, it was working.
Andrea Pirlo forced Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera to push his swerving free-kick over the bar, while striker Ciro Immobile shot wildly over.
Edinson Cavani wanted a penalty after 50 minutes, having gone down under the challenge of Andrea Barzagli, but the referee waved his claims away.
The Mexican official would, however, change the game moments later when he showed Marchisio a red card after the Juve midfielder challenged Arevalo for a loose ball near the centre circle.
Marchisio's studs were raised and made contact with the Uruguay midfielder close to his knee, leaving the referee with no option but to show him the red card.

Uruguay sensed their opportunity. Suarez almost broke the deadlock, striking a low shot with the outside of his boot that Buffon turned away with his upper arm.
More controversy was to come, however, as Suarez and Chiellini clashed in the penalty area with nine minutes remaining.
The Italy defender immediately complained to the referee that he had been bitten and attempted to show the official the mark.
With Italy's players still complaining to the referee, Uruguay won a corner. Suarez delivered a perfect cross and Godin rose highest, the ball going in off his back.
Italy threw everything at Uruguay to rescue the game, including keeper Buffon striding forward for a late corner, but Oscar Tabarez's side held firm.
This game is unlikely to be remembered for football, however. The spotlight will, once again, fall on Suarez.
