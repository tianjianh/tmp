Willett added a 69 to his opening 65 to be eight under alongside Miguel Tabuena, Soomin Lee and Jorge Campillo.
"I'm struggling a bit with my body," said the 28-year-old. "My energy levels collapsed on the back nine and I started making a few silly mistakes."
Nathan Holman followed his 64 with a 65 to be 13 under, with England's Richard Bland also shooting 65 to be two back.
The Australian picked up shots on the third, fourth, sixth and 13th and despite playing in the afternoon's tougher conditions, also made birdies at three of the last four holes.
World number 13 Willett, who is seeking back-to-back wins following his victory in the Dubai Desert Classic a fortnight ago, added:  "I'm going to see the physio then catch up on some rest, because I'm feeling very tired.
"But the flags were also quite tricky today and the wind's picking up a bit, so I can't see the scoring being too ridiculous. And I would've taken eight under after two rounds."
