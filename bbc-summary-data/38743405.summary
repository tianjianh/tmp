Great Yarmouth storm surge river jumper admits being 'stupid'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who jumped into a river at the height of a storm surge tide after ignoring a police officer's warnings has admitted being "stupid".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Wood, 43, leapt into the River Yare in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 13 January when parts of the town had been evacuated over flooding worries.
Despite being asked to leave, he told the officer: "I might as well jump in."
Wood admitted a charge of obstructing a police officer in their duty during a hearing before the town's magistrates.
The officer said she watched in "utter shock and disbelief" saying he travelled "several metres in a split second".

In mitigation, Wood's defence said he admitted his actions had been "stupid", but added he was a naval architect and experienced in the seas and rivers and he had been given bravery awards for helping in disaster situations such as Hurricane Katrina.
Handing down an order to pay a Â£150 fine, with another Â£115 in court costs and fees, magistrate Darren Gilkes said it was a night the officers would not forget.
Wood was cleared of another charge of being abusive to an officer.
