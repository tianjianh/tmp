Salah set up Stephan El Shaarawy for the opener and scored the second himself via a deflected shot.
Diego Perotti tapped in before Josip Ilicic pulled one back from the penalty spot after a foul on Cristian Tello.
Salah's second goal sealed a win that takes third-place Roma three points ahead of Fiorentina, who are fourth.
It continues a remarkable run for Roma under Luciano Spalletti, who replaced Rudi Garcia as coach in January and lost just once in the league before going on the current winning streak which has left them five points behind Juve.
The leaders travel to Atalanta on Sunday after second-placed Napoli, who are three points off top spot, host another mid-table team in Chievo Verona on Saturday.
