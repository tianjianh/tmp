BBC Sport Predictor: How to play and frequently asked questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport has launched a Predictor game for the Premier League and Scottish Premiership. So what's new, how do you play and what happens if you need help?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
(Return to the Predictor at any point here).
The biggest difference is you can create personalised leagues to play against friends, family and colleagues. This will work in the same way as it did in our Euro 2016 Predictor.
Yes. It's free to play and you can sign up in two easy steps - all you need to do is enter an email address and password.
No. Your sign-in details will be the same and the nickname you set for the Euro Predictor carries over to the Premier League and Scottish Premiership Predictors.
Any leagues set up for the Euros will automatically transfer to the Premier League, with the points starting at zero. You can choose to delete the league (if you are the the creator) or leave the league if you do not wish to be part of it for the Premier League.
Once you have signed in to the BBC, just enter your predictions and hit 'save predictions'.
At any point until a match kicks off. Once the match is under way, you cannot change your prediction.
10 points are awarded for a correct result (ie correctly predicting the winner or that the match will end as a draw). 40 points are awarded for predicting the exact scoreline.
When you sign up for the first time, you will automatically be entered into the 'Overall league', which is created by BBC Sport and contains everyone who has registered to play the game.
To create a league, use 'Create your own league'.
Every league needs its own name. This makes it easier for you to distinguish between different leagues you are involved in.
We need you to choose a nickname that will be visible to other people in your league and also in the 'Overall league'. We do not want to publicly display your email address, so this is a way for you (and your friends, family and colleagues) to identify you within leagues. We suggest you do not use your surname, and your nickname will need to be unique within the game.
You must be 16 or over to set a nickname and play in leagues.
This process will begin after the final fixture of the day has taken place and will be completed overnight.
When you create a username and enter a league for the first time, your position will display as 'N/A' until the league table is updated at the end of the day.
Only the person who created the league can delete it. However, you are free to leave a league at any time.
No, when your nickname is set, it is permanent.
On the leagues tab you have the facility to create or join leagues. These are accessed through the buttons under the overall league. Alternatively you can send your friends the league URL and when they click on that they can join immediately.
If you go back into the league you created, your pin and the facility to copy the league invite URL is located at the foot of the page.
No, each round will open up as the season progresses e.g. you can't predict the results of round two matches until all of the matches in round one have been played.
No, all the predictions you make will count for all the leagues you belong to.
No, you can delete the league if you are the creator and every member of a league can remove themselves from it.
This has been done deliberately to prevent ineligible predictions being saved e.g. predicting --1 or 1-- instead of 0-1 or 1-0. People can often do this in error and not be awarded points because of it.
At the top of your device you should see a button that says 'Your account'. From here you can log in and out at any time.
The Predictor will work on the latest version of any browser, but some older browsers are not supported.
It is possible to enter predictions and see your leagues on any device provided you are logged in with the same BBC ID on that device.
No. You aren't able to see other people's predictions but you are able to see overall points of any participants on the leagues tab.
If you miss a prediction no score will be recorded and no points will be awarded.
On the predictions tab there is a button labelled 'Save Predictions' at the top and bottom of the page where you can save any predictions whenever you are ready.
Do you have to enter all your predictions for each round before being allowed to save them?
No, you can enter predictions one at a time or all at once. It's your choice and you can change your mind up to kick-off.
