Bryony Page finished fifth and Kat Driscoll seventh at the Trampoline, Tumbling and Double-Mini Trampoline World Championships on Sunday.
It is the first time GB have earned two female trampoline spots at an Olympics.
Nicole Short then added to her team silver on Saturday with an individual double-mini trampoline silver medal.
"I wanted to carry on the pattern of three, two, one, but I'm thinking about retiring after this one so it's a little bit emotional," said the 21-year-old from Liverpool, who previously won bronze and silver medals at the Worlds.
Sheffield-based Page, 24, briefly led the women's individual trampoline on 55.295 points while team-mate Driscoll, 29, scored 52.935 as China's Li Dan took gold.
