The Harrogate crew was wrongly sent two and half miles from where it should have been by call operators working in Cornwall.
North Yorkshire and Cornwall fire and rescue services share control room operations at peak periods.
The North Yorkshire service confirmed an investigation is under way.
It said crews attending the business park fire at Killinghall, near Harrogate, were delayed 10 minutes as a result of the mix-up, but the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said fire engines were 17 minutes late.
Simon Wall, chairman of North Yorkshire FBU, said: "The delay could have been catastrophic if it had been a house fire."
Wednesday's call was handled by the Critical Control Centre in Tolvaddon, Cornwall,.
Mr Wall said "collaborating with Cornwall means there is a massive lack of local knowledge".
He added: "The collaboration between control centres is what the government wants and we accept that, but an incident like this is unacceptable.
"Something has gone desperately wrong."
Owen Hayward, North Yorkshire Assistant Chief Fire Officer, confirmed an investigation is under way with Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service.
He said: "We are not yet sure if someone gave us the wrong postcode or something went wrong in the control room."
No-one was  available for comment from Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service.
