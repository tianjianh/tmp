Michael Davies, 71, from Blaina, Blaenau Gwent, was on a coach trip with his wife when he went missing on the evening of Tuesday, 26 May.
The new CCTV footage shows him in the corridor of the Hotel Maria where they were staying on the night he vanished.
He was last seen in the street on CCTV in the early hours of the Wednesday.
In a statement released through Hampshire Constabulary, his family said: "We still remain in limbo with the not knowing where our husband, father and grandfather is.
"We are still crying out for any information about Mike - please contact the police ASAP if you have any."
Numerous searches involving specialist officers, dogs, and rescue volunteers have taken place in the areas surrounding Avenue Road where Mr Davies was last seen.
Water search officers have also conducted inquiries in the area of reed beds near Sandown and Yaverland seafront.
There is no evidence to suggest Mr Davies has been the victim of a crime.
