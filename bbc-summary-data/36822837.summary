[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joyce Morgan, 74, has helped generations of children cross the road at Roch Community School since 1973, while helping out as a dinner lady.
Mrs Morgan, who lives a short distance away from the Pembrokeshire school, said: "I've really enjoyed my time there and I'm going to miss everyone."
A special concert is being held on Monday to celebrate her retirement.
As well as her crossing patrol duties twice a day, Mrs Morgan has also been involved with school trips, swimming lessons and reading with the children.
"It's a wonderful school," she said, "but it's time to finish now".
"I've enjoyed spending time with the children, seeing them grow up and then looking after their children."
Carl Evans, head of Roch School, said: "Joyce was employed the second week the school opened so it's fair to say she has become part of the school.
"All of the children look up to her, firstly as a mother figure and now as a grandmother figure. She's a wonderful lady."
He added: "In the 43 years she has been here, she has taken on a number of roles within the school and there's no doubt about it, she will be sorely missed."
