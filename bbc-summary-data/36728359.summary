The budget carrier said services to Alicante and Malaga would start in February.
Ryanair last ran a service from the Granite City in 2011, with a route to Dublin in Ireland.
Ryanair said the new Spanish services would deliver 50,000 passengers a year to the airport.
Airport managing director Carol Benzie said: "This is fantastic news from Ryanair and it clearly demonstrates the opportunity that exists for leisure capacity here in Aberdeen."
