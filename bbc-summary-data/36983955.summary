Jack Alexander Wolf Marrian, the son of Lady Emma Clare Campbell of Cawdor, has denied the charge at a court in Nairobi and was remanded in custody pending a bail hearing on Monday.
A Kenyan national, Roy Francis Mwanthi, also denies the charges.
The pair were charged after drugs said to be worth about Â£4m were found in a container at the port of Mombasa.
The haul was discovered by Kenyan police and US Drug Enforcement Agency officials in containers that had arrived from Brazil at the main Kenyan seaport last week.
The class A drugs were allegedly shipped around the world in containers labelled as carrying sugar destined for Uganda.
The prosecution said documents found on the ship that was used to transport the cargo detailed 30-year-old Mr Marrian as a director of Mshale Uganda Limited, the firm which was to receive the containers.
Mr Marrian was born into the Clan Campbell of Cawdor, but grew up in Nairobi, attending one of Kenya's leading international schools at the same time as the cyclist Chris Froome.
