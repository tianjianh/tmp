A 200-acre (81ha) site at Ridgewood Farm on the outskirts of Uckfield has been earmarked for the homes and a primary school.
The developers have also promised to turn 70 acres (28ha) into a "greenfield space" for the community.
The project is part of Wealden District Council's local plan for sustainable growth up to 2027.
An outline planning application is expected to be submitted to the local authority by the end of January.
Ian Smith, mayor of Uckfield, said: "There is still influence that can be had over how the site will look.
"I know there are divided opinions on this but they will have more opportunity to talk about things like access arrangements, the school arrangements and employment opportunities."
The plans will be on display at the Civic Centre in Uckfield until Friday.
