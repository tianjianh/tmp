A woman travelling with three children has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to go to Syria to engage in terror acts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, from Leicester, was arrested at Birmingham Airport by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit officers under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act.
The 30-year-old's home and another associated address are being searched.
Officers are working with other agencies to ensure the children's welfare, West Midlands Police said.
Officers have a maximum of 36 hours to question her before charging, releasing, bailing or applying to a court for a warrant of further detention.
More than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million have been displaced in four years of conflict in Syria.
The conflict is between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule - as well as jihadist militants from Islamic State.
