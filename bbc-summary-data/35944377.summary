[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were alerted to the incident at Deeside Golf Club in Bieldside at about 11:25 on Thursday.
Golf clubs and clothing were stolen. No estimated value has yet been put on the haul.
Insp Kenny McGeough said: "I would ask anyone who saw anything suspicious to contact the force as soon as possible."
He added: "It is possible the car used could have been spotted in the car park from houses overlooking the area.
"Likewise, if you noticed anyone or anything unusual or suspicious in the shop or golf club in the days before, I would urge you to get in touch.
"I would also ask the public to look out for any suspicious golf clothes or clubs for sale in the coming days - it could well be the stolen goods."
