Champions League: FC Copenhagen 6-0 Crusaders (Agg: 9-0)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crusaders crashed out of the Champions League second qualifying round to FC Copenhagen, losing 6-0 in the away leg on Tuesday, and 9-0 on aggregate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrija Pavlovic opened the scoring with a cool finish and Andy Mitchell headed Christoffer Remmer's cross into his own net just before half-time.
Andreas Cornelius headed powerfully home and then Rasmus Falk fired in the fourth from close range.
Jan Gregus netted with a fine free-kick and Cornelius grabbed his second.
Trailing 3-0 from the first leg, the Irish League champions travelled to the Danish capital without skipper Colin Coates, who was on holiday.
The hosts had early chances, with Cornelius heading wide and then crossing for Pavlovic, who was unable to find the net.
Pavlovic made no mistake from 12 yards out in the 15th minute, however, finishing off a pass from Falk with style.
Kasper Kusk missed from five yards out, before the unfortunate Mitchell scored an own goal just before the interval.
Cornelius' back-post header three minutes after the resumption made it 3-0, before Falk scored his second of the tie and Gregus beat Sean O'Neill with a well-taken free-kick.
Cornelius notched his third goal of the tie with 14 minutes remaining as his side set up a third qualifying round meeting with Romanian champions Astra Giurgiu.
Crusaders' thoughts will turn to the defence of their Premiership title, which begins with the visit of Ballymena United on 6 August.
