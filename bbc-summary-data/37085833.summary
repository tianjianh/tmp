Ibrox boss Mark Warburton is keen to add a defender to his squad before the transfer window closes this month.
Swiss international Senderos, 31, most recently played his club football with Grasshoppers in his homeland.
"He is training for a week with us," Warburton told the Rangers website. "He is a very talented player with a very impressive CV."
Capped 57 times, he has played in three World Cup finals and a European Championship.
His spell with Grasshoppers last season followed an injury-hit 18 months at Villa.
Senderos, an FA Cup winner with Arsenal in 2005, has made over 200 senior club appearances.
"It is a case of he has not been training with a team so he is in for a week with us and nothing more than that," added Warburton.
"He looks very good technically from his background and physically he looks in good shape so we will have him in for a week and then see what that leads to."
