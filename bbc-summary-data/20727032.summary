The Danish broadcaster behind the TV thriller The Killing has bought a detective drama being shot in Aberystwyth in Welsh and English.

Commissioners at DR Denmark reportedly believe the Welsh landscape will appeal to its viewers familiar with the Copenhagen-set series.
The drama series is being made in both languages for the Welsh language broadcaster S4C and BBC Wales.
It will be shown on S4C next year and on BBC Wales and BBC Four.
The drama, which will be called Hinterland on the BBC and Mathias on S4C after the lead character, opens with the discovery of a body.
It is set against a backdrop of mountainous land, isolated farms and a close-knit village.
It stars Richard Harrington as Det Ch Insp Tom Mathias, and is being shot at the same time in Welsh and English.
Eva Bredsdorff is from Copenhagen, but has lived and worked in Welshpool as the curator of Powysland Museum for 25 years.
"There are absolutely no similarities between Denmark and mid Wales - Denmark is as flat as a pancake.
"Perhaps there's similarities between the Celts and Danes. A more cultural and psychological relationship rather than the geography.
"I'm a huge fan of The Killing. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
"I'm also a big fan of The Bridge, a Danish/Swedish co-production, and Borgen, which is about the Danish political system.
"Danish film and TV has developed greatly over the last 15 to 20 years.
"I'm pleased British people are seeing our TV. For years we've watched things like Upstairs Downstairs, All Creatures Great and Small, Fawlty Towers and Midsomer Murders."
Harrington is better known to viewers of the BBC's Lark Rise to Candleford.
His character Mathias comes to Aberystwyth in search of a new beginning.
Despite being tortured by guilt about his past, Mathias is an intuitive and passionate detective, compelled to find justice and succeeds despite his unorthodox methods, says S4C.
Filming for the four two-hour episodes has taken place in Aberystwyth and nearby Devil's Bridge and Borth so far, and will continue in the area until May 2013.
On Aberystwyth sea front, the town's former magistrates' court  doubles as the outside of Mathias's police station, while out of town Aberystwyth University's Plas Gogerddan building is being used for internal shots of the fictional police station.
University students are also being offered work experience on the production.
Gwawr Martha Lloyd, S4C programme commissioner, said: "The detective drama is a popular genre internationally and this thrilling, inventive and chilling series which appeal to viewers in Wales and foreign audiences.
"The purchase by DR is proof of this and I'm confident the Danish audiences will enjoy it as much as they did The Killing."
Reaching the climax of its third series on BBC Four on Saturday night, the hit Danish crime drama The Killing follows the police investigation of a specific case, day by day, with each hour-long episode covering 24 hours of the investigation.
