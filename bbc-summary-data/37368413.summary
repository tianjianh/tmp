US carmaker Ford has said it expects pre-tax profits to fall next year as it increases spending on projects such as self-driving and electric cars.

Ford, like most of its rivals, is seeking ways to profit as the industry moves toward driverless technology and ride-sharing.
The company also added it would move all of its small-car production from Detroit to Mexico within three years.
Shares of Ford dropped more than 1.5% after it announced its 2017 outlook.
The share price has not recovered since it fell more than 8% in late July when Ford said the industry was going into a gradual decline.
Last week, Ford lowered its 2016 pre-tax profit forecast to $10.2bn from at least $10.8bn because of an expanded vehicle recall.
It had initially forecast a profit equal to or better than last year, but pulled back after announcing a $640m recall of 2.4 million vehicles.
Ford currently makes some Fiestas in Mexico, but has kept production for some of its Focus and C-Max models in suburban Detroit.
The company is building a new $1.6bn assembly plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. It will make small cars there starting in 2018.
The move has drawn criticism from presidential candidate Donald Trump, would complained about a loss of US jobs. Ford chief executive said during an investor day on Wednesday that the company had to stay competitive.
Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant will be getting new products under a contract signed last year with the United Auto Workers union.
