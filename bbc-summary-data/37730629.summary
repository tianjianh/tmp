Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles during his two spells with the club before being sacked last December, takes his new side to west London for Sunday's top-flight encounter.
"When you win three titles, you remain in the heart of the fans," said Conte.
"I have great respect for him."
Conte, who became the permanent replacement for Mourinho in the summer, added: "I think he was an important man for the club.
"He wrote with the club, with his players, with the staff, part of the story of this club.
"After the whistle, he becomes like the other players of Manchester United - an enemy, in the sporting aspect."
Mourinho also won the FA Cup and three League Cup during his spells at Stamford Bridge.
