The Bosnia-Herzegovina international, 23, will join on a free transfer and become an Arsenal player on 1 July when the transfer window opens.
"Subject to the completion of all regulatory processes, the defender will start pre-season training in July," said an Arsenal statement.
Schalke confirmed that the defender had signed a deal "which runs until 2022".
The Bundesliga club also tweeted: "Good luck in the future and thank you for six great years."
Kolasinac helped Schalke finish 10th in the Bundesliga last season, while they reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League where they were knocked out by eventual beaten finalists Ajax.

"Arsenal has a huge tradition and I followed the club as a young boy, in the days of Jens Lehmann and Thierry Henry," he told the London club's website.
"Arsenal has always been a club that is well recognised in Europe and I'm pleased to be here.
"I'm a player who will try to help the team as well as I can. My strengths are my mentality.
"I think left back is where I feel most comfortable. I can play as part of a three at the back too or further forward. I'm really flexible."
