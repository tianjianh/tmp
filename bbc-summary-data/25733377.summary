Reprieve for Bristol's public toilets in Mayor's revised budget cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to shut 22 public toilets in Bristol as part of proposals to slash £83m from the city council's budget have been scrapped by the city's mayor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year, George Ferguson laid out his plans for cuts which included closing toilets and scrapping bus subsidies.
But following a public consultation, nearly 20 of his budget proposals have now been removed or changed.
The council still has to shed up to 800 jobs, over the next three years and cut library and children's centres funding.
The council's budget cuts were reduced from £90m to £83m in November, due to greater tax revenues and changes to government funding.
As part of the revised budget, the extra money has been earmarked for parks and play, a Welfare Reform Hardship Fund for the city's poorest residents and implementing a 'living wage' policy for the council's lowest paid workers.
Mr Ferguson has also made changes to 18 of his more controversial budget cuts, including reinstating funding for wardens in sheltered accommodation and continuing the staff supervision of Hengrove play park.
"This is still a very challenging budget but I am very pleased to have the chance to make changes," said Mr Ferguson.
"Not every concern can be answered, but I've looked at every proposal in light of comments made."
The amended proposals are due to be signed off by the cabinet on Thursday ahead of a full council meeting next month.
