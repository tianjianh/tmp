The US president's UK stay - part of a tour including Saudi Arabia and Germany - is likely to be his last before his term in office ends in January.
He will have a private dinner with the Queen at Windsor Castle and stage a joint press conference with David Cameron at 10 Downing Street.
The White House said the visit would allow Mr Obama to offer his gratitude for Britain's "stalwart partnership".
The president is expected to arrive in the UK just after the Queen celebrates her 90th birthday on 21 April.
A spokesman said:  "The visit will allow the president to offer his gratitude to the British government and people for their stalwart partnership with his administration and the American people throughout his presidency."
He will visit Saudi Arabia on 21 April for a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, including leaders of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
They will discuss the fight against the so-called Islamic State terror group and other regional security concerns.
Following his UK visit, Mr Obama will travel to Germany to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and visit Hannover Messe, the world's largest trade show for industrial technology.
