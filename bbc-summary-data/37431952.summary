[SN]TITLE[SN]
Departing staff cost Scottish Borders Council £2.2m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of "exit packages" to staff taking early retirement or made redundant at Scottish Borders Council has more than trebled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the last financial year 71 workers left the local authority sharing more than £2.2m between them.
The figure for the previous 12 months was £626,000 between 40 employees.
The details are contained in the latest council accounts which also show an increase in the number of top earning senior staff.
The number of employees earning more than £50,000-a-year has risen from 109 to 115 - although that includes workers who received additional payments for early retirement or voluntary severance.
Full details of the council's accounts are available online.
