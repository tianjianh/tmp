Peter Capaldi, who replaces Matt Smith, will have a dark blue Crombie coat with red lining, dark blue trousers, white shirt and black Dr Marten shoes.
Filming for the new series began in Cardiff earlier this month.
Doctor Who's regeneration was the most-watched Christmas Day television moment last year with 10.2 million viewers seeing the five-minute sequence.
The new look was created by Doctor Who costume designer Howard Burden.
Commenting on his outfit, Capaldi said: "He's woven the future from the cloth of the past. Simple, stark, and back to basics. No frills, no scarf, no messing, just 100% Rebel Time Lord."
Capaldi, who is currently starring as Cardinal Richelieu in the BBC series The Musketeers, admitted to first-day nerves after stepping onto the show's set in Cardiff, with co-star Jenna Coleman.
Filming on the latest series of the show will continue until August with director Ben Wheatley coming on board.
Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat said: "New Doctor, new era, and of course new clothes. Monsters of the universe, the vacation is over - Capaldi is suited and booted and coming to get you."
Doctor Who took two honours at last week's National Television Awards - best drama and drama performance for Smith.
The record-breaking 50th anniversary special last year was among Smith's final appearances on the show.
