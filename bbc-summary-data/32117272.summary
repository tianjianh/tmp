A care home in Mallaig that was temporarily closed last July to allow for an investigation into allegations about some staff remains shut.

Residents' families were told the Mackintosh Centre would only be closed for up to six weeks.
But residents continue to be cared for at a home in Fort William.
NHS Highland said an investigation of two staff was ongoing and that it was "working towards reopening" the Mackintosh Centre in May.
Mary Purdon whose 81-year-old mother Mary Purdie was a resident at the Mallaig care home said the wait for it to reopen had become stressful.
Mrs Purdie's husband Lewis, 86, was able to make daily visits when she was at the Mackintosh Centre, but can only make the two-hour round trip to Fort William about once a week.
Mrs Purdon told BBC Radio Scotland: "We were told not to worry and that the Mack would be open again in four to six weeks.
"Time is not on the side of mum and dad and the situation has become stressful for him.
"When mum was at the Mack he was only five minutes away and was close by if anything happened to her."
Mrs Purdon said her family only had praise for the staff of the Mackintosh Centre and Invernevis House Care Home in Fort William, where Mrs Purdie is staying.
However, Mrs Purdon said there had been a lack of information from the health board on when the centre would reopen.
She said families had been told that the home was not expected to open again until June.
In a statement, the health board said: "NHS Highland continues to progress the recruitment and training of staff to allow us to reopen the Mackintosh Centre.
"We continue to work towards reopen in the middle of May. This will only be on the premise we have appropriate staffing levels to support delivery of a safe service to residents."
