Hallen FC refuses to hand back keys to Moorhouse Lane ground

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cash-strapped amateur football club near Bristol is refusing to hand over the keys to its ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almondsbury Parish Council plans to close Hallen FC's Moorhouse Lane ground on 31 May and said it can no longer afford to support it.
But it denied the Southern League side is being evicted from the premises.
The club said it will continue to pay rent but wants the council to "shares its intentions" for the site and "discuss the situation sensibly".
Committee members said the club had delivered a letter to the council's solicitors outlining its intention to remain at the site until further notice.
A spokesman said Hallen FC wants to find "a mutually beneficial solution to our current quandary".
In a statement, Almondsbury Parish Council said it had provided additional financial support to HFC for the past year.
It stated it had also sought a number of ways to make the centre economically viable, but these had been rejected by the club, which had also refused to sign a new tenancy agreement.
The authority said "there was no alternative but for the football club to leave the centre" as a result.
Hallen FC has urged members of the public to attend a parish council meeting in Almondsbury on 2 June where the matter will be discussed further.
