[SN]TITLE[SN]
GP services online in most of England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost every patient in England can now book GP appointments, order repeat prescriptions or access their medical records online, data reveals.

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show some 97% of patients - about 55 million in total - now have the option to do it online.
It is a big increase on the 3% able to do so a year ago and is part of the government's drive to improve services.
Patients can still contact their GP by phone or in person.
But since March 2015, GPs have been contractually required to offer these online services.
