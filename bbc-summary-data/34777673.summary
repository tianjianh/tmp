A yellow "be aware" warning has been issued for late Thursday into Friday for the Western and Northern Isles, Highlands and Argyll.
The warning also applies to parts of Moray and Aberdeenshire.
Earlier this year the Met Office asked the public for suggestions for names for storms.
Storm Abigail could bring gusts of 60 to 70mph, potentially rising to speeds of up to 80mph in exposed areas.
The warning is in place from 18:00 on Thursday until 14:00 on Friday.
In its warning, the Met Office said: "The public should be aware of the risk of disruption to transport. In addition, large waves may give rise to local over-topping along some coasts.
"A vigorous depression is expected to pass just to the northwest of Scotland on Thursday night bringing a swathe of very strong winds on its eastern and southern flanks.
"There remains some uncertainty regarding the exact extent and timing of strongest winds and the extent of impacts and this warning will be kept under review."
Sea swell charts produced by South Devon-based surfing website Magicseaweed.com suggest swell reaching heights of 10-11.5m (36-38ft) on Friday.
Meteorologist Dr Eddy Graham, who lectures at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway in Lewis, said people should stay indoors if the weather deteriorates.
He said: "The Met Office have issued the first high wind warning of the season for this Thursday and Friday for most of northern and western Scotland.
"Winds are expected to reach over 70mph, possibly touching 80mph in the strongest gusts. Winds of these speeds are dangerous when outdoors - stay safely indoors when conditions deteriorate."
