Radrizzani had purchased a 50% stake in the Championship club in January with a view to buying the remaining 50%.
Radrizzani, who has also taken on Cellino's chairman role, said he was undertaking "a long-term commitment".
Meanwhile, BBC Sport understands that boss Garry Monk is set to extend his contract with the club.
Leeds plan to activate the year extension in his contract later this week while also discussing a longer term deal.
Monk led the team to seventh place, five points outside the play-off places, in his debut season with the club.
