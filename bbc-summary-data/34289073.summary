Bannockburn has been named as the most decisive battle fought in the British Isles.

A BBC News Online poll saw the pivotal 1314 clash secure a third of nearly 60,000 votes.
The two-day battle saw Robert the Bruce's army out-manoeuvre and outfight the knights of Edward II, helping preserve the Scottish throne.
It beat off competition from Hastings and the Battle of Britain, which is marking its 75th anniversary.
Bannockburn represented a huge change in fortunes for the Scottish throne, which had been under the influence of Edward I.
But his successor, Edward II, faced determined resistance and - despite large and well-equipped army - met a costly defeat near Stirling.
Professor Michael Brown, from the University of St Andrews's School of History, said in his submission for the vote: "Robert's victory meant not just the continuation of the Scottish kingdom but that Scotland would develop separately from the rest of the island for the next 400 years, maintaining and pursuing its own course in terms of government, law, religion and relations with the peoples of Europe."
Reacting to the news, Scott McMaster, manager of the Bannockburn Experience for the National Trust for Scotland, said: "It is fantastic that after 700 years this event is still commemorated and remembered.
"It is the classic tale of the underdog, the smaller army defeating the elite force, and this result clearly shows the mark it has left on the Scottish psyche."
