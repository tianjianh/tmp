Stringer, 39, joins the Warriors as cover for Francois Hougaard, who is on international duty with South Africa for the first half of the campaign.
The former Ireland international left Sale Sharks at the end of last season after two years with the club.
"I'm feeling as fit and ready as ever and am genuinely excited about getting back on the field," he said.
Stringer won 98 caps for Ireland between 2000 and 2011, and has also played for Munster and Bath.
He told BBC Sport in November of his desire to continue playing beyond the age of 40, and will now will be reunited with former Munster and Ireland team-mate Donncha O'Callaghan, the Warriors captain.
Stringer is Worcester's third summer signing, following the arrivals of fly-half Sam Olver and forward David Denton.
