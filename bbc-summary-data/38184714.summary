Gylfi Sigurdsson: Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino hails 'perfect' Swansea player

Tottenham were too quick to sell "perfect" Swansea talisman Gylfi Sigurdsson says the London club's boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Pochettino took over in the summer of 2014 and allowed Sigurdsson to join Swansea in a deal that saw Ben Davies and Michel Vorm move in the opposite direction.
Spurs host Swansea on Saturday.
"I think after he moved to Swansea and we saw his development he was a perfect player for us," Pochettino said.
"But in that moment it was the club decision and his decision to move to Swansea and find another way."
Sigurdsson has five goals already in the current campaign and Pochettino says the Icelandic midfielder is still well thought of at White Hart Lane.
"Every time we meet him and see him he shows his quality not only as a player but like a man. All the people here talk very highly about him," he said.
"It's a shame but sometimes in football you never know what will happen in the future."

Swansea manager Bob Bradley has challenged his defenders to keep Tottenham striker Harry Kane quiet at White Hart Lane on Saturday.
The England striker has been boosted ahead of Swansea's Premier League visit by signing a new Spurs deal which will run until 2022.
That could spell bad news for a Swansea side who have been vulnerable at the back all season and whose defensive frailties were again exposed in the astonishing 5-4 victory over Crystal Palace last weekend.
"Harry Kane is a terrific finisher and you need real concentration right through the match against him," Bradley said.
"You give him a chance and he has a solid record of hitting the target and scoring different kinds of goals.
"He is a striker where everybody must concentrate for every moment because the slightest lapse is when he pounces. So it is mainly a test of awareness and concentration."

Swansea have failed to record a victory over Spurs in 10 Premier League matches and have not managed a league victory over Spurs since a 2-0 success at the Vetch Field in October 1982.
"I've heard about the record and I've gone back and watched some of last year's match there," Bradley said.
"When you play them you have to do a lot of things really well because they are going to press and make it difficult for you to find a passing rhythm."
