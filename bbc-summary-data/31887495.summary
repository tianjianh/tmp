The actress, who played Deirdre Barlow in the show for 42 years, died in January aged 60.
The show's executive producer Kieran Roberts said: "She was a wonderful woman, and a wonderful actress. We all miss her terribly.
"At the moment, we're respecting her memory. We're talking to her family and respecting the family's wishes."
Coronation Street bosses told Newsbeat earlier this week that they were keeping Anne Kirkbride's name on her old dressing room door as a tribute to the star.
The dressing room is now being used by Anne's good friend Beverley Callard, who plays Liz McDonald.
"The exact plans are not yet finalised but that will certainly happen," said Kieran Roberts.
"It's important that, in the real world, the family are able to say farewell to the woman. We absolutely support and respect all of that.
"Later in the year, we will make sure that Coronation Street is able to say a farewell to Deirdre."
Roberts was speaking as Coronation Street: The Tour opened up more of the show's sets for the public to explore.
"The big thing for 2015 is we've been able to add the Kabin to the tour, which is fantastic," he said.
"It's such an iconic set - so many brilliant memories, so many wonderful characters. Great double acts Rita (Sullivan, played by Barbara Knox) and Norris (Cole, played by Malcolm Hebden), and Rita and Mavis (Wilton, portrayed by Thelma Barlow) have worked there, so it's a really brilliant addition."
Other sets to be included in the tour include Websters' Auto Centre and Prime Doner kebab shop.
