The station had 2.2 million listeners a week from October to December, having had 2.19 million the previous quarter.
It is the highest listening figure for a digital-only station since Rajar began in 1992.
Overall, BBC Radio 2 had the biggest weekly reach for any UK radio station with 15.47 million listeners, up from 15.38 million the previous quarter.
BBC Radio 4 Extra had previously been the top digital-only station from July to September, but trailed behind 6 Music in the last quarter with 2.11 million listeners per week.
The total weekly reach for all BBC radio was slightly down this quarter, with 34.95 million listeners aged 15 and over tuning in per week, compared with 35.10 million the previous quarter, but its audience share rose slightly in the same period, from 53.3% to 53.5%.
Helen Boaden, director of BBC radio, said: "This is yet another fantastic and well-deserved quarter for BBC Radio 6 Music. With its unique range of music and expert presenters, the station continues to grow its loyal listenership.
"It's good to see digital listening to BBC stations in such great health. One of radio's strengths is its convenience and digital devices make listening even easier."
On 6 Music, all its shows increased listeners with Steve Lamacq pulling in 1.08 million, while Shaun Keaveny attracted 976,000 and Lauren Laverne got 875,000 listeners.
Bob Shennan, BBC 6 Music controller, said: "I am delighted that 6 Music continues to grow and break records. The daytime shows are on a brilliant streak of form and it is also very pleasing that the eclecticism of Jarvis Cocker and Guy Garvey is proving to be more popular than ever."
The Rajar figures showed that BBC Radio 1 had lost listeners since the last quarter, going from 10.56 million to 10.33 million.
The Radio 1 Breakfast Show With Nick Grimshaw attracted 5.87 million listeners, up from 5.78 million the previous quarter,
Chris Evans's breakfast show on Radio 2 was the most popular morning show again, with 9.44 million listeners each week - its highest-ever reach was 9.91 million a week in the second quarter of 2014.
Radio 4's Today programme was in second place with 7.03 million tuning in each week.
Capital London regained its position as London's number one commercial radio station with 2.08 million listeners. Its rival Kiss saw audience figures fall by 3.5%, with 2.02 million listeners.
Capital London also had the most popular breakfast show in London, with 1.08 million listeners.
Chris Moyles's morning show on Radio X had 300,000 listeners a week in London, three months after the station launched.
Rajar said the total average number of weekly hours spent listening to radio this quarter was 1.01 billion. A total of 48.2 million adults, or 90% of the population aged 15 or older, listened to the stations monitored by Rajar each week.
