Protests have broken out across the US following a grand jury's decision not to charge a policeman over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

Demonstrators have taken to the streets in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as in cities around the country.
There were weeks of unrest earlier this year after Mr Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson on 9 August.
State prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the decision and said the jury exhaustively examined evidence.
Mr Brown's mother burst into tears as the announcement was made. His family have called for calm.
Mr Brown's family has now issued a statement saying they were "profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions".
Police have said there was a struggle between the teenager and the officer before the shooting.
Shots were fired and cars and buildings set on fire as part of the outcry. Police responded with smoke and tear gas to try to move crowds.
Many people have called for Mr Wilson to be charged with murder.
President Barack Obama made a statement urging Americans to accept "that this decision was the grand jury's to make,'' and calling for protests to be peaceful.
Thousands of people protested around the country, including in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington DC.
Protesters have been chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" - a reference to statements by some witnesses who said Mr Brown had his hands up in apparent surrender to the officer when he was shot.
