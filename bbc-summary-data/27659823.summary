A comedian who tried to gatecrash England's World Cup departure at Luton airport has been given "strong police advice", officers said.

Simon Brodkin, who performs as Lee Nelson, managed to get into a private terminal where the squad was preparing to fly to Miami on Sunday.
Wearing an identical suit to those worn by the England party, he was spotted by Steven Gerrard and removed by security.
Bedfordshire Police said Mr Brodkin was "warned about his future conduct".
A spokesman said: "A man managed to enter the area and approached the England team bus.
"This man was quickly apprehended, taken away from the scene and given some strong police advice."
The force was assisting private security at charter company Landmark Aviation, which said it could not comment.
The 23-man squad was travelling from Luton to Fort Lauderdale airport near Miami for the next phase of its World Cup preparations.
Mr Brodkin was pictured attempting to mingle with England's players and staff as they waited for their luggage to be removed from a coach.
Brandishing a passport, he spent several minutes in close proximity to the players before being seen by the England captain.
Luton Airport said: "A man entered the car park of the private aviation centre where the team coach was parked.
"The individual was quickly apprehended by the police and private security and ejected from the area."
The comedian is best known for his performances in two BBC comedy series of Lee Nelson's Well Good Show.
A spokeswoman said the stunt was not for a BBC project.
Mr Brodkin was cautioned by police in April 2013 after warming up with the Manchester City team ahead of a match against Everton at Goodison Park the previous month.
He was given a six-month conditional caution after being charged with going on to the playing area, contrary to the Football Offences Act.
