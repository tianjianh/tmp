England one-day opener Roy returned to form after his midweek Champions Trophy semi-final exclusion with a superb knock as Surrey piled up 363-7.
The hosts fell well short and were dismissed for 210, losing by 153 runs.
Surrey, runners-up in 2015 and 2016, will face Nottinghamshire on 1 July.
It would have taken a lot to live up to the drama of Friday night when Notts successfully chased an English 50-over record target of 371 to beat Essex in a thrilling first semi-final at Chelmsford.
But, in their 25th semi-final since one-day cricket began in 1963, Worcestershire wilted disappointingly in the blistering sun.
Having won the toss and elected to bat, Surrey made an explosive start, their openers putting on 114 inside 14 overs before Worcestershire's move to slow things down finally brought its reward.
Moeen Ali made the breakthrough by bowling Mark Stoneman for 41, and the England off-spinner proved his side's most economical bowler, going for 55 runs off his 10 overs.
Daryl Mitchell's medium pacers also had a comparatively becalming effect, capped by the eventual wicket of Roy, while Brett D'Oliveira's seven overs of spin cost 39.
Pacemen John Hastings, Joe Leach and Ed Barnard all proved expensive, however, as Roy and Stoneman, then Sangakkara (73) and Foakes (86), cashed in.
Needing their largest score in a knockout trophy game, Worcestershire's hopes largely rested with Moeen.
But just when he appeared to be winning his private duel with Jade Dernbach after five fours and two sixes, he went for one big shot too many against the former England one-day international and holed out to deep mid-off for 36.
From 42-3, despite D'Oliveira's 53 and a belligerent late 55 from Ross Whiteley, there was no coming back from that as Surrey captain Batty brought himself on against his former club to claim 5-40, his best List A figures for Surrey.
Surrey's meeting with Nottinghamshire at Lord's on 1 July will be their 13th one-day final, of which their last victory was in the CB40 against Somerset in 2011. From that team, only skipper Batty and Jade Dernbach remain in contention.
Notts will be making only their sixth visit to the home of cricket. They lost their first two and have won their past three - most recently when they beat Glamorgan to win the YB40 in 2013.
Worcestershire captain Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"That's cricket. We got beaten by a very good Surrey side. As a side we are going to take knockbacks and this is one of them, but hopefully we draw a line under it and move on.
"It's pretty raw at the moment. It obviously hurts a lot, having topped the group and played the way we did.
"But they came out and played well and Jason Roy came out and did what he didn't do in the Champions Trophy."
Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
"We set the tone brilliantly with the bat. Having Jason Roy back is wonderful. We welcome him with open arms every time we have him.
"He is a wonderful player. He hit the ball so beautifully. It was a pleasure to watch. Kumar and Foakesy were magnificent as well.
"We are getting quite a formidable line-up with the bat and we are putting it together with the ball and in the field. It was nice, I'm not going to lie."
