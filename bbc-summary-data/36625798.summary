[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative MP David Davies has said he will work with the Welsh Government to ensure Wales gets its fair share of the money saved by leaving the EU.

Following the referendum vote in favour of Brexit, he said all regional and farm funding should continue, and an extra £9bn a year would be available.
UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill has said politicians must work together "to heal the divisions" created by the campaign.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has also called for party and public unity.
In Thursday's referendum 52.5% of voters in Wales backed Leave, compared with 47.5% supporting Remain.

Monmouth MP Mr Davies - a prominent name in the Leave campaign - said he was "more than happy" to work with the Welsh Government to ensure Wales did not lose any funding when the UK left the European Union.
He told BBC Radio Wales it could result in even more money coming to Wales.
"We pay £19bn [a year] into the EU, we get about £10bn back at the moment," he said on Saturday's Good Morning Wales programme.
"We first of all make sure the money that was going into structural funds and CAP [the Common Agricultural Policy] continues.
"Then we look at the net £8.5-£9bn that's left over and ensure anything that's spent in Britain is 'Barnettised' so that Wales gets 5%."
The Barnett formula is used by the UK Treasury to share any extra money for public spending between the four UK nations.
Mr Davies added that he was "very open-minded" about a quick departure from the EU if the other 27 member states wanted it.
"I was campaigning to get out of the European Union, and if they want to help us out by speeding things up then that's great."
Meanwhile Clwyd West MP David Jones, a fellow Tory who led the Vote Leave Cymru campaign, said the UK Government could give Wales structural funding beyond 2020, when the current EU grant deal runs out.
The former Welsh Secretary said with the prospect of countries such as Serbia and Macedonia aiming to join the EU, it was doubtful Wales would still have qualified for aid anyway.
As the result of the referendum sank in, Mr Gill told BBC Wales that "the nation, Wales and the UK, feels divided".
He said it was the job of politicians to create "calm debate and conditions" for exiting the European Union.
Mr Gill also said it was important that the UK Government set out a "clear vision" on Brexit, and he praised David Cameron for making what he described as the "honourable decision" to stand down.
On Friday, Mr Jones called for unity, adding that it would now be "more difficult to attract investment into Wales and keep jobs in Wales".
But Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies - who campaigned for Brexit - accused him of continuing the Remain camp's "Project Fear".
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said she would speak to Mr Jones as talks begin on how to pull the UK out of the EU.
Meanwhile former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Wigley has called for a second vote on the matter - possibly via a general election - once the Brexit terms had been negotiated, calling for the devolved governments to be involved in those discussions.
He claimed on BBC Radio Cymru that people who voted to leave the EU were unclear as to what they were voting for, and the change of prime minister itself justified a fresh election.
Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price also joined calls for another poll. He tweeted: "I accept mandate for leaving EU, but final agreed terms of exit (Norway, Switzerland or no single market) should be put to 2nd referendum."
Following a long, and sometimes bad-tempered campaign, much of the emphasis is now on trying to heal the wounds inflicted during the debate.
But since Wales is a net beneficiary of EU funds, the focus is also on ensuring promises made during the campaign that the poorest areas would not lose a penny are kept.
Leanne Wood said she would speak with Carwyn Jones to pull together and present a united front as discussions begin on how to pull the UK out of the European Union.
Mr Jones insists he should be part of the top team carrying out those negotiations, but it is unclear whether that will happen.
