The number of exotic pets rescued by the Scottish SPCA has increased by almost three-quarters in five years.

The charity is seeking new homes for the 265 reptiles - including snakes, terrapins and lizards - that it took in last year.
But officials said they received fewer inquiries for the creatures than they do for more "cuddly" pets like dogs.
Spokesman Mike Flynn said:  "With snakes especially, a lot of people are put off by their appearance."
But he added: "We know there are plenty of reptile enthusiasts out there who would appreciate them for the stunning creatures they are."
The charity revealed that 100 snakes and 95 terrapins were among the rescued pets.
Mr Flynn, a chief superintendent with the charity, said: "Lots of people know we rescue and rehome cats, dogs and other more traditional pets, but many might be surprised to learn about our more unusual creatures.
"Unfortunately we don't receive as many inquiries about our exotic residents."
The charity say they would love to hear from pet owners with the time, knowledge and resources to offer a home to an exotic animal.
