Paul Pugh, 37, spent two months in a coma after being assaulted on a night out in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, on 6 January 2007 and will never make a full recovery.
Four men were jailed for the attack.
In 2014, he launched Paul's Pledge with Dyfed-Powys Police, which campaigns against alcohol-fuelled violence.
The former football captain visits schools, colleges and youth clubs across the force area to raise awareness of the dangers and consequences of violence, and the impact it can have on individuals and their families.
Mr Pugh began marking the 10th anniversary of the incident by returning to the Old Cross Inn in Ammanford, which is were he was attacked in the street.
"I don't want this to happen to anyone else - nobody in the world," he said, sat in the pub for the first time since the attack.
"I don't want anyone to go through what me and my family are going through - that's why I'm here."
He said the devastating injuries he suffered mean he still cannot do things that came naturally before the attack.
But he added: "This is my life now - I've moved on from what happened. There are many things I can't do - but this [campaign] I can do.
"I think it sends a powerful message to the world."
Mr Pugh spent Friday evening at Cwmamman Football Club, a place he said is "still so dear to me".
He shared his story, talked about his pledge and celebrated how far he has come with his rehabilitation.
"I've had to learn to walk and talk again and come to terms with the fact that I will never fully recover," he said.
"But I've turned this experience into something positive by telling my story to others.
"I'm over the moon that the campaign has been rolled out to cover the whole Dyfed-Powys Police force area meaning I get to speak to many more young people about the impact violence and alcohol has had on me and my loved ones."
