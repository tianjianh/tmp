A father who killed his four-week-old baby son had been known to the authorities as a "domestic abuse perpetrator", a report has revealed.

Liam Laverick, 25, was jailed in November for eight-and-a-half years for the manslaughter of Tommy Lee.
Tommy, from Hull, died in hospital on 25 September 2014 after he suffered bleeding around his brain from being violently shaken by his father.
A serious case review found the baby's death could not have been anticipated.
The Hull Safeguarding Children Board (HSCB) findings showed Laverick had slapped Tommy's mother, Kelly Whitworth, "a few times" after she became pregnant and had taken her phone and money.
It revealed that she was living in fear of his "angry outbursts and threats".
Ms Whitworth told the review she felt "unable to tell social workers what was happening, as she really believed [Laverick] would harm her or their child".
Laverick ordered Ms Whitworth to lie to social services about the couple not living together and had threatened Ms Whitworth he would tell social workers she was a bad mother and they would remove her children.
HSCB said Laverick was previously reported to police and social services "following several domestic abuse incidents" while he was in a relationship with a previous partner.
Numerous different social workers had seen the family and months before Tommy's birth care workers closed the case "as there had been no domestic abuse incidents", the report stated.
The report concluded: "There was insufficient collaboration between agencies, and between children and adults' services, and the expertise of practitioners in specialist services was not used effectively to inform assessments, judgments, and plans.
"Without opportunities to share information across agencies, a holistic picture of the family needs and vulnerabilities did not emerge."
In a statement, the HSCB said the review "highlighted the need for all agencies to improve early help, the gathering and sharing of information and pre-birth assessment and planning".
