The 21-year-old Frenchman is expected to start the first leg at the Bernabeu.
Hernandez has played 23 La Liga games for Atletico, including 12 this season.
"It is great news for all Atletico fans, he is a player with enormous potential with a spectacular future to come," said Atletico's sporting director Jose Luis Caminero.
Hernandez's 19-year-old brother, Theo, is on loan at Copa del Rey finalists Alaves from Atletico, while their father, Jean-Francois Hernandez, played for Atletico between 2000 and 2001.
