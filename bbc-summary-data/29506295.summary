Cardiff City: Russell Slade confirmed as new manager

Cardiff City have finally appointed ex-Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade as their new manager.

Slade, 53, has been helping the Championship club as a consultant since quitting as Orient manager.
The Bluebirds and Slade's former side had been in dispute over his proposed appointment at the Welsh club.
"I'm grateful to Vincent [Tan] for giving me this opportunity as Cardiff City is a fantastic football club," said Slade.
Cardiff owner Vincent Tan said he was "delighted" and called on the club's fans to back Slade, whilst criticising former manager Malky Mackay who he sacked in December 2013.
"Look at Russell's track record. He certainly deserves to be given a chance," said Tan.
"After all, Cardiff gave a chance to a mediocre manager from Watford [Mackay] and he took the Club to the Premier League.
"I did, however, give him a lot of money to spend for that - in fact, too much money."
Cardiff had been without a manager since ex-Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer stepped down on 18 September.
Scott Young and Danny Gabbidon have been in caretaker charge since Solskjaer's departure and were at the helm for Friday's 1-0 defeat at Blackpool.
Slade travelled with the Cardiff City squad for the first time for the Championship game at Bloomfield Road as he worked in his consultancy role.
The former Notts County and Yeovil manager had previously watched Cardiff's 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday on 27 September and was at the 1-1 draw at Brighton three days later.
Slade tendered his resignation as manager of League One side Orient on 24 September.
The O's initially rejected an approach for Slade, who had been their manager since 2010, and he subsequently spoke of his frustration at not being permitted to talk to Cardiff before quitting as manager the following day.
Legal discussions between the clubs had delayed Slade's appointment.
He now takes charge of a side currently 15th in the Championship.
"We have a large squad and it's more than putting out the best eleven players on paper," said Slade.
"We need the best group of players out there with the right balance and chemistry.
"It's now about building a relationship with the players and installing a strong ethos and work ethic.
"That's what I want us to take onto the pitch every week."
Slade's first match as Cardiff boss will be at home to second placed Nottingham Forest on Saturday 18 October.
