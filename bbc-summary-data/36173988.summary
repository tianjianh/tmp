Actor Ryan Reynolds has written an emotional goodbye to a young Canadian fan who died of cancer earlier this week.

The Deadpool star had been visiting 13-year-old Connor McGrath of Edmonton for past three years through the Make a Wish Foundation.
Reynolds and Connor bonded over Connor's favourite superhero Deadpool.
"We met because he loved Deadpool. In a certain sense he WAS Deadpool," Reynolds wrote.
"Or, at least everything Deadpool aspires to be; balancing pain, fearlessness, love and a filthy (filthy!) sense of humour in one body. I wish he could've stuck around a lot longer."
In the comic books, Wade Wilson is a cancer patient who undergoes an experimental treatment to become the foul-mouthed anti-hero Deadpool.
Earlier this year, Reynolds arranged for Connor to see an early version of Deadpool before it was released in cinemas.
"Before you jump down my throat for showing a 13-year-old an R-Rated film," Reynolds wrote on Facebook. "Please know this kid knew more swear words than a British chef."
