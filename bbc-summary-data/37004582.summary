The 41-year-old beat Alex Noren of Sweden 1 up in the final.
Wall, who has struggled with back and hip injuries over the past three years, said: "I've been struggling all year, not feeling well. And then this week, I've been really enjoying myself."
Wall's only previous European Tour win came in the Alfred Dunhill Championship in 2000.
In the third-place play-off, James Morrison was a 4&2 winner over fellow Englishman Oliver Fisher.
