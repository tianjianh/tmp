The choir has consisted of boys and men since the cathedral was consecrated in 1887.
In September 2015, 20 girl choristers aged 13 to 18 joined the music foundation.
At a special service on Sunday the treble section was made up entirely of girls as the boys were given the day off.
A cathedral spokesperson said girls are educated at Truro School, where they receive a 25% scholarship which can be supplemented by a means-tested additional bursary to ensure selection is based purely on ability.
The spokesperson said girls from any school are eligible to apply, though if successful they have to move to Truro School.
The Dean of Truro, the Very Reverend Roger Bush, said: "It was a very significant occasion for us. The atmosphere in the place was really electric."
"An aspiration has become a reality and we're all celebrating the fact."
