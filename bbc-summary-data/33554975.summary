The bird became trapped on the road at Whittington near Downham Market in Norfolk.
The driver travelled slowly to Graham Gillis Auto Repair where technicians removed the bird, which was then taken to the RSPCA centre at East Winch.
Craig Plumley, animal welfare officer, said: "It is the first time I have known it happen in the 19 years I have been working at the RSPCA."
Mr Plumley said the bird of prey was a victim of "very unfortunate timing".
"He got hit by the car at the exact moment it swooped up from catching a mouse - the dead mouse was also found in the grille," he said.
"You can't prepare for anything like this, but the driver did the right thing by driving slowly to a garage and the garage was really good in getting the kestrel out."
The RSPCA said the bird had been X-rayed and had no broken bones and it hoped to release it back to the wild soon.
Sue Levings, from East Winch wildlife centre, said: "Apart from tail feather damage, the bird is making a good recovery.
"He is receiving treatment for a wound, but it is eating well and it seems bright."
