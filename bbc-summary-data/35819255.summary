A huge survey by the United Nations looked at people's health, family lives and jobs, amongst other things, to measure how happy they are.
According the the results, the top ten happiest countries are Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Sweden. America came in at number 13, and the UK at number 23.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, from the team behind the report, said that the results showed that even if a country is richer, it doesn't mean it's going to be happier, and countries shouldn't focus too much on money as the way to make people's lives better.
"There is a very strong message for my country, the United States, which is very rich, has gotten a lot richer over the last 50 years, but has gotten no happier," he said.
