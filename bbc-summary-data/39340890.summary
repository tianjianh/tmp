Hartlepool United have cancelled the contract of goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, who is to take up a full-time coaching role with Middlesbrough's academy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bartlett, 31, made 29 first-team appearances during an 18-month spell at Victoria Park.
The ex-Kidderminster, Hereford and Gateshead player has previously coached in a part-time capacity at Newcastle.
Pools still have keepers Ben Dudzinski, Ryan Catterick, injured Trevor Carson and on-loan Joe Fryer in their squad.
"Everybody at the club would like to wish him all the very best in his new career," the Hartlepool statement read.
Meanwhile, former Bristol City and Wolves goalkeeper Adriano Basso has been appointed as the new goalkeeper coach at Victoria Park.
The 41-year-old left his position at FC United of Manchester to join up with Pools, and was part of Saturday's coaching team for the 2-0 defeat by Wycombe.
