Neil Warnock: Cardiff City manager bemoans late penalty decision

Cardiff City "deserved better" from their Championship game at Newcastle United, according to boss Neil Warnock.

Newcastle's 2-1 victory was their seventh consecutive league win and strengthened their position at the top of the table.
But Warnock felt Cardiff should have had a late penalty after defender Sean Morrison was fouled by Aleksandar Mitrovic.
"It's an absolutely nailed-on penalty and I'm so disappointed," Warnock said.
"The linesman is 20 yards away, the referee is quite close and we're all waiting for him to point to the spot and the linesman gives a free-kick the other way.
"At this level officials have got to be better educated to know when a penalty's given.
"There were a few contentious decisions that didn't go for us but all credit to the players, I thought they were super.
"When you see the effort that my team put in and to be let down by people who should know better."
Goals from Christian Atsu and Yoan Gouffran gave Newcastle a 2-0 half-time lead.
Cardiff had chances, with Craig Noone, Rickie Lambert and Sol Bamba all failing to hit the target from promising positions before Peter Whittingham scored with 13 minutes left.
"I thought we looked a good decent side in the second half," Warnock added.
"They [Newcastle] started to panic and we had some good chances.
"You could tell the relief when the whistle goes because they knew only one team was going to score in the second half. We deserved better."
The Bluebirds, who are a point above the relegation zone, resume their Championship campaign at home to high-flying Huddersfield Town on Saturday, 19 November.
