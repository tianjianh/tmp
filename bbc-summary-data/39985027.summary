Tony Adams: Seventh defeat in a row for Granada "a disaster"

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Adams called Granada's season "a disaster" after he lost his seventh and final game in charge against Espanyol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former England captain was appointed until the end of the season in April but failed to pick up a point.
Granada will finish bottom of La Liga and Adams said: "This season has been a disaster, we must not make the same mistakes.
"The main error has been signings. The owner is aware that he has made many mistakes, but this is a long project."
Adams' immediate future is unclear.
He has insisted that he will not stay on as coach but has been working at the Spanish club as a consultant since November and is vice-president of the company owned by Granada's club president.
Granada scored three goals in his seven-match reign.
At the top of the table, Real Madrid are three points ahead of nearest rivals Barcelona. Real travel to 11th-placed Malaga while Barca are at home to ninth-placed Eibar in Sunday's final games of the season.
