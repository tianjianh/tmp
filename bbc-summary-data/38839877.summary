Malcolm Wright, 56, was discovered at a house on Peter Buchan Drive on 26 January.
He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where he was treated for serious injuries, but died on Wednesday evening.
Gary Crossan, 30, of Peterhead, has been charged with assault and attempted murder in connection with the incident.
Following Mr Wright's death, his family said: "As a family we are devastated by the loss of Malcolm, a much-loved father, brother, son and friend to many. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
"We would ask that our privacy is respected at this sad and very difficult time."
Police Scotland said the death was a "contained and isolated incident" with no threat to the wider community.
Det Insp Stewart Drummond added: "Our thoughts are obviously with Mr Wright's family and friends at this very sad and difficult time.
"A report has been sent to the procurator fiscal, however I would still appeal for anyone who was in the Peter Buchan Drive area or surrounding streets during Wednesday evening or the early hours of Thursday morning to come forward if they think they have information which could help.
"Please contact Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 if you would prefer to remain anonymous."
