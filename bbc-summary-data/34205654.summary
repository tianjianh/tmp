Mr King, 70, was arrested at his home in Bayswater, west London, by Surrey Police officers on Wednesday morning.
Two other men, aged 77 and 86, both from Walton-on-Thames, were also arrested and are being questioned.
The arrests were made in connection with allegations linked to the Walton Hop Disco in Walton-on-Thames.
An ongoing investigation, titled Operation Ravine, is looking into allegations of sexual offences against children connected with the disco in the 1970s and 1980s.
Surrey Police said specialist police officers were searching the men's properties.
All three men were arrested on suspicion of various sexual offences concerning boys under the age of 16, Surrey Police said.
Det Ch Insp Karen Mizzi said: "This is a complex investigation into numerous allegations of sexual abuse and assault dating back over several decades.
"Our investigation focuses on the Walton Hop Disco, a popular event for youngsters between the 1970s and 1980s, and we are following a number of lines of inquiry."
Mr King is a former chart-topping star and TV producer who worked on BBC shows such as No Limits and The Great British Song Contest.
His lengthy career in music encompassed performing, song-writing, TV presenting and as an industry executive.
He reached number four in the UK charts for his 1965 single Everyone's Gone to the Moon, and also worked with bands such as Genesis and the Bay City Rollers.
