Hundreds of protesters have held a march and rally against cuts and closures in mental health services in York.

Organised by Mental Health Action York, it followed the closure of Bootham Park psychiatric hospital in September.
The Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust has run mental health services in the city since October.
It said it was "totally committed... to provide high quality mental health services".
It was "on track" to open a 24-bed adult inpatient unit in York in July and was developing plans for a new hospital, the trust added.
Inpatients currently have to travel 40 miles to the nearest mental health unit at a hospital in Middlesbrough.
Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, attended the protest and called for services to be moved "quickly back to York".
"So many people's lives have been disrupted over the closure of the hospital", she said.
Bootham Park was ordered to close by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and inpatients were either discharged or transferred to other hospitals.
The Leeds and York Partnership NHS Trust, which previously ran the service, was given five days notice to close the grade-I listed building in September.
