Kids Company closure impact: 'I feel like a bad mother'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leading figures from collapsed charity Kids Company are to be questioned by MPs about how it was run and how public money was used. But what impact has the sudden closure had on those who used it?

Shortly before Kids Company closed on 6 August, government officials were warned the charity's collapse could lead to "a high risk" of arson, looting and rioting.
It was feared the abrupt closure would prompt a backlash by deprived and troubled young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol who used its services and saw the charity as a surrogate parent.
Nothing as dramatic as arson, looting or rioting has happened but people's lives have been left significantly poorer as a result of Kids Company's sudden termination, says Rashidat Eletu, a 31-year-old mother-of-three from south London.
"Everything just went overnight," she says.
"It took me a long time to find Kids Company. I have never heard of anything else like it.
"My children [aged 13, 11 and three] already feel rejected because their dad walked out. It's only me as a parent and now the place they have been going to for three years, where they felt comfortable, has closed too.
"I told them it wasn't their fault but they think it was very unfair."
The family still have a roof over their heads - but without the childcare support, Ms Eletu has had to give up her part-time job as a store sales assistant. Without the charity's food vouchers she has also had to cut back on the family's grocery shopping.
Instead of buying three loaves of bread "because the children love toast and sandwiches", she buys only one to last the whole week.
Previously she cooked African dishes with plantain and yams to reflect her heritage but says that has had to stop because it was "too expensive" to buy the ingredients.
"I can save Â£5 by not buying those and that money can go a long way for us.
"We have to limit heating and lights in the house, even though it is getting colder now.
"Christmas is coming and I'm stressing about being able to afford to get them a present at all."
For the past three years Kids Company has supplied gifts for the children at Christmas and she bought her own smaller gifts for them in January at vastly reduced prices in the New Year sales.
"I am beginning to feel like a bad mother," she adds.
"Sometimes the kids don't understand. They think you have the money because you are an adult and you are just not giving it to them when their friends have something they don't, but they don't understand we are not all equal."
When Kids Company closed, the House of Praise, Redeemed Christian Church of God foodbank in Camberwell said it noticed an increase in school children arriving for breakfast.
"We had to change the type of food we were providing, to make the portion sizes smaller and we asked our volunteers to bring in small packets of those dried raisins and things we could give the children to take with them for a packed lunch," a spokesman said.
Thames Reach homeless charity says it has not seen a rise in homelessness among young people as a result of Kids Company closing down.
"We cover most London boroughs and our teams are out every night helping people escape homelessness and we do ask what other organisations people have had contact with, so we would be in a good position to know," a spokesman told the BBC.
As well as helping families with childcare, hot meals and food vouchers, Kids Company also provided emotional support for young people experiencing difficulty.
Bola Adako, 20, from Fulham, south-west London, says she walked three hours, sometimes up to three times a week, to get to Kids Company in Camberwell.
The American national, who was raised in Nigeria, came to live in the UK with extended family when she was nine, and says the UK is the only place she calls home now.
She says she has been waiting months for officials to deal with her immigration status and Kids Company was her main support.
"I was alone. None of the adults I was living with wanted to help me. I got kicked out of the house and my friend referred me to Kids Company.
"It helped me a lot, they gave me advice, they helped me print out CVs and once a week they gave me Tesco vouchers for food and shoes.
"When it closed, it made me really angry.
"I was really disappointed for myself, but in my head I was thinking my situation is not that bad, but it was heartbreaking to see all the school kids that used to come, they had no-one else to turn to."
But the charity's demise has apparently helped some people. Neighbours of an academy run by Kids Company for young people excluded from school or further education say their quality of life has improved dramatically since Kids Company closed.
Fola Ogunkola, chairman of Decima Street Tenants and Residents Association, says: "We don't have these problems with anti-social behaviour so much."
He says 80% of the anti-social behaviour problems on the estate had stemmed from the presence of people attending the Urban Academy in Decima Street, Bermondsey.
"They did not live on the estate but you would come home to find seven, eight, nine strangers on the staircase.
"We didn't have a problem with them sitting in the courtyard or on the open grass, that is what it is there for, but we didn't like them blocking our way and when they left, they left behind a lot of [rubbish] on the floor. They wee in the staircase and leave a lot of rubbish every day.
"The residents had some level of sympathy with the kids. The kids are smart and are supposed to be in education but because of difficult circumstances they are not in school, so it was right they should be at the centre.
"But sitting on the staircase and being anti-social was counterproductive to the aim of what Kids Company was trying to do and what they were going there for.
"Apart from that, the kids are troubled and you had the occasional craziness too. They could start to have a fight and start calling each other abusive names and they brought their dogs to fight or they would come in cars and race them.
"It's a different world now they have gone. Almost all of the anti-social behaviour problems on the estate stopped immediately. The kids have no reason to come there, they have nothing to do around here anymore."
