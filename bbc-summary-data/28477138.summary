Officers said they were "treating this kind of behaviour extremely seriously".
"Two males have had to be reported for indecent exposure as they thought it was a good idea to take all their clothes off to go for a swim - not a good idea," an officer wrote on the PSNI Holywood Facebook page.
"There are young children in these areas too."
They added: "You could end up with a criminal record and placed on the sex offenders register.
"Please enjoy the weather but be sensible."
Police in the North Down town also warned that they were on the lookout for people bringing alcohol to the beach, with officers patrolling the platform at Helen's Bay railway station.
