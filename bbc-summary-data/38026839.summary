Gordon Anglesea sex abuse conviction appeal lodged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former North Wales Police chief jailed for sexually abusing two teen boys has lodged an appeal against his convictions, it has been confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Anglesea, 79, was handed a 12 year sentence after being convicted at Mold Crown Court in October.
The jury found the retired superintendent guilty of three indecent assaults on one boy and indecently assaulting another, both in the 1980s.
An appeal against his conviction will now be sent to the Court of Appeal.
Manchester-based solicitors Burton Copeland said the Police Federation will not be funding it, despite the fact it paid Angelsea's legal costs at his trial.
The firm had said earlier this month they would be lodging an application to seek leave to appeal the conviction.
The offences took place between 1982 and 1987, when both boys were 14 or 15.
Meanwhile, a National Crime Agency spokesman said "financial matters" relating to Anglesea were "currently being examined under the Proceeds of Crime Act".
