Jose Mourinho says Manchester United could have "won 6-0" after 1-1 draw

Manchester United's "beautiful" football against Stoke should have been rewarded with a big win rather than a 1-1 draw, said manager Jose Mourinho.

Joe Allen's goal denied United victory in what Mourinho described as his side's best performance of the season.
"It could have been one of these fat results," he told BBC Sport. "It could have been 5-0 or 6-0.
"We had big chances, with amazing saves and big misses. We will play worse and win games for sure."
United dominated possession and had 24 shots - nine of which were on target and 16 from inside the box.
Anthony Martial gave them the lead on 69 minutes but Allen capitalised on a spill from United goalkeeper David de Gea to punish the hosts' lax first-half finishing.
Paul Pogba rattled the bar with a header as United mounted a late siege on the Stoke goal, but Mark Hughes' side clung on.
Mourinho said his team played better than they had during last weekend's 4-1 victory over champions Leicester and the 2-0 home win over Southampton on 19 August.
"You can have sometimes draws where what you do does nothing to change the result," he said.
"The players and I did everything. I made changes, everyone was giving more and more but we could be here all day without winning the game.
"We had 90 minutes of control, we had 90 minutes of ambition. We played really well and it was a good home performance and we created lots of chances."
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss praised goalkeeper Lee Grant for a series of fine saves which were instrumental in ensuring Stoke moved off the bottom of the table.
"In the first minute, their goalkeeper made an unbelievable save and he kept doing that until the end of the game," he said.
"Stoke fought like they do every game. They came for a draw. They were lucky but luck is part of football and my tribute to them is that they're not guilty of our bad luck."
United midfielder Ander Herrera agreed with his manager's assessment.
"It should be 7-0," said the Spaniard. "That's why we cannot be happy but we played fantastic, created a lot of chances and controlled the game from kick-off to the end."
