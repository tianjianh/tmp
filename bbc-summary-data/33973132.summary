A man has admitted stealing a bus and driving dangerously through Aberdeen while on drugs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hans Reid, 26, took the Stagecoach vehicle from Aberdeen Bus Station in May and was pursued by police.
It mounted pavements, struck parked vehicles, and other drivers had to take evasive action to avoid a collision.
Reid admitted various charges at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Sentence was deferred and he was remanded in custody.
He drove in the middle of the road to stop police overtaking him, and through red traffic light signals.
Defence lawyer Gail Goodfellow told the court her client had been under the influence of drugs.
After the hearing, Sgt Andy Duncan, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a particularly dangerous course of action committed whilst Aberdeen city centre was busy with night time revellers.
"Police Scotland is committed to keeping people safe and this case demonstrates that anyone who endangers the public with their actions will be prosecuted.
"Hans Reid will now have to face the consequences of his reckless and dangerous behaviour."
A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland said: "Fortunately nobody was injured as a result of this incident.
"However, the bus involved sustained significant damage which has now been repaired. We are pleased that the police were able to track down the person responsible."
