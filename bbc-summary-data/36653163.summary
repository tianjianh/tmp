Despite being a man down as prop Lee Mossop was sent to the sin bin for a trip on Tony Gigot, Wigan scored twice through Dan Sarginson and Ryan Sutton.
Oliver Gildart danced through to score as the visitors led 20-2 at the break.
Justin Horo gave the Dragons a way back into the game, but England wing Dom Manfredi added a try as the Warriors closed out the two points.
Shaun Wane's Wigan side have stretched their winning run to seven matches in all competitions in what was a resilient defensive display.
Their was a party atmosphere at a sell-out at Stade Gilbert Brutus before the game, with the French side celebrating 10 years of being in Super League, but it was dampened by the Cherry and Whites' early dominance.
Catalans' struggle against the top teams this season has continued as they are still yet to beat a top four side so far and this defeat was their third in a row.
Catalans head coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"I'm particularly disappointed. We have a lot of hard work to do over the coming week.
"I have got to give a lot of credit to Wigan, who performed very well out there and were the better team, but we have to better ourselves.
"This group of players have the potential to win the competition and that is what we spoke about after the game in the changing rooms. It is up to all of us to make sure that potential becomes a reality."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane:
"Catalans have a host of big, big men. I've got a number of smaller men, but they have big hearts.
"I felt Catalans dominated the ruck in the opening 20 minutes. We couldn't get a quick play of the ball, which affected us.
"But in the back end of the half I thought we came back into the game, and that was really beneficial for us.
"I thought some of the tries we scored were great. We missed some opportunities, but to do what we did against a team as good as Catalans is up there with the best for me."
