Snooker's second biggest tournament has been on a rolling one-year contract at the Barbican since it was first staged there in 2011.
A spokesman for the sport's governing body World Snooker told BBC Sport: "The event was a big success, with increased ticket sales and a great atmosphere.
"The UK Championship will definitely be coming back to York again next year."
The tournament, which was won by Neil Robertson on Sunday, was previously held in York from 2001-2006 and returned in 2011 after being held in Telford for four years.
