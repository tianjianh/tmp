BHS liquidation to lead to loss of about 200 jobs across Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Department store BHS is to go into liquidation with the loss of about 200 jobs in four stores in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 11,000 jobs will be lost across the UK after efforts to find a buyer for the store failed.
BHS went into administration in April. A number of offers were made to buy the department store chain but none of them were accepted by administrators.
The company has stores in Belfast, Holywood, Newtownabbey and Lisburn.
All 163 BHS stores will be holding closing sales over the coming weeks.
