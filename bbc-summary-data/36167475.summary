"It was an unbelievably easy decision for me," said Radford, who took over from Peter Gentle in 2013.
Owner Adam Pearson praised the 37-year-old former Hull FC player.
"I've worked with a lot of managers and head coaches in my 20 years in professional sport and never met an individual more committed to a club as Lee," said Pearson.
Hull, who are fourth in Super League after winning eight of their 12 games, host second-placed Catalan Dragons on Friday.
