[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murdered Michael Currer called Norfolk Police for help

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the murder of a man in Norwich say he called officers "requesting assistance" a few days before he was found dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Currer, 59, died from chest and facial injuries after being assaulted.
He phoned police on 9 November, but when officers arrived at Saffron Square they were told "police assistance was no longer needed".
The case has been referred to the police watchdog due to Mr Currer's contact with officers before his death.
Norfolk Police said the IPCC had authorised a local investigation which would take place in due course.
A man in his 50s and a woman in her 40s were arrested in connection with the murder and have since been released on bail.
Officers have been in the Saffron Square area two weeks on from the murder "to speak to people who use the area regularly as a route to work or in their social life that might have seen something which could progress the investigation," said Det Ch Insp Andy Guy.
"No matter how insignificant the information may seem to you, it could be key to our enquiries."
