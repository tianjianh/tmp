Exhall mining disaster: Memorial to men who died in pit fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial has been dedicated to 14 men who died in a Warwickshire mining disaster a century ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fire, started by a spilled oil lamp, swept through Exhall pit near Bedworth on 21 September, 1915, threatening the lives of the 375 men working there.
The majority of the men were led to safety through a ventilation shaft by the man in charge underground.
A circle of 14 trees, one for each man who died, has been planted around a granite memorial.
The memorial, in St. Giles Meadow, was unveiled by the High Sherriff of Warwickshire.
