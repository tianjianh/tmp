[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has condemned bystanders who recorded a street fight on their mobile phones, as a police officer lay bleeding and injured.

The High Court in Glasgow heard that no one came forward to help PC Kevin Smith after he was stabbed in an unprovoked attack in the city in April 2015.
Judge Lady Rae said it was "disgraceful and disgusting" that people nearby took pictures of the fracas instead.
She jailed Paul Patterson, 40, for 12 years after he admitted the murder bid.
PC Taylor was hurt when he stepped into a row Patterson was having with his neighbour, Wilson Martin, in Govan.
The officer was left with a serious leg wound and has been left scarred for life.
One of his colleagues had to drag Patterson to the ground before he was finally handcuffed.
Lady Rae said Patterson could "easily have killed" PC Taylor that day.
The judge told him: "Police officers fulfil a very important function in protecting the public from harm.
"In many ways, it is a dangerous occupation and they undertake their duties with bravery as did this officer."
She added: "In my view, all those working for the emergency services are entitled to expect protection from the courts."
Patterson's own lawyer described the attack as "shocking" adding Patterson "struggled to rationalise" why he behaved in such a manner.
Tony Lenehan, defending, added: "He very much regrets the consequences...whoever tackled him that day was at risk."
