Confusion undermining superfast broadband plan, says MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Confusion is undermining a project to get superfast broadband to more people in Wales, according to an MP.

Aberconwy's Guto Bebb said some constituents have been given contradictory information on whether they can receive it or not.
The Welsh government and BT are delivering the scheme, Superfast Cymru.
A spokesman said it was a "challenging and ambitious project" and so far 560,000 properties have accessed superfast broadband because of it.
It provides access to fibre broadband for the majority of premises not covered by any commercial roll-out of superfast broadband.
Conservative party member Mr Bebb said: "Superfast Cymru is publicly funded and my experience would indicate that the programme is out of control, and there's a lack of clarity in what it will deliver and how it will deliver."
The Superfast Cymru spokesman said in a project of its size, issues can arise that affect delivery dates.
He added that while this can be "frustrating", more than 80% of properties in Wales can access fibre broadband if they want.
