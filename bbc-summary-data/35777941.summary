The 215 (Swansea) Air Training Cadet Squadron congregated for a parade starting at the Guildhall at 10:45 GMT.
Road closures were in place as members marched along St Helens Road, Dillwyn Street, Oxford Street and Castle Square before returning to Guildhall.
The honour recognises the squadron's 75th year and its community work.
The air cadet squadron, which is a youth organisation sponsored by the Royal Air Force for 12 to 20-year-olds, helps the Royal British Legion Swansea branch organise Remembrance events and the annual Poppy Appeal.
Members also help raise funds for the RSPCA, the RNLI, Maggie's Cancer Centre, Cancer Research UK, as well as military charities.
Lord Mayor of Swansea, councillor John Newbury, said the squadron had raised more than Â£503,000 for Remembrance events in the past 12 years and the council was immensely proud of its work.
"Granting the squadron honorary freedom of the city and county of Swansea is an apt way of helping celebrate their 75th anniversary this year and recognising all the terrific fundraising work they've done," he added.
Others given the freedom of Swansea include the Welsh Guards and former US President Jimmy Carter.
