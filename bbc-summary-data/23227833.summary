Castle MacLellan Foods will receive the support for its Kirkcudbright base from parent company Kavli.
It will allow the business to "capitalise on strong growth prospects for its premium products throughout the UK".
The funds will be used to expand and streamline production areas within the factory which employs about 80 staff.
Improvements will also be made to the storage facilities, amenities and services at the factory in order to "maintain the high standards" of the Castle MacLellan brand.
Elaine McConnell, general manager at Castle MacLellan Foods, said: "This represents a momentous step forward for our business.
"It also demonstrates the confidence the Kavli Group has in the UK market and in the Castle MacLellan Foods team.
"It goes without saying that without the teamwork, commitment and dedication of our Dumfries and Galloway workforce we would not have secured this major inward investment to the region."
She added: "Having the opportunity to grow the business allows us to safeguard future employment prospects for the area overall."
Subject to planning consent, it is expected work will start on site in January 2014, with completion by September 2014.
Castle MacLellan Foods said it would be "working closely with the local community over the coming months" to keep them informed of its plans and to ensure "minimal disruption to residents" when building work gets under way.
