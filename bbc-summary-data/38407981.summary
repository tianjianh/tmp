Amar Raza Hussain, 38, was caught viewing the video while teaching at Lawnswood High School, Leeds, in April.
He was barred from teaching indefinitely following a National College for Teaching and Leadership misconduct hearing.
The panel said Mr Hussain was guilty of "unacceptable professional conduct".
The hearing was told safeguarding software detected pornographic material was being viewed from a USB device on the school network and identified Mr Hussain as the IT user.
Panel chair Fiona Tankard said: "The panel is satisfied that the conduct of Mr Hussain fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession."
She said he had created an "unacceptable risk" of the images being seen by the pupils and his actions meant he was not providing pupils "with the mutual respect and dignity that the class deserved".
Mr Hussain said he had been going through a "traumatic period", which included the death of his father.
However, the panel said despite the mitigating factors "a prohibition order is proportionate and appropriate".
Mr Hussain, who was suspended by Lawnswood High, will not be able to apply to have the order overturned until December 2018.
Jo Bell, headteacher at Lawnswood High, said: "It was our own, very robust, safeguarding measures which flagged up this inappropriate behaviour and enabled us to act swiftly and to ensure no pupils were harmed.
"We liaised closely with the supply agency who supplied him to us to ensure the appropriate security checks had been carried out by the agency prior to him temporarily working at our school."
