[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS 24's chief executive will step down and leave the organisation at the end of this month, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glasgow-based John Turner has been at NHS 24 since 2008.
He was chief executive at the former Borders Primary Care NHS Trust before holding the same post at NHS Western Isles after its chief was suspended.
NHS 24's chairwoman Esther Robertson said it was "with regret" that the board had accepted Mr Turner's resignation.
She said: "John has served the organisation since 2008, leading the development of NHS 24 as Scotland's national telehealth and telecare organisation.
"The board would like to thank him for the dedicated service he has given during his time, and wish him well for his future career. Interim arrangements are currently being agreed."
Mr Turner said he had enjoyed his time with the organisation "immensely".
He added: "Having recently successfully delivered a number of important milestones including the consolidation of the 111 service, completion of the 2014/15 performance year, and with the strong recent progress with our Future Programme , this seems like the right time for me to decide to move on.
"I wish NHS 24 and all its staff the very best for the future."
