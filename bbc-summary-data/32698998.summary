George Zimmerman, the man acquitted in 2013 of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, was injured in a shooting in Florida on Monday afternoon.

Lawyer Don West said he was sprayed with glass when the bullet pierced a car window but that he was not struck by the bullet, as local media reported.
"His injuries would be considered minor," he added.
The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Martin stirred debate over Florida's "Stand Your Ground" gun laws.
Since then, Mr Zimmerman has had several run-ins with law enforcement, including two incidents where he faced allegations of assault by girlfriends, and his wife who claimed he smashed her iPad.
Charges in those cases were dropped or not pursued because of a lack of evidence.
The latest incident happened in the Orlando suburb of Lake Mary on Monday.
"LMPD has responding [sic] to a shooting involving George Zimmerman," the Lake Mary Police Department tweeted from its verified account.
Zimmerman was admitted to hospital and then released.
He may know who is behind the shooting and is co-operating with police, said Mr West.
