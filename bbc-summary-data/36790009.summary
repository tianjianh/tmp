Lawrence and Ryan ten Doeschate (52) helped the Division Two leaders to 333 all out in reply to the hosts' 255.
After Gloucestershire had added 37 runs to their overnight score, Josh Shaw removed Tom Westley and Ravi Bopara to leave the visitors 57-3 before lunch.
Lawrence survived the hat-trick ball and, although Shaw (4-72) struck twice more, Essex forged a handy advantage.
Teenager Lawrence, who celebrated his 19th birthday on Tuesday, reached his second Championship hundred of 2016 off 162 balls.
Earlier, Jamie Porter (3-67) had taken the home side's final two wickets, while Matt Quinn ended with figures of 7-76 after his fine display on day one.
