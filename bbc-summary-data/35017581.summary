Luis Suarez or Sergio Aguero would score for us - Van Gaal

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes his side would have scored more goals this season if they had a striker like Sergio Aguero or Luis Suarez.

The Dutchman saw his side draw 0-0 with West Ham, a fifth such scoreline in their past nine games.
"The question is would Luis Suarez or Sergio Aguero score if they were here?" Van Gaal told BBC Radio Manchester.
"That is a question mark. You never know. I think they would, though."
Van Gaal, 64, added: "We've created enough chances to score, so that was not the problem."

The result means United drop to fourth in the Premier League, failing to capitalise on Manchester City's 2-0 defeat at Stoke.
The problem Manchester United face up front is highlighted by the fact Wayne Rooney and Memphis Depay have scored only two goals each in the league this season, while Anthony Martial has three.
The club's highest scorer is Juan Mata, who has found the back of the net four times in the top flight.
The hosts were lucky to escape with a point after seeing the visitors hit the woodwork twice at Old Trafford and although they are unbeaten at home so far this campaign, Van Gaal's side have scored just nine times in seven games.
Midfielder Marouane Fellaini missed their best chance, shooting straight at West Ham goalkeeper Adrian from inside the six-yard box, before the home side were booed off the pitch by their own supporters.
"The most important thing is you dominate, create and you finish. Football is about scoring goals. The first two basic aspects of football we have done," Van Gaal added.
"When you don't finish from a metre in front of an empty goal, you cannot say anything more. You have to finish and that's the only problem we have. We played very well especially in the second half - but you have to finish.
"The goals are coming. That is my strong belief."
United face a trip to Wolfsburg in the Champions League on Tuesday, knowing they must match PSV Eindhoven's result against CSKA Moscow to make it through to the knockout stages.
