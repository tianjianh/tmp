Stuart Gallear, 51, admits fatally stabbing his wife Mandy, 42, at their home in Hindley, Wigan in October 2016.
He said he had no intention to kill her and punish her lover, joiner Mark Prescott.
"Why would I plan to murder the mother of my children and leave them without a mother?" he told the jury at Manchester Crown Court.
His barrister, Simon Csoka QC, asked him: "On October 6 what was it that was bothering you the most?"
Mr Gallear replied: "Probably the fact my marriage was breaking up and I was losing the woman I loved for 20 years."
Mr Csoka asked: "Do you think about what happened?"
Mr Gallear responded: "I end up crying my eyes out. It's a never-ending nightmare."
During cross-examination Mr Gallear said he did not know why he picked up a knife from an open cutlery drawer in the couple's kitchen.
"There was no intent, I don't recall picking it up... I loved her to bits," he said.
Mr Gallear, who is originally from Wolverhampton, said his wife first told him in April 2016 of an extra-marital relationship, but told him she would end it.
He thought the marriage was "going a lot better" until 5 October 2016 when the son of Mr Prescott's partner told him about Mrs Gallear's affair, jurors heard.
The trial continues.
