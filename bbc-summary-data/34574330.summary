[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Trojan Horse' pupils had to 'stare at bushes as punishment'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils at a school involved in the "Trojan Horse" affair were put in "stress positions" as punishments, a misconduct panel heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monsoor "Moz" Hussain, former head teacher at Park View School, is alleged to have allowed this to happen.
He and four other senior Park View staff all deny unacceptable professional conduct.
The Birmingham school was investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to take over several schools.
It is claimed Mr Hussain allowed pupils to be subjected to unusual, and disproportionate punishments, including "being made to stand in the rain" and "being made to stare at bushes", the National College for Teaching and Leadership panel in Coventry heard.
Also accused are:
They all face a common allegation they agreed to the inclusion of "an undue amount of religious influence in the education of the pupils" at Park View, and, for some of the accused, the other sister schools.
Mr Saini is alleged to have advised a teacher, who was under a police caution for having "extreme pornography" on his mobile phone, to throw it in the canal.
He was also accused of not taking action when another teacher is said to have claimed that "We have the true religion."
Mr Faraz is alleged to have used the word "kuffars", in reference to non-Muslims "in a derogatory manner" and also to have told Park View pupils, in or around May 2013, that people in Guantanamo Bay were innocent.
It is also claimed he submitted a dishonest statement when he denied knowledge of a WhatsApp social media group, the "Park View Brotherhood".
Ms Clark is similarly accused but she, through her legal counsel, said she accepted "in part" one fact of the case levelled against her.
Katie Langdon said: "Lindsey Clark does not accept it was unusual or excessive punishment, but accepts some pupils were placed in detention, and accepts they have to look out towards bushes."
The hearings are scheduled to last until December and may hear from former Park View pupils.
The "Trojan Horse" allegations sparked several investigations including one by the Department for Education.
Park View was placed in special measures by Ofsted, and is now known as Rockwood Academy. Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock were also put into special measures.
