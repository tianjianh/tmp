Liverpool City Council to sell Grade II listed Municipal Buildings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool's Grade II listed Municipal Buildings will be sold off as the council attempts to make £90m of savings over the next three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool City Council approved plans to sell the building on Dale Street, which has been the authority's home for more than 150 years.
About 640 employees will move to other council sites, while the One Stop Shop will be relocated to St John's Market.
The council has used the building since the 1860s.
But it was declared "surplus to requirements" due to it being "a very costly building to run and maintain", with the authority "no longer having the staff numbers to justify retaining it".
Staff will begin moving out in the next few weeks and it will be put up for sale over a six-week period.
There have already been about 12 expressions of interest from across the country, a spokesperson said.
Councillor Malcolm Kennedy, cabinet member for regeneration, added: "This is a listed building and I want to reassure people that it will be protected and we will ensure that its future use protects its unique architectural features."
It will cost about £1.7m to relocate staff and refurbish other locations for them to move into, which will be funded from £1.2m in council reserves and £0.5m from the sale.
Discussions are ongoing about the future of another city centre council building, Venture Place in Sir Thomas Street.
