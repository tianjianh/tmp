Walter Oakley received a letter from the Russian and US leaders thanking him for his help in televising the meeting.
No agreements were signed at the summit but it was said to mark the end of the Cold War.
Mr Oakley from Low Fell, Gateshead, was holidaying when CNN asked him to help organise filming.
Newcastle auctioneers Anderson and Garland said the value is impossible to know.
Mr Oakley came across the letter again while researching a book about his family and has decided to sell it so more people can see and enjoy it.
His wife Diane said the letter has meant a lot to the family but it belongs in a collection or museum.
She said: "No matter how busy they were, they had the time to sit down and write the letter.
"He was Walt to both of them. He said they were both very nice guys, very easy to get along with. You wouldn't think they were the presidents of the two most powerful countries in the world."
Auctioneer Fred Wyrley-Birch said: "It's impossible to say how much the letter is worth because something like this has never been up for sale before to my knowledge.
"We'll start the bidding at Â£1,000 and see where it goes from there.
"Looking at the political situation between the US and Russia at the moment, it's a very interesting glimpse back to 27 years ago when there were increasingly friendly relations."
The letter will be auctioned during the Anderson and Garland's Fine Art sale from 22 to 24 March.
