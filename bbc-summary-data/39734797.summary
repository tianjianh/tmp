Morgan Ackerman, 16, was struck by a white Skoda Octavia taxi after knocking on doors and running away in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, on 3 January.
Morgan, described as "always joking" by his family, died from his injuries in hospital the next day.
Cardiff coroner Phillip Spinney concluded his death was accidental.
An inquest heard the college student knocked a window at about 22.30 GMT before running into the road where he was hit, resulting in "devastating" head injuries.
His friend Ethan, 16, said: "I shouted to him to stop because I could see the headlights of the car turning into the road.
"But he didn't stop and ran out between two parked cars. He was hit and landed heavily on the road. The side of his head banged on the road."
Another friend Bradley, 16, said Morgan put his hands out to protect himself but it was too late.
The taxi, driven by Anthony Hewlett, was travelling at about 20mph when it hit Morgan.
He told the inquest: "All of a sudden a person shot out. I braked hard but had no chance of avoiding him."
Morgan's mother Leanne Sweet, who received a text message from her son saying he was on his way minutes before he died, said he was "streetwise and knew the road well".
"To run out into the road would be completely out of character," she said.
Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Cardiff coroner Phillip Spinney said the taxi driver was unable to avoid the collision, adding "it was clearly a tragic accident".
