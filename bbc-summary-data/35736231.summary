[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town have signed goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell on loan from Championship side Derby County until the end of the season.

The 21-year-old joined the Rams in July 2014, when his contract at Newcastle United expired.
His only first-team appearance for the Rams so far came in January's FA Cup third-round win at Hartlepool.
"We think Jonathan is one of the best young goalkeepers around," said Luton boss Nathan Jones.
Mitchell is eligible to make his Luton debut against Leyton Orient on Saturday.
