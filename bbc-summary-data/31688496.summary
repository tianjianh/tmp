Premier League predictions: Lawro v Circa Waves' Kieran Shudall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the midweek Premier League fixtures is Kieran Shudall, singer and guitarist in indie-rock band Circa Waves.
Shudall has been an Everton fan since he was a boy and says his favourite player was Duncan Ferguson.
"I can't quite remember why I am an Evertonian - my brother must have convinced me when I was three or four that they were the best team," Shudall told BBC Sport.
Maybe Leighton Baines will come to see us at a gig one day and I can pat him on the back and say 'nice one'
"But I always felt more attracted to them than Liverpool anyway. When I was younger I was always quite into Dunc - he was tall, fearless and really cool.
"At the moment I like Steven Naismith, because he seems to put in more effort than anyone else, and Leighton Baines too.
"Baines is into his guitar music and and he looks like a bit of a mod. He is also one of the best crossers of a ball in the Premier League - maybe he will come to see us at a gig one day and I can pat him on the back and tell him 'nice one'."
Circa Waves are set to release their debut album and start a UK tour, and Shudall admits that it is always difficult for the band to follow football as much as they would like when they are on the road.
Sam Rourke (bass) is a Liverpool fan, Colin Jones (drums) supports Tottenham and Joe Falconer (guitar) backs Aston Villa.
"Joe supports Villa, but not much really," Shudall added. "He is probably the least into it, but we all enjoy it.
"It is quite difficult obviously on tour to try to keep up with all the games, but we try our best."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro got three correct results from eight Premier League games, including two perfect scores.
His score of seven points saw him beat England rugby union star George Ford, who picked five correct results but with no perfect scores to earn five points.
Lawro also correctly guessed the score and result in the Capital One Cup final, but that does not count towards his weekly total or average for the season.
Any points earned for the two Premier League games which were postponed because of that tie will be added after the matches take place.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
