Bree, 19, has arrived on a four-and-a-half-year deal for what Barnsley call a "substantial fee", having made 61 appearances for the Tykes.
Iceland international Bjarnason, 28, has joined Villa on a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Formerly of Belgian club Standard Liege and Italian side Sampdoria, he scored his country's first goal at Euro 2016.
"It's a very big club. I am now looking forward to getting out on to the pitch and helping the team," Bjarnason told Villa's club website.
Bree said: "(Manager) Steve Bruce was a big factor in my decision, when I met him I knew it was the right move for me."
The right-back was only 16 when he made his league debut for Barnsley against QPR in May 2014 and helped them win promotion from League One last season.
