Call for anglers to release salmon to halt 'serious' decline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglers have been asked to release all salmon they catch in Welsh waters after numbers hit a "worrying low".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said fry (juvenile salmon hatched in spring, 2016) were at critically-low levels in the rivers Usk, Towy and Clwyd.
NRW said although many anglers already practised catch and release, further conservation steps had to be taken.
Dave Mee, senior fisheries advisor, said "we need every adult fish to have the chance of spawning".
Mr Mee said the number of salmon migrating back into Welsh rivers was "worryingly low"  and NRW was considering "what future controls may be required".
NRW said the decline could be related to the warmest December on record in 2015.
