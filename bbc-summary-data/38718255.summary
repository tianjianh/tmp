Wolves are to appeal against the red card given to goalkeeper Carl Ikeme in Saturday's 3-1 controversial Championship defeat at Norwich.

Ikeme, 30, was sent off after pushing Wes Hoolahan in the chest, but the club have been advised it is normally considered only a yellow-card offence.
Wolves are hoping Ikeme will be cleared to play in Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool at Anfield.
"If it's feasible to win, then we'll try," boss Paul Lambert told BBC WM.
"Next week is a massive game for everyone at the club."
Norwich manager Alex Neil told BBC Sport after Saturday's game: "I don't think the goalkeeper should have responded in the manner that he did and deservedly got his red card.
"Wes has got the penalty and turned around to carry on the game. That was unprofessional from the goalkeeper and he obviously got his punishment."
Ikeme had never been sent off before, having received only three yellow cards in his previous 264 career appearances.
He posted on Twitter: "Apologise if anyone feels let down but this one is hard to take.
"Been mulling over whether to say anything or not . . . It's hard not to be frustrated when someone blatantly dives to win a penalty."
