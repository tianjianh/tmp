The Republic will take on Switzerland and Slovakia in Euro 2016 warm-ups.
Wolves defender Doherty comes into a 40-man provisional panel along with Aberdeen's Hayes and Peterborough midfielder Forrester.
"I want to give players a chance to impress," said Republic manager Martin O'Neill.
O'Neill's side face Switzerland on 25 March before a meeting with Slovakia four days later.
The squad, which also includes uncapped Brentford midfielder Alan Judge, will be shortened ahead of assembling on 20 March.
"The countdown to Euro 2016 starts now - both myself and my staff have been incredibly busy since qualification last November scouting and monitoring as many players as possible," added O'Neill.
"I know that I will have a very tough decision to name a final squad for Euro 2016."
