[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murdered Sandie Bowen's body was 'tied to sink in lake'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Murdered Sandie Bowen's decomposed remains were found tied to a porcelain sink at the bottom of a reservoir, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 53-year-old's body was recovered last month at Wentwood Reservoir, near Newport - 20 years after she was murdered by her husband Michael.
Mrs Bowen went missing from home in Monmouthshire in August 1997 but Bowen never revealed where he hid her body.
Coroner David Bowen recorded that Mrs Bowen had been "unlawfully killed".
Mrs Bowen, who was from Llandogo in the Wye Valley, was identified as a result of dental records and DNA testing, the inquest in Newport heard.
Her badly-decomposed remains were found at the reservoir, which had not been drained for 100 years, following a call from a member of the public on 1 February.
A subsequent post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as "unascertained".
Bowen was jailed for life in 1998 after being convicted of his wife's murder at Cardiff Crown Court but has recently been released on licence.
After talks with the Crown Prosecution Service, Gwent Police said no further action would be taken against Bowen following the discovery of the body.
Mrs Bowen's remains have been released to Mrs Bowen's family so a funeral can take place.
