'Vigilantes' catch Bangor sex offender Michael Harper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of people, described as "vigilantes", posed as a 14-year-old girl to trap a sex offender, then marched him to police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Harper agreed to meet a "girl" at Bangor railway station.
Instead, he was confronted by a masked group called Emerald Dragon Anonymous who handed him over to police.
On Thursday, Harper, 34, of Bangor, Gwynedd, was jailed for two years at Caernarfon Crown Court after admitting three sexual offences.
Elen Owen, prosecuting, said the group caught Harper on 31 July and took him to British Transport Police, along with a computer disc of "graphic" conversations he had with who he thought was a 14-year-old girl.
He was then taken to Bangor police station where he was arrested.
Ms Owen said the group "refused to identify themselves and were wearing masks".
Harper admitted attempting to meet a 14-year-old girl following sexual grooming and two charges of attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence.
When interviewed, he claimed most of the messages sent to "Lisa and Chloe" were in error and he meant to send them to an adult woman.
John Wyn Williams, defending, said a probation officer had described the group as vigilantes.
Judge Michael Burr said: "Nevertheless, your state of mind was clear and determined and it was your intention to carry out what you described in graphic detail in communication between you and who you believed to be two young girls."
Harper must also sign on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.
