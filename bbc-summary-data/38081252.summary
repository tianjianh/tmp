102-year-old shares his secrets to long life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim man, who recently celebrated his 102nd birthday, has been revealing his secrets for a long life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McLarnon has lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Free State and the administrations of 20 prime ministers.
He has lived in the same house in the townland of Largy, near Portglenone, since he was born in 1914.
"Our generation ran about in their bare feet, we went to school - everyone did, in their bare feet," he said.
For John, the invention which made his life easier was the bicycle.
"The bicycle was a great invention," he said.
"We all learned to ride the bicycle when we were very young, but one bicycle had to do two or three of the family."
John gave up driving when he turned 100. He said it was the sensible thing to do, as cars were "too fast now".
John credits his longevity to a life of moderation; he doesn't smoke or drink but does have a sweet tooth - despite the fact all his teeth are his own.
"I'm happy with everything I've done and being fit enough to do it," he said.
"I'm very thankful for my good health which is the greatest gift of all."
For a man who has seen many things and been around the block more than a few times, his advice on a long life is worth heeding.
"Take care of your health, because if you lose your health it never comes back," he said.
"Don't put off tomorrow what you can do today."
John is one of a number of older people talking part in a BBC NI appeal on behalf of Age NI.
