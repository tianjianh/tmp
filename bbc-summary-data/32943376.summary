The match ended with no result due to rain but Pakistan won the series 2-0.
The game had gone ahead despite the death of a policeman and injuries to six other people in Friday's attack.
Until the current tour, there had been no international cricket in Pakistan since a bus carrying the Sri Lankan team was attacked in Lahore in 2009.
Six Pakistani policemen and two civilians, including the driver of a minibus containing the game's umpires, were killed that day, while several Sri Lanka players sustained minor injuries.
Since then, Pakistan have played their "home" matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
A spokesman for the Pakistan Cricket Board said Friday's attack had not affected the tour, and that the players were were satisfied with security arrangements for Sunday's third one-day international.
Thousands of security personnel were deployed.
Police initially claimed the blast near Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium had been caused by an electric transformer.
But the Pakistani information minister later confirmed it had been a suicide attack and that the police officer had died when he tried to stop the bomber. No group has said it carried out the attack.
Pakistan won the first two one-day internationals in the series, as well as defeating Zimbabwe in two Twenty20 internationals.
The International Cricket Council refused to send any match officials for the series because of security concerns.
