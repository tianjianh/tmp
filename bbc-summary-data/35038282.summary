[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has said it would consider any request for funding towards a private prosecution of the Glasgow bin lorry driver Harry Clarke.

One bereaved family is taking action after an inquiry found the crash could have been avoided if Mr Clarke had not lied about his history of blackouts.
The 58-year-old was unconscious when the lorry crashed, killing six people.
The Lord Advocate told MSPs on Tuesday that the decision not to prosecute Mr Clarke was not popular but correct.
The BBC asked the Scottish government if ministers would consider any requests for funding towards any private prosecution of Mr Clarke.
A spokesman said: "Private prosecutions in Scotland are exceedingly rare and there are a number of steps that would need to be followed before a private prosecution could proceed.
"Scottish ministers would consider any request for public funding towards a private prosecution very carefully, should such an application be made."
The government comment came after relatives of Erin McQuade and Jack and Lorraine Sweeney announced that they would attempt to take forward a private prosecution of Mr Clarke as, in their view, the Crown's decision not to was "wrong".
On Tuesday, Scotland's top law officer, the Lord Advocate Frank Mullholland, answered questions in the Scottish Parliament about the fatal accident inquiry (FAI) report that was published a day earlier.
When asked about the private prosecution being pursued by one family, the lord advocate said he could not comment on that,
He said if and when such a bill was lodged seeking a private prosecution then the Crown would "carefully consider that and what its position is and make that clear to the court and the families".
Mr Mullholland also told MSPs that the decision not to prosecute Mr Clarke might not have been popular with the public but it was correct.
"No evidence emerged at the fatal accident inquiry that the Crown was unaware of," he said.
"There was nothing that emerged in the judgement of Sheriff Beckett that the Crown was unaware of and nothing in Sheriff Beckett's judgement undermines the decision taken not to prosecute the driver of the bin lorry."
The lord advocate added: "The Crown well appreciates that this decision was not a popular one but the Crown cannot take decisions on the basis that they are popular but wrong in law.
"That would be unconstitutional, an abuse of process, and would rightly result in severe criticism by the court and a loss of confidence in the Crown."
That Crown's decision not to prosecute anyone over the crash paved the way for the FAI which was held over five weeks at Glasgow Sheriff Court, before Sheriff John Beckett.
On Monday, Sheriff Beckett published his determination which concluded that Mr Clarke, who had a history of blackouts and poor health, had "repeatedly lied in order to gain and retain jobs and licences".
This included not fully disclosing the details of a blackout he suffered at the wheel of a stationary bus in April 2010 to his own doctors and in employment applications and medical assessments for later jobs at Glasgow City Council.
It found eight reasonable precautions that could have prevented the crash. All were related to his hidden medical past.
During evidence at the inquiry, which concluded in August, it emerged that Mr Clarke had suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope.
He passed out at the wheel while the bin lorry was on Queen Street in Glasgow city centre, just days before Christmas.
Just 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, leaving six people dead and 17 injured.
Those killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.
