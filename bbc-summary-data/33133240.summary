Women's World Cup 2015: Nigeria's Ugo Njoku gets ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's Ugo Njoku has been given a three-match ban for elbowing Australia's Sam Kerr during Friday's Women's World Cup Group D match.

The offence by Njoku, who came on as a substitute, went unpunished during the game, which Nigeria lost 2-0.
However Fifa's disciplinary committee later examined the video footage and handed the 20-year-old the ban.
With Nigeria unlikely to progress, she will miss the final game against the US plus their next two official matches.
Earlier in the tournament France striker Camille Abily escaped punishment for a similar incident with England defender Laura Bassett.
But the referee did not penalise Abily, Fifa did not review the incident and the Football Association did not contest Fifa's decision.
