[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Kelly scored a rare goal as AFC Wimbledon put their disappointing festive period behind them and came from behind to beat Oxford 2-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Hall opened the scoring for Oxford before a first-half own goal from Yellows keeper Simon Eastwood levelled.
Defender Kelly then headed the hosts in front - his first goal for the Dons - and after an eventful second half, Wimbledon saw the game out to get their play-off push back on track.
Hall struck after seven minutes, darting inside and hitting a powerful dipping strike from 25 yards into the bottom corner.
But the hosts were back level six minutes later, Dean Parrett crashing a fierce drive off the crossbar which hit the desperately unlucky Eastwood on the back and dribbled in.
Wimbledon were in front in the 28th minute after a Parrett corner was met by a towering Kelly header.
The Dons were rampant after the break, with Lyle Taylor and Dom Poleon guilty of spurning multiple opportunities to extend their lead, but in the end it did not matter.
