[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A free music festival in southern Scotland has been given funding to allow it to expand and improve the event.

Youth Beatz, staged in Dumfries, has secured two-year support of Â£49,000 from the Young Start Lottery Fund.
Organisers described it as "unbelievable news" which would help with planning for the event.
Preparations are already under way for this year's festival which will be held in the Dock Park on 12 August.
The grant will allow expansion and improvements at the event and its associated "youth engagement" programme The Toon.
Dumfries Provost Ted Thompson said: "Youth Beatz and The Toon are much more than just a music festival.
"It is a community enterprise, central to our region's annual events calendar, allowing young people to take an active role in their community.
"The range of activities and support available during the fringe festival in the run up to the event is incredible, helping our young people to fulfil their potential."
