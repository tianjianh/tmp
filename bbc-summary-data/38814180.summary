The 20-year-old striker came through the Stadium MK academy and previously spent time on loan with Nuneaton Town.
He played against Yeovil in the Football League Trophy in December, one of 12 games for MK Dons this term, and impressed Glovers manager Darren Way.
"We know he's a real threat behind a back four and he's got an eye for goal," Way told the club website.
Tshimanga is Yeovil's fifth January arrival and joins Tottenham's Shayon Harrison and West Bromwich Albion's Andre Wright on loan at the club.
