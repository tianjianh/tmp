In pictures: Haiti five years after the earthquake

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On 12 January 2010, Haiti was struck by a magnitude seven earthquake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 250,000 people are estimated to have been killed and more than 1.5 million displaced.
Five years on, more than 85,500 Haitians still live in displaced people's camps. The children in these camps are particularly vulnerable as they are growing up with limited or no access to everyday basic services such as water, sanitation, healthcare and schools.
Photographer Riccardo Venturi travelled to Haiti with Save the Children to document their lives five years after the devastating earthquake.
Marie Darline is 15 years old and lives in a camp for people who were displaced by the 2010 earthquake.
"I have lived in this camp for four  years. I don't like living here but this is what we have.
"I don't feel safe here at all because people don't respect each other.
"Once a police officer was killed. They shot him and rode off by motorcycle. We have a police station but no police officers.
"We can't walk out late, we're afraid to because there are young men in the street who will grab us."
Elinaud, 28, lives in the commune of Dessalines with his parents. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Haitians to be infected with cholera in an outbreak which swept through the country after the earthquake.
"I am not too sure how I caught cholera but because I work in the field and there are no latrines it could be from that.
"My stomach felt like it was on fire and I was scared that I was going to die.
"I went to a centre in Marchand de Dessalines to get treatment where they provided me with care and a Save the Children cholera kit.
"Now I know how to prevent cholera; I know I have to wash my hands before I got to the toilet and after I go to the bathroom.
"I support my family by working in the field. I have a lot of brothers and sisters, we are 11. Nine live here with me!"
Edrine is 14 and lives with her family of six in a makeshift hut in a displaced people's camp, where they moved the day after the earthquake.
"We used to live in a house but it was completely destroyed.
"We are not comfortable living here, when it rains there is so much water flowing through here.
"We would like shovels and picks so we can clean the ground and build canals for the water."
Katiana, 13, also fears for her security in the camp, but she says the lack of medical care is also worrying.
"The street lights are broken so you walk but you're not safe.
"But the biggest problem here is a health one. There isn't a health centre here at all."
Shesnerline Woodeline, 15, lives in a camp for Haitians displaced by the 2010 earthquake.
"I want to be a diplomat because I like politics and I like to talk, and share ideas.
"I would like to represent my country.
"If I was a diplomat for example in this camp I would create a health centre because there isn't one. And then I would make a square where children can have fun.
"And also build a more secure police station because the one here is almost broken and there is a problem with camp security.
"We children here have rights; we have rights to everything."
"My name is Betchina, I am 13 years old. I am in the sixth grade. I did well in my exams today.
"When I finish school I want to be a nurse. I want to be a nurse because I want to help people.
"When the earthquake happened I was bathing my brother and when the shaking happened we started to run.
"But a block of concrete fell on my knee and our house was completely destroyed.
"My knee was damaged and I was in hospital for a while.
"They sewed up my knee and I was in and out of hospital. Before the earthquake I could walk and then I couldn't.
"People talk a lot about the earthquake. When people see my injury the subject comes up a lot."
