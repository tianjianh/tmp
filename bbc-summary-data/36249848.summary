[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who talked about his fantasies involving children in "horrific" internet chat logs has admitted a number of sexual offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Whitlock, 45, a former employee of Kimbolton School, Cambridgeshire, had a "clear entrenched sexual interest in children", police said.
He admitted three offences involving hundreds of indecent images of children and publishing an obscene article.
The school said no past or present pupils were involved in the case.

Whitlock was arrested last June after police received an anonymous letter saying he had "disturbing images of children" in his possession.
Detectives found a "number of electronic devices" at his home in Bedford and at Kimbolton School, which contained indecent images of children along with chat logs in his name "detailing obscene material and explicit sexual fantasies involving children," Cambridgeshire Police said.
He was suspended from teaching before being sacked in November.
Senior Crown Prosecutor Samantha Woolley described the chat logs as being of a "horrific nature".
"The written content of the messages is of an obscene and distressing nature based on the sexual abuse of children and young children," she said.
During a hearing at Cambridge Crown Court, Whitlock pleaded guilty to one count of making indecent images of a child, one count of possessing indecent images of a child, one count of distributing an indecent image of a child and one count of publishing an obscene article.
The last offence relates to the exchange of chat messages about Whitlock's fantasies involving young children.
Police said the investigation was "complex" and had not involved any of Kimbolton School's past or present students.
Head teacher Jonathan Belbin said: "We treat any falling short of our high standards with the utmost seriousness and we have given the authorities every assistance during their investigation into this case."
Whitlock will be sentenced later this month.
