It is thought to be the first time a Chinese company has invested in the games industry in Scotland.
The new studio, which will be led by former Reloaded Productions managing director Michael Boniface, plans to develop a multi-player online game.
Scottish Development International helped to facilitate the move.
Mr Boniface said: "The establishment of Skymoons' new studio in Scotland is a game changer, and an exciting opportunity for those who make up the strong resource of locally-based talent.
"I am very pleased to be representing Skymoons in this venture and will be recruiting new staff shortly, aiming for all 21 jobs to be filled by the end of June."
First established in Chengdu, Skymoons Digital Entertainment Co is an established publisher of mobile games in China. It is looking to expand in the global digital entertainment market.
Business and Innovation Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "This is a great example of international investment in Scotland's growing digital economy and a good example of Scottish Development International support.
"Scotland is known around the world for our dynamic and successful creative industries - having produced some of the best known and bestselling games in the world.
"This investment will help create a very welcome outcome for Edinburgh's games development sector. "
