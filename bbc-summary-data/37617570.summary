[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cumbria Police have confirmed they are investigating.
Plans to downgrade some health services in West, North and East Cumbria put forward by the Success Regime are subject to a public consultation.
Success Regime chairman Sir Neil McKay said the online abuse had been "vile and unacceptable".
In an email newsletter about the consultation he said it had been directed to one of the team's local clinical consultants.
"I abhor and condemn all hate crime including written and verbal abuse," he said.
"I particularly deplore racial abuse.
"The matter has now been reported to the police and formally recorded as a hate incident."
He called on people to ensure the future debate about health services in the region was "conducted in a civilised manner".
