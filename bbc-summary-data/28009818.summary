He saw his side exit in the group stages for the second successive World Cup after the 1-0 defeat by Uruguay.
Prandelli, 56, took over the Azzuri after the unsuccessful 2010 tournament and led them to the final of Euro 2012.

"I chose a certain technical plan and that's why I am resigning, because it did not work," he said.
"Something has changed since my contract was renewed. I don't know why."
Italian Football Federation president Giancarlo Abete has also resigned.
Prandelli only signed a new deal in May taking him up to Euro 2016.
"I talked to the president of the federation and vice president Demetrio Albertini and gave my resignation," added Prandelli. "It is irrevocable."
Despite losing to Costa Rica in their second game, the Italians only needed a point to progress to the last 16 thanks to an opening Group D 2-1 victory over England.
But Diego Godin's late header, after Luis Suarez had escaped punishment for an apparent bite on Italy defender Girorgio Chiellini, sent Uruguay through to the last 16.
Abete said: "I would like to announce my resignation. I do hope that at the forthcoming meeting of the board they can persuade Cesare to reconsider his position."
