Killer back in jail for attacking partner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was jailed with two friends for killing a young woman who aborted his baby has been sent back to jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Johnny Stirling, 20, was aged 15 when 21-year-old Nattalie Muir was fatally stabbed in December 2010.
Stirling was jailed along with George Stewart for culpable homicide. Emma Merrilees was jailed for murder.
Stirling was released in 2014 but has been returned to jail after he admitted attacking a former girlfriend. He will be sentenced for that at a later date.
Stirling was jailed for six years for culpable homicide but was released in March 2014 having served around half the term.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that after being released he went on to attack his then partner at a property in Mauchline, East Ayrshire, in October last year.
The young woman was slapped and dragged around the house during the attack after Stirling "went mental".
She only escaped when a little boy used a butter knife to unlock a door after she was trapped in a bathroom.
Stirling admitted assault and abduction in connection with the incident.
Judge Lord Matthews deferred sentence over the attack but ordered Stirling to serve 279 days of the jail-term he had been freed early from.
Deferring sentence for the attack, Lord Matthews said that any new jail-sentence would begin at the end of the term.
