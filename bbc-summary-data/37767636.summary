[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 33, fled the UK in 2010 before being convicted of raping a woman in Cheltenham. He was sentenced to 14 years in his absence.
The Bangladeshi national was captured at a restaurant in Playa de las Americas by Spanish National Police.
He will appear at the Spanish National Court in Madrid on Wednesday.
Alam had been listed as "one of Britain's most wanted fugitives" by the National Crime Agency (NCA).
Steve Reynolds, head of international operations for the agerncy, said: "Locating and arresting Alam after he had been on the run for six years is a fantastic result.
"This was a team effort to get justice for his victim and he will now be returned to the UK to serve a 14-year jail term."
Alam arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, where he attacked his victim.
