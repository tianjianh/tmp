The boxer Floyd Mayweather has said it is "not a good idea" for Twitter to buy the selfie-sharing app Shots.

He funded it alongside Justin Bieber.
Reports suggested Twitter had held meetings with Shots, the company behind the app.
In a statement seen exclusively by Newsbeat Mayweather said he was not aware of any meetings until he saw it in the news and he had urged the apps co-founders "not to ever be pressured into anything by anyone."
Speculation over Twitter acquiring a new company began after one of the social network's bosses accidentally posted a public tweet.
Chief financial officer Anthony Noto tweeted: "I think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 -- we will need to sell him. I have a plan."
Shots - is all about posting selfies - the difference being no public comments are allowed. It was among the companies Anthony Noto was thought to be referring to and the statement from Floyd Mayweather appears to confirm Twitter's interest.
The boxer said it was not a good time to sell the app.
"Everything great comes with time. Shots is only a year old and the app keeps getting better, bigger and becoming more relevant."
When the app launched in 2013, co-founder John Shahidi told Newsbeat it would help people avoid the "jealousy, envy and manipulation" seen on other social networks.
Mayweather's statement referred to Shots' intention to counter abuse online, eliminating public comments.
"It's also the first social network that puts positivity over anything else by the way it's designed."
"The new generation needs this so it's important that they continue to build on this. There's too much drama on these other networks."
Justin Bieber is understood to have invested most of the app's $1.1 million (Â£691,000) funding.
Twitter has bought dozens of companies since it launched in 2006 including social media dashboard Tweetdeck and video sharing service Vine.
Floyd Mayweather's statement ended by suggesting he would back Shots' owners to sell if they decided to, even though he was against the move.
"No matter what, I'll support John, Sam and the Shots team. I believed in them when nobody else did and will always stand by their side."
