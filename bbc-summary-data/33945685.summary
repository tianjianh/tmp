Deputy Lord Mayor Shafique Shah joined veterans and members of the armed services in a special ceremony in Centenary Square at 11:00 BST.
It was one of dozens of events taking place around the country remembering those who fought in what's been described as the "forgotten war".
While the war in Europe ended in May 1945, the Japanese did not surrender until 14 August 1945.
It followed the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Paul Watson, from Birmingham and chairman of the Children of Far East Prisoners of War group, said it important to remember those who fought in the region.
"Sadly, many of the prisoners of war who returned from the Far East are no longer with us and so younger people often do not know about this important chapter in our history," he said.
"The suffering of many was immense."
The Queen attended a remembrance service in London, while a minute's silence was held at a ceremony in Tokyo.
