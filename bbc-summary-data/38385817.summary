The money will go to 27 organisations, including Aberlour, Includem, Mentor Scotland and the NSPCC.
The awards are part of next year's Children, Young People and Families Early Intervention and Adult Learning and Empowering Communities Fund.
They were confirmed by Childcare Minister Mark McDonald at Holyrood.
He was speaking during a Scottish government debate on improving the care experience for looked after children.
The funding awards will include an innovative scheme to help looked after children use the law to maintain contact with siblings. and a project that provides therapeutic interventions for looked after children and other vulnerable young people in Glasgow.
Mr McDonald said the money would also help to provide support for vulnerable families that may help prevent more children becoming looked after.
He added: "Over the decades we have learned a lot about what works when it comes to intervening in the lives of children who have been neglected, abused and traumatised.
"We are making real progress through Getting It Right for Every Child, changing culture and practice to prevent children coming into care and to intervene early when they are at risk of becoming looked after.
"This work is vital and must continue."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP conference in October that a "root and branch review" of Scotland's children in care system would be carried out.
