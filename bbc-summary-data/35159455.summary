One Scottish courthouse sold since closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's court service has sold just one of its former courthouses since a series of closures began more than two years ago, BBC Scotland has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service (SCTS) closed 10 sheriff courts across Scotland between November 2013 and January 2015.
In response to a Freedom of Information request, the service said the former Dornoch Sheriff Court had been sold.
However, the service said it had "disposed" of three other courts.
Haddington Sheriff Court has been given free to East Lothian Council.
In exchange, the SCTS said it would receive rent-free office accommodation from the council. It is understood the rooms would be made available to the courts when a vulnerable witness needed to give evidence by video-link.
Peebles and Rothesay courts operated in buildings which were leased from local authorities. Those agreements have been terminated.
The SCTS said it paid a total of £20,198 in annual maintenance costs on the six former courthouses that remain in its ownership
Plans to close 10 sheriff courts and nine justice of the peace courts were drawn up by the SCTS and approved by the Scottish government in April 2013.
It was estimated that the changes could save the courts service about £1.3m annually and a one-off initial saving of £3m.
Court chiefs said they hoped to complete a "free transfer" of the former Cupar Sheriff Court to Fife Council in the new year.
Like Haddington, the SCTS would be entitled to rent-free office accommodation under the agreement.
The court service said it was also in talks with Scottish Borders Council about a similar arrangement of the old Duns Sheriff Court building.
However a spokeswoman for the local authority has ruled it out.
She said: "As this would have incurred additional pressures on the maintenance budget, we are no longer in talks with them [SCTS] about taking on the former court building."
The SCTS  also revealed that local community groups have expressed interests in acquiring their properties in Arbroath and Stonehaven.
Dingwall Sheriff Court building is on the market and the former Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court is in the process of being sold.
A spokesman for the court service said their Shaping Scotland's Court Service report, which was published in 2013, identified significant benefits from reorganising the courts estate.
He added: "The report also confirmed that disposing of former court buildings would take a number of years to complete, but we are in fact ahead of our expected disposal schedule.
"Through a combination of lease termination, open market sale, public owner transfer and potential transfer to community ownership the disposal of these buildings is benefiting local communities."
