Hampshire are to split the captaincy for the coming season between James Vince and George Bailey.

Vince, who skippered in all formats last season, will captain in the T20 and 50-over competitions, with Bailey leading in the County Championship.
"We're fortunate to have two very good leaders within the squad," director of cricket Giles White told BBC Sport.
"It seems a sensible option as George comes with a lot of experience and James has led the side recently."
"I feel we've got two really good captains," White added. "One a young captain who's got it all ahead of him and the other with huge experience who wants to give it back."
Vince, 26, will lead the side in all formats during the first month of the season, while Bailey takes some times off to get married in his native Australia.
Bailey, 34, who has made 124 appearances for Australia across all formats, rejoined the county on a two-year contract in November.
He is expected to return to action for Hampshire against Essex on 19 May.
