Solihull Moors have signed centre-back Joel Kettle from Northern League Premier leaders Rushall Olympic.

The 25-year-old steps up to the National League after 22 appearances for Rushall this season.
He is the fifth signing since Liam McDonald became Moors manager and could be in the squad for Saturday's trip to Dagenham & Redbridge.
Meanwhile, defender Jean-Yves Koue Niate and midfielder Donnell Benjamin have both left Damson Park.
Koue Niate played eight times for Moors, but Benjamin did not make a first-team appearance.
