Middlesex: Tim Murtagh signs contract extension until 2018

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland seamer Tim Murtagh has extended his contract with county champions Middlesex, tying him to Lord's until at least 2018.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murtagh, 35, has reached agreement on a two-year addition to his existing deal.
"I've been extremely proud to represent Middlesex for the last decade," said Lambeth-born Murtagh.
"To have seen the side develop and grow to the point where we became county champions has been one of the most rewarding things I've achieved."
Murtagh has played for both London clubs, having moved to Lord's from neighbours Surrey in 2007.
He has gone on to make 277 appearances for Middlesex in all forms of the game, scoring almost 3,000 runs and taking more than 700 wickets, 557 of them in first-class cricket.
"I am delighted that, in all probability, Tim will finish his career with Middlesex," said managing director of cricket Angus Fraser, who was part of the last Middlesex team to win the title, in 1993.
"No current player will ever come close to overtaking the number of wickets Fred Titmus took for the club (2,361) but Tim's achievements will quite rightly be recognised.
"Last season, he overtook Norman Cowans' first-class wicket tally for the club to enter the top 25.
"Norman, quite rightly, is a Middlesex legend and Tim, having helped the club win its first County Championship for 23 years, should now be looked on in a similar manner."
