[SN]TITLE[SN]
Caroline Lucas takes over CND role from Jeremy Corbyn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has taken over from Jeremy Corbyn as the chair of Parliament's cross-party Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour leader is still CND's vice-president but has quit the Parliament role due to time pressure.
Ms Lucas said she was "proud" to succeed Mr Corbyn, who had been "a passionate and effective advocate for nuclear disarmament in Parliament".
She was previously vice chairman of the group.
"There is a growing cross-party consensus on nuclear disarmament with the Labour Party leadership joining the Green Party, SNP and Plaid Cymru in opposition to renewing Trident," added the Brighton Pavilion MP.
Labour is currently considering whether to ditch its longstanding commitment to replacing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons as part of a defence policy review.
