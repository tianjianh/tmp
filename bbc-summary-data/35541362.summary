Remember Abou Diaby? Ex-Arsenal midfielder? Always injured? He's back...

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old is set to return to action for Marseille after 17 months in the treatment room.
Injury-prone Diaby managed only two appearances in his final two seasons with the Gunners and was finally released in the summer.
His bad luck has continued in his native France after getting injured in training, but he is in line for a return in Marseille's French cup game against fourth Trelissac on Thursday.
