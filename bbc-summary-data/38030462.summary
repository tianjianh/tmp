Search for owner of 1942 diary lost on Remembrance Sunday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A search is under way for the owner of a diary from 1942 found at a cenotaph in Lancashire on Remembrance Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The book was found at Blackpool Cenotaph and had a photograph of two children inside.
It appears to have belonged to a gentleman called C. Bagguley, who was the editor of the Air Training Corps News back in 1942.
Gary Coleman, who is looking for the owner, said they know he lived in Claremont Road, North Shore.
He believed the owner was a teenager at the time the diary was written.
"It's full of what he got up to in his life - places he visited, friends of his, training and parades... it's fascinating to read," he said.
"They used to go out to the cinema nearly every Sunday - the Princess Cinema, the Hippodrome, the Imperial Picture Palace."
"What is intriguing is that being in the Air Training Corps, he was used to handling guns and it's funny because he used to go out to the fields nearby and two days running he saw three hares and missed every one of them... apparently he nearly hit a couple that were behind the hedge once."
He said the diary was handed after the remembrance events to his father, Ian Coleman, who is president of the British Legion in Blackpool.
