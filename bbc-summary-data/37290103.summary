[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Mugford kicked 14 points for Sale as they beat 14-man Harlequins for their first Premiership win of 2016-17.

Mugford, a summer signing from Nottingham, was called up for his first start at fly-half because AJ MacGinty pulled out with a hamstring injury.
His three penalties gave the Sharks a 9-7 lead at half-time, with Chris Robshaw's try keeping Quins in touch.
David Seymour's score secured victory, before Mat Luamanu saw red late on for a no-arms tackle on Josh Beaumont.
Despite some late pressure, Quins were unable to grab a losing bonus point from a bruising encounter and fell to their first defeat of the campaign.
Three other players were shown yellow cards - Sale's Jonathan Mills and Harlequins' front-row pair of Owen Jones and Kyle Sinckler - with Seymour crossing for Sale's only try of the match while Jones was off the field.
The game was held up for several minutes in the early stages while Sharks back-row TJ Ioane was treated for a head injury and eventually carried off on a stretcher, while Beaumont was also forced off in the aftermath of the dreadful Luamanu tackle which left visitors Quins a player short for the final nine minutes.
Quins and England prop Joe Marler was another injury casualty, lasting less than 20 minutes.
Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond:
"I thought Dan Mugford had an outstanding game, moving up a level. Young Paolo Odogwu on the wing also showed some flashes of potential.
"We managed to get the win and deny them the bonus point. We learned last year how important that was if you want to get in the top four.
"Dan played really well last week if I'm honest. He missed a kick under great pressure to win us the game, but we've encouraged him all week.
"He didn't lose us the game, but that kick cost us the game. But today it was five from five, and his distribution was good."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston:
"We managed, in a 10 or 15-minute period, to lose all the momentum we had built at the end of the first half by allowing them three successive penalties which led to them scoring from a maul and getting 16-7 ahead.
"That becomes very problematic, and what made it worse was we had a player in the bin as well.
"From that moment on, we barely had a period of time with 15 players on the park. We effectively played the last 32 minutes with a man down, and that's pretty difficult."
