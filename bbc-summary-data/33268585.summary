Fatigued kayaker rescued after 30 hours at sea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fatigued kayaker has been rescued off the Cornish coast after being at sea for 30 hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lifeboat crew was launched just after midnight after the German man alerted the coastguard.
He told them he was "unsure how to reach Padstow harbour" on his journey from Ireland to Land's End. Shortly afterwards he was towed two miles into the harbour.
It is understood the man did not suffer any serious injuries.
Michael England, RNLI Deputy Second Coxswain Mechanic said: "It was a beautifully calm and flat night, with very light winds, the chap had been at sea for 30 hours and was extremely tired.
"Although he was also equipped with an outboard engine, he'd used the fuel and under sail it would have been a long passage into Padstow.
"Unfamiliar with the area, he was also unsure of the best way into the harbour."
