A machete was pointed at Fatima Bibi's abdomen and her daughter had the knife held to her throat during the attack in Oldham, Greater Manchester.
Mrs Bibi is going into hospital on Wednesday to have her baby.
Her three other children were at home during the raid. She said it had left her terrified and unable to sleep.
Mrs Bibi said the moment of the attack was "frozen in my mind".
Her daughter had been "crying and screaming" at night since the attack on Friday, she said.
Police have released CCTV images of the men, who escaped with a mobile phone.
Det Insp Kenny Blain, from Greater Manchester Police, said it was "beyond comprehension" to hold a knife to the throat of a six-year-old child.
"This was an atrocious attack on an innocent family in their own home," he said.
"The stress this would have caused [Mrs Bibi] could have potentially threatened the life of her unborn child," he said.
The men stormed in when one of Mrs Bibi's sons, aged eight, opened the door to someone knocking.
Mrs Bibi said she heard screaming and could see a masked man holding her young daughter by the neck, with a machete in his hand, dragging her upstairs.
She said one of the robbers then put the knife on her stomach and said: "Pregnant lady, I'm going to kill you.
"Tell me quickly. Where's your safe, where's your money?"
They escaped with an iPhone.
Mrs Bibi asked anyone with information to come forward.
"Nobody should be allowed to do that to kids in our society.
"Today I'm the victim, tomorrow it might be someone else," she said.
Police described one of the men as white, over 6ft (1.8m) tall, of heavy build, wearing a black wool balaclava, dark baseball cap, a black, quilted jacket with no sleeves and a dark top and dark blue jeans.
The other man was described as white, 5ft 5in (1.65m) tall and aged about 25 with light eyes, an oval shaped face, short ginger beard and of medium build. He was wearing a black wool hat with the hood of his red jumper over the hat, and a black, sleeveless, quilted coat and brown chinos.
Both men were said to have local accents.
