[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 2-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fabio Saraiva's 11th goal of the season saw Woking end a run of two straight defeats with a win over Solihull Moors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woking went ahead just three minutes into the game when defender Terrell Thomas headed home his first goal of the season from close range following a corner from the right.
Kristian Green prevented Woking from doubling their lead five minutes before the break when he cleared off the line following another corner.
Shepherd Murombedzi then headed straight at Michael Poke from Omari Sterling's cross on the stroke of half-time as Solihull threatened.
And Solihull almost pulled level nine minutes after the break when George Carline met Sterling's corner but his effort was hacked off the line.
The goal Solihull deserved came after 59 minutes when Sterling's shot was not held by Poke and Murombedzi turned the rebound into the net.
That equaliser brought Woking to life and Nathan Baxter tipped over Gozie Ugwu's shot before they went back ahead when Saraiva slotted home Ugwu's cross from the right.
The lively Ugwu then hit the crossbar late on from an acute angle.
