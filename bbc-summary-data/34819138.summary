One Direction, actress Dame Helen Mirren and Sherlock actor Martin Freeman were among the host of stars featured in Friday's fund-raising show.
Dermot O'Leary hosted this year's fundraiser, replacing Sir Terry Wogan after the 77-year-old pulled out for "health reasons".
BBC Children in Need tweeted that the total raised was a "record-breaker".
The show was also presented by Tess Daly, Fearne Cotton, Saturdays star Rochelle Humes and BBC Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.
Sir Terry pulled out for the first time since the annual TV event's launch in 1980.
The veteran TV presenter is having a procedure on his back and is understood to have withdrawn in line with doctors' advice.
O'Leary said: "Thank you so, so much.
"To Terry, I hope you're feeling better, I hope we get to enjoy a drop of the pure very soon and we're all doing you justice here."
This year a special Star Wars sketch with characters C3PO and R2-D2 was featured.
There were also performances by Selena Gomez, Years and Years, Ellie Goulding and a special appeal by Sir Tom Jones.
