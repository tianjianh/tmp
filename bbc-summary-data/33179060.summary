Maggoty apples and Hamlet: HK's passionate debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamlet, King Solomon and maggoty apples were all invoked as Hong Kong lawmakers made emotional speeches debating a controversial political reform package, which was eventually rejected.

The debate pitted those who labelled the reform package as "fake democracy" against the pro-Beijing government.
All 70 lawmakers were given 15 minutes to speak and they employed every rhetorical art to add force to their points, as the BBC's Juliana Liu reports from the scene.
The Hong Kong democracy debate explained
Alan Leong, a member of the Civic Party that is part of the Pan-democrats quoted one of the most famous Shakespearean lines, just so nobody would be in any doubt as to the drama that was set to unfold.
"We are facing a "to be nor not to be" situation. Should we endure humiliation by accepting this fate? Or should we just veto it?"
Elizabeth Quat, a member of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong issued a grave warning.
"If this [package] is vetoed today, then what next? Will there be another Occupy? Or will more bombs or weapons be made to create a bloody revolt?"
Ronny Tong from the Civic party compared the situation to the biblical tale of King Solomon who was asked for judgement by two women both claiming to be the mother of a child.
When he asked for the baby to be cut in half and divided between the two, one woman said the baby should be divided - but the other begged for the child to be left unharmed and was so declared the child's true mother. It was a tale that left an impression on Mr Tong.
"So what if either the government or the pan-democrats each gain the support of half of society? Is that enough to say the [political reform] process is a success? Is that enough to make you happy? I think, if you are happy with the support of just half of society, you are not a real mother."
Wong Kwok-hing, a Beijing loyalist, was bald and brutal in his condemnation of the democratic camp.
"Pan-democrats, how you lie! You have no morals! You have no political principles! You have no courage! You lie to voters and today you will rob five million people of their voting rights and ballot rights."
"You're the killer of universal suffrage! You will stink for 10,000 years!"
Claudia Mo, a Pan-democrat said voting for the proposal is "like pocketing a maggoty apple".
"This motion, this resolution is a fraud," she said. "This bill makes nonsense of the word democracy. It is a very bogus version of universal suffrage."
