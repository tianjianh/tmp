Aberdeen path work should resume quickly, report says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repairs to an Aberdeen footpath which were halted amid a row over who owned the land should resume as soon as possible, according to officials.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Repairs to the Wellington Brae path, costing about Â£200,000, were suspended for an investigation.
The land belongs to the father of former councillor Willie Young.
Councillors will be asked on Wednesday to agree steps for work to resume. An investigation report is not due to be completed until September.
Aberdeen City Council admitted a "serious failing" in April after the repairs were ordered without proper approval.
Mr Young, the city's former finance convener, lost his seat at the local government elections.
The project was to have been fully funded by cycling charity Sustrans.
It awarded just over Â£21,000 for preliminary work, with the full funding to be paid when the work was completed.
Councillors will be told a report will not be completed until September, and in the meantime they are being asked to agree steps for work to resume on the path, which officials say is currently a health and safety risk.
