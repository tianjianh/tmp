Andy Webster, from Warrington, Cheshire, broke the news of his son Isaac Webster's death on Friday.
He said on his Facebook page: "Our little adventure boy sadly passed away this morning at 10.15 UK time."
The Foreign Office said it was "supporting the family of a British child who sadly died in Hurghada".
How the accident in the Red Sea resort happened is not yet known.
A crowdfunding page has been set up by Sankey Strikers Football Club, where his brother plays, to help raise funds to bring Isaac's body home and cover funeral costs.
It has so far raised more than Â£8,500.
The club said it was "devastated to lose such a lively, loving and fun member of our family".
The Foreign Office said it was liaising with the Egyptian authorities.
