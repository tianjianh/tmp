Alan Millar expected the usual single yolks as part of his ham, egg and chips meal when he ordered his lunch at The Gloucester Old Spot pub.
But pub owner Amy Devenish said her customer was "so excited" at what was placed before him.
Mr Millar shared his delight by buying all the staff a drink to celebrate.
Ms Devenish added: "The boys in the kitchen started frantically ringing the bell, so we went in to find out what was up.
"They said 'have a look at this, it's a triple yolker'. We couldn't believe it, we've never seen one of those before.
"I took a snap on my phone and then once the ham, egg and chips was plated up I took it out to the table.
"The old boy was so excited as he'd never seen one before."
"He was shouting over to his kids to tell them to come and have a look at it. He actually bought all the staff a drink later on."
The pictures were posted on the pub's Facebook on Sunday, attracting hundreds of likes.
The Cotswold Legbar blue eggs were from Le Chasse in Zeals, Wiltshire.
