RAF Typhoon's near-miss with Cessna in Norfolk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An RAF Typhoon was allowed by air traffic control to fly too close to a private plane, causing a near-miss, investigators have concluded.

The military jet was heading for RAF Marham in Norfolk in July when it saw a Cessna C172 and dived 200ft (60m) underneath it to avoid it.
The UK Airprox Board report said Marham allowed the Typhoon to fly "into conflict" with the C172.
It said the C172 pilot had told RAF Marham of his plans to fly.
The near-miss happened in the skies near Fakenham shortly after 11:00 BST on 31 July.
The investigation report said Marham air traffic control air had not been able to detect the Cessna on the secondary surveillance radar (SSR) system it was using that day.
When the Cessna's pilot contacted them traffic information was not passed on to the Typhoon in time for the near-miss to be avoided.
The report classified the degree of risk of a collision as A, or high.
"The incident had just stopped short of an actual collision where safety margins had been reduced to the minimum," the report said.
