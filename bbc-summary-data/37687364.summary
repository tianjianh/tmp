[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man - whom the Metropolitan Police have not named but have stressed is not an MP - was arrested on Friday. The rape is alleged to have happened in the early hours of that day.
The suspect has been bailed "pending further inquires" until a date in January, the force added.
Parliament is "working closely" with police, the House of Commons said.
"We are aware of an incident on the parliamentary estate which is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Service," a spokesman said.
"Parliament is working closely with the police on their investigation and we cannot comment further while this is ongoing."
