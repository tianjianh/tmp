Spain and Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has denied a claim reported in a Spanish newspaper that he organised a sex party with prostitutes for teammates in which a woman was made to take part against her will.

"It's all false," de Gea said.
The claims are contained in court papers in a trial against a pornography baron seen by El Diario newspaper.
A witness claims the defendant forced her and another girl into sex with two Under-21 internationals in 2012.
"I am the first one to be surprised by this report. I deny it, it is false and nothing more, it is a lie and false," de Gea told a press conference at Spain's Euro 2016 training base.
"It is false what is coming out in the press and it will be in the hands of my lawyers," he added.
The claims are part of a continuing case against pornographer Ignacio Allende FernÃ¡ndez, known as Torbe, who is accused of being the head of a prostitution network that abused Spanish and foreign women, some of them underage.
Torbe was remanded in custody in April charged with offences including sex attacks, sexual exploitation and child pornography.
The protected witness, who claims she was forced into the prostitution ring, said she was taken to a Madrid hotel and introduced to another girl and two footballers.
Once in a room with the other girl, the witness - known in police interview papers as TP3 - said that she was told by Torbe that she had to comply with the sexual demands of the two Under-21 internationals.
When she said she did not wish to take part, she claimed to police that Torbe "grabbed her forcefully by the arm".
The witness said she had told Torbe in front of the footballers that she did not want to take part in the sexual encounter, El Diario reported.
El Diario claimed the players said they did not want any recordings of the encounter to be made in case their playing careers were affected.
The witness claimed the encounter had been arranged by de Gea, according to the police report published by El Diario.
