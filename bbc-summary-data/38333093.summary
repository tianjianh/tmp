The track, recorded by a group of music stars and MPs, is a cover of the Rolling Stones classic, You Can't Always Get What You Want.
Sales of the single will raise money for a charity set up Mrs Cox's name.
An MP revealed the veteran rockers were foregoing payment during a House of Commons debate.
Pete Wishart, the SNP's Commons leader and keyboard player in parliamentary rock band MP4, said:  "I'm sure the Leader of the House would also like to join me in thanking Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for waiving their royalties... ensuring that even more money goes to the Jo Cox Foundation."
The recording, to be released on Friday, features Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson, Cockney Rebel's Steve Harley, KT Tunstall and David Gray.
Bookmakers William Hill announced it would donate any money staked on the single reaching the Christmas number one slot to charity.
The chancellor has already announced plans to drop VAT on sales of the single..
