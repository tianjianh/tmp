[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara made 18 in his final international innings before retirement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old, the fifth highest Test run-scorer in history, was given a guard of honour by India's fielders in the second Test in Colombo.
He hit three fours before edging Ravichandran Ashwin to gully, leaving Sri Lanka 33-2 in pursuit of 413.
Sangakkara ends his 134-Test career with 12,400 runs at an average of 57.40, with 38 centuries.
The left-hander also played 404 one-day internationals and 56 Twenty20 internationals and also appeared in English county cricket for Warwickshire, Durham and Surrey, who he joined on a two-year contract in January.
After breaking into the Sri Lanka side in 2000 as a wicketkeeper-batsman, he eventually relinquished the wicketkeeping gloves in Test cricket in 2008. He gave the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord's in 2011.
Sri Lanka ended day four at the P Sara Oval on 72-2, with captain Angelo Mathews unbeaten on 23.
England coach Trevor Bayliss, former coach of Sri Lanka, on BBC Test Match Special: "He's one of the legends of the game. He's one of those local heroes that a lot of people in Sri Lanka look up to, and he's been a great role model. He's had so many great innings over a period of time. The poise and time that he's got at the crease has been one of his hallmarks."
Ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on BBC Test Match Special: "Sangakkara has been a beautiful player; a stylish, excellent batsman. Nearly all the great players have footwork and he has it. And I don't think there's any doubt he could carry on for two or three years. But you get tired mentally."
