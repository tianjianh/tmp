Gillingham 0-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Junior Morias produced a brilliant 90th-minute winner as Peterborough kept their faint play-off hopes alive with victory at struggling Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was Posh's first win in six games but the Gills have edged closer to the relegation zone, with three points separating them and 21st-placed Port Vale
The only incident of a disappointing first half came after 38 minutes as referee Brendan Malone had to go off with an injury, with linesman Chris Wade taking up the whistle.
The match finally started to open up after the break as Gills substitute Harry Cornick shot wide from 25 yards before Marcus Maddison's ambitious free-kick dipped just over at the other end.
Gills debutant Tomas Holy then produced an excellent save as he tipped over a long-range effort by Peterborough captain Chris Forrester.
Then came a late twist as Morias let fly from 25 yards and Holy had no chance as the ball flew past him into the net.
It was the second week running that Morias struck from the bench, with the win keeping Posh within eight points of the top six.
