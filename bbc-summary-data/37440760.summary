Liverpool City Council confirmed it is holding discussions with two parties to manage St Luke's Church, which was severely damaged in a 1941 air raid.
It is understood the organisations behind the proposals are based in the city, following speculation that a company in Manchester was involved.
The council, which will retain freehold of the site, said it "wanted to achieve the best possible outcome".
"Once these discussions have concluded and an agreement has been reached, a recommendation will go to the Cabinet for a decision to be made," a spokesman said.
The Grade II* listed building, on the corner of Leece Street and Berry Street, has remained roofless since it was damaged in an air raid.
A survey found St Luke's Church needed to be made safe following damage caused by winter storms in 2015.
Full restoration work valued at Â£500,000 includes work to the tower, masonry, low-level stonework, a roof to be put on to the church tower and decorative stonework.
