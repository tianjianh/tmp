The Jets begin their 50-over campaign with a trip to Northants on Saturday, having won the trophy against Warwickshire at Lord's last September.
It was the second success at the famous old ground for Durham, who won the Friends Provident Trophy in 2007.
"We've a similar squad, if we can build momentum we'll be unstoppable," Stoneman told BBC Look North.
Durham have struggled with their batting in the four-day game. They have picked up just 19 batting bonus points from 11 County Championship matches - the third lowest total in Division One.
"We haven't been on fire with the bat," Stoneman added.
"Hopefully once we get settled into the One-Day Cup, we can put some big scores on the board and look to defend that with the ball.
"It's something that has worked well for us in the past and we hope we will be doing that again this year."

Success in the competition last year was particularly special for veteran Paul Collingwood who, since retiring from England duty in 2013, has been involved in winning a County Championship title and one-day silverware.
The 39-year-old - who captained England to victory in the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup - said that Durham's One-Day Cup success is among his greatest achievements.
"It was certainly right up there," he said.
"Just getting to a Lord's final and all the atmosphere and occasion, it was great to be back."
Reaching the final again is the target for Collingwood.
"We've got the skill levels, and the team has a lot of all-rounders and we can adapt to situations," he added.

One of the stars of Durham's cup run last year was Australian all-rounder John Hastings, but he missed the final because he was committed to playing for Chennai Super Kings in the T20 Champions League.
Hastings, 29, rejoined Jon Lewis' side for the 2015 season and can play in the final of they make it this time.
"I was very proud of the way the lads went about it last year," he said. "It was a tight and tough tussle with overhead conditions and rain about but the boys got the job done.
"I did ask my franchise if I could do it, but they declined.
"I hope that this year we can get there. I will be available for the final this year so I hope we can do it."
