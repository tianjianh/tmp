Peter Eyre, 43, Anthony Eyre, 21, both of Sandiacre, and Simon Eyre, 24, from Long Eaton, were remanded in custody by magistrates in Chesterfield.
They are due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 10 July.
The three men spoke only to confirm their names, ages and addresses during the three-minute hearing.
The victims died from the effects of smoke inhalation, police said.
Two men, aged 18 and 17, who were also inside the premises, were rescued by neighbours and treated for smoke inhalation.
Police are yet to confirm what caused the fire.
A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail.
