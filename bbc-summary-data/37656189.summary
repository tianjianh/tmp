Expand Heathrow Airport for global trade says Osborne

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain must expand Heathrow, a "great airport" which connects the UK to global trade, George Osborne has said.

The economic case is "overwhelming" and the airport connects to the Northern Powerhouse, the former chancellor said.
Gatwick expansion could be considered, but it must not be at the expense of the west London airport, he tweeted.
A decision on which London airport should build a new runway is thought to be imminent, after years of argument and a delay because of the Brexit vote.
Mr Osborne, who is MP for Tatton in Cheshire, said in a series of tweets:
"Time for a decision on airports & go for Heathrow. Economic case overwhelming; connects Northern Powerhouse; ensures Britain is open to world.
"If we want Britain to be outward-looking, free-trading & global, we must expand the great airport that connects us to that world & that trade.
"We can consider Gatwick expansion. But not at the expense of Heathrow - and not in parallel or else, in practice, nothing will get built.
The former chancellor was replaced with Philip Hammond in July by incoming Prime Minister Theresa May in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said a decision over where to site a new runway in the south east of England will be taken "shortly".
Three plans have been in contention - a third runway at Heathrow; a new runway at Gatwick; and an extension to one of Heathrow's existing runways.
Heathrow looked close to being expanded in July 2015 after an official commission recommended it.
But the decision was delayed in December for further environmental studies. It was again put back in June after the EU referendum vote. A decision is expected this month.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Justine Greening are among a number of prominent opponents of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet.
