Leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to rescue a point as Hoffenheim continued their unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season.

It required a slice of fortune for the hosts to equalise, Steven Zuber sending the ball into his own net attempting to clear Douglas Costa's cutback.

Leipzig, promoted to the top tier at the end of last season, have 21 points from nine games.
