Despite being blighted by injuries, the 33-year-old, who made his international debut in 2005, scored 34 tries in 71 Tests for the Wallabies.
His 14 tries across three World Cups is a tally bettered by only Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana, who both scored 15.
Writing on Twitter, he said: "I've been very lucky to have had the experiences I've had in our great game."
Mitchell played more than 100 times in Super Rugby - for Queensland Reds, Western Force and New South Wales Waratahs - before moving to French side Toulon in 2013.
Having won back-to-back European Cups, he returned to the Australia team in July 2015 and helped them reach the World Cup final, where they lost to New Zealand.
He played only once more for his country, coming off the bench in a Rugby Championship match against South Africa last September.
