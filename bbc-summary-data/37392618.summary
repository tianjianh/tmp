[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 1-4 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Colclough scored a hat-trick as MK Dons ran out convincing 4-1 winners at Fleetwood in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan winger Colclough gave the Dons a ninth-minute lead when his cross from the left wrong-footed Fleetwood goalkeeper Chris Neal and slipped into the bottom corner.
Nathan Pond nearly levelled for the hosts before the break, heading David Ball's corner on to the top of the crossbar.
Fleetwood looked to be gathering momentum as the first half came to a close but their purple patch did not continue after the interval. Neal gave away an indirect free-kick inside his own box when he handled a back pass before redeeming himself with a fine save to deny Nicky Maynard.
The visitors grabbed their second in the 61st minute when Dean Bowditch converted from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the area by Jimmy Ryan.
Colclough added a third shortly after, latching on to keeper David Martin's punt forward and firing low inside Neal's near post.
Dons keeper Martin was then at fault as Bobby Grant's speculative effort from 20 yards pulled one back for the hosts with 20 minutes to play.
Colclough competed his hat-trick from the penalty spot in added time after George Baldock was upended inside the Fleetwood box.
