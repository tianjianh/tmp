Pyke, 19, is a member of Huddersfield's Under-21 team and is yet to make a first team appearance for the Championship club.
"He's got pace, he's direct and he's a powerful runner," Wrexham manager Dean Keates said.
"He's on the verge of the first team at Huddersfield so it's a case of him coming here to get experience."
