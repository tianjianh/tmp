Aston Villa: Former FA man Bevington to help relegation-threatened side

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa are working with former Football Association executive Adrian Bevington as they continue to rebuild following a disastrous season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bevington has been advising Wales in the run-up to Euro 2016 as well as Championship side Nottingham Forest.
Villa board member David Bernstein said: "I'm convinced his experience, contacts and understanding of football will be a tremendous asset."
The Midlands side are 12 points from safety with seven games remaining.
Middlesbrough fan Bevington was managing director of Club England during his 17-year stint at the FA.
Villa have recently added former Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and club legend Brian Little to their new-look football board, which includes former FA chairman Bernstein.
Chief executive Tom Fox and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt have both left the club, while Remi Garde's future as manager remains uncertain.
