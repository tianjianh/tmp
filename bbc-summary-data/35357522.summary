'Significant regional variations' in ambulance response times

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Significant regional variations" in ambulance response times have been discovered by a Welsh Assembly committee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Welsh Ambulance Service has a target of responding to 65% of "red" life-threatening calls within eight minutes.
In October, the service responded to 68.7% of red calls within this time.
But while Betsi Cadwaladr health board responded to 73.4% of red calls within eight minutes, Hywel Dda missed the target, responding to just 57.6%
The committee said the regional variations must be addressed "as a matter of priority".
It also found progress had been made in some areas, including senior leadership and more effective deployment of ambulances.
Chair of the committee, David Rees AM, said:  "The committee would like to see firm assurances from the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust, stakeholders and the Welsh government that the progress made to date is sufficiently embedded to ensure lasting change and improvement."
