Ebbw Vale schoolboy Page and 18-year old Tyler Rees from Llanelli have been invited to the qualifying rounds at Ponds Forge in Sheffield in April.
Both received wildcards to compete at last month's Welsh Open in Cardiff with Page reaching the last 32 stage.
"We look forward to welcoming Jackson to Sheffield," said World Snooker's (WPBSA) chairman Jason Ferguson.
"Jackson is an example of a player who has taken the opportunity presented to him with both hands already in 2017.
"Having qualified through the WPBSA's development work with national governing bodies and during the Welsh Open last month he won two matches against current professionals and gained enormous exposure in the media.
"Last week he became the 2017 European U-18 champion in Cyprus and he continues to battle it out in the European Championships to try and earn that golden ticket to the World Snooker Tour.
"We look forward to welcoming him and the other successful qualifiers to Sheffield next month and seeing who will be able to take full advantage of the opportunity and perhaps even make it all the way to the Crucible."
