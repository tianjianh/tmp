More bones have been found near a motorway slip road where a man's skull was discovered last month, police said.

The eastbound exit at junction 4 of the M54 at Shifnal, Shropshire, remains closed while forensic teams continue to search for clues to the man's identity.
Police said the bones were human and were believed to be from the same skeleton as the skull found by maintenance workers on 20 August.
Tests determined the remains had been at the scene for at least two years.
A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive as to how the man died.
The latest discoveries were unearthed close to the surface and near where the previous remains were found, a spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said.
It will not be known if all findings represent a complete skeleton until the pathologists have completed their inquiries, she added.
Searches are expected to come to an end on Thursday evening and the M54 slip road will remain closed for unrelated road works, she said.
