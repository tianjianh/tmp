[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull was one of 52 players who had to finish round one of the ANA Inspiration at Rancho Mirage on Friday after high winds felled trees on the course.
She completed a 68 but then bogeyed two of her last four second-round holes.
America's Lexi Thompson leads at eight under par after a five-under 67 second round.
Hull, 21, the world number 16 who was runner-up to Lydia Ko in this event last year, reached six under but dropped shots at the par-four 15th and the closing par-five 18th.
Compatriot Mel Reid, who had a mixed opening round of 72 including three birdies and a double bogey, is level-par at the halfway stage after another 72.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew missed the cut after a 72 containing an eagle and a double bogey kept her at three over, while England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff also missed out after she carded a seven-over-par 79 to finish eight over.
