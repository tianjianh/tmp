And the wedding of one of the world's most famous bachelors, George Clooney, and Amal Alamuddin was no exception.
Hoards of Hollywood royalty descended on Venice in Italy to attend the ceremony.
There was also the typical celebrity circus with journalists in every crevice and locals trying to catch a glimpse.

It's a day Liverpool's Conor McDonnell won't forget - he was invited to be their official photographer.

Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wed in 2006 in the floodlit Odescalchi castle near Rome in 2006.
The centre of the small town of Bracciano was sealed off for the wedding and extra police were brought in to keep snooping paparazzi at bay.
The marriage didn't last and the couple divorced in 2012.
Odescalchi castle was also the venue for the wedding of Bernie Ecclestone's daughter Petra.
