Neilson Smith, 41, of Tonyrefail, Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said his accuser "came on to him" after he took her home from a Cardiff nightclub in December.
He denied then raping the woman in her own bed.
On Monday, a jury found Mr Smith not guilty of rape following a week-long trial at Cardiff Crown Court.
The court previously heard Mr Smith, a teacher at Willows High School, in Tremorfa, met the drunken woman at Tiger Tiger before taking her home in a taxi.
The victim said she was "too drunk" to agree to sex with Mr Smith, and she remembered nothing of the evening until waking to find him on top of her.
"I thought he was old enough to be my father and tried to push him off," she said.
But Mr Smith denied the allegations - saying he had taken her home in a taxi because he was "concerned for her wellbeing" and insisting their sexual contact was consensual.
He said he thought the woman was merely "tipsy" and said, despite her slurred speech, she was able to speak in full sentences.
"She was certainly not comatose," Mr Smith said.
He said she touched him and, "after a bit of a fumble", they engaged in sexual activity for a few minutes before he found he was unable to perform.
After the not guilty verdict, Mr Smith was in tears as Judge Patrick Curran told him he was discharged from the dock.
