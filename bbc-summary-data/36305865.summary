Williams: Bradley Davies and Alun Wyn Jones can be best in Europe

Former Wales captain Martyn Williams says a partnership between Alun Wyn Jones and Bradley Davies could be the best in Europe.

The 29-year-old Davies left Premiership side Wasps to join Ospreys next season on a national dual contract (NDC).
"It's a good sign that national dual contracts with the regions are starting to work," Williams told BBC Wales.
"There's a few other gems that we'd like to get back, like Leigh Halfpenny but everybody is different."
Williams feels Davies will add a new dimension to the region..
"He's got over 50 caps as a Welsh international, he's dynamic, he's a big ball carrier, and that pairing next year of him and Alun Wyn Jones, you won't get much better than that throughout Europe, let alone in Wales," Williams said.
The former Cardiff Blues lock joined Wasps in 2014 but signed a deal to keep him with Ospreys through until the 2019 World Cup.
"It's fantastic news for the Ospreys. They had a disappointing season this year in the Pro12, failing to get into the Champions Cup next year but Bradley is top quality," Williams added.
"Most players when they go away and play in a different league come back better for it and as a person as well.
"To make the move to Wasps I'm sure has helped his game and helped him individually but he feels the time is right for him and his family to come back to Wales."
Davies became the ninth player to sign an NDC with Ospreys and Williams believes it heralds a new era for Welsh rugby.
"He will be a huge addition and he is an experienced senior player now so it's great news," he said.
"That along with the likes of Jonathan Davies coming back to the Scarlets as well, they seem to be stemming that tide of players leaving."
