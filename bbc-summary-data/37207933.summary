The 24-year-old shot a three-under 69 in round three and is level with South Korea's Sei Young Kim. Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn leads on 17 under.
Meadow's career-best result came at the 2014 US Open, where she finished third.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew is tied 41st on five under, with England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff one shot further back.
Three successive birdies from the 15th maintained Meadow's hopes of a high finish as recent British Open winner Jutanugarn gave the other contenders hope by bogeying two of her final three holes.
County Antrim's Meadow is currently 152nd in the 2016 LPGA rankings with only the top 125 earning cards for 2017.
