[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England strengthened their grip on World Cup qualifying Group F with a clinical 3-0 victory over Scotland at Wembley.

BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty assesses the victors' display, while former Scotland striker Steve Thompson gives his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan's team.
A quiet night but did what he had to do effectively.
Has a licence to cause damage in attack and did so with fierce cross for Daniel Sturridge's goal.
Decent evening despite picking up a booking. Scored England's third headed goal from a corner to kill off Scotland.
Sloppy, too risky and conceded possession in the first half. Vital block from Snodgrass early in the second.
Excellent all-round performance and always willing to lend weight in attack. Provided a fine cross for Adam Lallana's goal.
Disappointing. Unable to exert his influence or act as the base in midfield.
Energetic and improved as the game went on, with Scotland fading in the middle of the park.
Good corner for Gary Cahill's goal did not really sparkle otherwise.
Mixed bag. Subjected to physical attention from the Scots, underlining his threat, but missed an incredible second-half sitter.
England's best performer. Good control, vision and another important England goal, with a very well taken header.
A performance that justified Gareth Southgate's faith with a brilliant instinctive header to break the deadlock.
Did nothing of note.
No chance with goals and had little else to do other than pick the ball out of his net.
A surprise choice but the Derby winger defended well considering he wasn't in his natural position.
Scotland's best player on the night after a long absence from the international scene. Offered a real threat going forward and worked tirelessly.
Played better than in Slovakia and unlucky at first goal after making a good block. Wasted a great chance to equalise, failing to hit the target from a free header.
Given a rare start and did well to keep England's danger men quiet for large periods.
The captain's desire and work rate are never in question but he was too often loose in possession.
Back from his short-lived international retirement but for how long? The Celtic captain gave the midfield energy and aggression as expected.
Largely ineffectual. Didn't get on the ball enough to make a positive impact. Again, a surprise inclusion given his lack of game time at West Brom.
Missed a glorious opportunity to level the game early in the second half, dragging a shot wide from near the penalty spot. Another player guilty of giving the ball away too often.
Provided some threatening set-pieces. Really should have scored not long after James Forrest's miss when he had a good sight at goal.
Led the line well with positive energy in the first half. However, made a poor decision not to play in Robert Snodgrass on a good counter-attack. Tired in the second half as Scotland meekly surrendered.
The game was over when he came on, very difficult to make an impression.
On for the injured Anya. Not given much to do since England were content to keep the ball and didn't pose much of a threat.
Too late to make an impact.
