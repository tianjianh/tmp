What Wakefield told us about #GE2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So we've spent a week trekking around the windy town of Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Why?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Well, because it's somewhere the election result is too close to call - what's known as a marginal seat.
We're heading to other marginals across the UK in the next few weeks to find out what people there care about as well.
These are places where the result will go a long way in deciding who becomes prime minister on 7 May.
But first stop: Wakefield.
Jaime's been telling us that, for him, getting around the place is a real problem and something he wants improved.
"I can't afford car insurance because it's too expensive for young people to get," he tells us.
He lives two miles from his nearest train station so Jaime relies on local buses to get into college on time.
"It takes me nearly two hours just to get there."
"I set off at half past six in the morning and if I miss that one there's not another one until quarter past seven so that means I'll be late for my course."
Jaime wants more money to be spent on improving transport links around Wakefield because it's so important for him to get into college on time.
"You only get so many warnings. If you're late more than three times you get kicked off your course. It's hard because you can't do anything about it."
Jaime's not alone; 19-year-old volunteer security guard Jarren says he'll vote for whoever can get public transport to turn up on time.
He says because the buses are so unpredictable he's "missed chances to get better opportunities in life".
"A couple of training programmes," he explains. "I didn't really need them but it's frustrating because it was a chance to better myself."
You can find all the different parties' policies on transport here.
Wakefield has been a Labour seat for more than 80 years (since 1932 to be exact).
But in the 2010 election they only won here by 1,600 or so votes. The Conservatives had this as one of their key target seats last time around.
It means that Labour hope their policies at this election will reinvigorate support for them here and stop the Tories from making further gains.
One of those is their proposal to ban some types of zero hours contracts.
Richard told us about his experiences of life on a zero hours contract.
"It's hard to look at the positives when you're hungry and in the dark."
So he's not a fan, but not everyone agrees with him.
The Conservatives are saying Labour's idea is a threat to jobs, and the Lib Dems say they would ban the clauses in these types of contracts that stop people looking for other work.

For 19-year-old Ash, sorting out parts of the benefits system should be the main priority for politicians.
"Worse thing was walking three miles to the job centre for 10 minutes then walking back again," he says.
He thinks better support should be offered to people looking for work because the courses he was sent on were "boring". He says they didn't help him finally get a job.
Ash also worries that benefits like Jobseekers' Allowance could be cut by the next government.
"I only just got through with the amount of money I was getting [at the time].
"If they're going to cut it I think people will struggle."
You know the drill by now. Here's what the parties are saying about welfare.
