Horton Road Shed Group wants to build the museum in tribute to the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company.
Opening in 1860, the firm's train carriages were exported around the world until 1960s.
The group is aiming to buy a derelict piece of land off Horton Road, where the firm once stood.
Plans are at a very early stage, but it is hoped fundraising will get project off the ground.
Group member Aaron Matthews said: "It's part of history that's dying out in Gloucester. Not many people know about the railways here.
"Our plans are to rebuild some of the buildings and put extra buildings in to display carriages and wagons, pretty much everything to do with the company."
In its heyday, the Gloucester railway firm built train carriages including those for the Hammersmith and City line in London, and the first London Underground trains.
The factory also built 765 Churchill Tanks used in World War Two.
Their vehicles were also exported to Toronto, Canada and Bolivia, South America.
