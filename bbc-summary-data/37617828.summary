[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old, from Penyrheol, was fined Â£90 for a public order offence after police received reports of a man taking part in the "creepy clown" fad outside St Cenydd Comprehensive School.
Gwent Police said it would go on his criminal record.
Clown sightings have been reported across Wales.
It has prompted police forces to warn people they could be arrested for scaring others.
Chf Insp Paul Staniforth said: "Gwent Police will not tolerate such behaviour and anyone seeking to cause distress and potential harm to anyone will be dealt with.
"I hope this result sends a strong message to anyone thinking about taking part in this craze, that their five minutes of what they may think is fun really isn't worth it."
