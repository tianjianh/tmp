Paul Caddis: Birmingham City defender told to find new club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham defender Paul Caddis has been told he is free to find a new club after more than four years with Blues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Championship side are willing to allow the Scotland international to leave on a free transfer, but they are also willing to consider a loan move.
The 28-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the season, joined Blues from Swindon in August 2012.
He has since played in 159 games for the club, but has been limited to just one appearance this season.
"We have had a very good chat," boss Gianfranco Zola told BBC Sport. "I've told him very clearly that I don't mind if he wants to stay.
"He has players in front of him in his position, but I've told him that If you want to stay and fight and you deserve to play, then you will play."
Caddis is a player whose name is imprinted in Birmingham footballing folklore, having scored the late goal at Bolton that kept Blues in the Championship on the final day of the season, in May 2014.
