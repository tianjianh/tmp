Torquing Group was criticised for a lack of communication over the Zano after the project folded last week.
An apology has been issued along with the new information.
The collapse of Zano caused embarrassment for Kickstarter when many disappointed backers questioned whether they would get their money back.
In the new update, which was published to the project's Kickstarter page, the firm detailed how its funding had been apportioned across the project.
The four largest areas to which more than £2.3m in donations had been distributed as follows:
Developing improvements to the Zano prototype had been one significant example of expenditure, the company said.
"Ultimately these upgrades coupled with delays caused by the creation of a bespoke and automatic testing rig had significant financial and timeline impacts upon the project," the statement added.
The firm also reiterated its intention to "co-operate fully" with Trading Standards within Pembrokeshire County Council.
In a closing comment, Torquing added an additional apology: "We would like to make a sincere apology for the understandable disappointment felt by all of those that have supported the project."
The BBC had also learned that Kickstarter had contacted Zano backers following the announcement of Zano's collapse last week.
"Like you, we're extremely frustrated by what's happened with this project," the message said.
It added that Kickstarter had asked Torquing to provide a more detailed update to backers by November 30 - or Kickstarter would pursue an inquiry into the Zano project.
