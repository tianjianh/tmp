The 37-year-old will remain available for first-team selection, but will coach the League Two club's Under-23 squad alongside Dean Selvey.
"First and foremost I'm coming back as a player, but to be offered the Under-23s coaching role as well is a bonus," he told the club website.
Nelson made 46 appearances during the 2016-17 campaign, scoring once.
