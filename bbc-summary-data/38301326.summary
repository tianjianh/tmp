[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said his position on immigration is closer to that of Plaid Cymru than that of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

He told the Senedd there was "merit" in Plaid leader Leanne Wood's call for free movement to work.
Mr Jones had accused Mr Corbyn of a "very London-centric" view which failed to acknowledge unease about immigration outside the "cosmopolitan" capital.
Ms Wood accused Mr Jones of pandering to UKIP, saying emigration was worse.
At the Labour conference in September, Mr Corbyn said Labour should focus on helping individual communities manage the pressure on public services from immigration rather than cut the numbers.
But last week the first minister told the Guardian newspaper that other parts of the UK saw immigration in a different light, adding that the issue which "loomed large" in the vote for Brexit.
Ms Wood tackled Mr Jones on his differences with the Labour Party leader during First Minister's Questions on Tuesday.
Mr Jones said immigration concerns had to be addressed without letting loose the "jackals of racism".
"I am closer to her position as leader of Plaid Cymru than any other," he said.
"She and I said something very similar last week, namely that there should be free movement for work, and free movement to look for work within a certain amount of time.
"I think there is merit in that."
Ms Wood tried to distance herself from the first minister, claiming his criticism of Mr Corbyn implied the people of Wales were opposed to immigration.
"You should be dealing with reality and not perception. You should not be dealing with the myths," she replied.
"We have a problem of emigration. Too many younger and skilled workers are leaving this country and also there is an imbalance within Wales with jobs and prosperity not spread evenly throughout this country.
"First minister, instead of pandering to UKIP, when are we going to have a real debate about the real solutions about the real migration problem here in Wales?"
