The first-round group fixtures for the Scottish League Cup have been confirmed, with the opening game taking place on the evening of 15 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Friday match, Arbroath v Dundee United, will be followed by 15 ties the following day, including Motherwell v Rangers.
There will be four further rounds of fixtures, with the eight group winners and four best runners-up progressing.
Scotland's European representatives enter in the second round.
And the tournament is a knock-out competition from round two onwards, with the final on 27 November.
At the group stage, a win is worth three points and a draw worth one but drawn matches will go straight to a penalty shoot-out, the winner of which will gain a bonus point.
