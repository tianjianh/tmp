The hashtag has been growing in popularity, prompting Bollywood celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and sports personalities like Sania Mirza and cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni to also participate.
The hashtag originated in Britain to celebrate their Armed Forces Day on 25 June but has now been appropriated in India to do the same.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation from the iconic Red Fort in Delhi on Saturday morning.
But celebrations appear to have started early on Twitter with thousands rushing to post their #saluteselfies on Twitter.
