Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have lifted a curfew in many parts of the Muslim-majority valley after more than 50 days.

Curfew was imposed after an upsurge of violence since 9 July.
The protests were sparked by the killing of a popular militant leader Burhan Wani.
More than 60 people, mostly young men, have been since killed in clashes between protesters and security forces and thousands more have been injured.
This is the worst violence seen in the region for years.
Kashmir's 'curfew schools'
Police said the 51-day-old curfew has been lifted from most parts of the valley, except in Pulwama district and some parts of Srinagar, on Monday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that "those inciting violence" in Kashmir "will be held accountable one day".
He said "if any life is lost in Kashmir it is our loss, a loss of our people and our country".
The killing of Wani, 22, sparked days of deadly violence in the valley.
India considered Wani a terrorist, but for many locals he represented the spirit and political aspirations of a new Kashmiri generation, correspondents say.
Indian officials have said he was instrumental in persuading local boys to take up arms.
The state government has said it will investigate reports of excessive police violence towards unarmed protesters.
The last bout of serious violence in the region was in the summer of 2010, when more than 100 people died in anti-India protests, which broke out after police shot dead a teenager.
Disputed Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan and has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years, sparking two wars between the countries.
Within the disputed Muslim-majority territory, some militant groups have taken up arms to fight for independence from Indian rule or a merger with Pakistan.
