He is undergoing surgery at Manchester Children's Hospital with "serious lacerations" to his ear and is said to be in a "serious but stable" condition.
A man and woman, both aged 45, have been arrested on suspicion of possessing a dog dangerously out of control, police said.
Paramedics and police were called to Adelphi Street at 16:00 BST on Monday.
The dog has been seized by Greater Manchester Police, who believe it is an American Bulldog which is not banned in the UK.
It is thought the boy was playing in a friend's garden across the road from his home when he was attacked.
Det Sgt Pete Carletti said: "Clearly this is an issue we are taking extremely seriously and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish exactly what happened here at this address."
