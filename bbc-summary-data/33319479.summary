A 27-year-old woman was walking in the town at about 03:45 on Sunday when she was forced into a wooded area and attacked.
The suspect was described as being about 20 years old, 5ft 7in tall, of very slim build with short, dark hair.
He was wearing tight-fitted jeans and a shiny black hooded top.
Police believe he may have been thrown out of a local nightclub before the attack.
Officers have appealed for anyone who was in the area at the time of the assault to come forward.
Chief Insp Kenny Simpson said: "Thankfully, offences of this nature are rare however this does not lessen the trauma experienced by a victim and family.
"Police Scotland is committed to keeping people safe and treats all reports of sexual offences with the utmost seriousness.
"Police patrols have now been stepped up in Dalkeith and surrounding area to provide a reassuring presence in the community."
