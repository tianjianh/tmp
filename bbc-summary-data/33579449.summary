The blaze broke out at the property in Darwen, Lancashire, shortly before 18:30 BST on Friday.
The teenager was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital and treated for ankle injuries before being arrested.
No-one else was inside but it is thought a dog died in the fire, Lancashire Police said.
Det Insp Nick Hodgeson said: "It was fortunate that no-one else was injured and we are working with the fire service to establish exactly how the fire came to happen."
