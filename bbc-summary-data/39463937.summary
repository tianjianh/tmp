[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts ended a run of three straight defeats as Dundee's relegation fears deepened with a sixth straight loss.

Isma Goncalves raced onto Don Cowie's pass and fired home from a tight angle via a deflection off Darren O'Dea.
The hosts might have been further ahead by half-time but Arnaud Djoum's header was superbly saved by Scott Bain.
Dundee offered little but Jack Hamilton was forced to tip Tom Hateley's free-kick onto a post and Craig Wighton dragged a golden chance wide.
But it was far too little from Paul Hartley's side, who remain in ninth place, only a point above the relegation play-off spot.
Hearts remain in fifth place, five points behind St Johnstone, but only their second win in 10 games brought some relief to under-pressure head coach Ian Cathro.
A tense atmosphere seemed assured given the two sides' recent form, but the hosts - with midfielder Prince Buaben playing at centre-back - eased any early nerves in the 13th minute.
Portuguese striker Goncalves, playing up front on his own, eluded three Dundee defenders as he collected Cowie's threaded pass and swept the ball home for his fifth goal since arriving in January.
Hearts dominated the midfield and Dundee - with 19-year-old Daniel Higgins making his debut in defence  - looked hesitant and nervy as the home side picked their passes at will.
Dundee keeper Bain made a terrific save to throw himself to his left to push away a powerful Djoum header from six yards before the interval as Hearts kept up the relentless pressure.
But the visitors came close to a leveller a minute before half-time when Hateley's free-kick was pushed onto the post by Hamilton, who reacted quickly when the initial effort appeared to deceive him.
Wighton, just on as a substitute, wasted an unbelievable chance after 63 minutes when Hearts defenders Andraz Struna and Krystian Nowak both gave the ball away, but the striker appeared to kick the ball into the ground 14 yards out to send the ball spinning well wide.
Chances were limited in a scrappy second half but Bain made stops from Alexandros Tziolis and a deflected effort from Goncalves to keep the visitors' hopes alive.
But ultimately Dundee provided little threat up front and a sixth straight defeat sends them further into the relegation mire.
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "It was a very important win.  Towards the end it was about us getting over the line, given the situation we are in. We had to defend some long balls and direct play
"So it was an important step but it is only a small step and we want to move on very quickly and take the next one.
"I'd like us to be a little bit quicker and finish our attacks and make more chances. It was a really good save from Scott Bain that could have given us that second goal and allowed us a bit more control, so we'll try to be a bit more clinical in games.
"We're suffering from a lack of positive results; there are no other issues. We are strong together and the team are fighting hard and putting in a massive effort. There were still 16,000 hearts fans here and we want that demand and we want everyone to come with us."
Dundee boss Paul Hartley: "There wasn't a lot of quality in the game, it was a bit scrappy, but we felt if we stayed in the game, we could get something.
"Craig [Wighton] had an outstanding chance in the second half and that is the difference.  When the chances come, you have got to take them and be clinical.
"I think he just choked on it a little bit, the ball got too close to his feet.  He could probably have taken another touch because he was through on goal. But that will happen to him.  He is still a young man and he will miss more chances throughout his career, so I won't be too critical.
"Our attitude was excellent, the shape was good defensively, the players are working ever so hard and they are not getting the breaks.  They don't mean to make mistakes, they are only human.  It isn't nice where we are, but keep performing like that for six games and we will be fine."
