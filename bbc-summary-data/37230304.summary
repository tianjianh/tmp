Wylfa Newydd: new public consultation for nuclear plant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The company behind the proposed Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station on Anglesey has launched its second formal public consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People have until 25 October to respond to Horizon Nuclear Power's refined plans.
The proposals will be on display at a series of exhibitions across north Wales.
The company said the project will bring significant investment to the island.
Horizon estimates Wylfa Newydd, near Cemaes, will take about nine years to build and will have an operational life of 60 years. It will employ 850 people, with recruitment to begin early in the construction phase.
The final price tag will be around Â£12bn.
People are being asked for their views on issues like proposed bus routes for the workers and the design and landscaping of buildings around the new power station.
But the public will have no influence on the technology used or the site location.
Dylan Morgan, from the People Against Wylfa-B pressure group, said it was a "mock consultation".
"They should put the serious question, 'Is this the right way to move forward in in the 21st Century?'
"The industry in Britain hasn't got an answer to the waste they've already produced over the past 50 to 60 years, let alone dealing with radioactive waste from any new stations that would be doubly hot and doubly radioactive."
Carl Devlin, programme director at Horizon, said: "This is the last scheduled consultation on the project as a whole before we submit our application for a Development Consent Order in 2017, so it's really important that people have their say on what matters to them."
Meanwhile, Horizon has called on Anglesey council to revise a specific clause which states that a proposal could be refused if it impacts development on the Welsh language. The company claimed it was too limiting and could endanger the project.
But council leader Ieuan Williams said it had "emphasised the importance of the Welsh language from the start" and that he was "very disappointed with Horizon's attitude in this case".
The final application will be submitted next year.
