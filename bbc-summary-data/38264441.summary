[SN]TITLE[SN]
Daniel Pelka murder: Stepdad Mariusz Krezolek died of heart attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man convicted of murdering his four-year-old stepson died in prison from a heart attack, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mariusz Krezolek, 36, was found in his cell at Full Sutton Prison in January where he was serving a life sentence for killing Daniel Pelka.
Daniel was starved and beaten for months before he died at his home in Coventry in 2012.
An inquest at Hull Coroners' Court concluded Krezolek died of natural causes.
Daniel's mother, Magdalena Luczak, who was also found guilty of his murder, was found hanged in her cell in July 2015.

During their trial at Birmingham Crown Court, jurors heard the boy weighed just over a stone and a half at the time of his death.
He was denied food, poisoned with salt, locked in a small room, forced to perform punishment exercises and subjected to water torture.
Judge Mrs Michael Cox said Daniel's mother and step-father had acted with "incomprehensible brutality" towards him, causing the boy "severe physical and mental suffering".
The pair were both sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail in 2013.
They failed to have their sentences reduced a year later after claiming they were "excessive".
A serious case review found chances to help Daniel had been missed, and "no professional tried sufficiently hard enough" to talk to him about his situation.
