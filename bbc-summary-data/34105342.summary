Warning of 'inequality' in diabetes care across Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is an "unacceptable inequality" in care for people with diabetes, according to charity Diabetes Scotland.

It said there were significant differences, between health boards, in the number of people getting essential check-ups aimed at avoiding serious complications.
About 276,000 people in Scotland have been diagnosed with diabetes.
The Scottish government said it had an action plan to improve care and urged people to attend appointments.
Diabetes Scotland has published its annual report charting the variations in care for people living with the condition across the country.
As well as those diagnosed with diabetes, the charity said there was a further 45,500 people estimated to be unaware they have type 2 diabetes.
There are nine key checks which should be carried out annually to help prevent the complications of diabetes - which can include blindness, limb amputations and stroke.
Diabetes UK said the number of people receiving these checks varies from health board to health board.
Its figures suggested the number receiving foot checks alone varied from 60% in Grampian, to 85% in Tayside.
Jane-Claire Judson, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: "It is indefensible that people living with diabetes are subjected to such disparities of care across Scotland.
"Whether you live in Orkney or Forth Valley should have no bearing on the level of care a person receives but what we are seeing are significant differences in the percentage of people receiving each of the nine essential care processes dependent on the health board area in which they live."
She added: "We must focus on improving diabetes care for all, reducing avoidable complications, and supporting people to live well with the condition which should include offering a range of appropriate education opportunities.
"If action is not taken now, the longer-term costs will be severe to people living with the condition, NHS Scotland and wider society."
The charity also found that people with Type 1 diabetes - which often develops during childhood - received poorer care than those with type 2 diabetes - which appears in later life and is related to obesity.
The report looked at other factors and said there were poorer health outcomes for people living in areas of deprivation.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said: "We know that the number of people living with diabetes in Scotland is increasing.
"However, this is not because we are seeing an increase in the number of new cases of diabetes picked up every year, but rather that people with diabetes are living longer with the condition.
"Latest figures show that for the first time we are seeing the percentage of people with poor glucose control decreasing and more people than ever accessing crucial eye screening and feet checks.
She added: "Our Diabetes Improvement Plan, which was published in November 2014, builds on these positive findings and sets out a programme of work to enhance services for people with diabetes, and help reduce their risk of complications."
