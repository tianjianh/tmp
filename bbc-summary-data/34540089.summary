New Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he wants to see "more bravery" from his players, as he prepares for his first match in charge.

The German, 48, was appointed last week after the sacking of Brendan Rodgers.
Liverpool, 10th in the Premier League, travel to Tottenham on Saturday.
Klopp said he wanted to see "fun in the players' eyes", adding: "This is not the time to change so much, just to turn the screws a little bit in the right ways."
The former Borussia Dortmund coach wants his players to "open our chests, run and fight and shoot" and "defend together and attack together like in your best dream".
He added: "It is not so interesting what happened a week ago or two weeks, only what the players can do now."
Klopp last week described the Liverpool job as "the biggest challenge" in world football as he seeks to revive a side that have won only one of their past eight matches.
Speaking at his pre-match news conference on Thursday, Klopp said he wanted his players to "trust themselves".
He added patience would be required as he makes changes to Liverpool's style of play.
Snapping his fingers, he said: "Some things you can change like this... but to get tuned as a team? That takes time."
Klopp also said he was not interested in people's expectations, adding: "Pressure comes from myself."
Klopp revealed striker Christian Benteke and midfielder Roberto Firmino are training again but are not ready for Saturday's 12:45 BST kick-off at White Hart Lane.
Benteke, 24, injured his hamstring against Norwich last month while Brazilian Firmino, also 24, has had a back problem.
"Benteke and Firmino are back on the pitch, but not in team training," said Klopp. "I hope in the next week they will be back in normal team training."
The German also had words of sympathy for full-back Joe Gomez.
The 18-year-old full-back will miss the rest of the season after rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament while playing for England Under-21s.
Klopp said: "What a wonderful young boy, muscles in all the right places.
"We will do everything we can so he can come back as soon as possible."
Striker Danny Ings was on Friday ruled out for the rest of the season with the same injury.
There was laughter at the news conference when a journalist from Norway held up a Liverpool shirt with 'Normal 1' printed on the back.
When asked about the attention he has received since arriving in the city, Klopp said he was surprised to find all the photographs he had posed for being published on the internet.
"With all these pictures on Twitter, it always looks like I am in restaurants and bars. I am not that type of guy," he said.
Asked about the Klopp lookalike who has been posing for pictures in Liverpool, the Reds boss said: "No, I haven't seen him. A lot of people look like me. Not the best shaver in the world. Funny glasses."
Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino says it will take time for his Liverpool counterpart to fully implement his favoured style of play.
The former Southampton boss said it was possible to get "some ideas" over to your players in a short space of time.
But he added: "It's impossible to put all your ideas in the mind of the team but always you try to change something.
"It's not easy, but it's not difficult because you start to give the players the tools to play in the way you want to play."
Tottenham's technical staff have watched videos of Klopp's Dortmund rather than recent Liverpool matches as preparation.
"We can use the information because in the last few months Liverpool have played in different ways and changed the system," Pochettino said.
"How we analyse Dortmund and the way Klopp played, it's similar concepts that we can take."
