They are joined by Heather Watson, 24, and Murray's older brother Jamie, 30, in the four-strong team.
Andy Murray, 29, claimed gold in the men's singles and silver in the mixed doubles at London 2012.
Konta, 25, will be playing in her first Games, but it will be a second appearance for Watson and a third for Jamie Murray.
World number 18 Konta said: "It's such an honour to have the rare opportunity to represent my country in an Olympic Games. I'm looking forward to doing my part for Team GB and supporting my team-mates across all the sports."
Former Wimbledon champion Murray added: "Playing for Team GB during London 2012 gave me some of the best memories I have in sport.
"Being a home Olympic Games, it was such a special occasion and the atmosphere at Wimbledon was like nothing I have ever experienced.
"Winning medals for your country is as good as it gets and I can't wait to get to Rio to try and win more medals."
