Cox, 29, was released this summer after scoring nine goals in 60 games in his second spell at the Royals.
The ex-Nottingham Forest, West Brom and Swindon man, capped 30 times by the Republic of Ireland, has found the net 78 times in 296 career league matches.
Shrimpers boss Phil Brown said he hoped Cox would make up the goals lost from Jack Payne's move to Huddersfield.
