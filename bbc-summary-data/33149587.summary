The head of the Welsh NHS has said there is a police investigation into aspects of Betsi Cadwaladr health board's spending plans.

Speaking to an assembly committee, Dr Andrew Goodall would not confirm the probe related to fraud allegations.
Dr Goodall called it a "discrete" issue and said he would not comment further while the investigation was ongoing.
A spokesman for the health board said two members of staff had been suspended.
Mr Goodall indicated issues involving capital spending contributed to the health board being placed in special measures.
He told the public accounts committee the spending matters were one of numerous problems that contributed to the north Wales board being put under more direct Welsh government control last week.
Welsh ministers said then the move into special measures had been prompted by "serious and outstanding concerns" about Betsi Cadwaladr's leadership.
The decision  came two weeks after a report found "institutional abuse" at the now closed Tawel Fan mental health unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire.
A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr health board said: "Early in 2014 concerns arose regarding the cost of the YGC [Ysbyty Glan Clwyd] hospital redevelopment programme.
"The health board took swift action to initiate an audit review of the scheme and subsequently referred matters to NHS counter fraud services.
"An investigation involving NHS counter fraud services and North Wales Police is, we understand, ongoing.
"Two members of staff are suspended whilst this investigation progresses."
Concerns about control of large investment projects at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board were raised in a review published last week.
The report said "considerable control problems have been experienced over the management of capital schemes and until the Welsh government are satisfied that better controls have been instituted then this area will remain the subject of intervention".
On Tuesday, the Welsh government said it could not comment on the police investigation while it was continuing.
Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar said: "Patients will be very concerned to hear this announcement; especially given the series of scandals to rock health services in north Wales.
"The public and their representatives will be anxious to know what this police investigation relates to."
