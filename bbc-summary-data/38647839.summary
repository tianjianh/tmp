[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every MP has had a book about Brexit delivered to them following a crowdfunding campaign.

After reading Brexit: What the Hell Happens Now?, software engineer Justen Hyde from Bladon raised Â£5,933 to buy a copy for every member of parliament.
He also sent Ian Dunt's book to every member of the devolved parliaments in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
He said he sent it because it seemed "no one has the faintest idea what's going to happen next on Brexit".
"People are just making it up as they go along," he added.
Mr Dunt, who is also editor of politics.co.uk, said he wrote the book to have an impartial and "adult conversation" about the issues and called Mr Hyde a "miracle worker".
Philosopher A C Grayling is among the 363 supporters of the campaign.
Mr Hyde said he was "absolutely flabbergasted" to have raised the money.
"I've never done anything like this before," he said.
"I don't have a social media presence to speak of, and we got enough funding to send books to every MP in less than a week from setting out the appeal. I've had a good cross section of people supporting it.
"What I would hope is that the public will be reading the book, and other books about Brexit, and they should be talking to their MPs and asking them hard questions about the realities and details of Brexit, because it's going to affect all of our lives."
