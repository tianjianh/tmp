An MP accused of threatening to sack a former employee while on sick leave, says she has apologised for voicemail messages left on her phone.

In one message, Tory MP Lucy Allan was heard telling Arianne Plumbly: "I'm advising you to work as normal or resign. We all know you're not ill."
The Telford MP said she was "frustrated" at her conduct.
Ms Plumbly, who said the messages were left when she was signed off for four weeks, said she was "hurt and upset".
"She has never apologised for this, that's what I take so offensively from this," said the 26-year-old from Coalbrookdale, in Shropshire, who worked at Ms Allan's Telford office.
"She has never tried to resolve this or speak to me about what has occurred.... I'm quite upset.... I'm hurt to be honest."
Ms Plumbly began volunteering for the MP in September 2014, but was dismissed in September this year, two months early from a six-month contract.
Ms Allan said the voicemail recording Ms Plumbly released related to an incident in September when she did not turn up to work for three days and did not notify anyone, something Ms Plumbly disputes.
In a statement the MP said: "Whilst it was certainly human to be frustrated and exasperated by Arianne's conduct, it was wrong to express that frustration as I did, and I have apologised for this."
Ms Allan added that she did not know why she contacted the Conservative Party and the media with her allegations as she was her employer.
But she said she did not believe she was "spiteful and malicious" and wished Ms Plumbly well for the future.
