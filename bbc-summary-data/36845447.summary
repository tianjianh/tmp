The 21-year-old played 41 times in all competitions for the French club last season, scoring 10 goals.
Nkoudou, a France Under-21 international, joined Marseille from fellow French top-flight side Nantes in June 2015 for £1.28m.
Spurs have also signed Espanyol goalkeeper Pau Lopez, 21, on a season-long loan deal.
Meanwhile, winger Clinton Njie, 23, has gone to Marseille on loan until the end of the season.
Nkoudou told Spurs TV: "I can't wait to get to know the Premier League and the English game.
"It suits my playing style, it's explosive. Everyone knows I'm fast, I like to dribble around players so the English league is best for me."
