Amir Khan ready to face Floyd Mayweather - Ricky Hatton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Hatton believes the time is right for Amir Khan to face undefeated Floyd Mayweather.

Two-time world champion Hatton lost only two of his 47 fights before retiring - one as a welterweight against Mayweather in 2007
But he believes IBF and WBA light-welterweight champion Khan, 24, is better equipped to test the American.
"I can see the fight happening. Amir is looking sensational at the moment," Hatton told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It's only a matter of time, like any fighter who has been number one, before he wants to move up a weight division, and see if he can win a world title in another weight division.

"I was fortunate enough to do that and I think Amir is on course to do that too."
And Hatton said he had been impressed with how Khan had progressed since suffering his sole professional defeat in being stopped by Breidis Prescott three years ago.
"A few years ago, you would have said Floyd Mayweather was a step too far, but the way he is performing now, it certainly isn't.
"Amir's style would probably suit against Mayweather more than my style.
"I was always 100mph and in your face, and that's probably tailor-made for Mayweather, whereas Amir has good height and reach, good hand speed, and is good on the back foot.
"Mayweather likes people to come at him so it might be difficult against someone like Amir who backs off."
Last month, Mayweather extended his unbeaten record to 42 fights with a fourth-round knockout of Victor Ortiz.
Bolton-born Khan's next fight will be on 10 December against American Lamont Peterson in Washington.
He said last month: "I know I'm two or three fights away from fighting Mayweather - and that within the next nine months I will fight him."
