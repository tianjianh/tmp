The Scottish side's Champions League campaign got off to a nightmare start, with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar rampant.
Celtic, having missed a penalty to equalise, were 2-0 down at half-time and were swept aside after the break.
"It's the second half that we're really disappointed with," said Brown.
"To lose five goals in 45 minutes is unacceptable. Everyone is disappointed in that changing room."
Messi netted his sixth Champions League hat-trick, Suarez scored twice, and Neymar and Andres Iniesta once apiece
Celtic's Moussa Dembele squandered a chance to equalise as his penalty was saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
Brown said he and his team-mates had not kept the ball well enough at the Nou Camp.
He said: "They're entitled to score goals, they're a great team, but we should do better than that.
"It's 7-0. I'm not going to come away from here laughing and joking, am I? It's hard to take, but they are a great team."
Celtic host Manchester City in their next Champions League game, on Wednesday, 28 September.
"We need to bounce back," said Brown. "We need to try and get something. We know at Celtic Park, with our fans, anything can happen."
Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers said "there can be no embarrassment" after the heavy defeat.
And Brown, while frustrated with his team's display, Brown said there is no shame in losing.
"They're the best team in the world, there's no doubting that," he added.
"Their front three are exceptional - their movement, their vision, their calmness on the ball - but we need to defend better from the front, midfield and the back.
"We've got to be a lot more compact and braver on the ball as well."
