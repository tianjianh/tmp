The victim, in his late teens, was attacked at about 23:10 BST on Friday in an alleyway near Heron Way on Lakeside Retail Park, Thurrock, Essex.
His attacker, described as white, with dark clothes, fled the scene.
Det Insp Hayley King said it was a "serious incident".
"I would urge anybody who may have seen anything suspicious or who noticed a man hanging around the area before or after the time of the assault to contact us immediately," she said.
She added she would like to hear from anyone who has found the victim's missing card-style wallet containing train tickets.
