Samson Lee: Wales and Scarlets prop to miss Pro12 game at Munster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales tight-head Samson Lee will miss Scarlets' vital Pro12 match with Munster on Saturday.

Head coach Wayne Pivac confirmed Lee is undergoing concussion protocol after suffering a head blow in the 34-20 win over Newport Gwent Dragons.
Scarlets need to beat Munster to maintain their chances of claiming a place in the end of season play-offs.
The Welsh region will also be without full-back Michael Collins who has a hamstring injury.
Lee, who left the field in the first half of the Principality Stadium match against Dragons, is expected to be part of Wales' three-Test tour to New Zealand in June.
His place in the Scarlets front-row was taken by Pete Edwards who is likely to be selected for the match against Munster in Lee's absence.
"He [Lee] is not in contention for this weekend, but he is going through the protocols," said Pivac.
Scarlets will clinch fourth place in the table if they beat Munster and gain a bonus point.
Anything less than a bonus-point win will mean Scarlets will need Ospreys to beat Ulster - who currently occupy fourth place - in their match at the Liberty Stadium.
Both Lee and Collins are likely to be fit in time for the Pro12 semi finals later in May.
Munster, who are sixth, need to win to ensure they qualify for the European Champions Cup next season.
