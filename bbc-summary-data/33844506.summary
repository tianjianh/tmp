[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man went into the Tesco Express on Cogges Hill Road, Witney and climbed over the counter before stealing an undisclosed amount of cash.
The raid happened at about 22:45 BST on Saturday. No customers were in the store at the time.
The offender was white and wearing a black balaclava, dark clothing and gloves.
Police are also investigating two other robberies and are keeping an "open mind" whether all three are linked.
Last Wednesday night a man armed with a syringe stole money after jumping over the counter at Tesco Express in Fettiplace Road, Witney.
While on Sunday evening a robber with a screwdriver stole cash from Co-op in Shipton Road, Milton-under-Wychwood.
No-one was hurt in either incident.
