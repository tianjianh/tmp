Footage of Omagh firefighter Terry Canning carrying a fellow runner towards the finishing line at the Boston marathon has gone viral.
Mr Canning, 44, was among tens of thousands of athletes taking part in the marathon on Monday.
But before the finish line, one of his fellow runners suffered from exhaustion.
Mr Canning saw Julianne Bowe on the ground about 200 metres from the finish line, and came to her aid.
