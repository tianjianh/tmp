An avid whale watcher has filmed a humpback whale circling a boat off the coast of Moray.
Steve Truluck, a volunteer with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, was about two miles off the coast of Hopeman when the mammal decided to move in for a closer inspection.
Sharing the pictures on social media, Steve said: "Dream come true! Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be circled by a humpback whale".
