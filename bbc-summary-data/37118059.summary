The hosts lost opener Chris Dent for a duck in the fourth over and Gareth Roderick (23) shortly after.
Will Tavare (20) and Michael Klinger (10) continued a steady fall of wickets until Hamish Marshall (58) and Phil Mustard (38) led the hosts' recovery.
However, Viljoen swept through the tail to end with impressive figures of 5-55.
