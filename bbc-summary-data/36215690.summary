A former Los Angeles rubbish collector has been found guilty of the "Grim Sleeper" serial murders that spanned more than 20 years and left 10 dead.

Lonnie David Franklin Jr killed nine women and a 15-year-old girl between 1985 and 2007, before dumping their bodies, often in alleyways.
Prosecutors said Franklin Jr, 63, stalked vulnerable young black women before shooting or strangling them.
He began by targeting drug addicts during LA's crack cocaine epidemic.
Franklin Jr was convicted after a two-month trial at LA County Superior Court and could face the death penalty.
He was also convicted of the attempted murder of an 11th victim who survived being shot, raped, and pushed out of a car in 1988.
He was nicknamed the Grim Sleeper because of an apparent 14-year gap in attacks after that incident.
The killer showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, court reports said.
