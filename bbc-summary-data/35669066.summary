The collie ran from junction 13 of the M5 at Stroud to junction 12 at Gloucester on Thursday.
Gloucestershire Police closed the motorway and asked drivers to stay in their cars while they captured it.
Officers from North Wales Police were criticised earlier in the week for deliberately running over and killing a dog that was loose on a main road.
After they caught the black and white collie, Gloucestershire Road Police tweeted a picture of the animal in the back of a police car with the caption: "Err, the vets please driver."
The force later tweeted that the dog had been reunited with its owners after it had been checked by a vet.
"PC Wood, who also ran from junction 13 to 12, wasn't taken to the vets and didn't require a defib. Both are recovering well," they added.
North Wales Police received thousands of complaints after the dog was run over on Monday.
The force has since been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
