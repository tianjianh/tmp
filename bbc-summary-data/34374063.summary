Up to 3,000 cyclists have taken part in the first Pedal Portsmouth event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The free event involved the closure of four miles (6km) of Southsea's seafront roads for four hours.
The city council, which organised the event with Portsmouth Cycle Forum, said it was about health and encouraging more people to cycle.
The authority also said it was an opportunity for children and beginners to get used to riding on roads "without the worry of vehicles".
