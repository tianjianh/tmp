A man charged with the murders of three Bradford women has referred to himself as the "crossbow cannibal" in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Griffiths, 40, is accused of murdering prostitutes Suzanne Blamires, Shelley Armitage, and Susan Rushworth.
Mature student Mr Griffiths, of Thornton Road, Bradford, was remanded in custody by magistrates and later by a judge at the city's crown court.
Recent events have been described in some of the tabloid press as the "crossbow cannibal killings".
When asked to confirm his name by magistrates, Mr Griffiths told the court he was "the crossbow cannibal".
Asked for his address, he replied: "Erm... here I guess."
Relatives of some of the victims were in court for the magistrates' court hearing. Some wiped away tears at the start of the proceedings.
After appearing before magistrates, Mr Griffiths was then taken to Bradford Crown Court.
During this appearance, which lasted only 10 minutes, Mr Griffiths  - flanked by security officers - spoke only to confirm his name.
He will next appear at the crown court via video link on 7 June.
