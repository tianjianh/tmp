Officers were called at about 23:40 BST on Thursday following reports that a gun had been fired in the Marsh area.
The 24-year-old local man was found injured in Waverley Terrace and was taken to hospital with head injuries, West Yorkshire Police said.
Two men, aged 23 and 22, have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
Det Sup Simon Atkinson said the man's condition was "serious but not considered to be life-threatening".
''At the present time we are treating this incident as a targeted attack," he said.
''We believe the man was shot as he was travelling in a car with two other men on Heaton Road.  The suspects are thought to have been in another vehicle when the firearm was discharged.
"The other passengers in the vehicle were not injured in the incident."
