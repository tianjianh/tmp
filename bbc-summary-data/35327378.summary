Marc Martin, 22, and Matt Preece, 21, died after the BMW crashed in High Beeches Lane, Handcross, West Sussex, in December 2014.
Mr Martin, from Haywards Heath, and Mr Preece, of Lindfield, were both sitting in the back of the BMW.
Kyle Witney, 21, of Lindfield had previously admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
Witney has been jailed for six years at Lewes Crown Court.
The court heard Witney had been smoking cannabis and had gone out to get more drugs when the crash happened.
His girlfriend said at the time of the crash he had been showing off in front of his friends "trying to be smart".
The jury was told Witney had said immediately after the crash: "Oh my God, what have I done? I hope I haven't killed my friends."
He told paramedics he had been driving at 100mph.
Mr Martin and Mr Preece were taken to hospital after the crash but died from their injuries.
A 16-year-old girl who was a front-seat passenger in the BMW was also treated in hospital for minor injuries.
Witney had been left the BMW by his grandfather three months before the crash, the court was told.
