Runaway mother Rebecca Minnock 'manipulated press'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The actions of a runaway mother at the heart of a custody battle were "utterly irresponsible", a judge has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rebecca Minnock and relatives tried to manipulate the press with a "publicity stunt" when she fled with Ethan, three, Judge Stephen Wildblood QC ruled.
But he said he would do what he could to ensure Ethan had "an effective relationship with both parents".
Ms Minnock, 35, handed herself in on Friday after more than two weeks in hiding with Ethan.
Mother and son disappeared from their home in Highbridge, Somerset, on 27 May - the day a judge ruled Ethan should live with his father.
In a judgement at Bristol Crown Court, Judge Wildblood said that had been an "utterly irresponsible way to behave" when the interests of a child were paramount.
He said she and relatives had tried to cause a "manipulation of the press".
And he said that during the two-year custody battle between Ms Minnock and Ethan's father, Roger Williams, it had "been found that the mother positively invented allegations against the father on two occasions".
Ethan was reunited with his father on Friday evening.
Ms Minnock's mother Louise, 52, and Louise's partner Andrew Butt, 56, were jailed on Friday for contempt of court after admitting withholding information about her whereabouts.
Butt, who drove Ms Minnock and Ethan to Cheltenham on the day they disappeared, told the court last week: "The plan was to keep her away for as long as possible and to generate as much publicity as possible."
While in hiding with Ethan, Ms Minnock gave interviews by telephone to two national newspapers.
In the written judgement, Judge Wildblood also said his "principal task" was dealing with Ethan's future - some of which would be resolved by the court "sitting in private".
He said he had to ensure there were no more attempts by Ms Minnock and her family to "manipulate public opinion".
"I may also have to look at what should be done about Rebecca Minnock's behaviour in breaching previous court orders," the judge added.
"I anticipate that there needs to be a short period of time in which people can take stock of what has happened and reflect on what they want to achieve."
