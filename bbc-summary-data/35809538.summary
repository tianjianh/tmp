Cross-Channel train operator Eurostar says a strong pound, the Paris attacks and disruptions have contributed to a drop in profits.

Annual underlying operating profits for 2015 were £34m, down from £55m in 2014.
The company said the strength of sterling reduced actual rates of sales revenue to £821m, down from £867m the previous year.
There was a "sharp drop" in passenger numbers following the Paris terror attacks in November.
Last year, rail services were also disrupted when migrants managed to get on to train tracks near the Channel Tunnel on the French side.
Chief executive Nicolas Petrovic said: "After a challenging end to 2015, trading is picking up and the outlook for the summer is positive."
The company said it had already introduced eight e320 trains between London and Paris, which carry 20% more passengers, and planned to roll out more over the next three years.
