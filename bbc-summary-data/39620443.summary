[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was a passenger in a silver Vauxhall Vectra that left the road near Eddleston at about 06:50.
The 35-year-old male driver is also in hospital with a "serious but non-life threatening injury" to his neck.
Police said a number of people had stopped at the scene to help and officers have appealed for them to get in touch.
They also want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time who may have seen the car before the crash.
The road was closed for about eight hours on Saturday to allow crash investigators to work at the scene.
Both the injured men are being treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
