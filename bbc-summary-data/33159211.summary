[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Wood, 27, had been chatting to road workers after delivering a load of tarmac before the incident happened in Largs, Ayrshire, in September 2013.
John Woods, 86, died after the lorry rolled down Waterside Street and collided with a car, which struck a house and garage before hitting him.
A jury found Mr Wood not guilty of causing death by careless driving.
Giving evidence at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Gary McRoberts, who had been driving a road roller when the lorry started to move, said: "Steven tried to run after it but it was going too fast by that time. Everything happened quite quick.
"By the time I turned around Steven was chasing it but it was going too fast and getting away from him. It was picking up speed all the time."
Mr Woods suffered fatal injuries in the incident.
Prosecutors had claimed Mr Wood, from Hurlford in Ayrshire, left his engine running and failed to properly apply the handbrake or turn the wheels to the kerb when he stopped.
