The perilous journey of a migrant boat that made it

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This is the story of one of the many migrant boats drifting at sea.  Packed with desperate migrants from Myanmar, this boat made it to a village in Indonesia days after a BBC team made fleeting contact with it near Thailand.

Reports came in of a boat carrying 350 migrants, mostly Rohingya Muslims, and stranded at sea, on 13 May. They were left without food or water after their crew abandoned them.
The next day, the BBC found the vessel in waters off southern Thailand, near the Malaysian island of Langkawi, after local fishermen spotted the boat.
Migrants onboard told the BBC's Jonathan Head that they had been stranded for a week, and that 10 people had already  died. Some of them looked as if they were in need of medical attention. They were crying out for assistance.
Many pleaded for food and drinking water. A Thai navy helicopter later that evening dropped off food packages.
Malaysia and Thailand both rejected the boat, taking turns to tow the boat to each other's waters, in what observers condemned as a "ping pong" match.
On Saturday, Thai journalist Taphanee Iestrichai was allowed to observe the military as they boarded the boat, repaired its engine, and taught some onboard how to operate the vessel.
That night, the boat was towed out to international waters, according to several witnesses.
Thailand insisted that those onboard did not want to stay, and wanted to move on. But Ms Iestrichai told the BBC that said it was clear the migrants needed urgent help and had no idea where to go.
When they were towed out it appeared they were heading not to Malaysia but further on to Indonesia.
Weather reports on Monday warned of possible rough seas ahead due to the monsoon but efforts by BBC teams in the region to find the boat proved fruitless.
Then, on Wednesday, it was spotted off the coast of East Aceh in Indonesia.
The boat had made it - six days after it was first discovered in Thailand, and 10 weeks since it left Myanmar.
Migrants later told activists that Malaysian authorities took them nearly all the way to Indonesia.
The migrants had been living in appalling conditions for weeks, a BBC team found.
An overwhelming stench permeated the boat; it was strewn with filthy plastic bottles, plates and clothes, said producer Xinyan Yu who boarded the vessel later.
Onshore in Aceh, the migrants were taken to temporary shelters at Julok village.
The migrants were put on buses  and taken to the nearby town of Langsa for processing.
Their arrival coincided with an announcement by Malaysia and Indonesia that they would not turn away migrant vessels and stop towing away boats.
Both countries said they would offer temporary shelter provided the migrants' resettlement is completed in one year.
The announcement is a glimmer of hope for these migrants who survived a perilous voyage at sea.
