[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Le Masurier died three months ago.
Geoffrey Morris from the club said Mr Le Masurier was an inspiration as well as a dedicated and passionate collector.
The club's first model railway exhibition since the death of Mr Le Masurier started on Saturday and is one of its largest.
It attracted hundreds of model railway fans from across the island and featured a range of different trains and models.
Mr Morris said: "The late Andrew Le Masurier was profoundly deaf, but he was one of our most active members.
"We were so proud to make a lovely nameplate in the form of a Great Western Railway nameplate, which proudly says the 'Andrew Le Masurier Hall'.
"This is our 33rd exhibition. We have held them at various venues around the island."
