[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Council bosses are to place a new team of nurses, carers and managers into an Aberdeen nursing home which has been criticised over the service it provides.

Kingsmead Nursing Home was branded "unsatisfactory" in an earlier report by the Care Home Inspectorate.
Some staff were accused of not treating people with "dignity and respect".
The report ordered major improvements, but now Aberdeen City Council has confirmed it has intervened.
A spokesman said:  "Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership has put measures in place to deal with issues concerning the quality of care at the privately-run Kingsmead Care Home in Kingswells.
"Care Inspectorate inspectors visited the home this week and have told us that they have concerns around the services currently provided there.
"The safety and wellbeing of the home's residents is our paramount concern. We are therefore acting swiftly to place a new team of nurses, carers and care managers into the home to provide expert care for the residents.
"Our partner organisations, including NHS Grampian and independent sector care providers, are assisting us in this regard."
He added: "Family members and residents in the home can have confidence that continuity of service will be maintained at Kingsmead.
"This interim measure has been taken promptly. We will ensure a good standard of care and support in the home in the immediate term as we plan longer-term solutions.
"We will keep families informed of our actions regularly. The welfare of the residents will be our primary concern throughout this process."
The Care Inspectorate report in February found that some residents had lost weight, with concerns being raised that their nutritional needs were not being met.
The family of an 84-year-old mother who had dementia told BBC Scotland that she was forcibly evicted from the care home after they complained about her treatment.
Mary Gray died in August last year, seven months after moving out of Kingsmead.
Mrs Gray's son David said: "She was evicted against the advice of her GP. We were treated as trouble-makers."
Mr Gray's wife Carol added: "It was disgusting. There were some very good staff. Sadly, I think some of them are no longer there."
Management said at the time that Mrs Gray was asked to leave because her son and daughter-in-law were "disruptive".
The report said that in some incidences, people were being treated like "objects".
Following the latest visit, the Care Inspectorate said they had identified "serious concerns about the quality of care in this home".
A spokesman said: "We have shared this with Aberdeen City Council and the Health and Care Inspectorate.
"We are working closely with them and considering all the powers open to us to protect people's health, safety and wellbeing."
The home can provide care for up to 55 older people, and up to 10 adults with learning disabilities.
