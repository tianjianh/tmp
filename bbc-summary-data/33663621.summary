Operation Promotion was launched by the National League side's supporters trust in June to provide cash to sign new players for the 2015/2016 season.
The club narrowly missed promotion to the Football League in May and The Mariners Trust had initially hoped to raise £20,000.
The trust said more than 3,500 individual donations had been received.
Dave Roberts, from the trust, said: "It is an incredible achievement and we are very grateful to every supporter for all of their donations over the past eight weeks.
"It goes to prove Grimsby Town supporters really are the best around and we can't wait to get the season under way."
