Hamilton to announce 'biggest health system shake-up' in five years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stormont Health Minister Simon Hamilton is expected to announce the biggest shake-up in Northern Ireland's health system in five years.

The BBC understands that he will outline a new management structure for the local health care system.
It comes in response to a review that recommended redesigning the system to make it simpler and more efficient.
The review said Northern Ireland had too many hospitals for its 1.8m population.
It was published in January by Sir Liam Donaldson, the former Chief Medical Officer for England.
It suggested setting up an international panel of experts to redesign the local health system so that expertise is no longer thinly spread.
The report also identified confusion about who was in charge of health care in Northern Ireland.
At present, the Department of Health is responsible for strategy and policy, while below it the Health and Social Care Board is in charge of "commissioning".
In essence, this means the board spends a large part of the health budget identifying needs and acquiring resources and services for the trusts.
The six trusts are then the service providers.
It is understood the minister wants the trusts to be directly accountable to his department, and this could have implications for the Health and Social Care Board.
It currently employs about 470 people, with an administration budget of Â£27m.
Alongside the board, the Public Health Agency is primarily responsible for improving health and social well-being and health protection, but it also has a role in commissioning.  It is understood commissioning will not longer be part of its remit.
The Donaldson review highlighted unnecessary duplication between the department, the health board and the Public Health Agency.
The minister is expected to address this directly.
Any move to restructure the management of the health service will require a public consultation and legislation, meaning it is unlikely to come into effect for between 18 months and two years.
Sir Liam suggested that an international panel of experts be established to make some of the tough decisions regarding the future shape of services, including the number of acute hospitals.
The review highlighted that a population of 1.8m could be served by four rather than 10 hospitals.
Sir Liam said it should be agreed in advance to accept whatever proposals such a panel made.
The BBC understands that Mr Hamilton will set up an expert panel, but it will mostly be made up of local people.  There will be no agreement to accept the panel's proposals in advance.
The review also pointed to a report from 2011 called Transforming Your Care which had 99 recommendations.
It focused on moving patient care away from hospitals and into the home or community setting.
Sir Liam said a time-tabled implementation plan was needed that would include an enhanced role for pharmacists and paramedics.
It is understood the minister will announce a 'transformation fund' to be taken out of any additional funding the department receives (currently Â£4.7bn).
The fund will be used to pay for cost-saving initiatives developed by the trusts and the implementation of Transforming Your Care.
This announcement by the minister is essentially his answer to the Donaldson report - on the question of who is in charge of the health service, Mr Hamilton says he is.
The minister vows to reduce bureaucracy and he suggests reforming a system so service providers work more closely with the decision makers.
