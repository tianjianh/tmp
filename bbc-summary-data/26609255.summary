The firm, which makes money from commissions charged to restaurants on the value of orders placed through its platform, said it would use the cash raised to boost growth.
It plans potential expansion into new countries, as well as acquisitions of complementary businesses.
It currently operates in 13 countries, with the UK one of its largest markets.
