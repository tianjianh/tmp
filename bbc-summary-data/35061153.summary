Police Scotland said the 64-year-old man from Hawick died at the scene of the accident on the A7.
In an earlier statement, the force said the car caught fire after crashing with lorry, on the road south of Hawick.
The road between Langholm and Hawick has been closed since the accident happened at 09:25 for a collision investigation.

He said it involved a red Vauxhall Cavalier, which was travelling southbound, and a white Renault lorry with a blue side.
The lorry driver was taken to hospital but he was discharged after treatment.
Insp Burns said: "First and foremost, our sincere condolences go to the family and friends of the gentleman who lost his life.
"An investigation into the cause of the accident is underway and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this collision, or the movements of either vehicle in the moments leading up to it."
Scottish Borders Council warned that the A7 closure was likely to remain in place until this evening.
