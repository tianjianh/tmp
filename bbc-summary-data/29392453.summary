Capita outlines plans for new jobs in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Capita has announced plans to create 200 new jobs in Glasgow, with an expansion of its Scottish IT and customer management divisions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm already employs about 5,000 people in Scotland in areas including IT, telecoms, utilities and financial services.
It said it would spent Â£5m expanding Capita Customer Management Ltd (CCM) and Â£6m growing its IT services division.
The new jobs will be based at Skypark.
They have been supported by two Regional Selective Assistance grants from Scottish Enterprise totalling Â£1.24m.
Capita also has offices in Aberdeen, Forres, Edinburgh and Stirling.
First Minister Alex Salmond, who met Capita's business development director Gordon Lee as part of a business engagement programme during the Ryder Cup, welcomed the news.
Mr Salmond said: "International companies estimate general cost savings of around 30-40% can be achieved in Scotland when comparing similar operational, property and employment costs to London.
"Capita, as one of our largest employers, already employ thousands of people across Scotland and I welcome their commitment to create an additional 200 jobs in Glasgow and the number of other ventures planned in coming years."
Gordon Lee said: "Our presence in Scotland has grown significantly in the last few years and this investment demonstrates Capita's continued focus in the country."
