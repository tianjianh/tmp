Morecambe: Troubled League Two club fails to pay players and staff on time again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Players and staff at League Two club Morecambe have had their wages paid late for the third time this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimps have had financial problems all season amid uncertainty over the club's ownership, and a court case is currently ongoing over a possible takeover by businessman Joseph Cala.
Owner Graham Burnard told BBC Radio Lancashire a delay in an international bank transfer caused the late payments.
Morecambe have lost six games in a row to drop to 19th in the table.
Cala's attempted purchase  was delayed on 3 February after Brazilina Diego Lemos, who owns a share in the club's owners, G50 Holdings, obtained a court order preventing a sale.
Cala hopes to buy Abdulrahman Al-Hashemi's stake in G50 but 99% of that share was transferred to tax consultant Burnard on 11 January.
