[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucestershire openers Michael Klinger and Chris Dent both scored brilliant centuries to set up an exciting 10-run win over Hampshire in the One-Day Cup.

The pair put on 242 at Bristol before Dent was caught by Shahid Afridi off Liam Dawson for 142 from 116 balls.
But skipper Klinger batted through the innings to make a List A best of 166 not out in Gloucestershire's 352-3.
Half-centuries from Dawson and Gareth Andrew (70 not out) gave Hampshire a chance, but they fell short on 342-8.
In a breathtaking display of clean hitting and pure timing, Dent was the dominant partner in a record opening stand for Gloucestershire against Hampshire - striking 14 fours and three sixes.
Australian Klinger then accelerated at the end of the innings including a huge maximum over long-on, his sixth, off paceman Tino Best, before finishing with four boundaries in Andrew's final over.
Hampshire started the chase well as opener Tom Alsop made 50 and Sean Ervine hit three sixes in his 38-ball 53.
However, just as Ervine was beginning to look dangerous he looped Kieran Noema-Barnett into the hands of Liam Norwell behind square leg.
Dawson (57) and Andrew gave Hampshire a glimmer of hope as their seventh-wicket stand of 64 left the visitors needing 69 off 38 balls.
But once Dawson was bowled by Norwell, Andrew had too much to do with the tail and was left stranded having hit four fours and five sixes in his 41-ball knock.
