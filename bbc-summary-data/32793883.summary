Wallace, 29, has made 18 appearances this season as the Clarets were relegated from the Premier League, while Duff, 37, has featured 22 times.
"Ross will be leaving and, of course, we thank him for his contribution," said manager Sean Dyche.
Duff has played more than 350 games for Burnley and will begin contract talks.
He joined from Cheltenham for Â£30,000 in 2004.
Midfielder Steven Reid has already announced he will retire at the end of the season, while top scorer Danny Ings is also expected to leave the club.
