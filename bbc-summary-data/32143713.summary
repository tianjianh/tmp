Blackpool Airport: Daily passenger flights resume

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Regular passenger flights have resumed at Blackpool Airport after a six-month absence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Citywing has reinstated two daily services to and from the Isle of Man and Belfast City.
About 100 jobs were lost when owners Balfour Beatty closed the airport in October after failing to find a buyer.
In December, the airport reopened with a licence allowing a limited commercial service but not large carriers with passengers.
The airport served 235,000 passengers in 2013 and was voted best UK airport in 2009, according to a Which? survey.
