Margaret Evans murder: Son denies Portstewart killing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court to deny killing his mother in their family home in County Antrim last summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alun Kinney Evans, 33, is charged with murdering Margaret Evans in Portstewart on June 4 last year.
Ms Evans, a 69-year old hairdresser who was known as Margo, was found dead in the Knockancor Drive home she shared with her son.
Mr Evans entered a "not guilty" plea at Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast.
A prosecution lawyer told the court the crux of the trial will "focus on medical issues".
The judge was informed that the trial is expected to last for a fortnight, with 6 January next year as a possible start date.
He was remanded back into custody.
