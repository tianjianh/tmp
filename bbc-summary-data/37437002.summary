The unnamed journalist was photographed while conducting an interview in Xiamen city on efforts to help the city recover from Typhoon Meranti.
Her appearance was a stark contrast to the volunteers she was interviewing as they helped clean up after the storm.
The images went viral, with many accusing her of being unprofessional.
Xiamen TV station said in a statement: "One of our journalists didn't obey our rules and misconducted in an interview.
"That damages the image of [the] journalist and causes a negative impact to the public."
Online comment, mainly on China's Twitter-like Weibo network, has been divided over the journalist's image and behaviour while reporting  in the aftermath of the storm.
Weibo user "Eclairask asked whether the TV station had been clear that its journalists "cannot have sunglasses on".
"Or is the station forced to suspend the journalist because of public pressure and anger?"
User Pan says "if you know how difficult and hard it is to be a journalist, you would not focus on her accessories."
Another Weibo user said the problem was about her lacking manners, and not knowing how to respect the people she was interviewing.
Yanping Zhang, one of the first people to repost the image online, said the reaction had been far harsher than she was expecting.
Ms Zhang says it's not clear who originally took the picture but that "the punishment is too much".
"I think an internal verbal warning should be fine," she said.
"What I intended to do was show the public that it's disrespectful for a journalist to wear sunglasses and hold an umbrella in an interview."
But Ms Zhang is now the subject of abuse and a backlash on her Weibo page.  Internet users accused her of taking the moral high ground, with some even cursing her family.
She was labelled a modern day Red Guard, a reference to the zealous and often ruthless youths who enforced the principles of China's Cultural Revolution, a time which saw many killed and beaten in the name of upholding Maoist ideals.
"I am very innocent. I even don't know the journalist personally," said Ms Zhang.
A Shanghai-based female TV journalist Yijing Lin also told the BBC that the reaction must be understood in the context of the expectations  and image the Chinese public has of journalists.
"I wouldn't call it stereotype, but it does happen," she said.
"I see adventurous people who don't mind getting their feet dirty."
