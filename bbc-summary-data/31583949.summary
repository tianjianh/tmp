On Friday it was made public the 2 Sisters factory in the Anglesey town is considering cutting an entire shift.
The company employs about 800 people at the chicken processing facility.
One union official described morale as "very very low", saying it is now feared 200 agency jobs could be lost along with about 116 employees.
The 2 Sisters Food Group bought the factory from Dutch firm Vion in March 2013, and three months later announced it needed to increase production with an extra shift, bringing in an additional 300 posts.
Paddy McNaught, the regional organiser for Unite, said the company was planning to cut production at the factory.
"It's not been very promising news," he said following the meeting. "I think the company today have clarified the situation slightly in terms of numbers.
"We still believe we're looking at potentially over 300 people will be taken out of this business here at Llangefni.
"We've got somewhere in the region of 201 agency workers, as we believe it of today, and those will be going, plus a further 116 direct employees."
The company confirmed on Friday some roles were at risk of redundancy as it looked to "simplify" its business to sustain the quality of its products.
