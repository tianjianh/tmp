[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 1-0 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Injury-ravaged Morton chalked up another vital victory with a one goal triumph over Raith Rovers. And the goal was a stunner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Forbes gave Morton the lead with a fabulous free kick on 18 minutes.
The opportunity for the strike- around 25 yards out and right sided - was created by sterling work by Jai Quitongo whose body strength knocked Kyle Benedictus horizontal in a fair shoulder charge.
He ploughed on towards goal only to be fouled.
Forbes took the kick and curled it gloriously round the wall and in low at Kevin Cuthbert's left hand post to the delight of the home support in a crowd of 1,528.
And in the end it was all Morton needed to embrace all three points
It was good stuff with chances at both ends, big Jean-Yves M'Voto with a header for Raith and Forbes firing over after a three-on-two break by the Greenock side, for example.
There was a blow and a reshape for Morton after 38 minutes, with Gavin Gunning floored and unable to continue and stretchered off, to be replaced by former Rangers player Andy Murdoch.
It was all Ton manager Jim Duffy needed.  Another player on the treatment table.
It didn't stop the hosts' flow and they should have had a penalty when M'Voto handled just inside the area as he was pursued by Quintongo.
Robbie Neilson, the Hearts manager, was in the stand to watch his loan player at Raith, Liam Smith, and he saw him given a torrid time from the lively Greenock attack.
There was drama in the last few minutes when Andy McNeill was forced to go off with a head knock to be replaced in goal by Derek Gaston, whose first job was to save a free kick from Declan McManus.
It meant a nervy climax but Morton were well worth the win.
