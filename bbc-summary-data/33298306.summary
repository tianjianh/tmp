Kenneth Hall, 49, from Bridgwater, Somerset, sold details about killers held at the Berkshire high security hospital to tabloid newspapers.
They included Robert Ashman, who attacked MP Nigel Jones and killed his assistant with a samurai sword in 2000.
Hall had earlier pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office and was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London.
He also pleaded guilty to forgery.
Hall sold stories about killers suing the NHS, and forged documents to beef up his tales, the court previously heard.
Judge Timothy Pontius said there had been a "grave" breach of trust, made worse by the fact that his offending continued after he left the hospital.
He added that although the some of the patients were notorious killers, which includes the Yorkshire Ripper, they were still entitled to professional care and a respect for their privacy.
Hall could not call what he did "altruistic whistle-blowing", the judge said, because his offending continued after his employment ended.
The Old Bailey had earlier heard how Hall made Â£23,800 from selling stories to the News Of The World and the Mirror.
Hall smuggled out patient notes relating to Ashman, leading to a number of stories, including one headlined, "Samurai Nut Could Be Free In 18 Months".
Another story had the headline "Sex Killer Sues NHS For Â£3 Million", and stated: "Monster who attacked girl of 12 wants cash because Broadmoor inmates attacked him".
The offences took place between 29 June 2002 and 6 October 2004.
