The aircraft left Turweston Aerodrome in north Buckinghamshire but then crashed at Aston Rowant Nature Reserve at 14:35 GMT.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: "Sadly, the pilot of the aircraft, a man, has been pronounced dead at the scene."
Road diversions are in place around the area and an investigation into the crash is under way.
The man's next-of-kin are yet to be informed.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it had sent a team to investigate the crash site.
Police have locked down the Aston Rowant Nature Reserve after the aircraft accident, with a steady flow of police vehicles coming in and out of the site.
Conditions around the reserve were treacherous even for drivers on Sunday evening with very heavy fog on the Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire border.
It is not known yet whether fog or poor visibility had a part to play in the fatal air crash at the nature reserve, which straddles the M40 near Stokenchurch.
What we do know is that recovery and investigations will continue throughout the night, although the fog may affect recovery overnight.
