LuaLua, 26, previously joined QPR on loan in January 2017 and played 11 times during his initial loan spell, contributing one goal.
"It's good to be back. I know the boys here, I know the manager, this was an easy decision for me," said LuaLua.
LuaLua is eligible for QPR's next Championship fixture at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.
"I am absolutely delighted to have Kaz back," said QPR manager Ian Holloway. "This is a great opportunity for us.
"He had such a good pre-season with Brighton and it was touch-and-go whether they were going to let him go out again."
