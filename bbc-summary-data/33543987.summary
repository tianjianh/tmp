[SN]TITLE[SN]
Andorra 1-4 Belgium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belgium booked their place at Euro 2016 with a convincing 4-1 win in Andorra, which lifted them top of Group B.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan fired in from 25 yards before Manchester City's record signing Kevin de Bruyne curled a free-kick in off the post.
Andorra captain Ildefons Lima scored a penalty but Chelsea's Eden Hazard then scored from the spot.
Debutant Laurent Depoitre tapped in Dries Mertens' cross before Hazard had a poor second penalty saved.
Belgium will win the group if they beat Israel on Tuesday - while Wales will hope to leapfrog them when they host Andorra.
Wales also secured qualification from Group B despite their defeat in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
