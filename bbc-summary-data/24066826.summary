Get Inspired: How to get into Orienteering

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The aim is to navigate in sequence between a set of control points and decide the best route to complete the course in the quickest time.  It doesn't matter how young, old or fit you are, as you can run, walk or jog the course and progress at your own pace.

Orienteering can take place anywhere from remote forest and countryside to urban parks and school playgrounds.  It's a great sport for runners, joggers and walkers who want to improve their navigation skills, or for anyone who simply loves the outdoors.
Orienteering is unique in providing a workout for both the brain and body. Orienteering not only increases fitness levels but also improves special awareness, decision making and navigation skills. Running and walking over uneven terrain also works the whole of your body and improves core strength and balance. Most importantly it gets you out in the great outdoors exploring our amazing countryside, giving you the feel-good factor and reducing stress levels.
To get started you just need a pair of trainers, or comfortable shoes if you're not running, and outdoor clothes suitable for the weather conditions. Everything else will be provided at the event.
You can find details of events and club activity nights using the search facility on the British Orienteering website.
If attending an event for the first time it's best to search for a 'Level D' event, which will be most suitable for beginners and will have experienced orienteers available to help you get started.
British Orienteering is also working with Sport England to introduce more people into orienteering through our 'Xplorer' events, that take place in local parks and are aimed at primary and pre-school children and their families. Participants use a simple map to find markers featuring animals and colours, which children love to find. You can find out more about Xplorer events here.
Permanent Orienteering Courses (POCs) are also great fun and can be located in a forest, local town or country park. To find out where your nearest course is visit the British Orienteering website.
You can also use the postcode search facility to find your nearest of the 120 clubs in the country, where they would be pleased to welcome you to one of their club nights.
Below are five basic skills that you need to practice to help you progress with orienteering.
1. Fold your map- Always make sure that you fold your map so that you can easily see the part of the map where you are.
2. Orientate your map- Always make sure that your map is the correct way round or orientated. This means that the features which are in front of you on the ground are in front of you on the map. You can also orientate your map using a compass by making sure that the north lines on the map point the same way as the north or red end of the compass needle. Each time you change direction you should change your grip on the map so that the map is still orientated to north.
3. Thumb your Map- To help you know where you are on the map it helps if you mark your position on the map with your thumb. As you move along the  ground you should move your thumb to your new position on the map. It is usual to move your thumb to the new position at a 'check point' such as a path junction or some other obvious feature where you will stop or slow down and check where you are.
4. Check your control card- Once you have found a control you always need to check that the code on your control description sheet matches the code on the control. You should also check that the control is situated on the correct feature on your map. You will then know for sure that you have reached the correct control.
5. Have fun and enjoy yourself- This is the most important skill to remember.  Orienteering should always be fun and enjoyable!
Orienteering began in Scandinavia in the 19th Century and was primarily a military training event.  It was not until 1919 that the modern version of orienteering was created in Sweden by Ernst Killander as a competitive sport.  In the early 1930s, the sport received a technical boost with the invention of the 'Silva' compass which was more precise and faster to use and the sport subsequently continued to grow and expand.
Orienteering was introduced to the UK in the 1950s and was heavily supported by renowned Olympians including John Disley and Chris Brasher. In the early years orienteers from Sweden helped develop the sport and the first event was held in Scotland in 1962.
