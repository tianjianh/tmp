[SN]TITLE[SN]
North South Ministerial Council to discuss Stormont welfare crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stormont's financial crisis is to be discussed when the Irish prime minister chairs a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in Dublin later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The meeting takes place in a climate of uncertainty over the future of Northern Ireland's devolved administration.
Stormont parties cannot agree their budget because of a row over welfare.
Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny said he was looking forward to a "detailed and open" discussion about economics on both sides of the border.
He will meet Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness, Finance Minister Arlene Foster and other Stormont ministers at Dublin Castle.
As well as the financial crisis, other items on the talks agenda include tacking cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering and EU funding opportunities
"These meetings provide an impetus in advancing North South projects and much needed all-island economic cooperation," Mr Kenny said in a statement.
"We will have a detailed and open discussion on the financial and economic issues in both jurisdictions."
On Thursday night, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers repeated her warning that time is running out for Northern Ireland's five main parties to agree a deal on welfare reform.
Ms Villiers told The BBC's The View programme that Sinn FÃ©in and SDLP must "live up to the agreement that was made at Stormont House" in December.
She also said a DUP proposal to produce a so-called "phantom budget" in the absence of a Stormont deal on welfare was "well worth pursuing".
She said with or without a deal on welfare reform, Northern Ireland Executive ministers were facing other financial pressures on public services and had to make spending decisions.
