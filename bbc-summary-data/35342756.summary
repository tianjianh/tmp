A doctor specialising in end-of-life care has written a letter to David Bowie thanking him for helping him talk to people about death.

Dr Mark Taubert, palliative care consultant at Velindre NHS Trust in Cardiff, said it prompted a "weighty" discussion with a dying woman.
His letter, published on the blogs website page of the British Medical Journal (BMJ), has been retweeted by Bowie's son, Duncan Jones.
The singer died from cancer aged 69.
Mr Jones had not tweeted since confirming his father's death, which happened in New York on 10 January.
But he retweeted a link to the letter, where Dr Taubert described the conversation he had with the woman after she had been told her cancer had spread and that she would not live much longer than a year.
Starting the letter with "Dear David", Dr Taubert wrote: "We discussed your death and your music, and it got us talking about numerous weighty subjects, that are not always straightforward to discuss with someone facing their own demise.
"In fact, your story became a way for us to communicate very openly about death, something many doctors and nurses struggle to introduce as a topic of conversation."
He went on: "We talked about palliative care and how it can help.
"She told me about her mother's and her father's death, and that she wanted to be at home when things progressed, not in a hospital or emergency room, but that she'd happily transfer to the local hospice should her symptoms be too challenging to treat at home.
"We both wondered who may have been around you when you took your last breath and whether anyone was holding your hand.
"I believe this was an aspect of the vision she had of her own dying moments that was of utmost importance to her, and you gave her a way of expressing this most personal longing to me, a relative stranger."
Dr Taubert also said dying at home and the last photos of Bowie carrying "off a sharp suit" would help people deal with any fears they had about the last weeks of life.
"You looked great, as always, and it seemed in direct defiance of all the scary monsters that the last weeks of life can be associated with," he added.
