Klinsmann tweeted his support for the midfielder after he completed his move from DC United.
"My wife told me about that. It's great to have his support, and his acceptance makes me feel good about the move," Kitchen said.
"I think it's a huge move."
Klinsmann, who enjoyed two successful spells in British football with Tottenham Hotspur, tweeted regarding Kitchen's move to Hearts: "Congrats to Perry to his new adventure: @PerryKitchen23 @JamTarts."
Kitchen, capped three times by his country, believes experiencing football outside of the United States will be invaluable for his career progression.
"Getting into a European environment is huge," the midfielder told BBC Scotland.
"The ability to progress and continue bettering myself is very much a possibility here and I'm looking forward to that."
Hearts manager Robbie Neilson thinks the move will benefit both the player and the club.
"I think he's just desperate to get to Europe and he sees this as a great opportunity, so it's going to work well for both parties," Neilson said.
"We had been looking for somebody in the summer in that position. Perry became available because of the MLS season. It's important to get a player of that calibre in and to get him in at this point of the season is good for us."
Kitchen says he was aware of his new club before the opportunity arose to move to Hearts.
"When you think of Scottish football, Rangers and Celtic always come to mind but I always had heard of Hearts, the passion their fans have and obviously the great city of Edinburgh.
"It's a great city, everything you'd want in a city. The castle, the history, the shopping for my wife, so it's got everything you'd want.
"I just want to better the club and do what I can to help the team win games. Hopefully I'm capable of doing that.
"They've created a great environment from what I've seen with the guys in the dressing room, and I definitely think that talent is there as well."
