[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 1-0 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Walker was the Aldershot hero, as his late goal saw off a surprisingly-gutsy Guiseley 1-0 at the Recreation Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a tight first half, it was the struggling Lions who created the best opening, but Jake Cassidy was foiled by Jake Cole in a one-on-one.
Scott Rendell did get the ball in the back of the net for Aldershot, but was adjudged to have infringed his marker.
A key moment occurred when Jake Lawlor received a second yellow card for a foul on Jake Gallagher, and was dismissed after 58 minutes.
The Shots applied constant pressure with the extra man and it was no surprise when Walker curled in the winner after 73 minutes.
