Kenya international Michael Olunga, who asked Arsenal to sign him last year, has moved to Swedish side Djurgardens from Kenya's Gor Mahia.

The 21-year-old published a video last August asking Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to sign him.
Instead he has signed a four-year deal with Djurgardens after a month's trial.
"He's very ambitious and purposeful, he trains hard and always wants to learn and take the next step," the club's sporting director Bosse Andersson said.
"The development potential is huge so with the peace and quiet of our Djurg√•rden environment he can develop into a striker able to play in the biggest leagues in Europe.
"That's Michael's own ambitions and he has the characteristics required for it."
Olunga, whose nickname is The Engineer due to his university studies as well as his football talents, admits he can be a slow starter.
"In the beginning I have to get going, but once I get started I tend to get on a roll with my scoring," he told the club's website.
"So far I have only played friendlies but it feels like a good level.
"Everything is very well organized and the quality of the training camp has been very good. It feels like it's a good springboard to the big European leagues."
