The 19- and 53-year-old were walking on Cathcart Road in Glasgow, near Somerville Road, at about 00:55 when a car was reversed into them.
The younger man was released after treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
His companion is in a serious but stable condition in the same hospital, with leg and head injuries.
Det Sgt Martin Smith said: "Inquiries are at an early stage and we are currently viewing CCTV to try and establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.
"The car involved is a small white three door, with a dark roof and dark alloy wheels. It was last seen travelling north on Cathcart Road.
"At the time of the incident the area would have been busy with members of the public and I urge anyone who witnessed this incident or anyone who has any information that could assist our inquiry to contact Cathcart CID immediately."
