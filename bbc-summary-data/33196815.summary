A terminally ill 18-year-old at the centre of a row between parents and doctors has died.

Specialists in February said continuing chemotherapy for Alexander Elliott, who had a brain tumour, was "futile". He died on Thursday.
His parents Brian and Olya Elliott had argued his treatment should continue.
But at the Court of Protection Mrs Justice Hogg gave University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust permission to withhold treatment.
It is the same trust involved in the dispute with the parents of Ashya King.
Brett and Naghmeh King fled the country in August 2014 with their five-year-old son, who also had a brain tumour, so he could receive treatment in Europe.
Mr Elliot said: "My son was a courageous fighter, and the very definition of brave.
"He went in his own time, with his dignity and autonomy intact, and not at the behest of the hospital trust who, since February, have repeatedly told the court that it was in his best interests for further life-preserving treatment to be stopped, and for him to be left to die."
In recent weeks judges heard that Alexander had "surpassed all expectations".
A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust said: "We are deeply saddened by Alex's death at a tragically young age.
"This is an extremely difficult and distressing time for his parents and we are doing all we can to support them.
"Although very upsetting for his family, Alex had reached a point where all medical and surgical treatment options had been exhausted and, due to his deteriorating condition, any further intervention would have been futile and risked causing him great distress."
