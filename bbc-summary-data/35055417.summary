[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eleanor de Freitas, 23, of Fulham, was found dead in 2014, only days before she had been due to stand trial accused of perverting the course of justice.
Alexander Economou has been charged with harassing her father, David de Freitas, the CPS said.
Mr Economou is due before Westminster Magistrates' Court on 11 January.
The CPS said he had been charged in relation to sending a letter to Mr de Freitas, emails to his solicitor, uploading recordings and comments to websites including YouTube and setting up a website with the domain name eleanordefreitas.com.
Trainee accountant Ms de Freitas, who had bipolar disorder, made a rape complaint against Mr Economou to the Metropolitan Police in early 2013.
The police said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the case and the man she said had attacked her took out a private prosecution, accusing her of perverting the course of justice.
Ms de Freitas's solicitors asked the CPS to halt the private action but instead the CPS decided to take it over and continue it.
The 23-year-old had said she felt there was "no way out" after the CPS charged her with perverting the course of justice and she was found hanged on 4 April, three days before she had been due to stand trial.
West London coroner Chinyere Inyama recorded that Ms de Freitas had taken her own life and that the impending court case had been "a significant stressor in her life at that time".
