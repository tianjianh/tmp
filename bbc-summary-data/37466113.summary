A woman who successfully campaigned against the closure of her village fire station has died in a house blaze.

The victim, named locally as parish councillor Tracey Swann, was found dead in her home in Caley Street, Heacham, near King's Lynn, on Saturday.
Emergency services were called just after 20:00 and neighbours were evacuated from their houses.
A joint police and fire inquiry into the cause of the blaze is under way.
However, the fire-ravaged house has been too unsafe for investigators to enter and Norfolk's Urban Search and Rescue unit was expected to start shoring up the gutted property on Sunday.
Ms Swann, who had a son, started a campaign on Facebook to save Heacham fire station after it was earmarked for possible closure in council cuts.
She also set up a protest meeting in the village with the county's fire chief last December before the station was given a reprieve in February.
Six fire engines from across west Norfolk - including one from Heacham - attended the fatal fire within minutes of receiving the call.
Station officer Jonathan Wilby, of Norfolk Fire and Rescue service, said: "We would like to say how sorry we are at the loss of life here.
"We will do everything we can in our powers to make sure we establish the cause."
Mr Wilby said CID and scenes of crimes officers were at the house along with fire investigators and had been making inquiries with neighbours and the victim's family.
It is expected that investigators will remain there until early in the week.
Sam Robinson, a family friend, said: "Almost every single person on this street knows Tracey and they're all friends of Tracey.
"She does so much for the village. She set up the youth club. She's done so much for the parish council, helped with the carnival every year. It's very sad."
Ms Swann's next-door neighbours cannot return home until a structural engineer has declared the property as safe, the fire service said.
