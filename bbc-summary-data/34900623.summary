£30k police theft case: Officer's admission 'not serious'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A South Wales Police detective who denies stealing £30,000 in a raid has told a jury he was not serious when he told a colleague he had taken money.

Det Con Michael Stokes and ex-colleague Det Sgt Stephen Phillips deny taking cash found in a Swansea safe in 2011.
Det Con Stokes told Cardiff Crown Court he was "wind-up merchant".
Earlier on Monday, the jury was directed to find a third officer, Det Con Christopher Evans, 38, from Llangennech, not guilty of theft.
The trial has previously heard from a colleague who told the court Det Con Stokes admitted taking cash from a drug dealer.
But taking to the witness stand for the first time on Monday, Det Con Stokes said the admission was "not serious".
"I'd been branded a thief. My reputation had gone. My name had gone and I didn't understand why anyone was taking it seriously," he said.
He told the jury: "I'm extremely childish and I'm a wind-up merchant."
The court heard his pranks included persuading a colleague to eat pot pourri, tricking another officer into thinking he was sending messages to a long-standing crush, and giving another a fake £20,000 lottery scratchcard.
Earlier the jury heard his co-defendant Mr Phillips was dismissed from the force after pleading guilty to a £250 theft.
The court was told he was caught after an "integrity test", in which a staged raid was carried out.
He was seen taking £240 from a coat and £10 from a bedside cabinet.
The trial continues.
