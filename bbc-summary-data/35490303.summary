Firefighters found the man inside the farmhouse after being called to Pilsley Road in Morton, near Alfreton, at about 20:45 on Wednesday.
They attempted to resuscitate him and paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at the scene.
The cause of the blaze is not yet known, but the fire service and Derbyshire Police said they were investigating.
Group manager Bob Curry, from Derbyshire Fire Service said: "It was a relatively small fire in the lounge of the property which produced a large amount of toxic smoke, and we believe that is what affected the casualty."
