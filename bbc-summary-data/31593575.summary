The break-in happened on Sunday morning in The Grange area.
The veteran woke to discover that five medals were missing, along with a large quantity of cash, two gold wedding bands and three antique watches.
Police said the medals had "great sentimental value" and appealed for witnesses.
Det Insp Alan O'Brien, of Police Scotland, said:  "This is an upsetting incident for the elderly occupant, who is understandably concerned at the loss of several items carrying a great deal of sentimental value.
"We are eager to speak to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in The Grange area overnight from Saturday into Sunday morning.
"The owner is very keen to see the property returned. Anyone who can help us with our inquiries is urged to come forward."
