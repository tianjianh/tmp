The waste, which includes soft toys, plastic bags and photographs, was discovered by the charity that operates Telford Steam Railway.
The site - owned by Network Rail - is near the A4169 near Horsehay, the Shropshire Star reports.
Network Rail said it was supporting an investigation by West Mercia Police to identify the culprits.

Network Rail said it had been monitoring the site to find out who was responsible for the fly-tipping.
Simon Masters, media relations manager, said: "Fly-tipping causes a great amount of misery to those who live nearby, as well as costing the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds in clean-up costs."
Paul Hughes, from Telford Steam Railway, a group which leases a signal box on the site, said he first discovered the dump before Christmas.
"We were doing a routine inspection when we discovered there was some commercial fly-tipping which progressively increased to what has become a huge mountain of waste," he said.
"We are all used to seeing somebody drop off an old sofa or bedspread but this is on a completely different scale."
Telford and Wrekin Council said it was working with the police and the Environment Agency.
