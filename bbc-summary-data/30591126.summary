It follows a deal being signed between the BBC and developers Rightacres to take the design of the Central Square building to the next stage.
Subject to planning permission, work is expected to start next year with staff moving in during 2018.
BBC Wales' director Rhodri Talfan Davies said it was "another important milestone".
Rightacres chief executive Paul McCarthy said: "Their decision to choose Central Square as their preferred site has generated real momentum for the project."
He said he was hopeful the BBC Wales headquarters would be the centre-piece of the development and the planning application "will signal another major milestone in delivering the vision for Central Square".
The project involves 1,200 staff moving from Llandaff. The city's current bus station will also be relocated.
Cardiff council leader Phil Bale said the development would attract further investment into the wider area and act as a catalyst for the local economy and the community.
Work on nearby offices has already started and the regeneration of Central Square is expected to create 500 construction jobs and eventually see 10,000 people working in the new developments.
