[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harlequins were knocked out of the Challenge Cup by defeat at Top 14 side Stade Francais in a match delayed because of a frozen pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A frozen corner at Stade Jean-Bouin meant the game began 95 minutes after the scheduled kick-off time.
Waisea Nayacalevu and Julien Arias put the French side 17-5 up at the break with Mat Luamanu crossing for Quins.
Craig Burden added a third Stade score before Marland Yarde and James Chisholm went over for late tries.
Quins knew they had to win the game to progress to the quarter-finals but the home side went through instead, and will be away to Ospreys in the last eight.
A corner of the pitch was still frozen at the scheduled 13:00 GMT start but play was able to start at 14:35.
