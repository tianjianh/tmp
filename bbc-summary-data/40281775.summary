Tributes have been paid to a beloved member of Rushden Transport Museum and Railway - Alfie, the station cat.

He passed away a few days ago after contracting an unidentified virus.
The feline mysteriously turned up at volunteer-run Rushden Station about 10 years ago just after the previous station cat had passed away, and quickly made it his home.
When he became unwell last week a JustGiving page was set-up for Alfie to pay his vet bills and Â£850 was raised.
The much-loved ginger tom had his own Facebook page with thousands of followers from all over the world.
In a post written about Alfie's death, the author of the page wrote that Alfie's vet bills had been covered by the donations.
The post said the remaining funds would go towards a memorial "in a prominent place" at the station.
Hundreds of people have since written tributes to the cat.
One wrote: "So very sorry to hear of Alfie's passing. He knew how much he was loved, by you, his humans and by everyone he met at the station and his fans!"
Another added: "I have so enjoyed in the last couple of years seeing about all of his doings at the station and how treasured a member of the community he was."
