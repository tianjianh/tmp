A new pitch has been laid at Berlin's Olympic Stadium to replace the damaged surface after the Irish band performed a concert there on 12 July.
And a spokesperson for the stadium has confirmed to BBC Sport that U2 have paid about 90,000 euros (£80,000) towards the total cost of 130,000 euros (£116,000).
Hertha host Liverpool on Saturday, 29 July in a friendly to mark both clubs' 125th anniversaries.
"The pitch will be in perfect condition for the game," Olympic Stadium spokesperson Christoph Meyer said.
"We've done this a lot of times, sometimes even one day before a match."
