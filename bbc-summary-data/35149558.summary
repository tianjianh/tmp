It might not be traditional but who needs a star on top of the Christmas tree when you are one of the biggest football players in the world?

For Wales forward Gareth Bale only a football would do to top off the festive decorations at his home.
And it was not just any ball - it was used in his four-goal display in Real Madrid's 10-2 win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.
The Cardiff-born star tweeted to say it was the "perfect Christmas present".
