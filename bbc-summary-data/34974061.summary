[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of an Irish man on hunger strike in an Egyptian prison have said he is weak and has occasionally lost consciousness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibrahim Halawa has been in jail awaiting trial since August 2013. He was arrested during a siege on the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo.
His sister Somaia said: "He can't take any more.
"He hopes something can be done before the trial."
Ten trial dates have been set since Mr Halawa was detained, but all have so far been postponed.
He was on a family holiday to his parents' homeland when he and three of his sisters were arrested during a crackdown on protests.
The son of a senior Muslim cleric, he was 17 at the time.
His family said he had taken refuge in the Al-Fath mosque during violent clashes between supporters of the democratically-elected ousted President Mohammed Morsi and the security forces.
A postcard campaign launched by his family aims to highlight that he will be 20 on 13 December, two days before his next court appearance.
A spokesman for the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said the Irish embassy in Cairo is continuing to provide "consular assistance to Mr Halawa and to work actively to try to secure positive progress for him at the earliest possible date".
The campaign for his release is supported by Amnesty International and Sinn FÃ©in.
