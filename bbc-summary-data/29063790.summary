Net profits rose 12% to 2.7bn Danish Kroner (Â£290m) after Lego Movie kits "exceeded expectations", the firm said.
Revenue increased by 11%, helped by growth in other Lego product lines such as Lego Technic and Lego Star Wars.
Consumer sales grew by double digits in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, the firm added.
"We are thrilled by the reception of the Lego Movie products that provided a significant boost to our sales during the first half of 2014," said Lego chief financial officer John Goodwin.
Lego Movie products were launched with the release of the film in early 2014.
"It remains to be seen how the line will continue to develop behind the highly anticipated launch of the Lego Movie on DVD in the second half of 2014," Mr Goodwin added.
The firm is controlled by Denmark's richest man, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, who is the grandson of Lego's founder.
