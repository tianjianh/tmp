The 27-year-old left-back made 29 appearances for Torquay last season in his second spell with the Gulls.
Rowe-Turner previously had spells in the National League with Luton Town and Kidderminster Harriers.
The Leicester City youth product is the third defender signed by Chester this summer following the arrivals of Andy Halls and John McCombe.
They will help plug the gap left by star youngster Sam Hughes' six-figure departure to 2016 Premier League champions Leicester City this week, on a three-year deal.
Midfielder Paul Turnbull and strikers Harry White, Nyal Bell and Ross Hannah have also signed for the Bumpers Lane club, taking the number of new signings to seven.
