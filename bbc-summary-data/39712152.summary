World Championship 2017: Neil Robertson needs more 'adrenaline'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Robertson says he will revert to his old style next season and play the sort of aggressive snooker that will fire him up and excite fans.

The Cambridgeshire-based Australian was beaten 13-11 by Marco Fu in the World Championship second round on Tuesday and said his performance was "garbage".
Robertson lost three frames after celebrating by shouting and punching the table when he went 11-10 up.
"Next year I just have to play with passion," the 35-year-old said.
"I won't be giving it a fist pump every frame but I will showing my emotion when I feel like it.

"I've tried to play within myself but I need adrenaline and need to be pumped up to play well otherwise you will see snoring snooker like that.
"I guess towards the end of the frames it was good to watch but apart from that it was absolute garbage.
"The only time I felt like myself was when I gave it the fist pump at 11-10 up and that's the way I have to play.
"I have tried to be that player who plays within himself, but I just can't do that."
Robertson, a 12-time ranking event winner, has struggled for form this season.
He won the Riga Open but has had no major successes, lost in the UK Championship first round and was knocked out in the last eight of the Masters.
Robertson said a change in tactics and approach will benefit both him and the sport.
"At the moment there are probably only three or four players in the world worth watching and I am not one of them," he added.
"It's not the way I want to play the game and the way I want people to watch me play the game.
"To bring more people into the game you need to see the type of snooker the likes of Ronnie (O'Sullivan) and Judd (Trump) and a few of the other top players produce on a consistent basis.
"It's pretty evident that as soon as Ronnie goes out, a large interest from the general public goes from a tournament - Judd as well. I need to be pumped up.
"I will not be running around the table taking 15 seconds a shot, but I am going to play a lot more aggressive and with a lot more freedom."
