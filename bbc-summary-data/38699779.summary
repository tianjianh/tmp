Police were called on Monday to reports of a sudden death at an address in Wellington Court, Burnley, where the body of a baby girl was found.
A post-mortem examination showed she had suffered a number of injuries, Lancashire Police said.
The infant's mother, Rachel Tunstill, 26, was charged with murder on Friday and is due to appear before Preston Crown Court on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man from Burnley has been released without charge and police said they were "completely satisfied" he had no involvement in the baby's death.
Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston said Ms Tunstill was charged "following a complex investigation and after consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service".
