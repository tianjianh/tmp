Simon Greaves's son Harry from Bronygarth, near Oswestry, in Shropshire was visiting friends in Peru and planned a lone expedition on a mountain on 7 April.
The 29-year-old has not been in contact since - which his family says is "out of character".
A Go Fund Me page called The Search For Harry has so far raised Â£13,000 of its Â£25,000 target - to fund flights and search and rescue operations.
Mr Greaves's mother and a cousin, who is a Spanish speaker, flew out on Sunday morning in the hope of finding him.
