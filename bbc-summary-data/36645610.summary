[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Edward I's finest Welsh castles has been virtually completed after 600 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beaumaris Castle on Anglesey was built in the late 13th and early 14th centuries but never finished.
Now visitors can tour the castle using an interactive app which shows how the finished product would have looked.
It follows a Â£170,000 investment by the Welsh Government's historic environment service CADW.
Other site improvements include audio-visual displays, new signage and the addition of a family trail.
Ken Skates, cabinet secretary for economy and infrastructure, said: "Along with Harlech, Conwy and Caernarfon castles, Beaumaris Castle forms one of Wales's only three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, so it's crucial that we continue to strengthen its visitor experience to attract visitors from Wales and beyond."
