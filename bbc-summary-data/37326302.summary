[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 1-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley were unlucky not to grab a first win of the National League season after battling to a draw at Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took a 14th-minute lead when strikers Bobby-Joe Taylor and Alex Flisher combined for the latter to net his fourth goal of the campaign with a tidy finish.
Neither goalkeeper had been threatened after the break, until the bottom club equalised through on-loan striker Reece Webb-Foster, who made space for himself before bending the ball expertly into the far corner.
There were then chances for both sides as Guiseley pushed on, but Adam Boyes' late cutback could not be converted before substitute Jordan Preston went close twice.
