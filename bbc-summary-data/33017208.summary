Kenneth and Rita Boughey were found at their home in the Abbey development at about 21:25 BST on Thursday, after Mrs Boughey's son raised the alarm.
A detective said the pensioners had been dead for a number of weeks.
Post mortem examinations were carried out on Friday and police are waiting for the results of further toxicology tests.
The deaths are still being treated as unexplained.
On Friday, Ch Insp Mark McClarence said they were investigating the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning but were keeping an open mind about what happened.
Mr Boughey, 68, and Mrs Boughey, 79, were originally from Liverpool but had lived in Ballycastle for 10 years.
Ch Insp McClarence appealed to anyone who had spoken to the couple recently to contact police "to assist us and the family in getting to the bottom of what has happened".
Tests for carbon monoxide were carried out by the Fire Service after the alarm was raised, but it was not detected.
"At that stage, it was safe for all the emergency services to enter; there was no sign of carbon monoxide," Ch Insp McClarence said.
"However, we do appreciate that could have been from some time ago and that carbon monoxide may not be a factor now, today."
Forensic investigators have been examining the house.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Cara McShane told BBC Radio Ulster on Friday that the deaths were "absolutely shocking and devastating for this community here in Ballycastle".
"This was a couple who were elderly and had lived in Ballycastle for some time," she said.
"They would have very much kept themselves to themselves, and the area in which they lived would be a relatively quiet area.
"The mood last night was almost eerie and very sombre."
