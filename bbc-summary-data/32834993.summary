[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Borders textile mill which can trace its history back nearly 350 years is facing closure unless a buyer can be found.

Owners Moorbrook Textiles confirmed the move at the Robert Noble's March Street Mill in Peebles.
It said a new owner was the best way to secure "continuation of production" and employment for 87 staff at the site.
A 30-day consultation on the move has started with management continuing to "actively seek" a buyer.
Moorbrook Textiles owns both the Robert Noble and Replin Fabrics brands which are run from the mill.
Robert Noble dates back to 1666, established under the David Ballantyne name in Galashiels.
Replin Fabrics was established in 1945.
Both brands were acquired and brought under Moorbrook Textiles ownership in the 1990s.
The company said that despite "significant investment" the "seasonal and volatile nature of the business" and "changes in global demand" had stopped the mill achieving  "sustainable positive financial results".
Managing director Ian Laird said the brands had strong global reputations for delivering high quality products to worldwide customers.
"We have worked hard to deliver a strong sales pipeline, and we have invested to strengthen the businesses," he said.
He added that both businesses were in a stronger position than they were 10 years ago.
"Despite this, continuing losses mean that if a buyer or alternative solution cannot be found, production at the mill will cease this year," he said.
"We fully acknowledge the impact the potential closure of our Peebles mill would have on the local community and are working closely with all employees, customers,  suppliers and government agencies to minimise this impact.
"It remains our earnest hope that a buyer can be found who can offer a better strategic fit for the excellent products and hardworking workforce at March Street Mills."
Manufacturing at Moorbrook's mill in Ayrshire is unaffected.
Some Peebles staff may be offered the opportunity to relocate to suitable positions in the Ayr business.
