The 40-year-old began his career in rugby league, representing Australia eight times.
Having made the switch to union, New Zealand-born Thorn then went on to earn 59 caps for the All Blacks, winning the World Cup in 2011.
"My goal was to play top-level rugby at 40 and to play well, and I've done that," he told BBC Radio Leicester.
"I've been part of all these teams and it's been awesome but I just think maybe I should do something else."
The former Crusaders, Leinster and Highlanders forward joined the Premiership Tigers last August, and went on to become the oldest captain in the club's history earlier this season.
"I had a few niggles but otherwise I've been really pleased with how I've played here and my body feels really good," he said.
"But it's just got to a stage where mainly I'm just playing here because I want to play."
Leicester are currently fourth in the Premiership, occupying the final play-off spot, with four matches remaining.
However, Thorn says the prospect of ending his career with another title does not give him any more motivation than usual.
"It's more of the same, 20 years of the same, I want to win the trophy every year," he said.
"It's not extra because I'm just so hungry to win stuff - I love it."
