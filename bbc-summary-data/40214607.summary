One thing we know for sure about this election is that the result is definitely not straightforward.
The Conservatives are the largest party but have fewer MPs than before the vote, despite calling the election themselves!
Labour has failed to take power, but the number of votes and seats they've won has gone up.
So how are all those politicians feeling today? Bring on the the emojis!
