The action-packed film, which also debuted at the top of the US box office, took £4.63m.
Comedy musical Pitch Perfect 2 was second placed with £1.87m, while Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron's Mad Max: Fury Road was in third with £1.75m.
Last week's number one, Tomorrowland - A World Beyond, slipped to fourth.

Marvel blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron was at number five in its sixth week of release, taking £883,000.
San Andreas sees Johnson as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot who has to navigate the destruction from Los Angeles to San Francisco to save his own daughter following a magnitude 9 earthquake.
The film also features Kylie Minogue as the sister of one of the key characters - Johnson's estranged wife Emma, played by Carla Gugino.
