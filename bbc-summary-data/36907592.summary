The three-month-old, who is yet to be named or have its gender confirmed, was born to first-time parents at the Leicestershire zoo.
Dr Charlotte Macdonald, director of Life Sciences at the zoo, said it was "really excited" about the birth and the baby's mother De'Arly was "doing a great job".
Diana monkeys are endangered in their native West African habitat, where they are under threat from habitat loss and hunting for bush meat.
The newborn is part of the European Endangered Species Programme.
