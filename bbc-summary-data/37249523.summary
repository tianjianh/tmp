Shopkeepers, police unionists and farmers plan to join hauliers in a "human chain" to demand the north of the Jungle migrant camp is demolished.
Natacha Bouchart, on a visit to Kent, said she would join the protest as the situation had become "unbearable".
Ms Bouchart said the action would show something had to be done.
"There might be chaos and disorder on Monday. This is for a good cause. We want things to change," she said.
"There is chaos every day and every night. We want the French government to take its responsibilities and put an end to this particularly difficult time we are facing."
The Calais mayor met Kent business leaders in Ashford at an event designed to foster stronger cross-border relations.
Former SeaFrance managing director Robin Wilkins warned the blockade could cause "very significant chaos".
"The cross-Channel business is the life blood of this country and of northern France.
"And if you put  a cork in the bottle, there is going to be a tremendous amount of disruption," he said.
On Wednesday, the UK and France pledged "close co-operation" and to "step up" moves to improve the migrant situation in Calais.
