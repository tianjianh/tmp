Uefa is considering closing the Principality Stadium roof for the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff as "clearly there is a security reason".

Giorgio Marchetti, director of competitions at European football's governing body, said talks were taking place with police.
Security concerns have been raised since explosions hit the Borussia Dortmund team bus in Germany.
The trophy arrived in Cardiff on Friday. The final is held on 3 June.
"We are always reviewing our security measures," said Mr Marchetti.
It could be the first Champions League final played under a roof.
A possible roof closure at the Principality Stadium had been suggested because of a fears of a drone attack on what is described as the biggest club football game in the world.
"The police have to consider all potential possibilities," said First Minister Carwyn Jones.
"Around those possibilities there has been a discussion whether the roof should be closed or not.
"But there is no specific threat of a drone attack."
Mr Marchetti has said any decision regrinding roof closure will be made closer to the match "and part of the overall assessment".
"The roof is normally there for other reasons," he said.
"Clearly there is a security reason to consider closing the roof and this will be considered. It is in our discussions with the police."
"Security is our number one priority at all of our events."
The trophy arrived in Cardiff on Friday afternoon ahead of the city hosting world football's biggest club final.
It was flown over from Uefa headquarters in Switzerland along with the Women's Champions League trophy.
Crowds gathered outside Cardiff Castle to see Wales football legend Ian Rush and the Wales women's team manager Jayne Ludlow carry out both competition trophies.
It was led through the city in a loud and colourful parade before being taken to the Principality Stadium - or the National Stadium of Wales as it is being called by UEFA for the matches.
The trophies will then go on tour around Wales in the build up to the finals.
Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Monaco and Real Madrid are vying for a place in the men's final.
The women's final will be held at the Cardiff City Stadium two days earlier.
The Champions League final has been held in the UK four times previously, at Wembley twice, Old Trafford and Hampden Park.
