[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a string of saves to secure a Champions League draw against Bayer Leverkusen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The France international superbly kept out Javier Hernandez's close-range shot, and pushed away low drives from Charles Aranguiz and Admir Mehmedi.
Dele Alli should have done better at the other end when he powerfully headed wide from six yards out.
Team-mate Vincent Janssen hit the bar and, from the rebound, Erik Lamela had an effort tipped over by Bernd Leno.
Spurs will be thankful to man-of-the-match Lloris for keeping a clean sheet in a match in which they had more of the possession but their hosts had the better chances.
The former Lyon player made six saves at the BayArena, three of which were high quality:
Mauricio Pochettino's side remain second in Group E, and have conceded just seven goals in 11 games in all competitions this season. Their only defeat came in the opening group game against Monaco last month.
Tottenham are playing in European football's elite competition for the first time in five seasons, and - three games in - they have struggled to find their best form.
A draw is by no means a poor result away from home, but they will need to improve significantly in the final third if they are to progress.
Spurs had six shots, none of which were in the second half, and worked goalkeeper Leno only once. In contrast, Leverkusen had 13 shots in the second 45 minutes.
In the continued absence of Harry Kane, lone striker Janssen lacked service, while former Leverkusen man Son Heung-min, who scored 21 goals in 62 games for the Bundesliga side, barely had a sniff.
But among the positives was the performance of full-back Kieran Trippier, who was playing for only the third time this season. The former Burnley man made more tackles (four), clearances (seven) and interceptions (three) than any of his team-mates.
Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris: "You need a bit of luck in that kind of action and this time I saved (from Javier Hernandez).
"It was a key moment but it was not the only one. We should have scored in the first half and then the game would have been much different."
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "I am not disappointed. After the game, I think it is a good point for us.
"It was a very tough game. In the first half we deserved more and in the second they got better. I am pleased with the point.
"In the second half I think they played better than us and started to dominate the game. We need to be positive - it is in our hands to go through to the next round."
Tottenham are back in Premier League action on Saturday as they travel to Bournemouth (kick-off 12:30 BST). Their next Champions League match is on Wednesday, 2 November when they welcome Leverkusen to Wembley (kick-off 19:45 BST).
