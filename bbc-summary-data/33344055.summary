Parliament is 'creaking' and devolution 'messy', says MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK Parliament is "creaking" and the devolution settlement "messy", a north Wales Labour MP has told the Commons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ynys Mon MP Albert Owen said he backed devolution but it was "unbalanced", "asymmetrical" and needed "adjusting".
Calling for a constitutional convention, he said he did not believe UK ministers' plans for "English votes for English laws" would help matters.
Earlier, he told BBC Radio Wales they did not allow for MPs with constituents crossing the border for services.
Speaking during a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, Mr Owen said that he had supported devolution since the 1970s, when many in his party did not, and now he wanted to "go a step further than my party".
"I believe in a federal United Kingdom," he said.
"I think we should have an English parliament and I think we should have an English parliament within the United Kingdom and I feel we should retain a UK parliament for foreign affairs, for other bigger issues that concern the whole of the United Kingdom."
But Mr Owen said that devolution had to be "practical" and "real" because it concerned health and transport services, which were  often east-west in the UK.
He said that most of the decisions that affect Wales were made in the Department for Transport.
"We have the debacle over the West Coast line, which affects not just my constituents, the whole of north Wales and the whole of England.
"It's an interconnector and a corridor between Ireland and London, going through north Wales.
"So it would be, I think, crazy, for north Wales MPs not to have a say, not to be able to question the secretary of state when big decisions go wrong like that."
Newport East Labour MP Jessica Morden said that in south Wales 48% of the population lived within 25 miles of the border and in constituencies like hers many Welsh people used education and health services in England.
Conservative MP James Gray said: "My constituents in North Wiltshire may well use the National Health Service in Wales, but I can have no say whatsoever over the way the National Health Service in Wales is run.
"Why should it be one way but not the other?"
Conservative MP for Eddisbury and former assembly member Antoinette Sandbach said the "reality" of Welsh devolution was that "the decisions of the assembly led to a centralising of power out of the regions of Wales and into Cardiff".
