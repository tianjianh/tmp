The 27-year-old has signed a two-year extension to his previous deal despite only playing 24 games in all competitions last season.
Montero arrived at the Liberty Stadium in 2014 from Mexican side Morelia and has gone on to make 63 appearances.
The Ecuadorian international has scored one Premier League goal for the Swans, against Stoke in May 2015.
Montero said it had been an easy decision to commit his future to Swansea.
"I feel at home here," Montero told the club website.
"The people are really warm and lovely within the club, as well as the fans.
"I'm happy on the field and I think when you're happy on the pitch everything else goes hand in hand.
"I hope I can stay here for many years."
