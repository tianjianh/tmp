The Executive Office said the move was made "to enable doctors to conduct a medical assessment".
Mr McGuinness was due to join the first minister on the trade mission.
A spokesperson said he was "fulfilling his responsibilities as deputy first minister working with his departmental political advisers".
"There has been no disruption to the work of The Executive Office during this period," added the spokesperson.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: "I'm sure everybody who values his work will send best wishes to Martin, Bernie and their family.
"I met Martin as normal at Stormont on Monday. I have been in regular contact with him since and he is totally committed to fulfilling his duties."
