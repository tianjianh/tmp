Gabe Olaseni scored 17 points, Dan Clark 12 and Ben Gordon 11 for the hosts at the Copper Box.
GB led by 11 points early in the third quarter but Adam Hanga and David Vojvoda inspired a Hungary rally.
GB are likely to need a win in Macedonia in Wednesday's penultimate game to keep qualifying hopes.
Saturday's victory means Hungary are likely to qualify as group winners.
Britain, whose final game is in Luxembourg next weekend, will hope to be one of four second-placed teams that qualify from the seven qualifying groups.

The police were called after a minor disturbance among Hungary fans in one end of the venue.
GB, coached by Joe Prunty, played confidently and led for nearly all of the first three quarters.
In the fourth, GB took the lead again (71-70) when Dan Clark hit a three-pointer with five minutes and 45 seconds remaining.
That proved to be their last score for almost five minutes, as Hungary, the unbeaten group leaders, hit important shots to secure the win.
After the match, Prunty said it was a "hard fought game by both teams", adding: "Hungary made some plays in the second half that you have to give them credit for.
"Every game's important - that hasn't changed a bit. The reality is that this was a big game, like every single one of them before it."
