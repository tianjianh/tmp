The 30-year-old's arrival comes four days after Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia.
However, a statement on the club website made it clear they had been pursuing Ruddy "throughout the summer".
"This is a bittersweet feeling for me - it is good to be here but the circumstances could have been better," said Ruddy.
"Having played against Carl over a number of years, I know what a good goalkeeper he is so it would have been fantastic for the club to have had us competing and bringing out the best in each other.
"Now it is a situation where football takes a back seat for Carl and everyone's thoughts are with him."
