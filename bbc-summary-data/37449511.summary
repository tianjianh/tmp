Both Jenna Coleman, who stars as the young queen, and Tom Hughes, who plays Prince Albert, will return to their roles, ITV said.
Daisy Goodwin will also continue to write and executive produce the series.
Last month, the opening episode of Victoria attracted an average of 5.4 million viewers, not including those watching on catch-up services.
Goodwin said: "Even though she reigned in the 19th Century, Victoria is a heroine for our times.
"In the next series she faces the very modern dilemma of how to juggle children with her husband and her job.
"As Victoria will discover, it's hard to be a wife, a mother and ruler of the most powerful nation on Earth."
