The incident happened at about 11:20 in Croftside Avenue in the south side of the city.
The driver of the lorry has been taken to the Victoria Infirmary for observation.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said no-one else was injured in the crash. The vehicle has been recovered from the scene.
Neighbour Julie Beckett, 43, who witnessed the incident, said: "I was drawing the curtains. The driver was out cold by the looks of it, slumped over the wheel.
"Two boys were outside the lorry collecting the bins, they looked alarmed.
"The first ambulance came quickly."
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: "We are aware of an incident in which a bin lorry left the road earlier this morning.
"The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital to be checked over. It is a huge relief that no-one appears to have been injured.
"We are assisting the police with their inquiries."
