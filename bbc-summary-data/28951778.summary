Dr Bennie, 51, succeeds Dr Brian Keighley as the leader of the British Medical Association (BMA) Scotland.
He said there were pressing issues in the NHS that needed to be addressed whatever the outcome of next month's referendum on Scottish independence.
Dr Bennie highlighted the structure of training and recruitment problems.
The new BMA Scotland leader graduated from Glasgow University Medical School in 1986 and trained in hospitals in the west of Scotland before taking up a consultant post in Glasgow in 1997.
He moved to work in Paisley in 2007.
Aberdeen-based psychiatrist Dr Sally Winning and Glasgow-based GP, Dr Alan McDevitt have been elected joint deputy chairmen of the BMA's Scottish Council.
Dr Bennie said: "I am immensely proud to have been elected as chairman of the BMA in Scotland.  It is a great honour to represent and lead my profession at such a unique time in Scotland's constitutional history.
"However, regardless of the outcome of the referendum in September, there are pressing issues in our NHS that must be addressed, especially the future structure of training for doctors and the current recruitment problems across general practice and hospital specialties."
