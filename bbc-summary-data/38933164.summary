[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene on the A944 near Loch Skene at about 11:40.
A 44-year-old man and five-year-old girl who were both in the car were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
The man has serious but not life-threatening injuries. The girl was treated for minor injuries.
The crash involved a blue Vauxhall Corsa and a blue Scania Tipper lorry.
The car driver had to be freed from his vehicle by firefighters. The lorry driver was uninjured.
Road closures were in place at the Dunecht junction and the junction with the B9126. They have since been reopened.
Sgt Steve Manson, from Police Scotland, said: "I would appeal to anyone who saw either vehicle in the lead-up to the incident, or indeed the collision itself, to please contact Police on 101."
