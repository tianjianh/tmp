[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town v Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town midfielder Emyr Huws, goalscorer in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Brentford, has a hamstring injury and is a doubt for the visit of Wolves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Hyam is sidelined for two to three weeks with an ankle injury.
Wolves take on former manager Mick McCarthy's Ipswich looking to avoid a seventh straight defeat.
Ivan Cavaleiro returns to the squad after eight games out with a knee injury, but suspended defender Mike Williamson is missing for the visitors.
On his first league start in 15 months, Williamson was sent off five minutes before full-time in Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Reading for a second bookable offence.
As well as going out of the FA Cup at home to Chelsea, Wolves have lost five league games in a row to fall within a point of the Championship drop zone.
