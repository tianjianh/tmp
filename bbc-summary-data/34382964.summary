Dundee United have confirmed the departure of manager Jackie McNamara and his backroom team.

In a statement, the Scottish Premiership club said the 41-year-old's exit was "mutually agreed".
It became clear on Saturday that McNamara had been relieved of his duties after the 2-1 defeat at 10-man St Johnstone.
The club had already announced that development squad assistant boss Dave Bowman would be caretaker manager.
Assistant coach Simon Donnelly, first-team coach Darren Jackson and goalkeeping coach Craig Hinchcliffe have also left the club.
United chairman Stephen Thompson, who spoke with McNamara immediately after the defeat at McDiarmid Park, will hold a news conference at Tannadice on Tuesday.
The Tannadice outfit said the club and McNamara "agreed that a change was required to improve the results", with United second from bottom of the Scottish Premiership after one win in nine games.
In a personal statement, Thompson said: "I'd like to personally thank Jackie McNamara for his efforts during his tenure, which saw him become the longest-serving manager in the league.
"Everyone at the club knows our recent run of results and current position in the league isn't good enough and we all want the club back to where it should be - challenging for silverware and European qualification.
"We've finished in the top six for eight consecutive seasons and reached four cup finals in that time against a backdrop of reducing the club's debt significantly.
"Although this has not been easy, it's the standard we have set here at United."
McNamara, who took charge in January 2013 after leaving Partick Thistle, led United to two cup finals.
Thompson added: "This is a big club with a large squad and playing budget, so we won't be short of interest from top managers within the game.
"We have one of the most exciting young squads in British football and a lot to be upbeat about.
"The next manager will be taking on a talented bunch of players at an exciting time."
Caretaker Bowman, a former United midfielder who won six Scotland caps and had a spell as caretaker boss at Livingston in 2007, will be assisted by United captain Sean Dillon.
United travel to bottom-of-the-table Partick Thistle on Saturday.
