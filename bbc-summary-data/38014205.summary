Cocker Spaniel Darcy had an emergency operation to remove her spleen after the fall in Glascarnoch Dam in the Highlands in July.
Veterinary surgeon Hal Drummond said the two-year-old, from Kellas near Dundee, had made an "amazing" recovery.
Darcy sustained a shattered femur, leg and pelvis fractures in the fall.
She was announced on Wednesday as the only Scottish finalist in the PDSA Pet Survivor Awards 2016.
Mr Drummond said he was delighted to be reunited with Darcy.
He said: "It's amazing to see her doing so well.
"I didn't think she'd be walking nearly as well as she is.
"Both ops have been a great success and she's done amazing just to recover from it."
The vet said that when Darcy was first brought to the team at Conanvet in Dingwall, it was uncertain whether she would survive.
He said: "There was a very guarded prognosis at the time, but it was a group effort by the whole practice.
"She was collapsed and in shock and obviously her legs were in a bad way.
"There was quite a lot of blood in her abdomen, so we had to take her to surgery straight away."
Darcy has undergone months of rehabilitation in Dundee and is on the way to a full recovery.
Owner Gordon Lyon said: "Given the nature and severity of the injuries she suffered we thought on a number of occasions that she wouldn't be with us at all.
"To see her running around like this is nothing short of miraculous.
"It's blown us away, what she's had to cope with and how much she's actually come through."
