[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Nick Gubbins makes maiden Middlesex century

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Gubbins scored his first Middlesex century as their batsmen closed down Somerset's commanding total at Lord's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gubbins (109) hit 15 boundaries as he enjoyed a 198-run partnership with opener Sam Robson (99).
Robson fell one run short of a fourth ton of the season, being bowled by Joe Leach (4-64) for 99 as the Somerset bowlers remained accurate.
Despite a middle-order wobble, Paul Stirling (85) played solidly as Middlesex reached 407-9 at stumps.
Resuming on 139-0, Robson and Gubbins continued their excellent opening partnership before Robson was dismissed.
Gubbins brought up his century from 208 balls before nicking Jim Allenby (3-51) to Marcus Trescothick at slip.
There was some hope for Somerset as Middlesex lost four wickets for 39 runs, but Stirling steadied the innings.
He fell to Leach five overs before stumps after pushing Middlesex into a lead, but a draw still looks the most likely result.
