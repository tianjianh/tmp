The 23-year-old was the only competitor to score more than 90 points out of a possible 100 in Cardrona, New Zealand, opening with 90.20 before posting 93.40.
He finished ahead of Norway's Oystein Braaten (89.80) and American Joss Christensen (87.20).
Earlier this month, Woods won the New Zealand Freeski Open.
In January, Mammoth in California will host the second of the five World Cup events, followed by Park City in Utah, Phoenix Park in South Korea and Silvaplana in Switzerland.
