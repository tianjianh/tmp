Craig Gordon hopes an impressive display against Manchester City can help him retain a regular starting position at Celtic.

The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage.
Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend.
"I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do," he said.
"Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. There is no bigger incentive to play well and keep your place."
Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August.
Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury.
De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike.
"This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me," said Gordon.
"We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side."
Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: "It's right up there. The atmosphere was just incredible.
"The noise was unbelievable. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. I couldn't have shouted any louder."
Gordon, capped 44 times for Scotland, insists his self-belief has not wavered since dropping to the bench and is hoping manager Brendan Rodgers will find it difficult to reinstate De Vries.
"I've always been confident in what I'm able to do," he added. "It was other people saying my confidence was gone.
"If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that.
"The other side of that is that I want to play every game.
"I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength."
