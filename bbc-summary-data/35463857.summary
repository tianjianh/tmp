[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old joined Rovers in June, but has struggled with injuries and has only played two games since October.
He told BBC Radio Nottingham: "The boss [Darren Ferguson] felt I needed games, having been out for the best part of four months, to get me up to speed."
The Magpies have also terminated the contract of former Belgian international defender Gill Swerts.
