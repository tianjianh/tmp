South African batsman Kelly Smuts hit the highest score in the 125-year history of the Lancashire League on Sunday - making 211 out of a total of 323-6 for Todmorden against Enfield.

The 27-year-old, who is his amateur team's paid professional, surpassed ex-Australia captain Michael Clarke's unbeaten 200 for Ramsbottom in 2002.
Smuts' innings came off 139 balls and contained 23 fours and 11 sixes.
He later took 4-16 with the ball as his side wrapped up a 182-run win.
Clarke, who is currently commentating on the Indian Premier League, tweeted Smuts his congratulations and joked: "This means I need to have another year with Rammy."
The league's next two highest scores are held by West Indies greats Everton Weekes (195* in 1949) and Learie Constantine (192* in 1937).
Smuts - the younger brother of South Africa all-rounder JJ Smuts - is no stranger to records since he also holds the distinction of being the first player to score a century and take 13 wickets in the same first-class match in South Africa.
He achieved that feat playing for Eastern Province in 2016 - becoming only the 25th player in the world to achieve it.
