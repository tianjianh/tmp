[SN]TITLE[SN]
Haringey children's club historic abuse claim surfaces

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has come forward claiming he was raped as a child at a children's club in north London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the alleged abuse was inflicted in the 1990s by an adult at Haringey Adventure and Recreation Team that no longer exists.
Very little was known about the club, which seemed to have been run informally at the weekends and after-school, the Met Police said.
Anyone with information about abuse at the club is asked to contact police.
Alternatively, contact Haringey Child Abuse Investigation Team or the NSPCC.
