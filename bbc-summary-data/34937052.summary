[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The renowned Welsh actress Siân Phillips says leaving Wales in search of stardom left her "heartbroken".

She makes the revelation in a new series of  BBC One Wales' Coming Home.
A Bafta and Tony award winning actress, she first made a name for herself on the London stage, and was married to film star Peter O'Toole for 20 years.
In the show aired on Friday evening, she returns to the former Neath Port Talbot village that was her home, at Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen.
She discovers how family was involved in the Battle of Waterloo - and delves into a long-standing mystery surrounding a photograph of an elderly woman clutching a Welsh bible.
She also explores her family's connections with the area and the old Glamorganshire counties dating back to the 1600s.
Phillips was made a CBE in 2000 for her services to drama, but said the decision to pursue her career as a young woman was never going to be easy.
"I realised I wasn't going to be able to stay in this wonderful place," she said.
"I was heartbroken, I broke my heart quietly and secretly.
"I really appreciated all of my childhood, all the places, all those villages."
One chapter in her life story she also revisits is at the National Eisteddfod - where she gets to recite a poem she originally performed at the festival as a 13-year-old girl.
Coming Home: Siân Phillips is on BBC One Wales on Friday, November 27 at 20:30 GMT.
