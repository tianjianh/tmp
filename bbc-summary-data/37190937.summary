Jersey sports academy approved against planning advice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a multimillion-pound sporting academy have been approved in Jersey, against planning advice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre, which was proposed by former rugby player and coach Ben Harvey, will allow elite athletes to train in sports from rugby to surfing.
Planners recommended it be rejected because of concerns about its community value and the loss of green space.
But the Planning Committee approved it on the condition it was made available long-term for everyone in the island.
Only 40% of the centre is earmarked for schools and sports groups to use while the rest will be a private members-only gym.
However, Mr Harvey said it was aimed "primarily at the children of the island", with schools getting free access to the facility and to staff.
It will be built next to the rugby club in St Peter.
