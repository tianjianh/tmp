Legal issues delay Portlaoise hospital baby deaths report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The publication of a report into baby deaths at a hospital in the Republic of Ireland has been delayed due to legal issues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An investigation into the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise was set up after five babies died in the maternity unit between 2006 and 2012.
A draft of the report was recently circulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority.
But the Health Service Executive has raised the possibility of legal action.
It is objecting to the report being published in its current form, and has sought further information and documentation from the HIQA on the draft report.
The report has to go to the HIQA board for approval and then to minister for health Leo Varadkar before publication.
The investigation followed a TV report by Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰  that raised questions about the unit.
The HIQA appointed a six-member team to examine the matter and its draft report was finished recently.
The HIQA is to give more information to those named in its report with regard to its findings.
