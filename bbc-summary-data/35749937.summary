Grand National: Randox Health to replace Crabbie's as sponsor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Grand National will be sponsored by Randox Health from 2017 after the healthcare company agreed a "multi-million pound" five-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland-based firm replaces alcoholic drink Crabbie's, which will sponsor the Aintree race for the final time on 9 April.
This year's race will start at 17:15 BST, an hour later than previously.
Many Clouds won the 2015 Grand National to give jockey Leighton Aspell his second consecutive victory in the race.
"Though British racing has no written-down policy of actively seeking non-bookmaker backers, everyone accepts it's the case, so it'll be cock-a-hoop to have landed a second new one for a major event in three months after technology company Timico took over the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
"Gambling is, of course, part of racing's DNA, but the sport's also desperately keen to show that via high-profile platforms like Aintree and Cheltenham it has considerably more breadth than that.
"And with bookies that aren't 'Authorised Betting Partners' currently being shown the sponsorship door, further opportunities to demonstrate this may follow."
