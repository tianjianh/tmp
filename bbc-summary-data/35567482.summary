[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers celebrated their first match under their new Jordanian owners with a victory over Morecambe that takes them up to fifth in League Two.

The Al-Qadi family saw their side go behind to Jamie Devitt's penalty when Tom Parkes was penalised for handball.
But Rory Gaffney equalised with a 12-yard volley after away goalkeeper Barry Roche's unconvincing attempts to deal with a Danny Leadbitter cross.
And substitute Billy Bodin's close-range header earned victory late on.
Rovers go sixth, five points adrift of the top three, while Morecambe are in 17th place, 11 points clear of the relegation zone.
