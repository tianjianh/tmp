The 26-year-old will miss Saturday's Premier League clash with Manchester City at Stamford Bridge as well as games against Aston Villa and Everton.
The Football Association charge, which Costa denied, related to an incident in the 12th minute of Tuesday's League Cup semi-final second leg in London.
Blues boss Jose Mourinho said the incident was "absolutely accidental".
Costa, a Â£32m signing from Atletico Madrid, has scored 17 goals in 19 Premier League games this season.
The incident, which occurred in front of the dugouts but was missed by the match officials, was subsequently reviewed on video by referee Michael Oliver.
Chelsea cannot appeal against the decision reached by the independent commission hearing.
