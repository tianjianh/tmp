A Hibernian-supporting lotto syndicate have said their future season tickets are secure after a £1m win.

The six Hibs fans from Edinburgh are celebrating after matching numbers in the Lotto Medal Draw on 27 August.
The retired group of friends, who will each receive £166,666.66, have been playing since the first draw in 1994.
Syndicate leader Douglas Gibson, 72, said his wife Sheena discovered the windfall after checking her emails for birthday messages.
He said: "We phoned all the other syndicate members and they were in such shock. I don't think they truly believed it until they saw the email for themselves.
"It was good timing as we had Sheena's 70th birthday party that Sunday, so got the chance to celebrate together with family and friends.
"Sheena was so excited she even printed and laminated the congratulations email from the National Lottery and was showing everyone at the party her 'best birthday card ever' - I don't know how I'm going to top that in the years to come."
Mr Gibson said his wife has treated herself to a shopping spree and a few of the syndicate members have already been out to purchase new cars.
He added: "I think I'll wait until the money is in my bank before I buy anything substantial.
"We'll be looking into a new car along with a luxury cruise. This certainly secures my season ticket for Hibs for many years to come as well."
The other syndicate members are: William Mackie, 65, Jim Robertson, 65, David Hannan, 65, David Hastie, 71, and Stewart McLaren, 73.
The friends named the syndicate the ScottieHibbies, after the football club and their old local, The Scottie Pub.
There were an extra 67 prizes up for grabs on 27 August to celebrate each of the medals won by Team GB at the Rio Olympics.
