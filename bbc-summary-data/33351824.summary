Formula 1 is not competitive enough, say majority of fans

Nearly 90% of Formula 1 fans want the sport to be more competitive, according to a survey conducted by the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA).

More than 215,000 fans from 194 countries took part in the survey, which ran for two weeks following the Monaco Grand Prix.
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was the most popular driver, while 60% wanted refuelling to return.
GPDA chairman Alex Wurz said the most striking result was a lack of new fans.
"We know that refuelling is probably not the answer to increase the action on track," Wurz told BBC Sport, "because we have other data from the teams.
"But it is interesting that we have people who followed F1 for the first time in the 2000s, when there was refuelling, and they hark back to that era as the best - as all of us do for the times we first became interested in a sport - and there are no new fans to counter-balance their views."
F1's stakeholders have been considering reintroducing refuelling, which was banned at the end of 2009, but this is likely to be overturned at a key meeting on Wednesday because data proves it reduces the amount of on-track overtaking.
Other key findings of the survey were:
Wurz said the GPDA would now spend some time analysing the detail of the data before meeting to discuss the findings and the next steps at the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend on 24-26 July.
A total of 217,756 people took part across 194 countries, with the UK, France and the United States the top three respondent countries.
The respondents voted F1 websites as their number one source for fan information, with 55% picking that medium and only 50% television.
And more than 50% of respondents said they had stopped watching races live since the sport moved to pay television.
In France, where the first grand prix was held in 1906 but which has not hosted a race since 2008, there has been no free-to-air coverage of F1 since 2013.
