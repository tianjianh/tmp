The Mitsubishi L200 he was driving came off the westbound carriageway near Livingston at about 01:15 on Saturday.
The man was seriously injured and died a short time later. The road was closed for five hours to allow for recovery and investigation work.
Police officers have appealed for witnesses to the crash - or anyone with information about it - to contact them.
Sgt Andy Gibb said: "Sadly, a 34-year-old man has died as a result of a road traffic collision on the M8 during the early hours of Saturday, May 14.
"Our thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time and we will continue to provide them with support as and when they need it.
"Our inquiries into the full circumstances surrounding this collision are ongoing and I ask anyone who was travelling on the M8 at around 1:15am on Saturday, May 14th, to contact us immediately if not already done so."
