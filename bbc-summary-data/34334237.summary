PCs Nikki Scott and Rob Hughes' patrol car was flagged down in Telford, Shropshire, by a man whose wife was waiting for a taxi to go to hospital.
"We initially thought they were lost and were asking for directions, but we soon realised his wife was about to give birth," PC Scott said.
The mother and her new daughter are recovering well from the birth.
PC Scott said: "By the time we got out of the car, the baby was already starting. It was very very exciting.
"Lovely local people brought out blankets and towels, and the baby was screaming and crying so I knew it was fine and had an airway."
The West Mercia Police officers kept the baby warm until an ambulance crew arrived to cut the umbilical cord.
"We were just on a routine patrol, and we never expected to deliver a baby, but it was great. It was very emotional," PC Scott said.
