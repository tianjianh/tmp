[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A call centre manager who posed as abused teenage girls on Facebook and had sexual conversations with older men, has been jailed for 12 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Yates, 31, from Wrexham, also had indecent images of children and other extreme pictures involving sex acts, Mold Crown Court heard.
He had a 15-year-old girl on his friends list he had arranged to meet saying "my father will pick you up".
Yates admitted being a public nuisance and possessing indecent images.
Judge David Hale said it was fortunate Yates did not meet the 15-year-old girl but it showed the defendant was prepared to go further, making it an aggravating factor in the case.
The court heard over the course of a year Yates had been using his fake Facebook accounts of three girls who he said were being "abused left, right and centre" by their father.
He regularly uploaded and cropped photographs and put them on the accounts, pretending to be the abused sisters.
They were put on social media groups which attracted like-minded people, the court was told.
"It is bizarre behaviour by you," the judge said. "It is very worrying conduct indeed.
"It is stupid to say you were just interested and doing research. You were getting some perverted kick out of it."
The judge said it was a case of persistent distribution of outrageous pornography, encouraging other people who were that way inclined to have somewhere they could feed their own feelings.
Peter Moss, defending, said his client could do with "a bit of a steer" to ensure that such offending did not happen again.
