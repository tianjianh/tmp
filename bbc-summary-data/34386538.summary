Robert Hanna, who is 47 and from Carrickfergus, went out to sea at about 12:50 BST on Monday at Portmuck. He was due to collect his son from school at 15:00 BST, but failed to return.
The alarm was raised with the coastguard at about 19:00 BST.
Four helicopters, six lifeboats and four coastguard teams have been assisting in the search operation.
A maritime operations controller at Belfast Coastguard, Alex Smith, appealed to the public to report any possible sightings.
"We conducted a search last night until the light beat us, and that search is continuing from first light this morning," Mr Smith told BBC Radio Ulster.
"We would just ask the public along the coastline from Portmuck down to Gobbins, and north from Larne to Ballycastle, to keep a sharp lookout for any debris or anything suspicious they see along the coast.
"And equally anybody that is out at sea today, if they could contact the coastguard - either by dialling 999 and asking for the coastguard - or contact us on a VHF [very high frequency] radio."
Rescue teams from both sides of the Irish border and from Campbeltown in Scotland are involved in the operation.
"We have resources from Malin Head [County Donegal], their rescue helicopter has assisted with our search," Mr Smith said.
"We have lifeboats launched from Campbeltown and from Red Bay.  Including that, we have the Larne lifeboat out and coastguard rescue teams all along the coast assisted with the search," Mr Smith said.
The search was previously extended along the County Antrim coast from Carrickfergus to Glenarm.
On the other side of Belfast Lough, searches have also been taking place between Crawfordsburn and Donaghadee in County Down.
A distress broadcast has also been issued to fishing vessels in the area.
