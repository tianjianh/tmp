Doosan Babcock, Clyde Union Pumps and the Weir Group are among the companies poised to win deals worth more than Â£1.3bn to build Hinkley Point C.
The power station will provide 25,000 jobs during the construction phase.
A final decision is expected in the coming months, after which the contracts will be signed.
France's EDF Energy is leading the consortium to build Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which was given the go-ahead in October 2013.  It was one of eight places initially identified in England and Wales as potential sites for new nuclear power stations.
The two reactors at Hinkley will provide power for about 60 years. It is hoped the plant will meet about 7% of the UK's demand.
EDF said the companies had won preferred bidder status after an "open and fair competition".
The company has estimated that more than 60% of the construction cost will be placed with UK firms, against an initial estimate of 57%.
Out of the 25,000 jobs provided during construction, about 1,000 will be apprenticeships.
EDF Energy chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz, said: "Hinkley Point C will be at the forefront of the revitalisation of the UK's industrial and skills base, and we have worked hard to build a robust supply chain to support new nuclear in the UK.
"The project will boost industrial stamina in the UK and kick-start the new nuclear programme. Experience gained at Hinkley Point will help firms be successful in nuclear projects around the world."
