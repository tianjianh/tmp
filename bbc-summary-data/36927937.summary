[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morley fatal crash motorist was 'driving like a lunatic'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A motorist was driving "like a lunatic" when he caused a crash which killed two teenage passengers and severely injured two others, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Wharton, 14, and Rhy Baker, 13, died when Thomas McMeekin crashed into a tree in Morley, near Leeds, on 7 March.
The defendant and a teenage passenger were also left paralysed by the crash, Leeds Crown Court was told.
McMeekin, of Bruntcliffe Road, Morley, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving.
One witness told the hearing McMeekin had driven "like a lunatic".
He was accused of "showing off" while driving the car, which had been bought for him by his mother just five days before the crash.
The court heard he had advertised "lifts cheaper than taxis" on social media.
He will be sentenced next month.
