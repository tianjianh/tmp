However, she warned that there are still significant obstacles to be overcome.
Ms Villiers was speaking to BBC NI's The View programme amid speculation that agreement between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in may be imminent.
She said there was a degree of hope because of the commitment of the parties to get an agreement.
"I think it is possible that we could have a deal next week," she said.
"I am realistic about the state of the talks.
"As I have said I think that the gap between the parties on some key issues has been closing but there are some difficult problems still to be resolved."
