A 500-year-old great hall which inspired the design of Hogwarts' dining hall in the Harry Potter films has been saved from serious fire damage.

The Renaissance-era building at Oxford University's Christ Church College was evacuated on Saturday lunchtime when fire started in a hot plate area.
Crews from four stations were called to tackle the fire which caused smoke logging to the building.
Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue praised college staff for their swift actions.
Incident commander Paul Webster said: "The quick thinking of the college staff, whose procedures ensured everyone was evacuated safely, and the quick response from the fire and rescue service helped to reduce the impact of the fire on the premises and mitigated damage to the historic building."
The hall, described on the college's website as the "finest surviving section of the college's original foundation", was completed in the 1520s and has been in almost constant use since.
The makers of the Harry Potter films used the site as one of their filming locations and later built a replica of the hall in their London studios.
