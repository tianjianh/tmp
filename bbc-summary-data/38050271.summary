[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new owners of a Scots armoured vehicle firm bought out of administration have said they are "desperate" to speak to former staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull-based Martin Williams Ltd took over Penman Engineering near Dumfries last week.
The Heathhall site employed about 140 staff before it went into administration earlier this year.
Director Nick Williams said they had already spoken to some former workers but were keen to hear from others.
He said: "We are actively engaging with some former staff but we're still desperate to hear from the rest of the old workforce together with any design and production engineers."
The company believes it could bring the workforce back to its former levels or even beyond during 2017.
Fellow director Chris Williams added: "We will transfer work from our Hull site to Dumfries in a bid to keep a steady production flow.
"The area has great pool of engineering skill and abilities which we need to tap into.
"We intend to continue to invest in the Dumfries site and by this time next year, Penman will be bigger and better than ever."
