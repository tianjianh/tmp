International friendly: Northern Ireland 1-0 New Zealand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Boyce scored his first Northern Ireland goal to secure a friendly win over New Zealand in Belfast.

The Ross County striker cut inside before rifling low into the net after six minutes and the hosts dominated the remainder of the first half.
New Zealand finally posed a threat after the break with substitute Kosta Barbarouses denied by the woodwork.
It was a deserved victory and a good workout for next week's crucial World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan.
Boyce jinked past his marker with a step-over and his left-foot strike whistled past a flat-footed Stefan Marinovic.
Northern Ireland should have added to their advantage but an improved All Whites side almost clinched a draw when Barbarouses curled his post onto the post.
The absence of Conor Washington and Jamie Ward gave Boyce and Josh Magennis a chance to shine in attack and they impressed in their 45 minutes together.
All eyes were on Boyce after top scoring in the Scottish Premiership last season and he linked up with Magennis for the only goal.
They complemented each other to form a promising partnership which gives boss Michael O'Neill a selection headache for the Baku qualifier.
Azerbaijan will provide a tougher test and O'Neill may pack the midfield with just one up top.
Tom Flanagan had a solid debut in defence although his mistake let in Barbarouses for New Zealand's best opportunity.
There was also a first appearance for forward Shay McCartan as he replaced Magennis with seven minutes left.
The big forward squandered a few openings but he was a constant menace to the visitors and showed he is much more than a physical force.
Two early efforts were saved while tireless running saw him dispossess Tommy Smith before his angled drive was blocked by Marinovic.

His pinpoint cross was poked wide by substitute Kyle Lafferty early in the second half before he headed just wide.
Magennis has just one goal in 28 appearances but he offers so much to the team and is expected to lead the line against Azerbaijan.
O'Neill is taking the squad for warm-weather training in Turkey to acclimatise for possible stifling conditions in next Saturday's Group C game.
The eight-day gap between the matches also gives defensive duo Gareth McAuley and Craig Carthcart time to regain full fitness.
Northern Ireland lie second, five points behind Germany but on course for the play-off spot.
Match ends, Northern Ireland 1, New Zealand 0.
