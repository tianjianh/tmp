England's Charley Hull achieved her best major result with joint second at the ANA Inspiration as New Zealand's Lydia Ko became the youngest player to win two LPGA major championships.

Hull, 20, was two shots off the lead going into Sunday's final round, but 18-year-old Ko finished one stroke ahead on 12 under par to add the title to last year's Evian Championship.
Hull, whose previous best major result was a tie for seventh at the 2014 ANA Inspiration, shared second place with South Korean Gee Chun.
"I can't wait for the next tournament," said Hull. "I am happy because I played some great shots on the back nine.
"I feel like I know I can play well under pressure, making birdies when I'm down. I have done that today and I am proud of myself.
"But Lydia hit a great shot into the last and she should be proud of herself."
Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn was fourth on 10 under, while overnight leader Lexi Thompson of the United States was a shot further back in fifth.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew was six under after three days but her challenge was derailed by a costly eight at the par-three second hole, with the 46-year-old finishing on three under in a tie for 32nd place.
"It was always my dream to play on the LPGA," said world number one Ko, who started the final round one shot behind Thompson.
"For these amazing things to be happening is unbelievable, but it also motivates me to work harder."
BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter:
"Ko's victory provided her with back-to-back majors. At just 18, the New Zealander is an astonishing sportswoman and she needed a birdie at the last to claim the title.
"A brilliant approach meant a mere tap-in was enough to emerge from a pack that included Hull, who joined the clubhouse leaders with a nerveless birdie putt on the final green.
"It wasn't quite enough, but still provided the best major finish of her career."
