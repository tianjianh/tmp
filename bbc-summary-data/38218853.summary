The 24-year-old was found at about 21:30 GMT on Monday and pronounced dead after shots were reportedly fired near restaurants on Walham Grove in Fulham.
Police believe the victim, who was with a friend, had stopped for something to eat at a fast food restaurant.
The Met said "it would appear that the gunman had been lying in wait" for the pair to return to their car.
The victim was shot as he was getting into the front passenger seat of the silver and black Renault Captur.
The man has not been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will take place in due course, police said.
Detectives from the homicide and major crime command are investigating, but no arrests have been made.
