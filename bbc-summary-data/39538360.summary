The part-plane, part-airship Airlander 10 was badly damaged when it nosedived during a test flight on 24 August.
After extensive repairs, it has now been moved back to its mooring mast at Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire.
Manufacturer, Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), said it would not announce a flight date in advance but that final tests were under way.
It said the aircraft, which is the length of a football pitch, was "flight-ready" and was expected to be airborne "very soon".
HAV chief executive Stephen McGlennnan said: "With our next flight just round the corner, this opens a new chapter in aviation history.
"An aircraft that flies in an entirely new way and which can do so many useful things is about to be a regular sight over the UK. I think we'll amaze people."
Airlander was moved out of its hangar at Cardington shortly after 21:00 on Friday to complete final preparations.
HAV believes it could be used for a variety of functions, such as surveillance, communications, delivering aid and even passenger travel.
The Â£25m aircraft was given a pair of "giant inflatable landing feet" as part of improvements following its crash on 24 August.
No-one was injured in the accident, but the cockpit was effectively destroyed.
It happened when Airlander climbed to an excessive height because its mooring line became caught on power cables, an Air Accidents Investigation Branch report found.
