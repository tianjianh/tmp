[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 1-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An early goal from Lee Molyneux gave Morecambe a narrow victory against Grimsby at the Globe Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Molyneux gave the home side the best possible start when he scored his third goal of the season in only the second minute.
Michael Rose surprised everyone in the ground with a corner that he delivered to the edge of the area and Molyneux was on hand to run in and drill a superb left-foot shot from 20 yards through a crowd of bodies and into the left-hand corner of the Grimsby goal.
From there the visitors, with the wind at their backs, enjoyed a greater share of possession and went close to equalising quickly when Gavin Gunning headed Zak Mills' pinpoint cross straight at Barry Roche.
Grimsby continued to press with Jamey Osborne firing a shot wide from the edge of the area before Morecambe went close again after another well-worked set-piece with Andy Fleming's volley from 12 yards out.
Morecambe looked the more threatening side in the second half and had two goals disallowed for offside, with both Paul Mullin and Kevin Ellison denied by the flag.
The Shrimps also hit the woodwork twice, with Mullin heading against the crossbar from close range and Rhys Turner firing against the foot of the post in the last minute of the game.
Grimsby battled to the death and almost scored a last-gasp equaliser when Adi Yussuf wasted a glorious chance after turning neatly in the box.
