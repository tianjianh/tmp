The two-car crash happened on the A937 at Marykirk in November 2013.
Bojidar Katsarov was born after his mother was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
A possible case against one of the drivers, Chavdar Ivanov, was investigated, but the Crown Office said no further proceedings would be taken.
A Crown Office spokesman told the BBC Scotland news website: "It is the duty of the Crown to keep cases under review.
"After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in this case Crown Counsel instructed that there should be no further proceedings taken."
