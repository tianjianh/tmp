[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The wife of the US treasury secretary has apologised for an Instagram post in which she boasted of her wealth and belittled a commenter.

The post showed Scottish-born actress Louise Linton exiting a US military plane, and was tagged with the brand names of several fashion designers.
It also featured a paragraph-long rant against one user who criticised her.
"I apologise for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response," she said late on Tuesday.
"It was inappropriate and highly insensitive," she said in a statement released to US media by her publicist.
Her now-withdrawn Instagram post on Monday depicted her travels to Kentucky with her husband Steven Mnuchin, who is currently working to overhaul the US tax code.
In what critics have suggested could be a government ethics violation, she tagged designers Hermes, Tom Ford and Valentino on to the image of her and her spouse exiting the blue plane with United States of America emblazoned on the fuselage.
"Glad we could pay for your little getaway," commented @jennimiller29, who is reportedly a mother-of-three from Portland, Oregon.
"Did you think this was a personal trip?!" Linton wrote back, tagging the woman.

"Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?"
News outlets dubbed this Ms Linton's "Let them eat cake moment", a reference to a comment reputedly made by French queen Marie Antoinette upon hearing the citizens of Paris had no bread.
