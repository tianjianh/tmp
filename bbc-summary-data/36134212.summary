Craig Allison was found dead on Sunday morning by a member of the public next to the River Kelvin in Maryhill.
His death is being treated as unexplained, but a post-mortem examination will take place to establish the exact cause, police said.
The 22-year-old, from Ruchill, had been fishing in the area the previous day. Officers have appealed for information.
Mr Allison was found in an area known locally as the "Slushie", close to Cowal Road at Blairbuie Drive.
Det Insp Jim Bradley said: "We know that he had gone fishing on Saturday afternoon with friends who we have since spoken to. However, his friends left him there late Saturday night, early Sunday morning.
"At this time we do not know what happened to Craig and until that is established, I would appeal to anyone who saw him in the area to get in touch.
"Craig, who is white, has light brown hair and was wearing a grey t-shirt with a white collar and white trim on the sleeve, grey jogging bottoms and blue and white Adidas trainers."
