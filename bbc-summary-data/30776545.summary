[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative criticism of Labour's handling of the NHS in Wales is "legitimate scrutiny", its Welsh leader has claimed after chairing a gathering of health officials in Cardiff.

Ambulance response times and A&E waits were among the topics discussed.
Andrew RT Davies said the discussions would inform Conservative party policy for the 2016 assembly election.
David Cameron and Ed Miliband have repeatedly clashed over health as the general election approaches in May.
Speaking after the meeting at the Senedd on Monday, Mr Davies said:  "From the Welsh Conservative point of view there is legitimate scrutiny of the Welsh government.
"We also want to work with anyone who has the best interests of the Welsh NHS at heart," he added, saying the meeting had been one of 14 the Welsh Conservatives had held on the issue.
The British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing, Cardiff & Vale University Health Board and the General Medical Council were among the organisations represented.
The Welsh government declined to comment.
