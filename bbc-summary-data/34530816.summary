Netherlands not going to be a force for a while - Arnold Muhren

It will be a while before the Netherlands national team are a force again in European football, says former Dutch international Arnold Muhren.

The Netherlands failed to qualify for Euro 2016 after Tuesday's 3-2 loss to the Czech Republic saw them finish fourth in their qualifying group.
They finished third at the 2014 World Cup and were beaten finalists in 2010.
"We think we're very good, but maybe we're not as good as we think we are," Muhren told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Of the teams who finished above us - Turkey, the Czech Republic and Iceland - we only managed to get a draw against Turkey. So that proves that you're not good enough.
"We've got a lot of red cards, a lot of mistakes from defenders. The last couple of games we've had a lot of injuries. I'm not looking for excuses but we didn't deserve to go to France next year."
National coach Danny Blind took over at the start of July from Guus Hiddink, who left after 10 months in the position.
Blind has lost three of his four matches in charge but says he has "no intention" of stepping down.
Former Ipswich and Manchester United midfielder Muhren, who was part of the Dutch side who won the 1988 European Championship, says "everybody is to blame" for their failure to reach France next summer.
"It's not only the manager. It's all about a combination of players, managers and technical staff," he said.
"Most of the players at the moment are not good enough. We've got a very good squad of younger players coming up but it's going to be a while before the Dutch national team is going to be a force in Europe again.
"Last night against the Czech Republic was a disaster really. We were three-nil down and we played against 10 men. So, overall, it's a very disappointing qualifying project for us."
Former Netherlands midfielder Bolo Zenden said it was a mistake to switch to a back four having played five at the back during the 2014 World Cup.
He added: "We didn't have the quality. In the first game, we scored an own goal and we scored an own goal in the last game - that probably sums it all up.
"If the director of football [Bert van Oostveen] decided to change the head coach he'll probably have to change himself as well because he is the one who went for Louis Van Gaal [manager until July 2014], Hiddink and then Blind. If he decided he isn't the right man, he should take responsibility as well."
