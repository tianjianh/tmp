Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt is not well enough to tour with the band this autumn, it has been announced.

The 67-year-old had a heart attack in Turkey in June, leading doctors to tell him to rest for the rest of the year.
Band manager Simon Porter said the guitarist "died" for several minutes after an attack that left him with "mild cognitive impairments".
Parfitt was "recovering well", but was "far from being fit enough to undertake the rigours of Quo's touring schedule".
The band will continue to use guest musicians until the end of 2016, among them Irish guitarist Richie Malone.
Freddie Edwards, son of the band's bass player John "Rhino" Edwards, also stepped in for Parfitt during the band's summer concerts.
Porter said of Parfitt that he is receiving neuropsychological support, adding: "His medical team continue to be confident of a full recovery, but Rick's absolute priorities for the foreseeable future are for his health and well-being."
The band manager conceded that Parfitt "may well have performed his last show with Quo" but said that no final decision would be made until next year.
Parfitt will use his recovery period to compose songs for a solo album which he plans to record early next year, his statement continued.
Status Quo are scheduled to kick off their Last Night of the Electrics tour in Vienna, Austria, on 12 October.
The tour, which runs until Christmas, comes to the UK later that month with a date at the SSE Arena in Belfast on 28 October.
Status Quo have had more than 60 chart hits in the UK, including Rockin' All Over the World, Whatever You Want and In the Army Now.
In 1991 they received a Brit Award for their outstanding contribution to music.
