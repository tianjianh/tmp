[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frenchman Sebastien Migne has replaced compatriot Pierre Lechantre as coach of Congo Brazzaville.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Migne, 44, has previously worked as Claude LeRoy's assistant at both Congo and Togo.
It is a swift return to the 1972 African champions for Migne, who worked as LeRoy's assistant with the Red Devils until November 2015.
Congo had been without a permanent coach since Lechantre was sacked in November 2016.
Migne, who worked as Togo assistant coach during the 2017 African Cup of Nations, was on a four-man short-list which included Patrice Neveu, John Toshack and Paul Put, according to sports minister LÃ©on-Alfred Opimbat.
He has been rewarded with a two-year deal with the objective of qualifying for the 2018 African Nations Championship and the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.
Under LeRoy's guidance, Congo reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 Nations Cup, which was their first appearance at the finals since 2000 - and only their third since 1978.
