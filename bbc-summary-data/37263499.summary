[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Maguire struck twice as Oxford continued their recent local derby success against nine-man Swindon with victory at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victory was United's sixth in a row over their arch-rivals, who had Lloyd Jones and Lawrence Vigouroux sent off in the second half.
Maguire converted from the penalty spot in the 44th minute after Liam Sercombe was tripped by Nathan Thompson.
Referee Stuart Attwell at first awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area, but changed it to a spot-kick on the advice of his assistant and Maguire despatched the penalty into the top right of the goal.
He scored again in the 61st minute, skilfully blocking a clearance from goalkeeper Vigouroux to send the ball flying into the net.
Swindon's miserable afternoon was completed by Jones seeing red for a second yellow card in the 65th minute, following a foul on Maguire, who was at the centre of everything.
And in stoppage time, goalkeeper Vigouroux was also shown his marching orders, for retaliating against Alex MacDonald.
In the first half, Maguire fired over when free on the right, and then saw a 20-yard drive pushed over the bar by Vigouroux.
Town's only opportunity before the break was a glancing header wide by Luke Norris, and late on Simon Eastwood saved superbly from the striker's shot.
