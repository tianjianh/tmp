The chief executive of a health trust that runs three West Midlands hospitals has stepped down following criticism by the watchdog Monitor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Mark Newbold said "the time was right" to leave the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust.
Last month the trust was criticised for failing to improve A&E waiting times and death rates.
A trust statement said it would be "in a position to announce new arrangements in the near future".
In his resignation letter, Dr Newbold said intervention by Monitor had prompted him to reconsider his position after four years in post at the organisation which runs Good Hope Hospital, Heartlands Hospital and Solihull Hospital.
He expressed regret at not being able to solve the problem of overcrowding and said he wished he had focussed earlier on "staff engagement".
"If I had managed to solve the overcrowding, I do not think I would be writing this letter," he said.
"However, a chief executive has to know when the time is right to pass the baton on and I believe that time is now."
A trust statement confirmed it had accepted the resignation.
"Dr Newbold believes that the time is now right for him to pass the baton on to allow the Trust to continue on its positive journey with fresh impetus," it said.
