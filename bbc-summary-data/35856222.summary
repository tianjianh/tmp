Federico Fernandez feels Swansea can finally relax in their battle against the drop after a tense 1-0 victory over Aston Villa.

Fernandez's first goal for the club was impeccably timed, with Swansea moving 10 points clear of the Premier League drop-zone.
"This game was massive for us," Fernandez said after his Liberty Stadium winner.
"This was a very important moment for us, now we are able to relax a little."
Since losing to Sunderland at home, Swansea have accrued 17 points from a possible 30.
"This is a very good step, now we rest and focus on another seven finals," Fernandez explained.
"We are not safe yet, we need maybe a point or three more points and to stay calm in the last weeks."
Fernandez's first goal for the club might have been a case of child's play as the father-to-be celebrated in a pregnant pose with the ball up his shirt.
Fernandez had not scored in his previous 57 Swansea appearances since joining from Napoli in August 2014.
But the Argentina defender got lucky when Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan missed Gylfi Sigurdsson's 53rd-minute free-kick and the ball rolled into the net off his right shoulder.
"I was going to stop but the ball hit me on the shoulder," said Fernandez.
"It was what we needed, it is a goal and you take the chance to score.
"Me and my girlfriend Florence are waiting for our first child in September, so it is a very emotional time.
"I told her I would celebrate like that if I scored. So it was perfect.
"Defending is my job and keeping a clean sheet is what is important.
"But to get a goal like that was a special moment, because what is important is that the club stay another season in the Premier League."
