Thiago is closing in on his fourth Bundesliga title since joining Bayern from Barcelona for Â£21.6m in 2013.
The 26-year-old's previous contract was due to expire in two years.
"My family and I feel at home in Munich. Everything's going well and I want to win a lot of trophies with Bayern in the future," said Thiago.
The two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona has featured in 25 of Bayern's 30 league games this season.
Carlo Ancelotti's side are eight points clear at the top of the table with four match left.
Bayern will clinch a fifth successive Bundesliga title on Saturday if nearest rivals RB Leipzig fail to beat struggling Ingolstadt at home (14:30 BST) and the leaders win at Wolfsburg (17:30 BST).
