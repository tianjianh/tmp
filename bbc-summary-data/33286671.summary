[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham's 'floozy' fountain to become flowerbed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The "Floozy in the Jacuzzi" in Birmingham city centre is to be filled with plants and flowers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fountain, in Victoria Square, has not been working since 2013.
Installed in 1993, it was given a £300,000 refurbishment in 2010, £70,000 was spent on repairs in 2009, and about £40,000 in 2006.
Birmingham City Council said it wants to make the square "as attractive as possible" until it is fixed. Planting is due to be completed in mid-July.
A full feasibility study is due to begin in January 2016, to work out what is wrong with the fountain and how much repairs will cost.
