[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The outfit, which includes a black skirt with a 43in (109cm) waist, was among items bought in a house sale in the 1970s.
Queen Victoria remained in mourning for more than 30 years after her husband died from typhoid in 1861.
The garments are expected to sell for more than Â£1,000.
The outfit also includes a black silk, taffeta and bombazine bodice, undergarments and a pair of small black boots.
Charles Hanson, manager of Hanson's auctioneers in Etwall, said: "The garments date back to the 1880s and include her silk undergarments, comprising a pair of silk bloomers and a chemise.
"Both objects are monogrammed VR [Victoria Regina].
"It's a real catwalk find. We unpack lots of cardboard boxes in our saleroom and you do not expect to unearth such important royal uniform which belonged to our longest-serving monarch."
