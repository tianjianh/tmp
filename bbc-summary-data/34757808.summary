Inter-party talks began in September to resolve the current political crisis.
They have been focused on the budget, welfare reform as well as past and present paramilitary activity.
The current crisis at Stormont was triggered when police said they believed IRA members had been involved in the murder of a former IRA man.
The parties have also been deadlocked over the issue of welfare.
The Northern Ireland parties had agreed on a welfare reform deal in December but Sinn FÃ©in withdrew its support in March.
Speaking at a Remembrance Sunday event in Enniskillen, Mr Kenny said: "I'm very hopeful and happy that the reports I'm getting are that a deal is on here.
"I do hope it can be concluded successfully in the next couple of days."
Mr Kenny said he would raise the issue with Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday.
He also revealed that he would be meeting Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minster Martin McGuinness.
Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers told the BBC that she expected this week to be crucial in finding a resolution.
"I think there has been some progress on certain issues, the gap is closing, but it is still a very difficult task," she said.
"There are still some very sensitive and difficult issues, where getting a resolution and finding common ground between all the participants in the talks is going to be very difficult."
Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness held a private meeting with Mr Cameron at Downing Street on Friday.
