The incident happened at the junction of Holburn Street and Holburn Road at about 03:00.
Police Scotland said officers briefly gave chase when the vehicle failed to stop for them in Crown Street, but they gave up their pursuit for safety reasons.
The car then hit an office building.
Insp Megan Heathershaw said: "Thankfully, no one appears to have been injured during the incident, however some damage was caused to a building in the Holburn Street area.
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that during incidents of this nature, vehicles will only be followed when safe to do so. The safety of the public throughout remains at the forefront of our priorities.
"Inquiries are ongoing and I would urge anyone with information to contact police."
