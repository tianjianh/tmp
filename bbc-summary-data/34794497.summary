The blaze at Wokefield Park, broke out at about 17:30 GMT in a ground floor linen area and spread to the roof.
The hotel, which features an 18th-Century building and modern executive centre, sits in 250 acres of land featuring a championship golf course.
Twelve fire engines were initially called to the hotel, near Mortimer, but they were scaled back to six at about 23:30, the fire service said.
Up to 100 guests of the hotel, part of the De Vere group, had been evacuated safely, Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue group manager Chris Bunyan said.
By midnight, he said the fire had been "fully surrounded and under control".
"There are six fire appliances still on site and crews are damping down and checking for hotspots," Mr Bunyan said.
"About 30 staff in total remain at the scene - I would say they will be there until at least three or four o'clock in the morning, with some there into the daylight hours."
The fire service said the initial fire was centred around a newer building on the site.
A spokesman from the hotel company said: "We can confirm that there has been a fire within a section of Wokefield Park.
"Our priority at this time is the safety of our guests and staff and we are working very closely with the fire brigade who are on site now.
"We will provide further information as it becomes available."
Fire engines that battled the blaze are from Whitley Wood, Dee Road, Caversham Road, Wokingham Road, Bracknell, Wokingham, Ascot and Newbury.
A further four are from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.
A spokesman for South Central Ambulance said there were no reported casualties.
The hotel's modern executive centre has 222 bedrooms and 30 meeting rooms, along with a pool, gym and sauna.
The historic mansion house has 87 bedrooms, 21 meeting rooms and a restaurant.
