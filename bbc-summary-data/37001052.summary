[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Taylor fired a 70th-minute winner as Bristol Rovers gained their first League One points of the season with a 2-1 victory at home to Oxford United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor scored just three minutes after Oxford had been reduced to 10 men for the last quarter of the game when Sam Long received a harsh second yellow card.
Rovers took the lead in the 25th minute when Jermaine Easter was allowed space to move into Oxford's penalty area on the right before burying a sweetly struck right-footed shot inside the far post.
But Oxford were level after 42 minutes. Ryan Taylor headed the ball into the path of Kane Hemmings, who moved forward to beat goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall with a low shot from 20 yards, the ball striking the inside of a post on its way in.
Oxford then lost Long on 67 minutes for a high foot and the hosts quickly cashed in on their extra-man advantage.
On as a substitute, last season's top scorer in the Football League buried a close-range effort on the turn after the U's had failed to clear a Luke James cross from the right.
But Oxford should have equalised in injury time when substitute Tyler Roberts blazed over an open goal.
