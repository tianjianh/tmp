Tim is currently spending six months on the International Space Station.
He shared a little video of himself cooking a breakfast of scrambled eggs in the space lab.
The process for making the eggs seems pretty easy (you just add warm water and they fluff up), but Tim doesn't look particularly excited about eating it!
He Tweeted: "Not quite as good as at home, but they are definitely scrambled! Space scrambled eggs."
