Serbian stamps honour Scots WW1 heroines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish women who volunteered in Serbia during World War One are being commemorated in a series of stamps.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The British Embassy has teamed up with Serbia Post to celebrate the efforts of the Scottish heroines.
Five women who worked as doctors, nurses and drivers feature on the new stamps.
A sixth English woman, Captain Flora Sandes, who was the only British female to bear arms during WW1, is also being remembered.
The five Scots are:
Cpt Sandes went, along with other British nurses, to Serbia in 1914. However, she swapped bandages for guns when she enlisted in the Serbian Army.
She remained in Belgrade after WW1 and volunteered to fight the Nazis during the attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941. She was decorated with the highest Serbian military medal for her contribution in combat.
The stamps are part of a wider campaign by the British Embassy in Belgrade aimed at highlighting more than 600 British women who contributed to the war effort in Serbia.
As well as remembering their service to the war, the embassy is keen to focus on their role in raising awareness about universal suffrage, solidarity and gender equality and the part they played building relationships with leaders and communities in Serbia.
