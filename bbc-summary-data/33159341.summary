Hong Kong government set to reveal political reforms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hong Kong's government is set to present a controversial political reform package on Wednesday ahead of a much-anticipated vote later this week.

The proposal will set out how Hong Kong will choose its next leader in 2017.
The package will for the first time give citizens the right to vote for the chief executive - but candidates will be vetted by a pro-Beijing committee.
That ruling sparked weeks of large-scale protests in the city by people calling for greater democracy.
Details of the package are expected to be presented by the government at 11:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers look set to vote against the reforms despite warnings from the Chinese government not to do so.
If that is the case, it is unlikely to get the two-thirds majority it needs to pass.
"If the pan-democrats stubbornly insist on vetoing the proposal, democracy in Hong Kong will come to a standstill," Song Ru'an, a Chinese foreign ministry official in Hong Kong, told reporters.
It is unclear what China's response will be if the package is vetoed in the vote, which is expected to take place on Thursday or Friday.
Security has been stepped up across the city, with both pro-democracy and pro-government groups due to rally outside the government headquarters when the debate starts on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, China warned against "radical forces" in Hong Kong after police arrested 10 people on suspicion of making explosives.
Police said one suspect had claimed to be a member of a "radical local group" but would not name the group or specify motives.
Pro-democracy activists have accused police of launching a smear campaign against them.
