[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton recorded their fourth clean-sheet victory on the bounce in League One with a hard-fought win at Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sammy Ameobi silenced The Den after just three minutes, hitting a stunning strike from 25 yards just beyond Jordan Archer's reach.
But the Lions fought back and were denied an equaliser by a superb reaction save from Mark Howard after 19 minutes after Lee Gregory met Shaun Williams' free-kick at the front post.
Despite having less possession, Bolton looked more threatening and Zach Clough's curling effort forced a good save from Archer after 34 minutes before Max Romeo crucially stopped the 21-year-old's counter-attack in first-half injury time.
Millwall built pressure well in the second half, with Williams' hopeful shot going just wide on the hour mark, minutes before Tony Craig's header looped onto the roof of the net.
But David Wheater ultimately ended the contest after 86 minutes, sending Lions fans to the exit en masse with a cool finish after Millwall failed to clear a corner.
