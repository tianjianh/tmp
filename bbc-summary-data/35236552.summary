Internet dater Kenneth Ellis jailed over gun incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Edinburgh man who held a gun to a woman's head weeks after contacting her through an online dating site has been jailed for more than four years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Ellis, 44, told the 40-year-old woman: "I'm going to kill you", the High Court in Edinburgh heard.
Ellis admitted abducting and assaulting the woman last August in his Edinburgh home, telling her he had made people dig their own grave then shot them.
The court heard he snapped after the woman mentioned a former partner.
She managed to make a 999 call warning that Ellis had a gun and when police arrived they found her standing in the middle of the road shaking uncontrollably.
Ellis also subjected another woman to harassment, turning up at her home and repeatedly sending her text messages and phoning her.
Lord Turnbull jailed him for three years and nine months for the incident involving the gun and a further four months and 15 days for the offence against the other woman.
Ellis also admitted engaging in a course of conduct between March 2014 and August last year at addresses in Edinburgh which caused another 28-year-old woman fear or alarm by repeatedly texting, phoning and attending at her home uninvited.
Advocate depute Angela Gray said Ellis and the older woman had contacted each other through a dating website about three weeks prior to the gun incident. Within a fortnight they met up and began a relationship.
Defence solicitor advocate Leanne McQuillan said: "He fully appreciates a custodial sentence is inevitable."
