A survey carried out by the States' Youth Service found 97% of respondents were happy with activities on offer at the island's youth schemes.
However, the service said there was a number of responses calling for better IT hardware and more outdoor space.
Mark Capern, principal youth officer, said it was important to use the survey to help improve future services.
Jersey's Youth Service was used by 46,000 young people in 2012.
The States offers 19 youth projects in locations around Jersey, as well as three island-wide schemes.
Mr Capern said by offering a survey, young people were being given a say in the services that they use.
