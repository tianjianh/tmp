The 22-year-old centre-back, who can also play in midfield, has been on trial with Wycombe, but is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury.
"I saw enough to convince me to take a chance on him and see how he gets on when he's back from injury," boss Gareth Ainsworth told the club website.
Wycombe travel to Crawley in their League Two opener on Saturday.
