Cricket World Cup 2015: Steven Finn takes hat-trick for England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Finn became the first England bowler to take a World Cup hat-trick with wickets off the final three balls of Australia's innings in a 111-run defeat in Melbourne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Finn, 25, removed Brad Haddin, Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Johnson to deny Australia a record total of 344 as they closed on 342-9.
He finished with figures of 5-71, the second most expensive five-wicket haul in one-day international history.
England then subsided to 231 all out.
Finn's hat-trick, in England's tournament opener against co-hosts Australia, was the first by an Englishman and eighth in World Cup history.
All of the paceman's wickets were taken with skied catches.
"A fortuitous and unheralded hat-trick," said ex-England spinner Graeme Swann. "He seemed embarrassed by it."
