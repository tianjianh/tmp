AFP report that Bale has suffered a minor setback in his recovery from a calf injury.
Bale has been out since suffering the injury in a 5-1 win against Sporting Gijon in January.
"He needs time and we need to be patient," Zidane said.
"We need Gareth to be 100% fit."
Bale, 26, will not feature at home to Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Saturday.
"He is feeling better every day but I am not going to say that he will be back training with us next week," Zidane said.
"If he is feeling pain then it is to be expected that he might suffer a setback.
"Gareth is such an important player for us that we are not going to take any risks."
