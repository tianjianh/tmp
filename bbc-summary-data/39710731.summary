Aberdeen safety code word scheme hailed a success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A code word campaign for people feeling unsafe on a date in Aberdeen is being hailed a success, just over a month after its launch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme allows people to subtly ask for help by going to the bar to "Ask for Angela" - alerting staff that they need help.
A total of 25 Aberdeen venues have been taking part in the campaign.
Unight Aberdeen, a partnership of 19 late-night venues in the city, said two women had been helped already.
Lincolnshire County Council came up with the scheme.
Hayley Child, who works as the sexual violence and abuse strategy co-ordinator for Lincolnshire and came up with the idea, said: "Angela was a play on the word (guardian) Angel."
