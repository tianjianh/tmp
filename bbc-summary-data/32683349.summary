A goldfish has undergone a 45-minute operation in Bristol to remove multiple tumours from around its eye and back.

The five-year-old fish, named Monty, had to be put under general anaesthetic for the "very delicate" Â£200 procedure.
Vets used water soluble anaesthetic to knock the goldfish out before operating to remove its eye.
Sonya Miles, who assisted in the operation, said: "Monty is doing exceptionally well at home and is acting as if nothing has happened."
The Highcroft Veterinary Group said the tiny fish had been in a "very bad way" when it was brought into its Whitchurch hospital.
And despite the "tumour extending further than expected", the surgery had gone "swimmingly".
"He was a brilliant patient and the surgery went very smoothly from start to finish," said Ms Miles.
"We don't perform surgery on goldfish very often but we are seeing a definite increase in veterinary treatment in fish generally,"
