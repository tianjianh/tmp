About 250 boats set off from Greenock and arrived at Pacific Quay to be greeted by crowds along the shoreline.
The flotilla, the largest ever seen on the Clyde, was organised by the Royal Yachting Association Scotland.
Huge, cheering crowds turned out to see small ships, leisure yachts, clippers and working boats take part.
A special viewing place to watch the passing boats was set up at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.
Meanwhile, Police Scotland said it would mount its biggest-ever operation in Glasgow over the weekend to help the city cope with expected massive crowds.
There were reports of delays on the park and ride at Eurocentral.
It is one of the sites being used by thousands of spectators heading to Ibrox Stadium for the Games rugby sevens.
People took to social media to vent their anger saying they had been waiting for more than an hour with not enough buses to transport them to the venue.
The flotilla is one of many events taking place across Glasgow to mark the Games.
About 280,000 people were expected in the city on Saturday as events take place at eight different venues, as well as the Barry Buddon Shooting Centre in Carnoustie.
Police Scotland are in charge of the Â£90m security operation and have said this weekend will be their largest ever operation in the city.
The force will not say how many officers are being deployed but have admitted forces from outwith Scotland are helping with specialist tasks.
These include carrying out searches at Games venues.
Police are also on duty at Games events in Edinburgh and Carnoustie and around areas hosting the cultural programme of 2014 festival.
