[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers won promotion back to League One at the first attempt after a narrow win over Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tommy Rowe's header from sub James Coppinger's corner was enough to see off the Stags.
Ben Whiteman went close to a leveller but his curled effort was just wide.
Rovers, relegated to League Two last May, have spent the majority of the season at the top of the table and now need just eight points to claim the title.
Doncaster boss Darren Ferguson told BBC Radio Sheffield: "The focus all week has been on winning promotion here at home.
"I said to the players before the game 'we are going to get this done but how do we do it? By default with other teams losing or do you want to do it by winning the game?'. The players showed tremendous character.
"It's massive turnaround from where we were 12 months ago and I have to thank the board. We recruited good characters and I have got a dressing room I can trust."
