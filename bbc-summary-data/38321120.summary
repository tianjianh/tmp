He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years in February but the case could not be reported until the conclusion of a related trial.
Harber, of North Hill, Bexhill-on-Sea, east Sussex, was found guilty of 30 rapes, seven of inciting rape by others, one of assault causing actual bodily harm and two of sexual activity with a child.
He groomed victims by giving them cannabis or amphetamines and forced them to have sex with friends or criminal associates.
The Judge at Exeter Crown Court told Harber he had kept the 21-year-old man as if he was a slave, repeatedly raping and humiliating him.
He also forced the victim to have sex with four other men.
The judge said: "You believe you have an entitlement to sex and maintain the victims were willing participants.
"In my judgment this offending is so serious a life sentence is required."
Det Insp Simon Costin From Devon and Cornwall Police said: "It is fair to say that his treatment of his victims can be described as sexually motivated torture and there is no question in my mind that the only place for him is prison.
"David Harber considered himself above the law and kept his victims in fear."
