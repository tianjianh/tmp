Crawley Town 2-0 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crawley claimed revenge for their 5-0 thrashing at Yeovil a month ago with a comfortable home victory over the Glovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half goals from defender Josh Yorwerth and striker James Collins, from the penalty spot, gave the hosts their first points of the festive season and left Yeovil without a win in five League Two games.
Crawley top-scorer Collins should have hit the target in the fourth minute when he blazed over from a good position after meeting a pass by Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn.
The hosts had a penalty appeal waved away when, following a throw from Boldewijn, Billy Clifford went over in a challenge by goalkeeper Artur Krysiak.
Krysiak saved a low shot from Collins and Crawley keeper Glenn Morris denied Otis Khan before Yorwerth gave Crawley the lead after 29 minutes.
Former Ipswich player Yorwerth rose unchallenged at the far post to head home a corner by debutant Dean Cox.
Crawley doubled their lead with their first home penalty of the season seven minutes before the break, with Collins confidently blasting his 11th league goal of the campaign after Boldewijn was shoved over by Khan.
Yeovil came close shortly after the interval when Morris pulled off two good saves to deny substitute Francois Zoko and Tom Eaves.
Glovers boss Darren Way used all three substitutes in a bid to get back in the game but Crawley closed out the match soundly to claim their first home clean sheet since October 22.
