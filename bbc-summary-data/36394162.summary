Audience wins first EU debate on social media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The BBC's first televised EU referendum debate was held in Scotland, but on social media most people wanted to talk about the audience.

The 150 young voters, aged between 18 to 29, questioned four politicians in Glasgow.
Former SNP leader Alex Salmond and Labour MP Alan Johnson made the case for staying in the EU.
UKIP MEP Diane James and Conservative MP Liam Fox argued for exiting the EU in 23 June's referendum.
Twitter and BBC News monitored some 45,000 tweets which were sent using the hashtag #BBCDebate. These are the main moments from the online conversation.
Ban clapping
In the opening minutes of the show hosted by Victoria Derbyshire, it quickly became apparent that both sides of the audience were going to show their support for the politicians by loudly clapping after every statement.
Since the audience was split according to their voting preference, this quickly meant that whenever one side of the audience was clapping, another third would sit in stony faced silence.
Emily from Poole
An audience member's questions about social housing and the impact that leaving the EU might have on the chance of her mother getting an appropriate bungalow caused the first big stir of the night, according to Twitter data.
Emily from Poole argued that she wanted to leave the European Union because of fears that her family would not have access to a council home due to pressure from migrants.
More than 900 tweets a minute were sent after she made her comments, and prompted this response from Chris Kerr, which proved to be the most shared tweet of the debate.
The Scottish Referendum
A debate about whether or not there would be another  another Scottish referendum within two years if Britain voted to leave the EU caused the most number of tweets per minute, with more than a thousand tweets being sent at 8:50pm.
Twitter data shows that Alex Salmond was also the most mentioned candidate during the debate, with Liam Fox coming second followed by Alan Johnson and Diane James.
EU roaming charges
A Remain supporter who tried to argue that the European Union had caused significant changes to mobile phone roaming charges also sparked fierce online debate. After she was interrupted several times by Leave supporters, she complained that "This feels like I'm in the House of Commons here and it's prime minister's questions,".
But UKIP MEPs were quick to dismiss her comments.
Flirting fail
And finally one of the surprising stars of the debate was a young audience member who propositioned Victoria Derbyshire  while asking a question during the debate. She declined to join him on a date, but that hasn't stopped many people online asking to find out further details about his slick pick up skills.
