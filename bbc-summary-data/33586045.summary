[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Researchers from the UK fishing industry will visit ports across Northern Ireland from Monday.

Over the next four days they will be speaking to skippers and vessel owners from all sectors of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland  about their running costs.
It is part of the 11th annual economic survey of the UK fishing fleet.
The results will be published next year.
Tom Pickerell, of the group Seafish said: "This is a hugely important exercise that enables us to better understand the industry as a whole and as a result helps us to inform key decision makers at a national and European level.
"We therefore urge skippers and boat owners across the UK to be part of the project by speaking to our researchers so that we can present the most accurate picture possible and help drive better informed policy."
