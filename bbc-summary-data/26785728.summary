The festival allows cinema exhibitors to get a first look at new films as studios and actors present footage from their most-hyped forthcoming projects.
This week, the first scenes from the eagerly-anticipated Fifty Shades of Grey adaptation were unveiled.
The new Hobbit, X-Men and The Amazing Spider-Man films were also teased.
A behind-the-scenes clip of The Hobbit: There and Back Again, which is due in December, showed Orlando Bloom saying to director Peter Jackson, "the better end'', to which Jackson replies, "the happy end.''
Sony Pictures debuted 30 minutes of 3D footage from The Amazing Spider-Man 2, starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - including scenes explaining the death of Peter Parker's parents.
They also introduced Max Dillon who becomes Electro - played by Jamie Foxx; and Harry Osborn who becomes the Green Goblin - played by Dane DeHaan.
Jupiter Ascending, the new sci-fi fantasy adventure from the Wachowski siblings Andy and Lana, who created The Matrix trilogy, was also unveiled.
Mila Kunis joined her co-star Channing Tatum to promote the film in which Tatum plays a "genetically engineered human and wolf".
"People always say that they're tired of seeing old movies remade and comic book movies made," said Tatum.
"This is a completely-out-of-the-Wachowskis'-brain type of a crazy film," he added.
Other films included Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and The Fault of Our Stars, based on John Green's best-selling tearjerker about two young people with cancer who fall in love.
Its star Shailene Woodley was handed the female star of tomorrow award.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were awarded a prize for comedy filmmakers of the year after unveiling scenes from their new film The Interview, which stars Rogen and James Franco as two friends asked to assassinate Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann - who was named comedy star of the year - attended the convention to promote their forthcoming film The Other Woman.
Due in US cinemas at the end of next month, it sees Diaz's character discover her boyfriend is actually married to Mann's character, before the pair team up to seek revenge.
A very pregnant Barrymore and Adam Sandler were handed the awards for male and female star of the year, after attending the festival to promote Blended.
The comedy about two families who embark on a trip to Africa reunites the pair who previously starred in 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer.
A first look at Fifty Shades of Grey, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, suggested it may focus more on the romance than the erotic element of EL James' best-selling novel.
Exhibitors were shown scenes featuring Grey whisking Steel off her feet with a joyride in his helicopter and a fancy make-over.
Johnny Depp presented clips of his new sci-fi drama Transcendence, in which he plays a terminally ill scientist-turned-unruly computer system, alongside British actress Rebecca Hall, Kate Mara and Paul Bettany.
