Ben Gallop, BBC's head of Formula 1, said: "Everyone on the BBC team is hugely excited about the new season.
"Last year saw us rise to the challenge of bringing the action to fans through the mix of live television and highlights, delivering great programmes which were reflected in impressive audience figures.
"This year sees new faces, practice on BBC Two & HD on live race weekends and a greater sharing of talent across BBC television, radio and online.
"With Suzi Perry at the helm, we're aiming to bring even more content, insight and access to audiences throughout the season."
The BBC Sport website will broadcast a simulcast of the TV and radio output, and at live races will also have the 'driver tracker', on-board cameras and a pit-lane stream.
Legendary F1 commentator Murray Walker will be providing a series of archive-based videos and written articles for every race of the season.
