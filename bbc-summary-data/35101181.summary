The company has written to the 39 workers to tell them they are all at risk of redundancy, though there may be the chance of redeployment.
The letter adds that Homebase is intending to assign the lease on its unit to another unnamed occupier.
In a statement, Homebase confirmed it had entered a period of consultation with staff regarding the closure.
"Colleagues at the store have been informed and we will be working with them to support them as much as possible," the statement added.
"As the consultation is in progress, we are unable to comment further at this time."
SDLP West Tyrone representative Daniel McCrossan said the proposal would "come as a devastating blow" for staff.
He questioned why closure was being proposed saying he understood the store was making a profit.
Last year, the group which owns Homebase said it planned to cut the number of stores by 25% by 2019.
Home Retail Group said a number of its 323 Homebase stores across the UK were "unprofitable or are in decline".
Earlier this year, the rival B&Q chain announced that five stores in Northern Ireland were to close, with the loss of about 300 jobs.
