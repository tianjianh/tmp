Norwich International Airport website hack sparks 'secure' update pledge

An airport has taken down its passenger information website after a hacker breached security systems, claiming they were too lax.

Using a pseudonym of His Royal Gingerness (HRG), the hacker told the BBC he wanted to highlight the website's "vulnerability".
It only took him a few minutes to hack into the site, he said.
Norwich International Airport director Richard Pace condemned the hacking as a crime that police were investigating.
HRG pointed out that while he made his attack to see if he could gain access, a more maliciously-minded intruder could have done damage.
He claimed he knew of someone who had planned to plant a bomb hoax in the system over Christmas, but said he was able to prevent that from happening.
While Mr Pace said the information website was not linked to the airport's operations system, he acknowledged that removing it was a serious inconvenience to passengers.
He admitted malicious hackers could have planted a bomb hoax on the site.
The airport's operations director promised a robust replacement site - with more secure protocols and systems - would be operational within weeks.
In the meantime, passengers can get information by calling 01603 411923.
HRG, who asked not to be identified because he fears prosecution, said he hacked the site "to see if I could".
"I found I could do it and then contacted the airport to let them know," he said.
"It took me between two to three minutes to do this. I do this mostly to see what vulnerability there are in modern systems."
