(Close): An early rally on the FTSE 100 had largely fizzled out by the close of trade, weighed down by supermarket shares.

The FTSE 100 index closed up just 0.18%, or 11 points, at 6,072.5. Earlier it was more than 1% higher.
After rising strongly on Wednesday, Morrisons and Tesco were among the worst performers.
Analysts at HSBC also cut their price forecast for Tesco shares to 275p from 295p.
Shares in Glencore continued their volatility. After rising as much as 7% in early trade, shares closed down 0.6%.
"What's stunning with markets at the moment is the degree of day-to-day volatility... and Glencore is an example of this," said Standard Life Investments head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan.
A better than expected report on the Chinese economy boosted mining shares such as BHP Billiton and Anglo American, although they also ended the day off their highs.
China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
But the sector did shrink for the second consecutive month.
Some analysts think that a build up of negative data about the Chinese economy may force authorities there to take further measures to boost the economy.
"China is warming investor sentiment this morning, really pushing the markets higher," Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments.
On the currency markets, the pound was a touch higher against the dollar at $1.5143 and was up 0.3% against the euro at â‚¬1.3571.
