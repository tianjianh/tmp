County Championship: Ben Duckett's 189 puts Northants in control against Essex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Duckett's fine 189 put Northants in a commanding position against Essex on day one at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duckett and Rob Newton (75) shared a 167-run first-wicket stand before the latter was caught off Ravi Bopara.
The 21-year-old hit 28 fours and a six before falling 11 runs short of a second double century this season as he was bowled by Bopara (4-64).
Adam Rossington and Steven Crook both then fell cheaply to medium pacer Bopara as Northants closed on 376-5.
