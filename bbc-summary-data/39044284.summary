Six Nations 2017: Scotland must 'stand up' to Wales - Gordon Reid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland prop Gordon Reid says Wales will try to bully the Scots when they meet at Murrayfield on Saturday.

The Scots resume their Six Nations campaign following a week's break with a victory against Ireland under their belt and a loss to the French in Paris.
"We need to front up. Wales are going to come out and try to bully us up front - mentally bully us," said Reid.
"We just need to try to stand up for ourselves. Stand up as a team, stand up for Scotland."
Scotland have lost their last nine meetings - including the last four at home - against Wales, their last victory coming at Murrayfield in 2007.
The last two have been closely contested, with Wales prevailing 26-23 on their last trip to Edinburgh two years ago, before a 27-23 victory in Cardiff last year.

Reid, who is pushing hard for a start at loose-head after appearing as a replacement for Allan Dell in the first two Six Nations matches, believes Scotland must improve their set-pieces if they hope to end that run on Saturday.
"There's still a load for us to work on," said the Glasgow prop. "Teams will be targeting our scrums and line-out. They weren't performing that well against Ireland and France.
"But I think we're getting there. We've done a lot of work on it in the past couple of weeks so hopefully we'll be hitting form by the weekend.
"What have we done to fix it? A load of scrums. We've been working on technique because we know what Wales are going to bring.
"We've scrummaged against these guys before. Most of the guys have come up against Scarlets, who [Wales props] Samson Lee and Rob Evans play for."
Asked how he would describe the Welsh scrummaging style, he replied: "Erm, interesting. Yeah, interesting.
"We always look to be legal and do everything by the book. It's just the Scottish way. We don't look to take shortcuts - we grit our teeth and do things the hard way.
"Is that the wrong thing to do when you compare it to some of the methods used by other sides? Not really. We just need to work a bit harder. If there is a problem, we'll get there."
