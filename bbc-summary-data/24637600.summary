Lincolnshire wind turbines: Hope for Gayton campaigners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners who failed to stop plans for a Lincolnshire wind farm have said they hope to have the decision reviewed in light of new planning guidance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In April, a government inspector gave the go-ahead for eight turbines at Gayton Le Marsh, near Louth.
The government has since said people would get a greater say in wind farm decisions particularly when it came to the protection of the landscape.
East Lindsey District Council said the guidance could make a difference.
Craig Leyland, from the council, said he has written to the Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles.
He said: "The principle rejection of that [Gayton Le Marsh wind farm] scheme made by the district council planning authority and local residents was the harm caused to the landscape, so that's why I've asked for a review."
However, a spokesman for Mr Pickles' department said there was no "retrospective effect" for applications that had already been decided.
Developer Energiekontor's application was initially turned down following protests including a march and a 377ft (115m) blimp being flown to demonstrate the height of the turbines.
But following an appeal, the firm was given the green light.
Cheryl Warwick, chair of Saltfleetby Parish Council, said the difference the turbines would make to the landscape was key to her objections.
She said: "We already have two wind farms in close proximity.
"If you're looking from a number of viewpoints, in the [Lincolnshire] Wolds, it would decimate that view in terms of the size and range of how the turbines would be set.
"They are inappropriate for what is a beautiful part of the east coast."
Building is due to start sometime in 2014.
