[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Struggling firm' supported Craig Whyte's Rangers bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A London financier, whose firm was struggling to pay its rent, gave assurances that Craig Whyte had £10m to invest in Rangers, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Witness John Newlands said in the year before Mr Whyte bought Rangers, he had asked Mr Whyte for a loan to pay his company's rent.
Mr Whyte, 46, is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow for acquiring Rangers by fraud, which he denies.
He also denies a second charge under the Companies Act.
Mr Newlands told a jury that he had given his backing to Mr Whyte in good faith.
He said he been shown documents indicating Mr Whyte's company had funds available to invest in Rangers.
Prosecutors allege Mr Whyte pretended to Sir David Murray, and others, that funds were available to make all required payments to acquire a "controlling and majority stake" in the club.
The Crown alleges Mr Whyte had only £4m available from two sources at the time but took out a £24m loan from Ticketus against three years of future season ticket sales.
The court has heard the sale was eventually made to Mr Whyte for £1 but came with obligations to pay an £18m bank debt, a £2.8m "small tax case" bill, £1.7m for stadium repairs, £5m for players and £5m in working capital.
The second charge under the Companies Act centres on the £18m payment between Mr Whyte's Wavetower company and Rangers to clear a bank debt.
The trial before eight men and seven women continues.
