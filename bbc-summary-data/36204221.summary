Aberaeron primary schools under threat of closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to four primary schools could close in Ceredigion as the county council looks to address surplus places and save money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A review has been carried out on education in the Aberaeron catchment area, which has 10 primary schools.

They will all be discussed at a scrutiny committee meeting on 9 May.
Other suggestions include:
The advantages and disadvantages for each option have been laid out in the report.
Ceredigion council is in the process of reviewing each of the county's six catchment areas.
The report by Barry Rees, strategic director for learning and partnerships, states that education is a priority for the council, which is being forced to reconsider how it delivers education in a "cost effective way" while "raising standards" for learners.
