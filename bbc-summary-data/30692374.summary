Dustin Diamond, 37, is charged with felony reckless endangerment and two misdemeanours.
His lawyer, Thomas Alberti, said there were no witnesses who said they saw the actor stab the man but a judge ruled there was enough evidence for a trial.
The stabbing is said to have happened in a bar in Port Washington, Wisconsin.
The man was not seriously hurt during the fight at The Grand Avenue Saloon.
Diamond's fiancee Amanda Schutz, who appeared in court with him on Monday, told police she shoved a woman who was making rude remarks to them.
Diamond claimed the women then became physically aggressive and that two men held his 27-year-old fiancee by her hair.
Port Washington police officer Ryan Hurda, who testified during the hearing, said that a man pushed Diamond as he moved towards the fight.
The man's brother "intervened when he heard the snap of a knife", said Hurda.
The brother did not see Diamond stab anyone, Hurda added, and there was nothing in the bar's video surveillance that showed the actor stabbing the man.
"No, it's not distinct, but you see he's holding some type of object in his right hand," Hurda said.
Alberti asked for his client to be allowed to leave Wisconsin, Diamond's home state, for a short time.
Diamond was granted permission to perform at comedy shows which he had already scheduled in other states. He remains free on $10,000 (Â£6,600) bond.
Saved by the Bell aired during the 1990s and followed the lives of a group of high school students.
Since the show ended, Diamond has been sued a number of times for failure to pay taxes and in foreclosure proceedings following missed mortgage payments.
He has appeared on reality TV shows, made a sex tape and made a documentary called The Unauthorised Saved by the Bell Story.
