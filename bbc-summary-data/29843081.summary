Not bad for a bit of fun, according to Tinchy Stryder, who recorded the track with the Chuckle Brothers.
"I bumped into them at Celebrity Juice...we just got along," the rapper said.
But the charity behind the track told Newsbeat they want people to remember it's not just about the laughs.
Ronke Okay from the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) said: "It's a great cause and Tinchy is a fantastic ambassador.
"It's good to see that two generations, Tinchy's age and the Chuckle Brothers, can collaborate on something that is so important and bring awareness to it."
The organisation has been looking to increase the number of ethnic minorities who are on the bone marrow transplant register.
They claim a black person waiting for a transplant faces a one in 100,000 chance of finding a donor.
For a white patient it's one in four.
When the ACLT was founded in 1996, 500 names were on the register. There are now 50,000.
Ronke says they hope with Tinchy's help that number will rise.
"We're completely grateful to him, we know that it's a cause that's close to his heart."
