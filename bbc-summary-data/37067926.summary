The promotion hopefuls were out of the traps early as Craig Robson headed in an excellent Luke Guttridge corner after 11 minutes.
Jordan Maguire-Drew made it 2-0 with a fine individual goal, dribbling into the box and curling past Michael Poke.
Fejiri Okenabirhie increased the lead from the penalty spot before half-time, scoring on the rebound after Poke had saved his initial effort.
Anthony Edgar pulled one back for the Cardinals in the second half, but it was to be the first time since 2010 that the Daggers had won three league games in a row.
