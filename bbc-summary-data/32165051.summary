A protester who threw marbles at MPs in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions has been given a suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Abberley, from south London, threw glass marbles at a security screen and swore at politicians, calling them liars, a court heard.
He told Westminster Magistrates' Court he felt his life was "wasting away".
Judge Quentin Purdy said his "antics" were an inappropriate way to express his political views.
He told 28-year-old Abberley: "Anyone who chooses to disrupt [proceedings] causes those attending anxiety and distress.
"It causes people to feel they cannot go to that place. That's not the way it should be."
Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon told the court Abberley apologised to fellow spectators in the House before shouting abuse at MPs in October last year.
The court heard he caused Â£2,416 of damage.
Abberley, from Sutton, admitted using threatening words and behaviour, and was handed a 12-week suspended sentence.
He was also given a four-week suspended term for drawing graffiti which read "the enemy within" on a wall at the Palace of Westminster.
During the hearing, Abberley said he accepted full responsibility for his actions.
He told the judge: "I feel like my life is wasting away where I'm living. There's nothing happening for me."
Abberley was also ordered to pay Â£500 towards the damage and an additional Â£80 victim surcharge.
