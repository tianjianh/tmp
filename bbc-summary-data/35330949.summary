[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Simpson scored a late equaliser for Plymouth against fellow promotion hopefuls Bristol Rovers but Argyle dropped to second place in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gregg Wylde almost scored for Plymouth in the first half of the West Country derby, but shot over from 15 yards.
And after Tom Lockyer hit the post for Rovers, Billy Bodin nodded them ahead from Jermaine Easter's cross.
But with two minutes of normal time left, Simpson drilled in from the edge of the area to earn his side a point.
The result left Rovers in fourth place, four points behind the automatic promotion places, while Plymouth are two points behind leaders Northampton, who have a game in hand.
