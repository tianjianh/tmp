Three lecterns mark the moment in September 1297 when the joint commanders of a small Scottish force defeated Edward I's English army.
The memorials were unveiled at a ceremony attended by Andrew de Moray's direct descendant, the Earl of Moray.
The Saltire was then raised at Stirling Bridge for the first time in 700 years.
The flag will now become a permanent fixture at the site of the battle.
Made of Scottish whinstone, the lecterns were commissioned by the Guardians of Scotland Trust, set up in 2011 to mark the equal contribution made by Wallace and de Moray in the Wars of Scottish Independence.
John Stuart, the current Earl of Moray, said: "I am delighted that Andrew de Moray is finally, after 700 years, to have the recognition he deserves.
"The Guardians of Scotland have put a huge amount of time and effort into the lecterns, which are a very fitting tribute to one of Scotland's greatest patriots."
