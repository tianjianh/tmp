The clothing stolen from the Tiso store in Leith included brands such as North Face, Craghoppers, Berghaus, Jack Wolfskin and Sprayway, which are popular among hillwalkers and climbers.
The break-in at the Commercial Street shop happened at 01:00 on Thursday.
Police said they believe a car or van was used in the theft and they have appealed for witnesses.
Det Insp Grant Johnston said: "We expect that a vehicle is likely to have been involved given the number of items stolen and we're keen to speak to anyone who was in the area of Commercial Street between 23:30 on Wednesday and 01:00 on Thursday and who saw any suspicious behaviour.
"Likewise, if you're offered any items fitting this description, which are new but the owner cannot provide proof of purchase, please get in touch.
"If you purchase stolen items, knowingly or otherwise, they can be returned to their rightful owner, meaning a financial loss for yourself."
