Apton was officially launched before Christmas  offering music specifically from Welsh record labels.
But its website and app services are down, with some registered users told a ransom of about Â£200 in the digital currency Bitcoin must be paid.
One of the companies behind Apton said 1,300 customers' details are safe.
Police have been informed of the hackers' activity and Apton officials said on Thursday they were considering paying the 0.2 Bitcoin demand.
"It seems that we are not the only company to suffer like this and I can see that at least 16 companies have already paid similar amounts," said Dafydd Roberts from the record company Sain.
The Apton service is backed by apps on the Apple and Android stores and received Â£30,000 in Welsh Government funding to promote the language.
It charges a monthly fee like Spotify and Apple Music to access an online stream of music from the catalogues of Welsh record companies like Sain.
"This is extremely frustrating," added Mr Roberts.
"This is many months of hard work, it is like someone breaking in to your home, and we have informed the police."
The service insisted all banking details and personal data remained safe and was stored on different systems to those hacked.
Apton said it hoped to have its services back online within a few days.
