Clara Amfo is taking over her mid-morning show, as well as the Live Lounge.
Ben Cooper, controller of BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra, has spoken to Newsbeat about the changes to the schedule.
"Well I'm delighted for her and Jesse. As any parent knows, it's that difficult time where you desperately want to tell people and you can't.
"All of us at Radio 1 are delighted for them and wish them all the best for the future. It's fantastic news."
"I can't stop people having sex.
"We've got fantastic news for two of our great friends at the station and we wish them both very well in different ways.
"But the great thing about Radio 1 and as the listeners will know, is that we've got an amazing family of DJs. So we've got great news this month for Annie Mac and we've got great news for Clara [Amfo]."
"Her warmth, her enthusiasm, her friendliness on air. She's really slick as presenter.
"You've heard that on the Official Chart Show already, she hit that running.
"She's going to bring all of that and some great new ideas and still keep the Live Lounge going 10 to 12.45.
"It's a bit like being a football manager, being the person in charge of a radio station.
"There are always going to be decisions that you have to make about players and which positions they play and whether you play them upfront or midfield.
"It's exactly the same with the schedule. You try to choose the right players for the right position and Clara is going to be brilliant on that show."
"I'm sure they, like us, wish her all the very best. It's fantastic news for her and her family.
"We wish them all very well over the next few months and we've got an exciting brand new show."
"Fearne has taken the Live Lounge and run with it and taken it to real great heights.
"You just look at Ed Sheeran - his Live Lounge performance reached over two million people within 24 hours on our YouTube channel. That's fantastic.
"So that energy, that excitement, that calibre of artist is still going to be in Clara's show."
"Radio 1 throughout its history has had huge stars presenting on its airwaves. And those stars, at some point in their career, have moved on.
"Radio 1 is still here. Radio 1 is still as fun and exciting. And it's still promoting and pushing great new British music and that will always continue."
"Clara will come off her 1Xtra weekend breakfast shows and Ace, who will be familiar to a lot of listeners, is going to take on that so I'm really pleased for him to get back on the schedule.
"Clara will be continuing to do the Official Chart Show and her weekday [Radio 1] show."
