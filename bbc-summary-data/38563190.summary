All Round to Mrs Brown's will be hosted by Agnes Brown, the female alter-ego played by Brendan O'Carroll in the sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys.
O'Carroll said: "The entire cast is excited by this. I think Agnes may be worried that she'll need a bigger kettle to make tea for everyone that's coming round!"
The series will transmit later this year.
The BBC said the show would feature "celebrity guests, surprise audience shenanigans and outrageous stunts" in front of a live studio.
Charlotte Moore, director of BBC content, said: "Bringing one of our biggest comedy stars, Mrs Brown, to Saturday nights in 2017 with a new entertainment show is going to be full of fun and mischief and totally unpredictable."
Mrs Brown's Boys became a hit when the BBC sitcom first aired in 2011.
Mrs Brown first appeared on Irish radio station RTE 2fm in 1992 and has been the focal point of a series of books and a long-running stage show.
But it was not until O'Carroll's matriarch hit the small screen that he became an international star.
A Saturday night live episode of Mrs Brown's Boys was watched by more than 11 million viewers last year. The sitcom was also voted the most popular of the 21st century in a Radio Times poll.
In 2014, the spin-off film Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie topped the UK and Ireland box office.
All Round to Mrs Brown's is to be produced by Hungry Bear Media in conjunction with O'Carroll's production company BocPix.
