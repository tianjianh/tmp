Scotland make eight changes for Australia

Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has made eight changes for Saturday's Test against Australia in Sydney.

Greig Tonks takes over at full-back, with Lee Jones and Rory Hughes completing a new back three that boasts a total of 13 caps.
There is also a whole new front row with Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown and Zander Fagerson selected.
Jonny Gray comes into the second-row to partner Ben Toolis, while Hamish Watson returns at openside.
Duncan Taylor moves from number 15, where he played in the win over Italy in Singapore, to inside centre.
Australia make one change from the starting XV that beat Fiji last week, with Fiji-born Eto Nabuli making his debut on the left wing, in place of the injured Henry Speight.
"I believe our team is stronger this week," said Townsend. "This will be a much tougher game than against Italy."
Townsend said he had no problem in pitching in Tonks, Jones and Hughes together against what can be a lethal Australia attack.
Tonks has been playing second-tier English rugby this past season and has not played a Test in nearly two years. Jones, who has had a fine season with Glasgow, has not represented Scotland for more than five years. Hughes has only started one international.
"No worries," said Townsend. "Lee was always going to start in this game. We were pleased with how Damien Hoyland played against Italy. He defended really well, made good decisions on the ball, so that's great, but Lee is in great form.
"He's a brilliant story and he's a much better player now [than when when he played for Scotland before]. He's shown that in a number of big games, especially Champions Cup games. He's in great physical condition.
"That back three are going to have to work very hard. Not just in defence. We want them getting hands on the ball as much as possible.
"Greig is someone I've always admired as a player. He was always dangerous for Edinburgh. He's very good at putting people into space, has a very good wide passing game off either hand.
"Tim Visser is out with a rib injury - hopefully he'll be available for Fiji - so Rory gets another opportunity. He didn't get his hands on ball against Italy but worked really hard in attack and defence.
"We need that because they are playing against guys like Israel Folau, who's getting to get a lot of ball."
Australia: Israel Folau; Dane Haylett-Petty, Tevita Kuridrani, Karmichael Hunt, Eto Nabuli; Bernard Foley, Will Genia; Tom Robertson, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Allan Alaalatoa; Sam Carter, Adam Coleman; Ned Hanigan, Michael Hooper (capt), Scott Higginbotham.
Replacements: To be announced on Friday.
Scotland: Greig Tonks; Lee Jones, Alex Dunbar, Duncan Taylor, Rory Hughes; Finn Russell, Ali Price; Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown, Zander Fagerson; Ben Toolis, Jonny Gray; John Barclay (capt), Hamish Watson, Ryan Wilson.
