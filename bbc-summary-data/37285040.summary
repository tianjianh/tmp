Becky Godden murder: 'I'm sick' Christopher Halliwell told police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taxi driver accused of murdering a woman missing since 2003 told police he was "sick" as he confessed to her killing, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Halliwell denies murdering Becky Godden between 1 January 2003 and 3 April 2008.
Jurors were told he led police to her body and asked officers if it was "too late to get help".
They also heard Mr Halliwell, 52, is serving a life sentence for murdering Sian O'Callaghan in 2011.
Miss O'Callaghan went missing after a night out with friends in Swindon.
Her semi-naked body was discovered in undergrowth in Uffington, Oxfordshire, while the remains of Miss Godden were found "hidden in the middle of nowhere" in Eastleach, Gloucestershire in 2011.
The court heard that, while in Uffington, Mr Halliwell told Det Supt Steve Fulcher, who was leading the investigation: "We need to have a chat."
Mr Halliwell allegedly informed Mr Fulcher he would show him the "exact spot" where Miss Godden's body was buried.
The jury was told the accused asked what was wrong with him and said to Mr Fulcher: "Normal people don't go round killing each other."
Bristol Crown Court was told: "This defendant, Christopher Halliwell, confessed to the police that between 2003 and 2005 - he couldn't be sure of the date - he had taken a girl from the streets of Swindon.
"He told the police he had sex with her and then he killed her by strangling her. He told the police he stripped the girl of her clothes and concealed her naked body.
"Not only that but the defendant took the police to the location."
The court was told Miss Godden's skeletal remains were recovered from a field in March 2011 and soil from the area was later matched to dirt found on garden tools found at Mr Halliwell's house.
Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told the jury  the "last reliable sighting" of Miss Godden, then aged 20, was in Swindon town centre in January 2003.
"After that nothing more was heard from her. She quite literally disappeared."
The court heard Miss Godden's parents separated when she was aged about six.
"It is right to say Becky had a troubled adolescence," Mr Haggan said.
"She became a heavy user of Class A drugs and, at some point during her early to mid- teens, she began earning a living as a sex worker."
Miss Godden was last seen by her mother on 16 December 2002, and 11 days later a police officer recorded seeing her.
Then, in early January a friend spent time with her outside the Destiny and Desire nightclub in Swindon.
A taxi pulled up and Miss Godden approached it, returning to the car a short while later and arguing with the driver, Mr Haggan said.
"A short time later, Becky told her friends that she was leaving and she went back to the taxi," he told the jury.
"She got into the rear of the vehicle and the vehicle drove away."
"Extensive inquiries by the police indicate that this probably was the last known reliable sighting of Becky."
The case continues.
