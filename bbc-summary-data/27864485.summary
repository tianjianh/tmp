A three-year-old girl has died in hospital following a fire in Carmarthen, say police.

The girl's mother is in a serious condition in hospital, and her father is also in hospital.
Fire crews, police and an air ambulance were called to Bryn Gorwel in Carmarthen at 18:15 BST on Sunday.
The woman in her 20s was taken to Morriston Hospital, Swansea. The child died in the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.
A neighbour said she ran into the street when she heard screaming.
"It was chaos - everyone was screaming," she said.
"The black smoke was horrendous and there were loads of flames. People were crying.
"A man jumped out of the window and the mother was taken out by a fireman over his shoulder.
"The young girl was taken to hospital in a police Jeep."
The woman, who did not want to be named, said the family had moved into the area around two weeks ago.
Another neighbour, Sally Thomas, said: "It's a terrible experience."
One witness said the family had been out for a walk and had returned home around 40 minutes before the fire broke out.
It took almost four hours to bring the fire under control with three crews - two from Carmarthen and one from Kidwelly - attending.
Eight firefighters wearing breathing apparatus tackled the blaze and a thermal imaging camera was used.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the family's relatives were being supported by officers.
Inquiries are continuing to find out the fire's cause.
