[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman accusing a former Sunderland footballer of rape went to bed with two other players just a day before his trial began, a jury has heard.

Mobile phone footage showing the woman, the footballers and another woman in bed on Saturday night has been played to jurors at Hull Crown Court.
Cabral, whose real name is Adilson Tavares Varela, is accused of raping the 21-year-old at his flat in Gateshead in January 2015.
He denies two counts of rape.
Mr Varela's barrister Kitty Taylor asked the woman: "What on earth were you thinking?
"Preparing for this event by going out on Saturday night and ending up in bed with two professional footballers in the early hours of the morning?" she asked.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she "didn't class them as footballers" and had been in bed with her best friend.
She denied she had sex with either of the men in the video.
She had only had a relationship with one other player in the past, she said.
Ms Taylor asked whether she "liked and sought out the company of" black, professional footballers, which the woman repeatedly said was not the case.
The woman rejected Ms Taylor's contention that she was attracted to men "who have money, who can flash the cash on a Saturday night".
When the woman said she always paid her way, Ms Taylor asked if she could afford Â£1,200 magnums of vodka, such as the one bought by Mr Varela in a nightclub they visited.
The complainant said she had a lot of money for her birthday.
She also denied accusing the 27-year-old midfielder of rape to get compensation and said she had not known he was a footballer until last month.
Crying, she said she only wanted "this man to go to jail for what he's done".
Cabral, from the island of Cape Verde, only made one Premier League appearance for Sunderland in 2013-14 and now plays for Swiss club FC Zurich.
Sunderland announced on 2 February 2015 that the player had left the club by mutual consent.
