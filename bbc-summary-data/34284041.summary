He was swinging on a rope hung between two large flowerpots when one fell and crushed him, state prosecutor Jost Schuetzeberg told Reuters news agency.
Authorities in Eschweiler have ordered a post-mortem examination but say there is no indication of a criminal offence.
The boy and his family arrived there four weeks ago after a journey of more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Iraq.
He was taken to hospital but later died of head injuries, local media reported (in German).
The boy was attending the welcoming party, organised by local citizens and aid groups, together with his parents and his nine-year-old brother, city spokesman Rene Costantini said.
"It was a very tragic accident," he said, adding that the parents and the brother had been offered psychological help.
