[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship club Aston Villa reached the EFL Cup second round with a narrow away win at League Two Colchester.

Scott Hogan slotted in Villa's opener after U's keeper Sam Walker fumbled.
The hosts had an early chance to level after Christopher Samba took out Sammie Szmodics in the box, but Mikael Mandron's drilled penalty was saved.
Frankie Kent then inadvertently turned in Albert Aldomah's cross, before the United defender made it 2-1 at the other end shortly before half-time.
Colchester pushed for a leveller after the break but missed several chances as Villa - who made nine changes to their starting side after their league draw with Hull - held on to progress.
Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce: "The conditions were tough and we had a makeshift back four, so it was always going to be difficult.
"Jed (Steer) pulled off two or three very good saves and I'm delighted for him, because he's worked really hard to get back.
"He ruptured his Achilles in my first week at the club but he's a very decent goalkeeper and he got his rewards.
"You wouldn't send a lifeboat out in those conditions and I've never known anything like it for an August evening. It was unbelievable.
"We made too many mistakes but thankfully got away with it."
Colchester head coach John McGreal: "We showed a togetherness tonight, even after their first goal had gone in which came out of nothing.
"We bounced back straight away and showed a bit of character but then it went to 2-0 and we could have crumbled.
"But we bounced back again and I'm really proud of the players. The fans were on their feet at times and it was one of those games.
"We missed a penalty but that happens and we had opportunities after that when we got into good areas. It was great experience and a great game to watch - we can take a lot of heart and confidence out of the performance."
