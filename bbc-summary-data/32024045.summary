Afzal Amin was accused of attempting to form a plot with the EDL in which they would announce a march in the Dudley North constituency and he would take credit when it was scrapped.
Mr Amin had denied any wrongdoing
He said earlier on Monday he planned to make a "robust defence" of his actions at a party hearing on Tuesday.
Norman Smith, the BBC's assistant political editor, said the party hopes to have a new candidate in place by the weekend.
A Conservative spokesman said: "Afzal Amin is resigning as Conservative candidate for Dudley North with immediate effect.
"Conservative Chairman Grant Shapps has welcomed Mr Amin's decision and thanked him for his work in the past."
