A year ago Farah pulled out on the eve of this meet as the controversy around his coach Alberto Salazar reached a crescendo.
But roared on by a home support untroubled by that storm, he followed the pacemakers through the first 2,000m before hanging on over the last 600m to take a tenth of a second off that long-standing mark.
His seven minutes 32.62 seconds means he now holds the British track records at 1500m, two miles, 3,000m, 5,000m and 10,000m, as well as half-marathon on the road.
The Briton dedicated his victory to his hero Muhammad Ali, the boxing great who died on Saturday aged 74.
"I just want to wish his family well," the double Olympic champion told BBC Sport. "He was someone I looked up to and someone we've missed. That's for him for sure."

Yet his fellow 2012 gold medallist Greg Rutherford was well down on the form which saw him win in Rome last week as part of an unbeaten run going back to last July.
The reigning world, Olympic and European champion led briefly with a first round 8.17m, but with USA's Marquise Goodwin going out to 8.42m in the second round, Rutherford found himself first under pressure and then out of jumps after three other men pushed him into fifth.
Eilidh Doyle continued her fine start to the season with a second place in the 400m hurdles, finishing with the same time as USA's Cassandra Tate but missing out on the photo finish.

Doyle had won the Diamond League opener in Doha and then taken third in Rome, and she led to the line here before Tate's late surge and dip.
But there was disappointment for former world and Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu, down in seventh in the 400m with 52.40secs, with her compatriots Seren Bundy-Davies and Anyika Onuora fourth and fifth in a race won in style by France's Floria Guei.
Goldie Sayers, who looks likely to be upgraded to javelin bronze at the 2008 Olympics after a retrospective doping positive for Russia's Maria Abakumova, could manage only 57.08m, to finish her competition down in ninth.
And Jo Pavey's hopes of making her fifth Olympics at the age of 42 still hang in the balance after she was well outside the GB qualifying time in a 5,000m won by Vivian Cheruiyot in a sprint finish from her fellow Kenyan Mercy Cherono.
Colombia's Caterine Ibarguen came to Birmingham on a four-year, 38-event winning streak, her last defeat coming with triple jump silver at the London Olympics.
But a season's best of 14.61m from Kazakhstan's Olga Rypakova in the final round pushed the day's biggest favourite into second, her third round 14.56 almost half a metre down on her season's best.
The brilliant David Rudisha won the rarely run 600m, holding off the fast-finishing Frenchman Pierre-Ambroise Bosse in 1:13.10 - the second fastest time in history for the event - as he looks towards Rio and retaining the Olympic 800m title he won in such wonderful fashion four summers ago.
Another reigning world champion, Kenya's Asbel Kiprop, ran a world-leading time of 3:29.33 to dominate the men's 1500m, while Kendra Harrison brought home a USA one-two-three in the 100m hurdles.
Olympic champion Kirani James underlined his class with a meeting record 44.23secs win in the 400m, Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith running a season's best 45.13secs in fourth, while Mutaz Barshim jumped a world lead of 2.37m to hold off Erik Kynard by two centimetres in a tense high jump competition.
