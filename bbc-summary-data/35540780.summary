Well for 9-year-old George that dream came true when he was allowed on to the pitch at Everton and slotted home a cheeky goal.
George has cerebral palsy, a condition which affects how your muscles work.
Now he's beaten his idols to take the prize for the best goal of the month.
George himself became the fan's favourite when Everton supporters voted his goal as the best.
"I never thought I would win. I thought I'd come close because of all the support I've had but I can't believe I won!" said George when he found out.
"Thank you so much to everyone who voted for me."
See his award winning performance.
