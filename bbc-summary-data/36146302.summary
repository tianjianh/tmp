Drugs mule Melissa Reid 'to return to UK very soon'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drugs mule Melissa Reid is set to return to the UK "very soon" after Peruvian authorities agreed to expel her, according to the British embassy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old, jailed for cocaine smuggling in 2013, has been seeking to serve the remainder of her sentence closer to home in Scotland.
Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, and Michaella McCollum, from Co Tyrone, were jailed for more than six years.
They admitted trying to smuggle cocaine worth Â£1.5m from Peru to Spain.
A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Lima said Reid had been "granted expulsion back to the UK", and would be returning "very soon", but refused to comment further.
McCollum, 23, was freed last month under new legislation on early prison release introduced in Peru last year, after serving two years and three months.
However, it is anticipated she will have to remain in Peru for a considerable period as part of her parole conditions.
The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said they had received no word of Reid's expulsion, adding they would only be notified if she was set to serve the remainder of her sentence in Scotland.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We continue to provide consular assistance."
McCollum and Reid were caught with the haul at Lima airport on 6 August 2013 while attempting to fly to Spain.
They had claimed they were forced into carrying the drugs but pleaded guilty to charges later that year.
The pair were caught trying to board a flight with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage.
McCollum and Reid faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence of six years and eight months.
They had previously been held at Lima's Virgen de Fatima prison but were moved to the Ancon 2 prison, where McCollum was reportedly crammed into a cell with 30 other prisoners with poor sanitation and toilet facilities.
The SPS agreed in principle to a transfer in 2014 and Reid has been awaiting approval from the Peruvian authorities, who need to consent to her serving the remainder of her sentence under Scots Law.
Reid's father Billy has previously said that the impact of his daughter's crime on his family had been "horrendous".
He said: "Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru.
"She missed the significant event of her only brother's wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us. There'll be no celebrations in our house, there'll be no Christmas tree until we get her back home."
Mr Reid spoke out in a video warning of the consequences of drug offences abroad.
