[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester United v Chelsea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper David de Gea is expected to start for Manchester United after missing out against Sunderland with a hip problem and only making the substitutes' bench against Anderlecht.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wayne Rooney and Ashley Young are back in training after respective ankle and groin injuries and might be involved.
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte has a full-strength squad and could name an unchanged side.
Cesc Fabregas and Willian are the most likely of any players to earn a recall.
Guy Mowbray: "On paper it's one of the biggest fixtures of the season, but there are factors to suggest that this won't be a United-Chelsea classic.
"A close one as with last month's FA Cup tie? Almost certainly. End to end attacking excitement? Probably not.
"Chelsea will be fresher than United and quite frankly are much the better team right now, so Jose Mourinho is unlikely to set his side up for an open game.
"Moreover, he'll be very keen to avoid any prospect of a third defeat of the season to his old side - and maybe more pertinently to Antonio Conte.
"A fourth Old Trafford Premier League draw in a row will be a popular prediction."

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on Chelsea: "It's not for no reason that they are top of the league.
"It's not just because they're fresh but they have individual quality and they have collective quality.
"They have a certain style of play, they stick to it, they do it very well.
"For me, it is just a game. One more game. No difference for me."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "I have zero problems [with Mourinho]. It's only a sporting competition between him and me.
"There is a game of football. I want to try and win with my team. He wants to try and win with his team. It's normal to be at conflict during the game, but only a sporting conflict."
I was tempted to go for a draw but, because of United's schedule, I am going to back Chelsea to take another step towards the title.
