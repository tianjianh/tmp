Aurier was also fined €600 (£521, $674) in damages over the incident at a Paris nightclub in May.
He will remain free pending an appeal, which means he could play for PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday.
The 23-year-old was suspended earlier this year over his comments about the then-PSG coach Laurent Blanc.
Aurier was convicted on Monday of elbowing a police officer after leaving a nightclub in the early hours of 30 May.
The defender had been stopped to take a breath test after leaving a Parisian nightclub.
According to the police account, the officer involved needed to take a day off work to recover from his injuries.
Aurier denied the charge, arguing that he was a victim of police violence.
In addition to paying damages, he was charged a further €1,500 (£1,304; $1687) to cover court costs.
The PSG defender has had a troubled year. His suspension from the Ligue 1 side in February came after he appeared to use homophobic language to insult then-coach Laurent Blanc.
He also called his team-mate Angel di Maria a "clown" as he answered fan questions on social media app Periscope.
On Friday, he was sent off for a foul in the first half of PSG's Ligue 1 match against Toulouse.
Despite the sentencing, Aurier is expected to be available for PSG's tie against Ludogorets in Bulgaria on Wednesday.
