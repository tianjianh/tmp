The 26-year-old's loan at Swansea has come to an end after he joined from the Championship side in February.
Dutch international Fer, who made nine appearances for Swansea, still has a year to run on his QPR contract.
"The clubs have to sort it out, but I'm very happy [at Swansea]," he said after the 1-1 draw with Manchester City.
"Hopefully in the future I can sign a deal. I want to be more and more important for Swansea because the four months went well.
"I just need to wait and hopefully I can stay in Swansea."
Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin has admitted he will not have the final say on transfers this summer, but former Norwich player Fer says the Italian and chairman Huw Jenkins have been pleased with his contribution as Swansea secured their Premier League status.
"They're very happy with me right now, but they have to speak to QPR," he said.
"I was happy at QPR, but I always said I want to be playing at the highest league."
Fer, capped 11 times by Netherlands, joined QPR on a three-year deal in August 2014 from the Canaries, for a reported Â£8m.
He was part of the Rangers side relegated from the Premier League in 2014-15, and he was also relegated with Norwich in the previous campaign.
