The number of giant house spiders creeping into UK homes is set to rise after the hot wet summer weather, experts say.

The spiders, which can grow up to 12cm in length, are heading indoors to find a dry place to mate.
Despite the name, house spiders more commonly live in sheds and gardens.
Stuart Hine, insect specialist at the Natural History Museum said "they can give you a nip if you pick them up" but they are not harmful to humans.
He said: "This is mating season. The males when they are mature will leave their webs in search of a female spider, so off they go on their little trek to find love.
"In doing so they stop feeding so they actually don't live that long as an adult and they're just sort of roaming around."
The spiders enter homes through open doors and windows.
Mr Hine said: "When we get this type of weather we see a lot more of them but it doesn't necessarily mean there are a lot more of them. That said, they do well in years when there is plenty of food."
He said despite the name house spiders more commonly live in garages, sheds and under shrubs in the garden.
"They can give you a bit of a nip if you pick them up by the leg, saying 'please let go of me' in the politest way they know," he added.
"They can even draw a bit of blood, but they don't have venom that can have any effect on us."
Many people are frightened of spiders but don't panic - there are many ways to get rid of the eight-legged crawlers without killing them.
