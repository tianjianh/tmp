The protest was organised outside Stoke Newington police station on 28 July following the death of Rashan Charles.
Police said that while the protest was initially peaceful, it was used by some to commit disorder with fireworks and bottles hurled at officers.
An inquest into the death of Mr Charles is due to open later.
The 20 year old was followed by police in Dalston on 22 July but became ill and died and after putting an object in his mouth.
The peaceful demonstration took place on Kingsland Road, close to Middleton Road, during the afternoon of 28 July.
However, angry clashes broke out that evening with mattresses and bins set alight and missiles thrown at riot police.
Mr Charles' family later condemned the violence, saying any protests should be peaceful.
Scotland Yard are searching for a white woman, a black man and a light-skinned black man in connection with the disorder.
"Anyone who recognises any of those pictured is asked to contact the investigation team," Det Sgt Gareth Coffey said.
The inquest into Rashan Charles' death is due to open at Poplar Coroner's Court.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has previously said a package containing a "mixture of paracetamol and caffeine" was found in Mr Charles' throat but no cause of death has been confirmed.
