[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme that allows inmates at Magilligan Prison in County Londonderry to video-call their families via Skype is to be extended.

More than 70 approved prisoners currently have access to Skype technology from inside the prison near Limavady.
The prison is believed to be the first in the UK to allow inmates to use the technology.
Calls are made in a sound-proof suite, but are monitored by security cameras.
It was originally launched in a pilot scheme and could be extended to other prisons in Northern Ireland in the future.
Magilligan governor David Eagleson said: "The audio visual Skype link allows prisoners to make personal video calls to loved ones.
"We know that when prisoners have strong family support they're in better shape for reintegration to family and community and we see this as an important part of the rehabilitation process."
He added: "The uptake among the prison population was slow to start but it is being used by more and more prisoners, including foreign nationals, who are husbands and fathers and those who wish to maintain a good relationship with their families.
"We are now also planning to roll it out to more prisoners in the future."
Noel, a prisoner at Magilligan who uses Sykpe to talk to his family, said: "You can see this house and all, you can see even the wee dog running about - things you wouldn't see in ordinary visits.
"The Skype has made it a whole lot better.
"We just chat about their school work and all that type of thing."
