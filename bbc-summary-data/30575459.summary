Gold ring found in Swansea field declared treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 17th Century gold ring found by a metal-detecting enthusiast has been declared treasure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ron Pitman, 71, stands to earn a "finder's fee" for the discovery at Pennard, Swansea, in October 2010.
It bears the inscription "prepared bee to follow me," is 81% gold and 9% silver and dates back about300 years.
The ring was found 13cm (5in) below the surface of a field used to grow maize that had since been ploughed and rolled, Swansea Coroners Court heard.
In a report to the hearing, Dr Mark Redknapp, acting keeper of archaeology and numismatics at the National Museum and Gallery in Cardiff, said:  "Such rings can be difficult to date but the decoration and sentiments in this case suggests a 17th rather than 18th Century date."
