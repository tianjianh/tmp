Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock, watched by his father Neil and mother Glenys, spoke during Wednesday's debate on devolution: "I was born about 30 miles to the north east of Aberavon, in Tredegar, as was my father.
"My mother is of course form another country altogether known as north Wales They have always worked tirelessly to combat injustice and their dedication to public service has inspired me throughout my life."
Stephen Kinnock said he saw himself as "a global Welshman", having lived in many exotic lands, including England. "I believe Wales is a nation with the ability to punch far above its weight and I hope that I will have an opportunity to contribute to that worthy cause."
He also raised a local cause or two: "In Aberavon we like to connect our proud history to our promising present and our ambitious future. It is in this spirit that I wish to join those calling on the Ministry of Justice for the posthumous pardon of Dic Penderyn, a miner and son of Aberavon hanged in 1831 for his part in the Merthyr Uprising."
Cardiff North Tory Craig Williams told the debate his primary ambition during the next five years was to achieve a "city deal" for Cardiff. He saw it as an opportunity to deliver what he sees as "the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation - version two".
He was also critical of the Welsh government's refusal to adopt some UK government policies: "I will be shining lights on subjects where I think devolution is failing my constituents and the people of Wales."
Gower Tory MP Byron Davies  - a member of the National Assembly for Wales until recently - said the key question was the added value brought by devolution. He said he found "much discontent after 16 years of devolution in Wales" during his election campaign.
Mr Davies also had a message for his wife: "It's my wedding anniversary today and I forgot to send a card so I do hope this will make up for it."
Green MP Caroline Lucas told him that although his speech was "exceedingly good" she wasn't sure it would compensate for the lack of an anniversary card and he might want to buy one anyway.
