[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paramedics treated the man following the incident on The Kingsway at 13:00 BST on Monday.
He was taken to Morriston Hospital with non life-threatening injuries. The road has since reopened.
Mother-of-three and police officer Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, died after being hit by a bus on the road earlier this year.
Daniel Foss, 37, from Reynoldston, Gower, also died after being struck by a bus on the road in September 2013.
A Swansea council spokesman said the authority has "introduced safety barriers on the Kingsway's central reservation that follow on from the introduction of 20mph limits and pedestrian signage last year."
