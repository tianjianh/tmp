The 30 year old was injured when he and three other officers on foot patrol stopped a wanted man on Westmorland Road in Huyton at about 11:20 BST.
The 18-year-old man tried to flee but was caught by one of the other officers. He remains in custody.
The injured officer was taken to hospital with wounds to his back, which are not thought to be life threatening.
The suspect was arrested on suspicion of rape, relating to an attack in Liverpool in June, and assaulting a police constable.
Deputy Chief Constable Carl Foulkes paid tribute to the officers involved for their quick response to the knife attack.
"After seeing their colleague stabbed, three officers continued to attempt to arrest the man and successfully detained him," he said.
"I would like to commend their bravery and that of the officer who has been injured."
