Malcolm Corfield, 63, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, said the 30mm (3cm) artefact was a "find of a lifetime".
He said the cross was now in the hands of a coroner and, if it is declared treasure, museums could bid for it.
Mr Corfield was on a search with members of the Gwent Detecting Club when he dug up the cross.
"I had goose bumps. I couldn't believe what it was," he said.
