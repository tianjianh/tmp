Alex MacDonald's firmly struck free-kick gave the visitors an early lead and Josh Ruffels headed in a Marvin Johnson cross just before the break.
U's keeper Simon Eastwood had to get down well to stop a deflected Dan Hector effort before Kane Hemmings finished well after being played in.
Tyler Roberts made it 4-0 from a tight angle before Hemmings tapped home.
Merstham, from the Isthmian League Presmier Division, attracted a crowd of 1,920 for the game - about 10 times their normal home attendance.
They played with spirit throughout, but Dan Bennett's tap-in, which was disallowed for offside, was the closest they came to a consolation goal.
