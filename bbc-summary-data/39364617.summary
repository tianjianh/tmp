Glencoe Mountain, Nevis Range, CairnGorm Mountain and Glenshee are preparing to hold events for Ski-Scotland's Snow Fest.
Glenshee does not have enough snow for snowsports, but is taking part by holding a live music event.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said the winter had been "challenging".
The chairwoman of the snowsports industry body said: "No one can deny that it's been a challenging winter for Scotland's snowsports areas.
"However, it's not really been a mild winter. We have had good snow and some brilliant overhead weather for t-shirt skiing, but the fluctuating temperatures have meant that it's been a bit of a stop-start season so far."
She added: "Remember that we usually expect to ski well into May and that in previous years which had this sort of weather pattern there have often been large dumps of snow well into the spring."
Over the last few days, Glencoe, CairnGorm and Nevis Range have benefited from fresh snowfalls.
The sites provide updates on skiing conditions on their websites.
