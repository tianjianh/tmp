Bradford Bulls were liquidated on Tuesday after the Championship club's administrators were unable to find a suitable buyer.
The RFL has said the new Bradford side will take the place of the old one in the second tier but start the season with a 12-point deduction.
They have set a deadline of Monday, 9 January for bids to be submitted.
A decision is then expected within two weeks and, should an agreement be reached, the new Bradford side would play their first competitive game against Hull KR on Sunday, 5 February.
Jamie Peacock, who captained Bradford to their last Super League title in 2005 before joining Leeds, believes a reformed Bradford club can be successful if they can get through what is likely to be a tough spell in the short term.
"They had the same situation in 1963, reformed in 1964 and were winning trophies again within about five years," former England captain Peacock told BBC Radio 5 live.
"That may be more difficult this time, but I think they've got more chance of being successful now it's not saddled with the debts it's had.
"This year will be a difficult year for the club and whoever starts the club up again, given the handicap of losing 12 points.
"But if they can spend within their means this year and go hard again in 2018, there's no reason why can't become successful again."
