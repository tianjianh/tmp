Quique Sanchez Flores: Espanyol appoint former Watford boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores has been appointed Espanyol's new head coach, less than a month after the Spaniard left Vicarage Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 51-year-old - who is succeeded by ex-Inter Milan boss Walter Mazzarri at Watford - has signed a three-year deal.
Espanyol came 13th in La Liga in 2015-16 but only secured their top-flight status on the final day of the season.
Romanian Constantin Galca took charge of the Catalan club from December but did not get his contract renewed.
His departure paves the way for Flores to take his ninth job as a manager and he will be presented to the media on Monday.
The former Atletico Madrid and Valencia head coach spent just one season in the Premier League, guiding Watford to a 13th-place finish along with an FA Cup semi-final appearance.
