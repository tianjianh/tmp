Kirkconnel flooding affects Glasgow to Carlisle services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flooding at Kirkconnel in Dumfries and Galloway has affected trains running between Glasgow and Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ScotRail said replacement buses were put in place to and from Kilmarnock.
West coast train services are already badly affected by ongoing works until the end of February at Lamington Viaduct in South Lanarkshire.
By 12:30 ScotRail said services via Kirkconnel were returning to normal but were still subject to cancellation.
ScotRail said strong winds and prolonged, heavy rainfall had caused the disruption to services between Kilmarnock and Carlisle.
The company said it had introduced replacement buses "as quickly as possible" and they would continue to run in both directions until trains could return to normal.
A ScotRail Alliance spokeswoman said: "We are grateful to customers for their patience during the disruption this morning which is being caused by flooding on the line.
"Buses are running in place of trains to help keep people on the move."
