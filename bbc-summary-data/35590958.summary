Tourism NI case: Advertising agency AV Browne ends legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An advertising agency has ended its legal action against Tourism NI, after being ruled out of contention for a Â£14 million contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belfast firm AV Browne brought the case after missing a deadline in a bid for work.
The contract is for advertising and design work for a period of two to four years.
It should have been awarded earlier this year, but the legal action stalled the selection process.
The settlement of AV Browne's challenge was confirmed at Belfast High Court on Tuesday.
On Monday the court was told AV Browne's problem arose with the Department of Finance-run procurement website on 14 October 2015.
The agency's lawyer said just before the deadline, the portal froze.
It resulted in AV Browne's tender not being accepted.
No reasons were disclosed for the settlement and no order for costs was made between the parties.
