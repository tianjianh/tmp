The Australian, 23, featured in all of the club's Scottish Premiership fixtures as Thistle secured a highest top-flight finish (sixth) since 1981.
Edwards has made 55 appearances for Thistle since joining Alan Archibald's side from Reading in September 2015.
"I'm delighted to sign, it was a really easy decision," he told Jagzone TV.
"The club have been great with me since day one, and made my time on and off the pitch really easy-going and enjoyable."
