[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Illness forced Great Britain's Gabriella Taylor to retire from her quarter-final match against Kayla Day in the girls' singles at Wimbledon.

The 18-year-old had lost the first set 6-4 to the American and was serving at 1-1 in the second when she retired.
Southampton's Taylor was broken in her second service game when she double faulted and was unable to find a way back against the Day, the fifth seed.
Taylor, the British number nine, had been given a wildcard into the draw.
She struggled to find the consistency to match her earlier performances in the girls' singles, having progressed through the first three rounds by recording straight-sets victories.

Day, 16, served consistently, hit powerfully from the baseline and was able to dictate rallies while Taylor made 14 unforced errors to the American's six.
Taylor took time to compose herself between games towards the end of the first set before taking the decision to withdraw when 15-0 down in her second service game of the second set.
The teenager has been a regular on the senior circuit in 2016, playing nine ITF events and reaching the semi-finals of the hard-court tournament in Irapuato, Mexico, in March.
Having fallen in qualifying for both the WTA event in Birmingham and Wimbledon in June, Taylor has climbed to 419th in the world rankings and her next priority will be to gain more experience on the senior tour.
