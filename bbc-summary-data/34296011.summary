Blogger Jamie Bryson argues to give evidence to Nama inquiry in public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson has written to Stormont's inquiry into the National Asset Management Agency's (Nama) £1bn Northern Ireland loan sale to argue he should be allowed to give evidence in public session.

Mr Bryson is due to appear before the finance committee on Wednesday.
He made claims about the deal online.
But the committee has decided witnesses who cannot demonstrate a "direct link" to parties at the centre of the inquiry should be heard behind closed doors.
That evidence would then be published later and could be redacted, subject to legal advice.
In his letter, Mr Bryson took issue with the "direct link" criteria arguing that it is "ambiguous, open-ended and sets no clear parameters".
But he argued that he meets the criteria as he has "primary documentation" that proves he has a direct link to those involved.
Mr Bryson also praised the chair of the committee, Daithí McKay, for his conduct of the inquiry.
"I must place on record that I have been heartened and mightily impressed by the diligence of yourself in the chair and your desire to ensure transparency and equality for witnesses," Mr Bryson wrote.
Nama sold its Northern Ireland loan book to the Cerberus investment fund for more than £1.2bn in 2014.
It has been claimed in the Irish parliament that a Northern Ireland politician was to receive a payment as a result of the deal.
US investment fund Cerberus, which bought the Northern Ireland loans from Nama, has denied that any improper or illegal payments were made on its behalf.
Nama says the sales process was "robust, competitive and secured the best outcome for the Irish taxpayer".
