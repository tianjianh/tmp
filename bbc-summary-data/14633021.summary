Camping equipment left behind after Leeds Festival this weekend will be salvaged for reuse by community groups and individuals.

Everything is Possible is the charity responsible for collecting the unwanted equipment after the festival is over.
Only equipment that is in good condition is recycled but last year the haul included more than 1,000 tents.
A two-day sale then allows groups and individuals to get bargain equipment for a small donation.
The charity was set up in 1999 to support excluded young people, such as the homeless and those with drug or alcohol problems.
Now it helps to promote recycling during the Leeds Festival.
After the three-day event 60 volunteers scour the campsite for discarded tents, sleeping bags, mats, wellingtons and camping utensils.
Any salvaged, unopened food will be used by St George's Crypt in Leeds to help feed homeless and disadvantaged people.
As well as the tents about 2,000 sleeping bags or mats were also recovered after 2010's festival.
Raphael Harfaux, who is a coordinator for the charity, said: "Some people buy a tent just for the festival and then leave it all there.
"A lot of organisations need these tents for their activities."
Local community groups can apply to the charity to join with the salvage operation at Bramham Park and filling their vehicle with recycled equipment.
The remainder of the equipment is then available for sale on Tuesday and Wednesday in Leeds.
For the first time this year individuals are also invited to pick up bargain camping gear during the Wednesday sale.
