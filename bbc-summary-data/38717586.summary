White house press secretary Sean Spicer has become an internet meme on his first day in office.

In his press conference on Saturday, he said Donald Trump's inauguration had had the largest audience ever, a statement that was instantly mocked on Twitter.
He went on to back up his statement with a series of "facts", which were later dubbed "alternative facts" by White House aide Kellyanne Conway.
Since then, some other "alternative facts" have appeared on social media:
To support his statement, Sean Spicer outlined figures amounting to 720,000 people in the Mall, despite having asserted seconds before that "no-one had numbers" for the inauguration.
He also said the number of people taking Washington's subway system on the day had been higher than during Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013.
In fact, there were 782,000 tickets that year, but 571,000 this year, the Washington-area transit authority says.
Mr Spicer also said that plastic sheets had been used for the first time to cover the grass, which "had the effect of highlighting areas people were not standing whereas in years past the grass eliminated this visual".
In fact, the grass was also covered in 2013.
He added that fences and metal detectors had had an impact on attendance, but this has been denied by officials
Some Twitter users quickly started joking about other things Mr Spicer might claim were completely true, and a meme was born:
It wasn't long until Harambe was brought into it:
A parody account called Sean Spicer Facts was soon set up:
The hashtag #AlternativeFacts also trended after top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC to defend Mr Spicer.
When asked about the veracity of Mr Spicer's claims, she said he had given "alternative facts".
"Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods," NBC presenter Chuck Todd replied.
