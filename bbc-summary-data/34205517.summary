Almost half of Australian surgeons have suffered discrimination, sexual harassment or bullying, a report says.

The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) commissioned the external report in the wake of complaints from surgeons.
The results come after a senior surgeon sparked outrage over claims doctors should "comply with requests" for sex to save their careers.
The RACS has apologised to surgeons, stressing the need for change.
"I'm sorry that too many of us have been silent bystanders," RACS president Prof David Waters said. "This silence has been part of the problem."
The head of the RACS advisory group, former Victorian health minister Rob Knowles, said he was disturbed by the results, and surprised "at the depth and the entrenched nature of bullying and harassment".
The report recommends training, education, addressing gender inequality and actively holding surgeons and their employers to account.
