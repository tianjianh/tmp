[SN]TITLE[SN]
Polls open in Leicestershire County Council elections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Polling stations across Leicestershire have opened for the elections to decide who runs the county council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Registered voters will be able to cast their ballots from 07:00 to 22:00 BST.
The Conservatives won 30 of the 55 seats on the council at the 2013 elections, but have since gained a councillor due to a defection, giving them a majority of seven.
The election count will start on Friday and results will be published on the council's website.
