[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened outside Foyleside Shopping Centre in the city centre on Sunday.
Police said the lorry "rolled away" as it was being unloaded in Ferryquay Street at about 04:45 BST.
It rolled down Linenhall Street and Newmarket Street, hitting bollards, signs and a car before crashing into the shopping centre on Orchard Street.
No-one was injured in the crash.
Police have appealed for witnesses and said they were "particularly keen to speak with three young males who were in the area of Ferryquay Street around the time of the incident".
SDLP councillor John Boyle said the lorry "flattened" a number of bollards outside the Millennium Forum before ending up under the bridge.
However, Mr Boyle said significant damage has been caused to parts of Linenhall Street.
The lorry remains at the scene.
A police spokesman said Newmarket street and Orchard Street remain closed and diversions are in place.
