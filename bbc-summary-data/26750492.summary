[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rupert Murdoch has appointed his two sons, Lachlan and James, to top roles at his media and entertainment empire.

Lachlan returns to the Murdoch empire as co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, having previously stood back to focus on his own businesses.
Meanwhile, younger son James was appointed co-chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox.
After the phone hacking scandal, James quit as executive chairman of News International in 2012.
News Corp is one of the world's biggest media organisations, and owns newspaper titles The Times, Sun, and the Wall Street Journal.
News Corp split from 21st Century Fox in 2013. The business owns broadcaster Fox News in the US and British Sky Broadcasting in the UK.
Rupert Murdoch, who went through a high-profile split with wife Wendi Deng last year, said Lachlan was a "talented executive" with a "rich" knowledge of the business.
Lachlan will report to Chase Carey, chief executive at 21st Century Fox.
Rupert said: "I am very pleased he is returning to a leadership role at the company, where he will look closely with me, Chase, James and rest of the board of directors to drive continued growth for years to come."
He also said he was "pleased" to promote James into the "important role".
There is reportedly no new role for the third sibling, Elisabeth Murdoch, however, who sought to distance herself from James after the phone hacking scandal.
