West Midlands Police have released a recording of the call to reinforce the message that dialling 999 should be reserved for genuine emergencies.
Ch Insp Sally Holmes said this kind of call keeps operators from dealing with "a genuine life or death emergency".
She said West Midlands Police receive more than 1,500 emergency calls a day.
