Tens of thousands of protesters have attended an annual pro-democracy march in Hong Kong.

Protesters held photos of bookseller Lam Wing Kee, who returned in June after eight months saying he had been detained in the mainland.
Mr Lam was to lead the march but dropped out over fears for his personal safety.
Five booksellers went missing after being linked to books critical of China's leaders.
Some in Hong Kong feel the treatment of the booksellers is a sign of Beijing's growing social and political influence in the city.
Albert Ho, a lawmaker who has been advising 61-year-old Mr Lam, told the BBC: "He feels he is under intense surveillance."
"He has been physically followed by unknown people. He is under intense pressure."
Mr Ho added that arrangements were being made for Mr Lam to go to a safe house.
1. Lui Bo, General Manager, went missing in Shenzhen, 15 October
2. Cheung Jiping, business manager, 32, went missing in Dongguan, 15 October
3. Gui Minhai, co-owner, 51, went missing in Thailand, 17 October
4. Lam Wing Kee, manager, 60, last seen before detention in Hong Kong, 23 October
5. Lee Po, shareholder, 65, went missing in Hong Kong, 30 December
The 1 July march marks nineteen years since the city's handover from Britain to China.
Organisers said 110,000 people had attended but police said the number was 19,300.
Marchers also called for the resignation of Chief Executive CY Leung, who has faced criticism for what protesters say was a failure to protect the booksellers.
"The fact that he [Lam Wing Kee] and others were so blatantly made disappeared should be an alarm for everyone in Hong Kong," Billy Leung, a charity worker told the Associated Press.
"If you have a critical mind and you start criticising what you think is not correct and not right, it could very well be you next time."
A separate pro-independence "black-mask" rally is also planned outside China's liaison office by the growing localist movement in protest over Mr Lam's treatment.
What are Hong Kong's localists angry about?
Police say that the pro-independence protests have not asked for required permission and have warned that they will take "resolute and effective actions" against illegal acts.
Last year's anniversary democracy rally saw an estimated 48,000 people take part, with police placing the number at 20,000.
