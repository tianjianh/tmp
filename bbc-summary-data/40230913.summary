[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A third-wicket stand of 146 from Samit Patel and Cheteshwar Pujara put Nottinghamshire in a strong position against Gloucestershire at Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Roderick fell four runs short of a ton, bowled by Luke Wood (3-85) who took two wickets in as many balls as the hosts were all out for 303.
The visitors slipped to 74-2 when openers Steven Mullaney (38) and Jake Libby (30) fell in successive overs.
But Patel (78*) and Pujara (67) guided Notts to 221-3 at close, 82 behind.
Both men had to be patient for their runs, with Patel bringing up his half-century off 120 balls, while it took the Indian Test star 13 further deliveries to reach his 50.
Nottinghamshire batsman Cheteshwar Pujara told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I didn't want to get out. Not on this wicket where I was really comfortable.
"At times it was difficult to score runs, but if you apply yourself out there they can't get you out.
"We don't have to do anything extra, just keep batting the same way. If we can get to 400 it will be tough for them on day four."
