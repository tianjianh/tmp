The development, in the Porth Teigr area, would feature hotel apartments, offices, a pop-up market, street food venues and an outdoor TV screen.
The Welsh Government has given initial approval to lease a small piece of land to developers DS Properties.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said it could become the first development of its kind in the UK.
The proposal could "bring a host of exciting leisure and business opportunities" to the derelict and disused site, he added.
Simon Baston, director of DS Properties, the company behind the Grade II-listed Tramshed, said it would be an "innovative space".
