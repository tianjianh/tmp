[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Stuart Armstrong tapped in from Leigh Griffiths' ball across goal.
After half-time Celtic scored twice in a minute, Armstrong's long-range shot added to by Griffiths taking advantage of Adam Barton's error.
Liam Lindsay headed a consolation, but Celtic continued to press and Callum McGregor finished Emilio Izaguirre's cut-back.

Partick had limited Celtic to a few half-chances in the opening 40 minutes, the champions never looking in danger of conceding but not exactly moving at their fluent best.
From a contest, though, Celtic opened up in the space of eight minutes either side of the break. Having defended well for much of the half, Thistle switched off just before half-time. Griffiths slid a ball in from the left and Armstrong was the only alert man in the six-yard box, driving home a close-range finish.
The second came when Griffiths rolled a free-kick into Armstrong's path, who then curled it beyond goalkeeper Tomas Cerny. Armstrong was a key man again for the visitors but Cerny was unconvincing when trying to keep out his effort.
Last season's 40-goal man has had his thunder stolen by Moussa Dembele since he got injured back in August. This was only his third start since then and his goal - and his earlier assists - would have come as blessed relief.
The one that made it 3-0 came only a minute after Armstrong's second and it was about determination, awful defending and class finishing. He mugged Barton of possession on the right-hand side of the penalty area, spun away from him impudently and then whipped his shot past Cerny. Cheeky and ruthless.
On the hour, Lindsay got his head on the end of free-kick and sent a diagonal effort across and beyond Craig Gordon. Celtic had gone to sleep at the back.
Bizarrely, the same thing happened again five minutes later - another Partick free-kick, another free header, from Sean Welsh. Welsh was just offside, but Celtic's concentration levels had deserted them again.
Celtic have scored four or more goals in half of their league games so far this season. Their fourth here was a while coming - they had chances to do it earlier - but they eventually found their way through again.
Dembele was on the field by then, playing up front with Griffiths -  just what Partick didn't want to see - but it was Izaguirre, the full-back, who did the damage and not the strikers, and it was McGregor who thumped it home.
That was their 43rd league goal in 14 games and it all meant that their lead at the top of the Premiership stretched out to 11 with two games in hand over second-placed Rangers.

Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "We made it tough for ourselves. You can't give good sides goals. We struggled with the basics tonight, they got in behind us with a couple of long balls and that was the disappointment. Good sides can cut you open but I thought we gave them goals.
"We got into good positions but we didn't do anything with it. You've got to have that belief and we didn't have that tonight."
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: "I don't think Partick Thistle have conceded more than two goals in a game this season. On the back of Tuesday night [away to Manchester City] with only two days recovery, to come here and play to that level was exceptional really.
"You give Partick credit tonight, they made it really difficult, but the mentality in the team is very strong. I can see the development, the relationship between training and the game, they are taking on board the concepts of our build-up play and consolidating the game and then we've obviously got goals in the team.
"We're staying very composed and calm under pressure and that's a really good sign."
