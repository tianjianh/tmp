A Grade-II* listed building is to be temporarily decorated with a mural to celebrate Leicester City's Premier League title win, despite opposition.

Historic England said it could "harm the appreciation and understanding" of the Newarke Houses Museum.
But the city council has approved placing the mural on the building for two years.
It is the fourth of six pieces of art which the council has commissioned to celebrate the Foxes' 5,000-1 success.
Live updates and more from Leicestershire.
The mural, which features Buddhist images, will celebrate the Thai heritage of Leicester City's owners.
The Foxes stunned the Premier League by winning the title by 10 points in May.
Councillor Ted Cassidy said: "The committee took into account the objections and views of Historic England and decided that on balance, this was acceptable for that particular part of the building.
"It may in fact encourage people to go to that side."
Three murals have already been painted on to walls in the city to celebrate the title win.
Historic England had hoped the council would find a "less sensitive" building for the latest mural to be painted.
It also suggested the work could be painted on free-standing boards so it could be moved around.
"Only 8% of all listed buildings are Grade II*, making this a particularly important site," a spokesperson for Historic England said.
"It dates back to the early 16th Century and much of its medieval core survives, with later changes made in the 18th Century.
"It is an intriguing, attractive building which reflects the rich historical and architectural importance of this area of Leicester."
The council now has three years in which to start work on the mural.
