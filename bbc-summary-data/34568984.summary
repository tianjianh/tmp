[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, named as 24-year-old John Santos Gurgao from Brazil, swallowed 0.8kg (1.8lb) of the drug, the Irish Times reported.
It is believed that one or more of the packages burst during the flight.
A Portuguese woman in her 40s, also on the flight from Lisbon, was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences.
It is not clear if her arrest is linked to the man's death.
Toxicology tests have been carried out on the consignment found in the man's stomach, which reportedly had a street value of around Â£40,000 ($61,900).
Passengers said the man became agitated and then violent and had to be restrained.
A doctor and a nurse treated the man aboard the plane after he lost consciousness.
The captain declared a medical emergency and diverted the plane to Cork airport, landing early evening local time.
About 170 passengers and crew members were taken from the aircraft and were interviewed by police about the incident.
