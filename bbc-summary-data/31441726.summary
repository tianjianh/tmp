But while everyone pokes fun on social media, how different is North Korea's political language to the UK's?
Well, you might not hear this in Norfolk: "Should the enemy dare to invade our country, annihilate them to the last man!"
But other phrases are not so clear cut.
North Korea is very proud of its agricultural prowess, so we've pitted some of the secretive state's slogans against things said by our own Environment Secretary Liz Truss, MP for South West Norfolk.
We may have added a few ! marks to level the field, but can you work out who said what?
