Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been honoured with the Zurich Film Festival's top award, the Golden Icon, for his work in film and politics.

Schwarzenegger is best known as the hardman of cult movies such as the Terminator and Conan the Barbarian.
He served two terms as California governor from 2003 to 2011 before returning to acting in The Expendables.
"I'm happy to be back into acting and that I did my public service. I will be doing many more movies," he said.
Previous recipients of the Golden Icon have included Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman.
Austrian-American Schwarzenegger, 68, was presenting his latest film, Maggie, at the festival.
He plays a farmer struggling to look after his dying daughter, played by Little Miss Sunshine actress Abigail Breslin.
In something of a departure for the actor, the film is a horror thriller.
He is more commonly associated with action roles, with his major breakthrough 1982's Conan the Barbarian, which led to a sequel and then to further hit action movies, most notably the Terminator series and Predator.
He has also ventured into comedy, with notable films including Twins, with Danny DeVito, and Kindergarten Cop.
Schwarzenegger's worldwide fame as both actor and politician belie his relatively humble roots. He grew up in rural Austria, the son of the local police chief.
From an early age, he had a keen interest in fitness and bodybuilding and it was this that saw him emigrate to the US.
He made his name and fortune after coming to prominence as the winner of Mr Universe when he was 20.
Last month television network NBC said Schwarzenegger would replace US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as the host of reality show The Celebrity Apprentice.
