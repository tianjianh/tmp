[SN]RESTBODY[SN]

Compiled by BBC Sport's Shamoon Hafez
JOEL CAMPBELL (22, striker) Arsenal
Linked with: Swansea, Stoke
The pacey Costa Rican has barely had a look-in this season for the Gunners, despite starring at the World Cup. Finds himself behind Danny Welbeck, Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo in the pecking order. Could make a loan move to Swansea or Stoke.
RON VLAAR (29, defender) Aston Villa
Linked with: Manchester United, Arsenal
Solid performances for the Dutch during their World Cup semi-final run saw the central defender's stock rise and his contract runs out in the summer. Manchester United and Arsenal - who both need to reinforce their defences - could sign him for a cut-price fee.
PETR CECH (32, goalkeeper) Chelsea
Linked with: Liverpool, Arsenal
The Czech has found himself on the bench this season following Thibaut Courtois' capture of the number one spot. May look to move away from Stamford Bridge to ensure first-team football, and the experienced stopper would solve Liverpool's goalkeeping crisis.
MARIO BALOTELLI (24, striker) Liverpool
Linked with: Inter Milan, Napoli
Brendan Rodgers took a gamble in the summer on the problematic frontman bought to replace Luis Suarez, but the move has failed to pay off, with the Italian failing to score in the Premier League so far. A return to former club Inter Milan under manager Roberto Mancini has been mooted.
ANDERSON (26, midfielder) Manchester United
Despite winning 10 major trophies at Old Trafford, the Brazilian has struggled with form, injuries and weight issues and is now out-of-favour. A permanent move to Fiorentina failed to materialise last season. Contract may be cancelled to facilitate a move back home to Brazil.
SAIDO BERAHINO (21, striker) West Brom
Linked with: Tottenham, Liverpool
Earned his first call-up to the England national side in November after his goalscoring exploits for the Baggies, where he has netted seven goals this season. Has attracted the attention of Liverpool and Tottenham who are looking to boost their options in attack.
WILL HUGHES (19, midfielder) Derby County
Linked with: Liverpool
Considered one of English football's hottest talents outside the top-flight, the England Under-21s international has been a consistent performer for the high-flying Rams over the last three seasons. Liverpool may firm up their interest, despite the player signing a new contract in the summer.
ALEX MOWATT (19, midfielder) Leeds United
Linked with: Aston Villa, Everton
The youngster came through the academy and broke into the first-team last season, making 29 Championship appearances and recently named Football League young player of the month. Has netted four times in the league so far this campaign. Aston Villa and Everton have been monitoring his progress.
KRIS COMMONS (31, forward) Celtic
Linked with: Crystal Palace, Leicester
The current PFA Scotland Player of the Year netted 32 goals last season as Celtic won the league, but is yet to agree a new contract which ends in the summer. Has been told he will not be offered a long-term deal. Crystal Palace and Leicester have been linked with the player.
LEWIS MACLEOD (20, midfielder) Rangers
Linked with: Everton, Burnley
Received his first Scotland call-up in November after a string of impressive performances for his club in the middle of the park and has represented the national side at all junior levels. Everton or Burnley could take advantage of the Ibrox club's perilous financial situation.

ALESSIO CERCI (27, winger) Atletico Madrid
Linked with: Arsenal, Inter Milan
The versatile forward signed from Torino in the summer, but his impact has been limited and he recently admitted he is running out of patience at his failure to earn more playing time. Arsenal have been linked but his departure could depend on whether Atletico can sign a replacement.
SAMI KHEDIRA (27, midfielder) Real Madrid
Linked with: Chelsea, Manchester United
The German has struggled to establish a regular starting place, not helped by a series of injuries. Contract expires at the end of the season and could wait to ensure a bumper 'Bosman' deal, but Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal are all reportedly keen to secure him sooner.
AYMERIC LAPORTE (20, centre back) Athletic Bilbao
Linked with: Manchester United
Widely regarded as one of the best young defenders in La Liga, Laporte has stated his commitment to Athletic, but a poor season for the club both domestically and in Europe may force him to consider his future if his £33m buy-out clause is met. Manchester United have been linked.
PEDRO LEON (28, winger) Getafe
Linked with: West Brom, West Ham
The ex-Real Madrid playmaker missed the first few months of the season after being barred by La Liga because his salary takes Getafe over their league-imposed wage limit. Has returned to action amid legal wrangling, but doubts over his future remain and West Brom have been linked.
MARTIN MONTOYA (23, right-back) Barcelona
Linked with: Liverpool, Juventus
The homegrown right-back - who has been on the fringes of the Barca squad for the last four years - is surplus to requirements, having been overtaken by summer signing Douglas as back-up to Dani Alves. Premier League suitors will face stiff competition from Juventus, among others.

Germany
XHERDAN SHAQIRI (23, midfielder) Bayern Munich
Linked with: Liverpool, Napoli
Having arrived from Basel with a big reputation in 2012, has never nailed down a first XI spot - hardly surprising when Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are the competition. Scorer of a hat-trick for Switzerland in 2014 World Cup, he has interest from clubs including Liverpool and Napoli.
AARON HUNT (28, midfielder) Wolfsburg
Linked with: Werder Bremen
German left-footed international midfielder, with an English mother, has struggled to make an impact since joining on a free from Werder Bremen, having previously interested a host of Premier League clubs. Sporting director Klaus Allofs insists "nobody" will be allowed to leave in January.
France
EZEQUIEL LAVEZZI (29, winger) Paris Saint-Germain
Linked with: Inter Milan, Napoli, Valencia
The Argentine has had an excellent 2014, but with FFP a major concern, PSG would countenance the departure of a player who has 18 months to run on his contract. Serie A suitors include Inter and old club Napoli, but there are serious doubts they would be able to match his lucrative salary.
Italy
KEVIN STROOTMAN (24, midfielder) Roma
Linked with: Manchester United
The Dutchman has only just returned to action following a serious knee injury and was booed by home fans in a recent match with Sassuolo. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is a big fan of the player's wide range of passing and could make a £32m move to Old Trafford.
Portugal
ENZO PEREZ (28, midfielder) Benfica
Linked with: Manchester United, Valencia
The 2013-14 Portuguese Liga Player of the Year impressed for Argentina in the latter stages of the World Cup and was close to joining Valencia in the summer. The club are expected to come back in for him and are favourites to clinch a deal ahead of interested Premier League parties.
NICOLAS GAITAN (26, midfielder) Benfica
Linked with: Manchester United, Monaco
This winger-cum-playmaker has flourished since arriving in Lisbon as a nominal replacement for Angel Di Maria in 2010, and has eight assists in the Liga already this campaign. Extensively scouted by Manchester United in recent seasons, Monaco are poised to bid for him again.
Netherlands
NIKLAS MOISANDER (29, defender) Ajax
Linked with: Tottenham, Napoli
The central defender has become captain in his second spell at the club, but his contract is up at the end of the season and he has shown little inclination to sign a new deal. Everton could come back in for the Finland stopper, with Spurs and Napoli also thought to have an interest.
Ukraine
BERNARD (22, winger) Shakhtar Donetsk
Linked with: Tottenham, Inter Milan
A 2013 Copa Libertadores winner with Atletico Mineiro, the Brazil midfielder pondered long and hard before joining Shakhtar straight after. He has never truly established himself, however, in Mircea Lucescu's first-team. Clubs in England and Italy are tracking this speedy creator.
YOUNES BELHANDA (24, midfielder) Dynamo Kiev
The Moroccan playmaker surprised many when he opted for Dynamo in August 2013, having previously expressed an interest in moving to England. Though the league leaders are very pleased with his contribution, both player and club's heads could be turned be a big offer.
Turkey
WESLEY SNEIJDER (30, midfielder) Galatasaray
Linked with: Manchester United, Manchester City
Club and player briefly clashed when Sneijder's wages went unpaid in October. That was quickly resolved, but it seems the Istanbul giants have little desire to open talks on extending his expensive contract, especially after European elimination. Could finally make the move to England.

Brazil
LUCAS SILVA (21, midfielder) Cruzeiro
Linked with: Real Madrid
A key player in the team that has won the last two Brazilian league titles, and the best passing central midfielder the country has produced for some time, with sound positional sense. 2014 Champions League winners Real Madrid head his list of admirers.
JOEL TAGUEU (21, forward) Coritiba
Linked with: Cruzeiro
The lanky, left-footed centre forward was born in Cameroon but has been based in Brazil for five years. Capped at junior level for his country. His goals in the second half of the season saved his club from relegation, and could pave the way for a move to Germany.
Argentina
LUCAS ROMERO (20, midfielder) Velez Sarsfield
Linked with: Torino, Flamengo
A tough and talented Argentine central midfielder, often compared to Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano. Maybe more reminiscent of a slightly more defensive version of a young Diego Simeone. Is being watched by leading Italian clubs.
Uruguay
GASTON PEREIRO (19, midfielder) Nacional
Seen by some as a left-footed Uruguayan Socrates.  Skilful, confident and versatile, the attacking midfielder is being watched by 2014 La Liga champions Atletico Madrid. Current team-mate and former Inter Milan forward Alvaro Recoba expects great things from him in Europe.
Ecuador
JUNIOR SORNOZA (20, midfielder) Independiente del Valle
Linked with: Burnley, Derby
The Ecuadorian attacking midfielder - a fine striker of the ball - is being linked with a move to England. Two problems though; four caps in friendlies may not be enough for a work permit, and he would seem to lack the dynamism needed in the English game.

Algeria
AKRAM DJAHNIT (23, attacking midfielder), ES Setif
Djahnit's club won the Africa Champions League in 2014 and he was one of the key players, finding the back of the net five times, including in the first leg of the final. Won 'best prospect' at the Algerian football awards in December. Has been linked with a move to Europe.
BAGHDAD BOUNEDJAH (23, striker) Etoile du Sahel
Algeria had a 2014 to remember and Bounedjah is one of their brightest prospects. He was top scorer in the Tunisian league last season and has been regularly leading the charts during this campaign. Any English clubs interested would face strong competition from the Bundesliga.
South Africa
RIVALDO COETZEE (18, defender) Ajax Cape Town
Linked with: Ajax
He's got a legendary first name but unlike the Brazilian, Coetzee is a centre-back. Became the youngest player to represent Bafana Bafana, when he made his debut at 17 years and 361 days old. Ajax Cape Town's parent club, Ajax Amsterdam have been watching him.
ITUMELENG KHUNE (27, goalkeeper) Kaizer Chiefs
Considered by many to be the second best keeper in Africa behind Nigeria and Lille's Vincent Enyeama. Has just recovered from a long-term ankle injury. High price tag has put European clubs off in the past but is out of contract at the end of the season.
DR Congo
FIRMIN NDOMBE MUBELE (20, forward) AS Vita
Made headlines in March after scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win against Kaizer Chiefs in the African Champions League. Nominated for CAF's African footballer of the Year award, for players based in Africa.  A raw talent with plenty to learn but is one to watch at the Africa Cup of Nations.
Compiled by MLS football reporter Sean Wheelock
ROBBIE KEANE (34, striker) Los Angeles Galaxy
Linked with: QPR
Makes a strong case as the greatest foreign import in Major League Soccer's 19 year history. In three-and-a-half seasons, he has won three MLS Cups (including this season), and was named the league's 2014 Player of the Year. QPR have been rumoured as a suitor.
LEE NGUYEN (28, midfielder) New England Revolution
Linked with: Southampton
His 20 goals and excellent work rate were major factors in Nguyen being named an MLS Player of the Year finalist, and his club finishing as league runner up.  The former PSV man could be headed back to Europe, with reported interest coming from Southampton.
JERMAIN DEFOE (32, striker) Toronto FC
Linked with: QPR
Scored 11 goals for Toronto FC, but none in his club's final 18 matches of the MLS 2014 campaign. Transfer rumours started to swirl in August when the club publicly stated that they would consider high priced offers for Defoe. QPR has been mentioned as the next stop.
GYASI ZARDES (23, striker) Los Angeles Galaxy
Labelled as the next star in US soccer, following his breakout campaign in 2014. Playing in the long shadows cast by Landon Donovan and Robbie Keane, he still managed 19 goals in all competitions this year, including the opening tally in December's MLS Cup Final.
AJ SOARES (26, defender) New England Revolution
Linked with: Hellas Verona
A strong, smart, and athletic central defender, becomes an even more attractive candidate for UEFA clubs due to holding an EU passport, despite being born and raised in California. Reports from the US have been trickling out that a move away from the MLS is imminent.

UAE
OMAR ABDULRAHMAN (23, forward) Al Ain
Linked with: Manchester City, Liverpool
A gifted playmaker with all the tricks and has a precise left foot from which he can pick out a pass. Impressed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and then turned down an offer from Manchester City. Has also been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and La Liga side Valencia.
Japan
YOSHINORI MUTO (22, midfielder) FC Tokyo
Japan produces midfielders by the bullet train but top-class strikers are a little rarer. This confident young man could be the real deal with his speed and dribbling ability. A number of Bundesliga clubs are monitoring the player's situation.
South Korea
KIM SHIN-WOOK (26, striker) Ulsan Hyundai
The South Korean version of Peter Crouch has had a very good year with the only question mark on whether injury means he will move in January or July. Has already turned down Spartak Moscow and there has been interest from Premier League teams.
Indonesia
EVAN DIMAS (19, midfielder) Persebaya Surabaya
The wonderkid impressed on his senior debut in 2014 and has already trained at FC Barcelona. Looks to be the creative force that this football mad country has been waiting for. Inter's Indonesian owner Erick Thohir is said to be a fan but a smaller league would be a better first step.
Thailand
CHANATHIP SONGKRASIN (21, midfielder) BEC Tero Sasana
Known as 'Messi Jay' by fans in Thailand for his small stature and skills, the youngster has been in perfect form this year, leading Thailand to the ASEAN title to end a 12-year wait for major international silverware. A longer shot but clubs in Europe are waking up to this young talent.

MATTHEW SPIRANOVIC (26, defender) Western Sydney Wanderers
Linked with: Liverpool
An elegant ball-playing centre-back, Spiranovic caught the attention of Brendan Rodgers during his time at Swansea, who maintained his interest when he took over at Liverpool. A move did not happen but now entering the peak of his career, may want to test his luck in Europe one more time.
MARK MILLIGAN (29, central midfielder) Melbourne Victory
An all-action midfielder with a great range of passing, Milligan can also fill in at central defence. A Socceroos regular, Crystal Palace came calling three times to no avail last season and a lucrative move to the Middle East fell through. The ship may have sailed for Milligan in Europe.
TERRY ANTONIS (21, central midfielder) Sydney FC
Things have not fallen Antonis' way during his young career. Unable to sign a five-year contract with Everton at 14 due to Fifa regulations, a move to Parma fell through in 2013. Has pulled the strings in midfield for the club since recovering from a ruptured quad tendon.
DANIEL DE SILVA (17, attacking midfielder/left winger) Perth Glory
An impressive Under-20s World Cup for the then 16-year-old De Silva caught the attention of Manchester United scouts. A number 10 who can also play on the left wing, De Silva has already signed with Roma for the end of the A-League season but is a name to remember.
AWER MABIL (19, winger) Adelaide United
Linked with: Ajax
A fleet-footed but raw winger, Mabil is set to trial with Dutch giants Ajax during the January transfer window. Mabil made his debut for Adelaide as a 17-year-old and has terrorized defenders with his quick feet but has been prone to fluffing his lines in the final third.
