Ashley Williams: Facing Swansea was 'a bit weird' says Everton defender

Everton defender Ashley Williams says it was a strange experience facing former club Swansea City, who he believes can escape relegation

Wales captain Williams, 32, left Swansea to join Everton in August.
Swansea were denied only their second win of the season in a 1-1 draw to leave them bottom of the Premier League
"It does seem a little bit weird when you're in the tunnel and looking across at people you've played with for a number of years," he said.
"You try and keep it as normal as possible but at the same time you understand you're playing against your former team and a lot of good friends."
Gylfi Sigurdsson had put the Swans ahead at Goodison Park with a penalty in the 41st minute after he had been dragged down by Everton captain Phil Jagielka.

But Seamus Coleman scored a minute from time, with a looping header to salvage the draw, and deny Swansea a first victory under manager Bob Bradley.
The Swans, who have not won since their opening day 1-0 victory at Burnley in August, are five points off safety at the bottom of the Premier League.
But Williams, who played more than 350 games in eight years for the Welsh club, says his former club can get themselves out of their current predicament.
"When I was there we were down there a couple of times and we fought," Williams added.
"There's a strong set of lads there and some really good players as well with a good mentality and good attitude.
"I'm sure they're working hard to get themselves out of it.
"They defended really well in the second half and they played some good stuff as well."
