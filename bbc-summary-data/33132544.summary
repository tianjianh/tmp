Borders Railway tickets affected by website glitch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A website glitch has meant many people trying to buy some of the first tickets for the new Borders to Edinburgh railway were unable to do so.

Most of the new stations were not recognised by the ScotRail website.
Galashiels to Edinburgh tickets could be booked but at almost three times the previously announced price.
ScotRail said it was due to a technical glitch with the Thetrainline website which they were working to correct as soon as possible.
The 30-mile rail route between Tweedbank and Edinburgh is due to take its first passengers on 6 September.
It was expected that tickets would go on sale on Sunday but the website issues left many people unable to make their purchases.
A number took to social media to voice their concerns at the situation.
ScotRail stressed that the price currently being quoted for the trip from Galashiels to Edinburgh was not representative of those which would be charged to travel on the Borders line.
"We are working with Thetrainline to get that fixed," a spokeswoman said.
"It is a technical glitch on the Thetrainline website."
Scottish Borders Council leader David Parker said he understood public frustration and said he had contacted ScotRail to seek a swift solution.
"I think it is fair to say it could have gone better from ScotRail's point of view - it's not good that we have had this hiccup," he said.
"Certainly on the first day that tickets go on sale I can totally understand the Borders public's frustrations.
"What I can say is that we have contacted ScotRail and we are asking them to get it changed as quickly as possible and make sure the correct information is out there.
"Hopefully that will be done in the very imminent future."
