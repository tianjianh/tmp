About 20 academics from Europe, Australia and US are to attend.
Faber's book The Crimson Petal and the White was adapted for a BBC TV drama, while Under the Skin was made into a film starring Scarlett Johansson.
He won the 2015 Saltire Book of the Year award for A Book of Strange New Things.
Earlier this year, he published his first collection of poetry.
Faber will give a reading at the event, Defying Genre: Michel Faber, which is to be held on 21 and 22 July at Inverness College UHI.
Born in Holland and raised in Australia, the writer has lived and worked in the Highlands for more than 20 years.
His first published book was a collection of short stories, Some Rain Must Fall, in 1998.
The title piece won the Ian St James Award in 1996 while another of the stories, Fish, won the Macallan Prize in the same year.
Half a Million Pounds and a Miracle, also a story in the collection, won the Neil Gunn Award in 1997.
Under the Skin, published in 2000, was shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award.
Set on the A9 road between Perth and Thurso, it was adapted for director Jonathan Glazer's film starring Johansson.
The actress described filming scenes in Glencoe in November 2011 as "brutal, cold and wet".
Glasgow was also used as a location for the movie.
