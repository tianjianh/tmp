South Wales Police said the car was later recovered in the Rumney-area after a complaint on 9 October.
"This has been forensically examined and enquiries are on-going to trace the registered owner and locate the dog," Sgt James Dowler said.
The RSPCA said it was "concerned" about the incident.
An online petition urging the authorities to pursue the case has attracted almost 7,000 signatures.
"Dog owners have a legal responsibility to help protect their pet from hazards, however, this dog was put in a potentially very hazardous and dangerous situation," an RSPCA spokesman said.
South Wales Police asked anyone with information to get in contact.
