[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who wanted to "defend the UK from an attack by Isis" stockpiled weapons, explosive substances and a guide to making bombs, a jury was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roger Smith was concerned about an attack similar to that on fusilier Lee Rigby in London in 2014, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Mr Smith, 46, is accused of having explosive substances and two copies of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.
The 46-year-old, of Summerwood Lane, Nottingham, has denied the charges.
Michelle Heeley, prosecuting, told jurors the Anarchy Cookbook contains instructions on how to create numerous bombs with the potential to kill people.
"This is not a man who has simply got an innocent interest in chemistry," she said.
"He has it in his mind that he is going to defend the country from an attack by Isis, and he has gathered his weapons, got his patriotic flags ready, and made explosives at home in order to do that."
Roger Smith denies two charges of having an explosive substance, including gunpowder, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, peroxide and acetone.
He also denies two charges of having a document or record for terrorist purposes, contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000, namely the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.
However, the prosecution told jurors there was no allegation Mr Smith was a terrorist or that he was going to personally commit a terror act.
He has not been charged with any offences in relation to the weapons, which included three bows, arrows and a flick knife.
Police first became aware of Mr Smith in June 2014 because of a dispute with his neighbours to do with hedges and garden fires, the court heard.
PCSO Matthew Holden told jurors he had several dealings with the defendant, who openly told him he had a compound bow and a set of three knives.
Mr Holden told the court: "Mr Smith explained he purchased the weapons as he believed a citizen should have the right to bear arms and should have the right to arm themselves.
"He developed it further to say he was concerned if there was a terrorist attack or Islamic attack similar to the Lee Rigby attack... he ought to be able to do something about it.
"He said words to the effect that Islam was an evil religion and Islam was at war with the West."
Mr Holden said Mr Smith also said "words to the effect that Barack Obama was probably a Muslim and referred to him as an ape".
He told the PCSO he bought the chemicals for medical purposes and experiments.
When his house was searched on 21 October 2015 he allegedly told police they were treating him "like I am a Muslim".
In interview, after being arrested, he said he made the gunpowder to entertain his nephews and nieces by lighting it in the garden.
His first copy of the Anarchy Cookbook had been downloaded off the internet, but he bought a second copy from Amazon while awaiting trial.
Ms Heeley said: "He had wanted to make the point that since you could buy it from Amazon, it must be OK to have it in this country."
However, he was charged with an extra offence for doing this.
The trial continues.
