Two-thirds of the civilian staff working for Lincolnshire Police have transferred employment to a private security company.

Lincolnshire Police Authority expects the outsourcing to save money and increase the time officers can spend on the frontline.
The 10-year contract was signed in February but took effect from the start of this financial year.
Ten other authorities have indicated an interest in similar outsourcing.
Barry Young, chairman of Lincolnshire Police Authority, said the new approach would mean the "leanest police force in Britain".
"This is not a total solution and the authority still faces significant financial challenges, but it does provide a solid foundation to secure quality and value for money policing of our communities in the future," he said.
The police authority employed 813 full-time civilian staff as of 14 February.
A total of 544 have transferred, including those working in finance, human resources, custody, the force control room and firearms licensing.
Staff which have not transferred include those working in the occupational health unit and press office.
Under the contract, one approach being trialled is the way detainees are transported into custody after being arrested, called the "street to suite" initiative.
This means a person could be arrested by a police officer but then accompanied to a custody suite by a member of G4S staff.
The police officer could then stay on the street and continue their duties.
The contract with G4S contains an option for an extension to 15 years.
The deal also includes a proposal to build a purpose-built custody suite at the force's headquarters in Nettleham, which was chosen because the force already owns the land.
Lincolnshire Police Authority said it could not say how soon the facility would be built or when a planning application would be submitted.
