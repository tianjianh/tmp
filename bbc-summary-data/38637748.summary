Paisley's Forsyth, 24, is with the Scotland squad in Spain for three Tests against Russia.
His Surbiton club-mate Grassick, 26, is currently recovering from a cruciate ligament injury.
"It's good to see the hard work of the players over the years has paid off," said Scotland coach Derek Forsyth.
"Hopefully they can push on for selection."
Forsyth's GB Men's counterpart Bobby Crutchley said he was "excited about the challenge" of preparing for the 2020 Olympics.
"We have a vibrant squad with a good blend of youth and experience and we're eager to get going.
"We're very excited about this new group. There's been significant change and we're looking forward to developing the players."
