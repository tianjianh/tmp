Tens of thousands of packs of garlic bread have been taken off shelves in Tesco stores after a trading standards probe found some were underweight.

The emergency product withdrawal involved 66,000 packs, worth Â£93,000.
The producer of the slices - Bakkavor Foods - said it had taken steps to avoid a repeat of the problem.
Aberdeenshire Council trading standards officers measured the weight of 290g packs of own-brand garlic bread slices at stores in Huntly and Inverurie.
They found that 39 were under the stated weight, with one weighing less than 230g.
Aberdeenshire Council welcomed action being taken "swiftly".
Trading standards manager Wilma Urquhart said the service "takes these incidents extremely seriously".
She said: "We were pleased to see that the supermarket acted swiftly following the discovery.
"Our work is very important in protecting both consumers and businesses from unfair competition and the service will continue to work with both Tesco and Bakkavor to ensure legislative compliance."
A Tesco spokesperson said: "We take great care to deliver clear information for our customers so they can make informed decisions on the products they buy and to ensure that customers receive the stated quantity of product.
"We are disappointed that errors occurred with a very small number of product and we have worked with our supplier to ensure there is no repeat of the issue."
A Bakkavor spokesperson said: "We confirm that a bakery product made on behalf of a customer has been recalled due to an error with product weight.
"Bakkavor takes such incidents seriously and sincerely apologises for this error. We have put in place a number of measures to prevent a similar incident arising in the future.
"We wish to reassure customers and consumers of our continued commitment to compliance and the highest standards of production."
