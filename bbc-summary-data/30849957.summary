LGBT school: Could it stop the bullying?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's first school for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people could open in Manchester in a few years.

It would offer students who face homophobic bullying in mainstream education a safe place to learn.
Pupils would be referred to the school for full-time and part-time places.
But there are worries it could cause segregation and do nothing to promote tolerance.
Newsbeat's been finding out what people think:
Leon Ward is a 23-year-old gay man who works with the young people's sexual health charity, Brook.
Leon didn't come out at school because he was bullied, but it doesn't make him agree with opening an LGBT school.
"Segregation doesn't work when you're talking about creating equality," he says.
"You have to deal with the core issues of bullying rather than forcing the victims to move.
"Isn't there something more powerful about championing equality?
"The money would be better spent on education in mainstream schools.
"There should also be a more wholesome approach to sex education with teachers openly talking about gay, straight and bisexual sex," he says.
"You know what kids are like: 'We wanna beat up some gays so let's go to that gay school and beat them up.'"
Amelia Lee is from the youth charity behind the idea, LGBT Youth North West.
Amelia will be consulting young people, teachers and specialists about the need for a school based at an LGBT centre in Manchester.
"A lot of LGBT young people tell us they experience active hostility from other pupils," she says.
"But they also suffer self hatred - they're made to feel like freaks.
"They need specialist personal development support," explains Amelia Lee.
"For example, for a trans child it can be really hard to work out how or when to come out and to who.
"It would be for all pupils regardless of whether they're LGBT or not," she continues.
"All are welcome, we're not going to ask pupils to prove their sexuality."
James is an 18-year-old gay man who's been visiting the LGBT centre in Manchester for five years.
James was bullied at school when he came out in Year 7.
"I told everyone I don't care who knows," he says.
"But that was a big mistake. Once they took my bags and books and wrote 'Die in hell' on there.
"My mental health suffered, I tried to kill myself.
"Schools are failing LGBT kids and we need a solution," he goes on.
"In an ideal world we wouldn't build a separate school, but it's naive to think that mainstream schools are going to take steps to tackle homophobia."
He says a school like this would have changed his life: "I would not have been so depressed and desperate."
"It's not so much segregation as training these young people to integrate."
Hannah Kibirige is from the the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity, Stonewall.
Hannah's sympathetic to the aims of setting up an LGBT school, but thinks there are better ways to make sure all students have a positive experience.
"The best way to make sure that happens is to train teachers to make sure they're skilled up to deal with homophobic bullying," she says.
"Some recent research we did shows that 9 out of 10 teachers feel they have a duty to tackle it, but most haven't been trained."
She explains: "We know that homophobic bullying is endemic, but we want every young person to be able to access support and that's about making all of our schools inclusive."
"Our approach remains that the only way to ensure no-one experiences bullying is to make sure all teachers can deal with it."
Councillor Sheila Newman is an executive member of Children's Services at Manchester City Council.
The council told Newsbeat it supports LGBT Youth NW in their bid for funding to expand their premises and develop the good work they already do across the city to support LGBT young people.
"We fully support initiatives to support LGBT young people and to tackle homophobia in schools and wider society," she says.
"We don't support however - and haven't supported - the setting up of a separate school for LGBT young people.
"Schools should be inclusive supportive places for all pupils regardless of their sexuality."
