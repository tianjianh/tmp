Kathleen Connochie, now a 76-year-old great grandmother, was 16 when she took part in 1955.
Her trainer was Fort William butcher Duncan MacIntyre, who was a former race winner and veteran sportsman who lost an eye playing shinty.
Prizes handed out at the Ben Nevis Race include one dedicated to her.
Connochie Silver Plaques are presented to athletes who complete 21 of the races.
Hundreds of athletes were expected to take part in this year's event.
