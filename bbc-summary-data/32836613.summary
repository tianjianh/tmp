Middlesbrough Council improves school support says Ofsted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council criticised for being ineffective at supporting schools is improving, Ofsted inspectors have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In January 2014 Ofsted said Middlesbrough Council did not know its schools well enough and was offering weak leadership.
But in its latest report the body said the council has made "significant improvements".
Ofsted said work is still needed to reduce the education gap between richer students and poorer ones.
Middlesbrough primary school pupils are doing better than before while in the city's secondary schools the pace of improvement is picking up, although there is still room for progress, particularly in maths.
The number of young people who are not in education, employment or training has fallen significantly and is now in line with the England average.
Nick Hudson, Ofsted director for North East, Yorkshire and Humber, said: "More than a year ago Ofsted found that school improvement support in Middlesbrough was ineffective. I am really pleased that things have got much better since then.
"Pupils are on the whole doing better at primary school while improvement rates in the city's secondary schools are greater than the national average, for poorer pupils as well as their wealthier peers.
"That is what parents and pupils want and deserve."
Jan Brunton, Middlesbrough Council's executive member for education and skills, said: "Good schools are fundamental in ensuring children have the best start in life, and we are fully committed to providing constructive support and intervention."
