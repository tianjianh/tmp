The Scot beat Raonic in straight sets to repeat his triumph of 2013 and claim a third Grand Slam title.
Murray is the first British man to win more than one Wimbledon singles title since Fred Perry in 1935.
"I'm proud to have my hands on the trophy again," said Murray.
Murray finally ended Britain's 77-year wait for a male Wimbledon champion in 2013 - and the chance to see him repeat the achievement attracted huge attention.
Fans queued overnight just to grab a spot on Henman Hil to watch the match on a big screen, while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those watching from the Royal Box on Centre Court.
"This is the most important tournament for me every year," added an emotional Murray.
"I've had some great moments here, but also some tough losses. The win feels extra special because of the tough losses."
