Homeowners have transformed their front windows into works of art for a new Window Wanderland trail.

Artist Lucy Reeves came up with the idea after she admitted she enjoyed looking into houses where curtains are open.
The trail idea took off quickly, starting among a few friends and growing to more than 160 houses and shops in the Bishopston area of north Bristol.
Themed displays include a beach with a Dalek, a disco with lasers in the street, a Lego winter scene and hand-made puppets.
Mrs Reeves, a "self-confessed nosy parker", said the trail was aimed at helping "see your neighbours in a new light".
The project has been funded through the Green Capital funds - part of Bristol's year as European Green Capital.
Keith and Carol Walker turned their garden into a beach, welcoming people to pose for a photo in their swimsuits.
Despite the freezing weather, some people did strip off to raise money for the Children's Hospice Southwest.
On Cornwall Road, a disco spilled out into the street, with people dancing and children trying to stand on lasers projected out of the house.
Andrew Spooner came up with the idea for an interactive moonface after reading Enid Blyton's Enchanted Wood stories with his daughter Amelia, 9.
"I wanted it to be playful and magical," he said.
