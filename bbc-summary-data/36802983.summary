The 19-year-old is travelling to the Potteries to finalise his move from Cairo club Al Ahly and will become Stoke's first signing of the summer.
"He's regarded as a special talent in Egypt," Scholes told BBC Radio Stoke.
"To be a regular in the national side for 12 months at just 19 shows the quality of the player."
Sobhi has scored 11 goals in his 55-game career so far and although he will be coming to England as a player with a lot of potential, Scholes warned against putting too much pressure on him.
"He's got undoubted skills but we have to remember his age and he's coming from a different country and a different culture," he said.
"He has got to have time to settle but he's one for the future and one we're excited about.
"Hopefully over the next 24 to 48 hours he'll complete a medical and we'll tie-up all the last bits of the deal as well, but it's all 99 per cent agreed."
