[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 0-2 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David McGoldrick scored both goals as a much-changed Ipswich side reached the second round of the EFL Cup at the expense of League Two side Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker slipped the ball past Marek Stech for the opener from Bersant Celina's through ball.
Elliot Lee went close to an equaliser with a curling effort and Luton continued to press after the break.
But McGoldrick remained a threat and forced Stech into a fine save before rolling home his second late on.
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy made seven changes for the game, four of them enforced because of injuries to Jordan Spence, Grant Ward, Tommy Smith and Joe Garner.
They gave new signing Martyn Waghorn his debut as a substitute in the second half and he was just wide with a good effort before McGoldrick made the tie safe.
