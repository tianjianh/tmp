Have laws to stop laser attacks on planes been delayed?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A big decision on whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick has already been delayed due to fall out from the EU referendum and a change in prime minister.

But it looks like other less high profile legislation has also been put back.
According to the pilots union BALPA, tougher laws to stop laser attacks on planes has been put back "two Parliamentary sessions" - i.e. some months.
The union wants restrictions on high powered lasers as well as more powers for police to stop and search people suspected of carrying lasers.
The government has said it never outlined a timetable but was "looking to make changes as soon as possible".
"Safety is our top priority", a spokesperson for the Department for Transport said.
It comes as one South West Trains driver told us what it's like to be hit in the eyes with a laser.
Steve Upton said it was like looking directly into the sun and it was completely disorientating.
So far there have been 151 recorded laser attacks on train drivers over three years.
That's considerably lower than the number of aircraft being hit every year by lasers. In 2015, there were 1,439 incidents with 121 at Heathrow.
BALPA says urgent action is needed "to avoid a serious crash."
