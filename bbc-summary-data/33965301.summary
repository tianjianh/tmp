A man who raped a 14-year-old girl after getting her "blind drunk" has been jailed for eight years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Barrett, 46, from Elstree, initially said the teenager, from Bushey, had consented to sex at a film location in a Buckinghamshire field.
He later pleaded guilty to two counts of rape. St Albans Crown Court heard he "took advantage of her sexually" after plying the girl with alcohol.
Barrett was caught after his victim's mother read her diary.
She had written: "Richard. I hate you. You have ruined my life."
The court heard Barrett, of Jubilee Walk, told the girl it would be their "little secret" after he raped her in a caravan at the film set where he worked as a security guard.
He groomed the girl by giving her wine and vodka, asking her about her sex life and showing her pornography on his mobile phone.
Judge Jonathan Carroll said Barrett had got his victim "blind drunk".
He said she had been vulnerable and Barrett had shown "sinister signs of grooming".
Barrett was placed on the sex offender register for life.
