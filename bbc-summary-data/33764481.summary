They unexpectedly released the first single from their forthcoming album on Friday, entitled Drag Me Down.
It has had more than double the combined sales of its closest competitor, Little Mix's Black Magic, the Official Charts Company said.
The track has also been clocking an average of 3.11 million daily plays on the Spotify streaming service.
Industry experts at Music Business Worldwide say Drag Me Down is currently earning around $21,700 (Â£13,903) a day which, according to Spotify's own rough estimate of $0.007 per play, means the track should bring home around $152,000 (Â£97,464) in its opening week.
It is the band's first single as a foursome and was released just two days after former member Zayn Malik announced a new record deal as a solo artist.
Cilla Black's Anyone Who Had A Heart has re-entered the midweek chart at number 91, following her death on Sunday.
It was the singer and TV personality's breakthrough track and is expected to climb the chart throughout the week.
The Maccabees are currently leading Lianne La Havas by just over 300 copies in the battle for the number one album spot.
