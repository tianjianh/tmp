Owners urged to get dogs microchipped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dog owners in Scotland are being urged to get their animals microchipped in the new year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new law comes into force in April which makes is compulsory for all dogs to be tagged.
It is hoped this will help to trace lost or stolen dogs and hold irresponsible owners to account.
Microchipping dogs is a quick procedure which involves putting a tiny device between the animal's shoulders.
It can then be easily scanned to show up basic information about the dog, such as who its owner is.
Microchipping will be offered for free at many vets across the country and some animal charities such as the Dogs Trust rehoming centres in Glasgow and West Calder.
About two-thirds of dogs in Scotland have already been microchipped voluntarily.
Owners who do not comply by April could face a fine of up to Â£500.
A public consultation in 2014 showed that more than 83% of those who took part favoured making microchipping compulsory.
The new law is set to be introduced in England and Wales at the same time.
