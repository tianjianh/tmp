Plunging temperatures in Moscow failed to dent the enthusiasm of hundreds of cyclists who took to the streets in a mass event.

The organisers ignored warnings to cancel and say some 500 took part in the ride, aimed at promoting cycling.
The participants, some dressed as Santa Claus or the Russian equivalent, braved temperatures of minus 27C.
"Not one of the participants... ended up going to the doctors after it finished," organisers said.
Dubbed Let's Bike It, the course took riders 15km (nine miles) along the banks of the frozen Moscow river with the Kremlin as backdrop.
This man was putting on a spurt on to make it to the start in time.
But some riders could not do it without support from their loved-ones, including this lady with her well insulated pet.
