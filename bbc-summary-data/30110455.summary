She's arguably been the most entertaining personality to watch on this year's I'm a Celebrity.... Get Me Out Of Here.

But ITV has confirmed that Gemma Collins has quit the show, becoming the first contestant to leave.
After struggling with jungle life, the TOWIE star told producers she wanted to leave permanently.
A spokesperson for ITV said: "We're sorry to see Gemma go but respect her decision and wish her well."
No official reason has been given for the exit but anyone who has been watching her on it will know she's struggled with camp life.
She diagnosed herself with malaria (she didn't have it... unsurprisingly) and claimed to have the "worst diarrhoea ever".
There's also been a big reaction to the online trolling she's received following her appearance on the show with claims she was being 'fat shamed'.
Only last week Gemma Collins spoke about being trolled and even abused on the street: "[I get] 'Oh my God, you're so fat - die'. It's really distressing."
"Like, if I'm in my car, people will shout or bash on the window. Things like, 'Oh look, it's that fat cow', it really hurts."
She breaks down in the interview with Heatworld.com where she talks about looking after her mum who's "very ill with arthritis".
Talking through tears she added: "So when you go from doing that to people shouting at you in the car, it's just ridiculous and it just makes you not want to do this anymore."
She says her friends can't believe it happens and that "it's not going to stop until I lose weight".
