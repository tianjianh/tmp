New debris has been found at the scene of a crash on the M9 near Stirling last July, in which two people died.

Officers did not attend the scene until three days after the incident was reported to them.
The Scottish Sun reported the material was found when family members visited the scene to lay flowers on the first anniversary,
Police Scotland said they were investigating whether or not the debris was linked to the collision.
John Yuill died at the scene, and his partner Lamara Bell died in hospital after she was found by emergency services.
That prompted a review of how 999 calls were handled and a report into whether any further action - such as criminal proceedings or a fatal accident inquiry - was necessary.
The Lord Advocate is currently considering the findings.
The newspaper has reported that Lamara Bell's family found wreckage, including part of a car bumper and plastic bodywork, which appeared to match the colour of the couple's blue Renault Clio.
Police Scotland have confirmed they were alerted on Friday, and have now recovered the material.
Forth Valley Commander Ch Supt Stephen McAllister said: "I would wish to reassure the families and the wider public that following the incident, specialist officers conducted an extensive search of the crash site.
"This resulted in the recovery of the vehicle and items found nearby which were examined during the investigation into the crash.
"We have made direct contact with the Bell family and have recovered the debris to establish its source."
