"I'm not trying to cause any problems, I'm not trying to create any trouble, I want to help the club," he said.
Boycott is unhappy at the club's level of debt, reported to be above £20m.
The Test Mast Special summariser added: "If you carry on with the debt as it is, there won't be a club in existence as it's a recipe for bankruptcy."
Yorkshire announced a profit for 2015 - their first since 2009 - of £368,000 after tax, but Boycott is not convinced the county is on safe ground yet.

"The debt's gone from £5m in 2002 to £24m in 12 years, so the businessmen on the board haven't done a very good job have they?" the cricket pundit and former England opener told BBC Look North.
Denison has asked board members not to back Boycott's return on the grounds that he wants stability at the club.
He also says the board needs "individuals with skills that can guarantee the survival of the club".
But Boycott is eager to play his part.
"I love Yorkshire cricket, it's in my blood," he said. "I'm not going to turn away if the members don't vote for me, but I hope they will.
"If we don't have a better business plan, there won't be a club for members."
Boycott said Denison had written to him explaining that there were four vacancies on the board.
According to Boycott, Sir Gary Verity will fill one of the spots, with the re-election of vice-chairman Robin Smith and chief executive Mark Arthur accounting for another two.
That would leave one place, which Boycott, who acts informally as an overseas ambassador for the club, is eager to take.
Boycott is a popular figure at Yorkshire.
He received 91.09% of the vote when he was voted club president in 2012, a role he held for two years.
His return to the board would need to be approved by members at their annual general meeting on 26 March.
