[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ban on estate agent boards in Bath extended for 10 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ban on estate agent boards in a city designated as a World Heritage site has received a 10-year extension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority in Bath said the move would "allow the special architectural qualities" of the city to be protected.
An inspector working for Communities and Local Government agreed that allowing boards within the conservation area would have a "harmful effect".
He said boards often clashed with stonework in "sensitive settings".
The ban, which Bath and North East Somerset Council said was designed to "protect and conserve the unique heritage of the city", has been in place for 27 years.
