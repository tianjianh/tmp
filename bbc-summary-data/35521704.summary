Paris St-Germain can become the first team to go through a Ligue 1 season unbeaten, says captain Thiago Silva.

Les Parisiens are closing in on a fourth consecutive title after beating rivals Marseille 2-1 to go 24 points clear at the top.
Laurent Blanc's side, who have not lost in 34 Ligue 1 games, are 13 matches away from an unbeaten league campaign.
"I think if we continue like this, we can go through the entire season without loss," Silva said.
"That's not an objective, but if we can do it, it will be magnificent.
"I don't know if we deserved to beat Marseille, but we won again. We're very happy. We need to continue like this, with desire and humility, to finish off this great season."
PSG are chasing a second consecutive clean sweep of domestic trophies. They won the season-opening Trophee des Champions and are in the League Cup final against Lille.
They host Lyon on Wednesday in the French Cup last 16 - and face Chelsea in the same stage of the Champions League next week.
