It was found by a member of the public, who saw it near the water bank at Redcliff Bay in Portishead on Monday evening.
Avon and Somerset Police said it was "not unusual for discoveries of this kind to be made near coastal areas".
The skull "cannot be aged visually", and tests would be carried out to see if further action was needed, it added.

Local historian, Sandy Tebbutt, said speculation the skull could belong to Cdr Eric Robinson, who crashed a plane in Redcliff Bay in 1938, was likely to be wrong as the bodies of he and his co-pilot were recovered from the crash site at the time.
She added it was "more likely" the skull had belonged to a sailor, as the bodies of mariners had washed up in the area over the years.
