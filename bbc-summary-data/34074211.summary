[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neymar lookalike Barry Cotter signs for Limerick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On first glance it looks like Limerick have pulled off the transfer of the century and signed Barcelona striker Neymar.

But on closer inspection, it turns out the Barcelona striker has not swapped La Liga for the League of Ireland.
It is in fact 16-year-old Barry Cotter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the Brazil World Cup star.
While Neymar will line-up in the Champions League, former Avenue United and Ennis Town forward Cotter will play in the under-17 National League after signing for Limerick.
But he shares his doppelganger's confidence telling the club website: "I'm looking to score at least one or two goals in each game for the rest of the season."
