[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man acquitted of Edinburgh cemetery rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been acquitted of raping a woman in an Edinburgh cemetery after she laid flowers at the grave of a relative.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Lowe was alleged to have sexually assaulted and raped the 20-year-old at the Eastern Cemetery at Drum Terrace, in September last year.
But Lowe, 24, a prisoner, had denied rape and claimed that sex was consensual.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the charge not proven.
Mr Lowe told his trial he had felt "physically sick" when the woman said he had pushed her down when she was at the grave.
He told his defence counsel Derick Nelson that the woman was "fine" after they had sex.
A resident who lived close to the cemetery said that he had heard a woman screaming or crying.
A taxi driver who had dropped off a fare saw her running towards him "in a state of shock" with ripped clothing.
"She was on her phone, she was shouting at me if I could help her. She explained she was on the phone to the police," he told the court.
