Model gives ancient Iceman Oetzi new face

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oetzi the Iceman has reappeared looking fighting fit - as a new model on show in the Italian Alps, where he died from an arrow wound some 5,300 years ago.

In 1991 a German couple found Oetzi's mummified corpse embedded in a glacier, in a high mountain pass.
Using 3D images of the corpse and forensic technology two Dutch experts - Alfons and Adrie Kennis - created a new Oetzi model. They gave him brown eyes.
The model is on show at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano.
The museum is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Iceman discovery - a find which became an international sensation.
Oetzi was found still wearing goatskin leggings and a grass cape, and his copper-headed axe and a quiver full of arrows were lying nearby.
He was named after the Oetz Valley, on the Italy-Austria border, where he was found.
Researchers say Oetzi was about 159cm tall (5ft, 2.5in), 46 years old, arthritic and infested with whipworm.
