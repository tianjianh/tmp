The Icelandics' 1-0 win at Mourneview Park on Friday leaves them unbeaten after seven games however.
They move into first position in the group, ahead of Macedonia on goal difference, and in a good position to qualify for the finals in Poland.
Northern Ireland are away to Macedonia in their next game on Tuesday.
Twelve months on from registering their previous point in the group against the same opposition thanks to Ryan Johnston's goal in Reykjavik, Jim Magilton's side had chances to record their first victory of the campaign.
Everton teenager Shayne Lavery, one of several new call-ups to the squad, came close with two first-half attempts and substitute Louis Rooney, another of the new additions, saw an attempt hacked away having beaten goalkeeper Runar Runarsson.
Northern Ireland's own stopper Conor Mitchell had made a terrific double save in the first half but he was eventually beaten near the death by Aegisson.
Northern Ireland remain bottom of Group C with just that solitary point, having drawn one and lost six of their seven games ahead of next week's trip to Skopje.
