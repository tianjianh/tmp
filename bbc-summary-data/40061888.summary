But since then she has built up a reputation as a controversial broadcaster and writer.
LBC announced she will be leaving the station with immediate effect, just over a year after she joined to host a weekly show.
Here are some of her most controversial moments from recent years.
Earlier this week, Hopkins caused anger with when she tweeted that there must be a "final solution" in dealing with terrorists following the Manchester terror attack.
She later changed the term "final solution" to "true solution", describing the earlier version as a "mis-type".
But some Twitter users drew the comments to the attention of the Metropolitan Police, claiming they could incite racial or religious hatred.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed the matter was being "reviewed and assessed by specialist officers".
Earlier this year, food writer Jack Monroe won Â£24,000 in damages, plus Â£107,000 in legal costs, in a libel action against Hopkins after a row over two tweets, which Monroe said caused "serious harm" to her reputation.
Hopkins was later told she could not appeal against the ruling.
In December, she apologised to a Muslim family she accused of being extremists after they were refused entry to the US for a Disneyland trip.
Mail Online, which published her claim, also paid Â£150,000 in libel damages to the Mahmood family.
During his election campaign, US President Donald Trump tweeted UK politicians should take notice of Hopkins and her views.
In December 2015 he called for a halt to Muslims entering the US.
In response to Mr Trump's comments, Hopkins wrote in her newspaper column that he should not be demonised.
"Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins of the Daily Mail for her powerful writing on the UK's Muslim problems," Trump later said.
In a 2014 TV documentary, Katie raised more eyebrows when she said fat people were lazy. She added that she would not employ fat people because they look lazy.
She illustrated her point by managing to gain and then lose three stone in weight.
In November 2015, students from Brunel University walked out of a debate where Hopkins was invited as a guest.
Objections were raised to her attendance while during the debate about the future of welfare, students turned their backs to her and later walked out.
In 2013 she caused upset when she said she would not let her children play with lower class children with names like Chardonnay and Tyler.
She made the remarks during an appearance on ITV's This Morning programme.
She admitted that she judges children by their names.
But when she said she did not like children with geographical location names, it was pointed out that one of her children was called India.
