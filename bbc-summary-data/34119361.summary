Broadcaster John Humphrys returned to Cardiff where he was a baby at the end of World War Two.
He also interviewed the woman who became Britain's youngest air raid warden in Swansea, Elaine Kidwell.
She was officially too young to serve at the time, but witnessed the devastating raids first hand.
Around 100 German planes headed directly for south Wales from French airfields on 2 January, 1941.
The most concentrated bombing happened in Swansea over three days in February, which saw 40 acres of the centre destroyed.
Ms Kidwell, who was 17 at the time, said she "still shudders" when recalling the scenes unfold on Swansea's Wind Street.
Pembroke Dock was targeted and bombers hit oil tanks which started a three-week blaze - the largest in Britain since the Great Fire of London. Bangor received hits along with Llandudno and Holyhead.
Radio Four's Today programme presenter Humphrys said he still remembers playing in bomb sites near his Cardiff home after the war, and said as a baby he was carried in a cardboard box to the cellar of a neighbouring chemist shop when air raid sirens rang out.
Blitz Wales will be shown on BBC One Wales on Wednesday at 21:00 BST.
