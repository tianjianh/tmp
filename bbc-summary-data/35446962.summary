Lucas failed to complete the first of the 10-race series but recovered to win seven of the next nine.
The 40-year-old is the only confirmed member of the British Paralympic team for the Rio Games.
"It's been a really good regatta and great to start 2016 off with a win," she said.
"We have had some great winds and some good conditions in different directions which has made it a good regatta."
The Sonar crew of John Robertson, Hannah Stodel and Stephen Thomas missed out on a medal by finishing fourth.
The trio were second behind Canada going into the final day but three fifth places ended their medal hopes.
