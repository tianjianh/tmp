Mr Satyarthi told the BBC that his Nobel certificate was also missing after the burglary on Tuesday morning.
He said no-one was home at the time of the burglary.
Mr Satyarthi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his work to combat child labour and child trafficking in India.
He shared the award with Pakistani child education activist Malala Yousafzai for her work on female education.

Mr Satyarthi has long campaigned against child labour and rescued children from servitude.
His efforts have seen tens of thousands of children rescued from hazardous industries and rehabilitated.
