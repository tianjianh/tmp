Birmingham man, 80, to run 100th marathon in London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 80-year-old runner is taking part in his 100th marathon in London on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dale Lyons is one of just 11 surviving athletes to have run the London Marathon each year since it began in 1981.
He has raised Â£50,000 for charity throughout his years of pounding the pavements.
Mr Lyons, from Edgbaston in Birmingham, said: "I never imagined in a million years I'd still be at it 37 years later."
Sunday's 26.2 miles (42.1km) will also be Mr Lyons' last marathon.
"The ankle I don't think is up to six or seven hours and my daughters have put a three-line whip on me. I've got to listen to the family as well as my body," he said.

Mr Lyons, who says "clean living" is the secret of his success, is running to support the deaf and blind charity Sense, which is set to open its new headquarters in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
To keep motivated Mr Lyons said he just keeps "thinking about the end, if you can distance yourself from the pain, the crowds will keep you going, it's wall-to-wall spectators."
