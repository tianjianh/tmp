[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee McFadyen, 29, went missing on Thursday during "unescorted suspension of detention in the community".
He was last seen on Crookston Road near the hospital. Police believe he may be at Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender venues in Edinburgh.
The force said it was "becoming increasingly concerned" for Mr McFadyen's welfare.
He was described as being 5ft 10in tall, of medium build with a fair complexion, brown eyes and dark brown/black hair.
He was last wearing a black parka jacket with a burgundy scarf, a navy T-shirt, blue denim jeans, a royal blue Nike sweater and royal blue Adidas trainers.
Sgt Ross Jackson, of Police Scotland, said: "Despite our extensive inquiries, we have been so far unable to trace Lee and we are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare.
"It is possible that Lee has travelled to Edinburgh and maybe frequenting some licensed premises, including Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender venues.
"I'd ask anyone who recognises him from the photograph or has seen someone matching his description to contact us as soon as possible."
Sgt Jackson added: "I would urge anyone with any information regarding Lee's whereabouts to contact Police Scotland."
