Chat: Do you mind your parents sharing school uniform pictures?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The holidays are almost over and many of you will be going back to school.

Some of you might be starting at a new school for the first time.
One thing that many parents might do - especially if you're starting at a new school - is snap a picture of you in your uniform to post on their social media.
Do your parents do this? What do you think about it?
We want to hear from you!

I don't mind my parents taking photos of me in my school uniform because I can see what I looked like when I was younger to now and make memories.

My mum takes a picture takes a picture of me every year and my siblings and I hate it so much and she sends it to all of my Aunts and uncles.

I think that it is ok, if your parents account is on private as it showing they are prideful and proud of you!

My mum took loads of photos when I started year seven but she never shared any of them online. We kept them to ourselves and only shared them with people we speak to everyday that we know and trust.

Comment: I don't really mind. my mum put it on social media but only our family and friends could see the photo which meant that nobody we didn't know was seeing it.
