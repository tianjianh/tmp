Drug laws: The government can't hide from the evidence

"She would have been 17 today. It's extraordinary to think that."

Anne-Marie Cockburn's daughter Martha passed away after taking half a gram of 91% pure MDMA three months before her 16th birthday.
She's told Newsbeat that steps need to be taken to make sure the same thing doesn't happen to other people and that free, widespread drug testing at clubs would be "a good starting point".
"It's called harm reduction and safeguarding," she says.
"It's a bit like giving needles to a heroin addict, you're not judging their decision but you're trying to keep them as safe as you can."
Her comments come on the same day as a debate in parliament over whether current drug laws work.
Green MP Caroline Lucas is urging the government to review "failing" drugs laws.
Under current regulations, offenders can be jailed for up to seven years for possessing Class A drugs, and can be jailed for life.
Prime Minister David Cameron says he does not "believe in" decriminalising drugs.
"These laws have been around for years," added Anne-Marie. "Are they appropriate for modern society? Do we need to look at them and see if there's new best practices, new evidence that could be used instead?
"You can't hide from that evidence for much longer.
"I thinks it's incredibly appropriate on Martha's birthday. It reminds us of what has happened.
"It's a bit like Remembrance Sunday for me. I live in fear every day because until something changes there will be the risk of another loss like Martha.
"Everyone who knew her just loved her. She was a brilliant person to spend time with. She had a very full life, unfortunately it was shorter than we would have wanted."
Although she acknowledges that it's difficult to get into the mindset of a teenager, she says there are certain things that could help.
"Some people will go for the most dangerous route and some people won't," she says. "That is life.
"I would rather go for something that had a label on the bottle than a blank label. I feel that approach would help people make more informed decisions.
"She was researching online how to do it safely. She didn't want to die but she had an accidental overdose because she really wasn't getting good information online.
"Had she been able to test what she was about to take, she would have taken an awful lot less."
