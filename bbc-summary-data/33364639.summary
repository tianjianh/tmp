Jordon Begley: Taser death inquest jury retires

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest jury has retired to consider whether a Taser fired by police contributed to an unarmed man's death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordon Begley, 23, died in hospital after being Tasered at his home during a row with neighbours on 10 July 2013.
The jury at Manchester Civil Justice Centre will have to decide whether the use of the Taser and him then being restrained were factors in his death.
Up to 11 officers went to Mr Begley's house in Gorton after his mother called 999 to report he he had a knife.
Dorothy Begley, 47, said she feared her son may get into a fight.
The jury was told Mr Begley, who worked in an ice-cream factory, had thrown the knife down and was unarmed when he was shot in his dining room from a distance of 70cm (27in).
PC Terence Donnelly, who pulled the trigger, PC Dave Graham, PC Christopher Mills, PC Peter Fox and PC Andrew Wright - all officers serving with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) - have all given evidence.
Coroner Nigel Meadows told the jury "it has been a long case with a lot of evidence" which had been "different and inconsistent".
Mr Begley, who was a heavy drinker and used cocaine, was hit with the Taser and then, as he resisted arrest, was dealt two distraction strikes as officers struggled to cuff him.
Mrs Begley said she had seen the "fear in his face" moments before being hit, adding that her son's arms were by his side.
The jury heard PC Donnelly opened fire because he was worried Mr Begley might have a concealed knife on him and the suspect took "one step too far" towards him.
The officer told the hearing he pulled the trigger after Mr Begley put his hands into the pockets of his jogging pants.
Despite orders to stand back, he said, Mr Begley walked towards him in a "fighting stance".
Seconds after being Tasered he became unresponsive with abnormal breathing and another officer noticed a "golf ball-sized" bump over his right eye and the imprint of the carpet on his face.
He died two hours later at Manchester Royal Infirmary.
Medical experts said the Taser did not or was "unlikely" to have contributed to or caused the heart attack Mr Begley suffered, but the alcohol he had consumed and the struggle with officers as they cuffed him may have been "contributing factors" to his cardiac arrest.
The circumstances of his death were reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission which decided it was appropriate to carry out an independent investigation.
