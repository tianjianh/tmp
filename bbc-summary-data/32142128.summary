A group of 348 Indian nationals trapped in the fighting in Yemen have been evacuated and are on their way home, India's external affairs ministry said.

They were picked up by an Indian navy ship from Aden late on Tuesday and are travelling to Djibouti from where air force planes will fly them home.
The group includes more than 100 women and 25 children, reports say.
A Saudi Arabian-led coalition has been targeting rebels in Yemen in support of President Abdabbuh Mansour Hadi.
Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted that the navy ship carrying the evacuees would reach Djibouti on Wednesday afternoon and "arrangements [are] in place to receive them there".
Reports say two more navy ships are expected to reach Yemen by Thursday to rescue other Indians, who are mainly stranded in Aden and Sanaa.
There are some 4,000 Indian workers, businessmen and nurses working in Yemen, a report says.
Yemen has suffered from political instability for years and Shia Houthi rebels control nine of the 21 provinces.
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace President Hadi's government, which they accuse of being corrupt.
