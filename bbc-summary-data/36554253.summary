Murray, seeded number one, came through 6-4 3-6 6-1 as he chases a record fifth Aegon Championships title.
Edmund, 21, put up a strong challenge before Murray took control in the final set.
The Scot will face Marin Cilic in the last four after the Croat beat American Steve Johnson 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4.
"I train with Kyle, I know how good he is," Murray told BBC Sport.
"He's a big, strong guy with a very powerful game. When he's on he's very difficult to play in practice, and I felt it today as well. I expected it to be hard."
Murray knows Edmund well after inviting the Englishman to join him in Miami for off-season training for the past three years, but this was their first competitive meeting.
Edmund had beaten eighth seed Gilles Simon in round one and began with a confident service game.

His heavy serve and forehand were in evidence, as well as some flashes of skill in the forecourt, with a sharp volley helping him recover an early break.
Murray broke again on his way to clinching the first set, a spectacular lunging volley bringing the crowd alive, but the top seed twice fell a break down in the second.
Edmund's big forehand took him 4-2 ahead - after a nasty slip at the net by Murray - and the world number 85 came through a dramatic game of three break points to level at one set all.
With grey clouds gathering, Murray stepped on the accelerator in the final set.
A brilliant running forehand in the first game and some typically sharp returning helped him to a 3-0 lead, and he closed it out from 15-40 down thanks to some good serving.
"I am pleased with the way I played and overall it's been a positive week for me," said Edmund.
"I thought I played well but Andy is so tough to beat because he makes it so difficult for you when it really matters."
Murray made his breakthrough in terms of public attention with a run to the last 16 at Queen's Club in 2005, when ranked 357th in the world, and he made a plea on Edmund's behalf.
"Kyle's the future of the game in this country," said Murray. "It's important that he's given time to develop at his own rate and not too much pressure is put on him.
"He's doing great, he's improving every year and he's got a really good team behind him.
"If he's given time and a little bit of space to keep developing and not too much pressure on the results at this stage, he can go very far."
