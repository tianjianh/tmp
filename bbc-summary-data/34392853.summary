Isle of Man TT: Kennaugh breaks Boardman's 22 year record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Isle of Man cyclist Peter Kennaugh has broken Chris Boardman's 22-year record for cycling a lap of the TT course.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kennaugh completed a lap of the 37.7 mile (60km) Mountain Course in one hour 23 minutes and 48 seconds.
It was six seconds faster than former Olympic individual pursuit gold medallist Boardman's time, set during the Isle of Man Cycling Week in 1993.
Two-time men's British road race champion Kennaugh, 26, recorded his lap during a time-trial event on Sunday.
The Onchan rider received Â£3,000 from a local sponsor for breaking the record.
He said: "Taking the record means a great deal to me being from the island, especially with it having been held for so long by one of the most prolific time trialists of his generation.
"Even now I still remember being inspired by Chris when he wore the Yellow Jersey at the Tour de France in the mid-nineties".
Conditions were almost perfect in the early section of the course although riders later reported strong headwinds on the nine-mile mountain course section from Ramsey to the Creg Ny Baa.
