Josh Matavesi's interception try set the seal on the win, but it was fly-half Biggar's control and kicking that put Ospreys in charge.
Biggar reacted positively to missing some first-half kicks to accumulate a personal match tally of 20 points.
"He was frustrated and took it upon himself to go out and give us some yards," said Ospreys captain Jones.
"You watch Dan - whether it's with Wales or the Ospreys - and when he's playing well he gets us on the front foot and that fulcrum between 9, 10 and 12 is pretty good when he's firing."
Biggar's personal contribution helped Ospreys make a winning start against the team lying second in England's Premiership.
Jones was happy with his team's win after their poor form in the early rounds of the Pro12.
Ospreys lie eighth in the table after losing five of their opening seven matches.
"People didn't expect too much from us in this first game, but it's a good start," added Jones.
"It's the home win that we needed off what we're mature enough to say is a disappointing start in the Pro12, and this was the game we needed.
"If you look at the game it probably could have gone either way and we were lucky to get a couple of decisions and get on the front foot."
Ospreys face last season's runners-up Clermont Auvergne away in the second round of matches on 22 November.
"It's massive step up," added Jones.
"We've got a quick turnaround, but hopefully we can get out there and get something.
"They've had a indifferent start but they always peak for the ERC - they've been to a couple of finals and the squad and the reputation they have got playing at home."
