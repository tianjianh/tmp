Sussex have appointed Mark Davis as their new head coach after cricket manager Mark Robinson left the club to become head coach of England women.

Robinson, 48, had been in charge of the club since 2006, winning two County Championship titles and four one-day trophies during his spell in Hove.
South Africa-born Davis, 44, spent five years playing for Sussex before joining the coaching staff in 2005.
"I'm very excited and honoured to be taking over," he said.
Robinson has previously spent time coaching England Lions and says leaving Sussex, with whom he ended his playing career, "is going to be a wrench".
He will join England women next month ahead of their tour to South Africa in early 2016.
"I'm obviously hugely excited about my new opportunity, but it goes hand in hand with a lot of sadness too," said Robinson.
"The club and the supporters will always have a special place in my heart and I wish the club stability and every success for the future."
Sussex were relegated from Division One of the County Championship last season, dropping into the second tier of first-class cricket for the first time since 2010, and the club appointed Luke Wright as their new captain last month.
Davis, who took 188 wickets and scored over 2,000 runs for Sussex between 2001 and 2005, is looking forward to "exciting challenges ahead".
"I'd like to thank Mark for everything and wish him well for his future role," he said.
"We will be working hard to continue with the values that Sussex stands for and to ensure that the county competes at the forefront of English cricket.
"We have a fantastic squad which has a good mix of youth and experience."
