The South African says he is "thrilled" with the deal which will keep him at Kingspan Stadium until 2020.
Ludik, 30, joined Ulster from French side Agen in 2014 and made a superb start to the season before suffering a fractured cheek bone against Connacht.
The full-back, who has also played on the wing and at centre this season, is expected to be out of action until the end of November.
Ludik will qualify to play for Ireland next summer.
"Myself and my family really enjoy Belfast and we feel very much at home here," he stated.
"Everything about Ulster Rugby is first class; the stadium, the training facilities, the players and coaches, the medical care and the supporters.
"Once I return to fitness, I'm looking forward to contributing to the team this season and for the following three years."
Ulster's Director of Rugby Les Kiss described the player's contract extension as "a major boost".
"He is an outstanding guy who gives 100% to the cause and adds so much value both on and off the pitch.
"His form at the start of this season has been absolutely brilliant and I'm looking forward to seeing him deliver for us over the next few years."
