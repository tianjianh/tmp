McCoy had won almost every big race in his sport but never the Grand National. In 2009 this feat was accomplished at the 15th attempt as he rode Don't Push It to victory over the famous Aintree fences.
The 18-times champion jockey has gone on to ride over 4,000 winners.
BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2015 is broadcast live from Belfast on Sunday, 20 December from 19:00 GMT on BBC One. Further coverage on BBC Sport's online platforms and Radio 5 live.
