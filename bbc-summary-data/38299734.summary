Landslip-hit Carlisle-to-Settle rail line set for March reopening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of the Settle-to-Carlisle rail line damaged by a 500,000-tonne landslip is scheduled to reopen on 31 March, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stretch at Eden Brows, between Carlisle and Armathwaite, closed in February following heavy rain and Network Rail launched a Â£23m scheme to underpin the line.
Hundreds of concrete-filled steel piles are being driven into the bedrock.
Rail replacement buses are currently running between Carlisle and Appleby.
A steel, tunnel-like structure will sit beneath the railway, 230ft (70m) above the nearby River Eden, to provide a stable base across the damaged ground.
Two rows of high-strength piles in the sloping bedrock will form a corridor on which a 100 metre-long (328ft) concrete slab will provide a base for new tracks.
The popular tourist route usually carries about 1.3m passengers each year.
Paul Barnfield, regional director at rail firm Northern, said it had been a "difficult" time for its customers.
