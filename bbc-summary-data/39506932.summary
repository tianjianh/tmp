The incident happened in Stade's 21-25 European Challenge Cup win at the Principality Stadium on Sunday.
Citing commissioner Alberto Recaldini cited Raisuqe for the stamp, which occurred in the 19th minute.
Raisuqe, 22, was shown a yellow card for the incident and was later sent off.
The Fijian-born player was suspended for 15 weeks in 2016 after being red carded for making contact with the eye area of Munster captain CJ Stander in the Challenge Cup.
Raisuqe will be available to play on Monday, 7 August but a European Professional Club Rugby statement said the suspension could be extended "subject to confirmation of Stade Francais' forthcoming playing schedule."
