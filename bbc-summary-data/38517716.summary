The 44-year-old's predecessor Bob Bradley had spoken of a list of January transfer targets that Swansea had drawn up before his departure last week.
But Clement admits he has some of his own targets in mind.
"I've had assurances from the club that the opportunity (to buy players) will be there in January," Clement said.
"Before I came there were discussions and targets, those targets are known to me now.
"I bring with me some of my own ideas and thoughts on where we need to strengthen and players I've seen and like.
"It has to be done quickly. But I'm gathering information, that started against Palace, and it's only fair to see what they (the current players) can offer."
Swansea were taken over last summer by an American consortium fronted by Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, and have hired former economics journalist Altman, of North Yard Analytics, as the club's 'Moneyball' expert.
'Moneyball' is the use of statistical analysis to buy what is undervalued and sell what is overvalued made famous by a book and subsequent movie based on the Oakland Athletics baseball franchise under general manager Billy Beane.
Clement is comfortable with the input of New York-based Altman using data to analyse the current squad and help identify transfer targets as part of the 'due diligence process'.
"I'm a believer statistical analysis should be part of the jigsaw puzzle that goes together to help recruit players and assess your own team," Clement said.
"I have experience of this, I've travelled in the United States and visited a number of sports teams that use data.
"It is my belief it should be used as part of the due diligence process in deciding who should come to the club.
"But it's just one part, because you can't take away the expertise of the scouting, calls to get information about a player's character and their professionalism.
"We we will be using data as part of the whole picture. Dan is someone hired by Steve and Jason, but he's sent me through some information. He's an intelligent man and an expert in the field."
Former Bayern Munich assistant Clement, who had also assisted Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid and Paris Saint German said he felt the Swans job was his ''biggest'' personal challenge.
"I have told the players I am absolutely up for the challenge, I am with you on this. I am excited by the challenge," he said.
"I have stayed at Bayern and had a great chance to win the league there and advance into further stages of the Champions League.
"But I have done that for the last six seven years now and I want another challenge this is going to be really exciting i can feel it already. I feel good about it."
Ancelotti backed his long time deputy to be a success.
"I think he has a lot of motivation because he wanted to come back to England to be a manager in the Premier League," he said.
"He has this opportunity and I think he has the quality and the skill to do very well.
"I hope he is going to do a great job in Swansea."
