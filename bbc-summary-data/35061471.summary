[SN]TITLE[SN]
A day in the life of an astronaut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are currently seven billion people living on Earth. Although our lives differ in countless ways - almost all of us share some common experiences.

But there are six people out of seven billion whose daily experience sets them apart. These six are floating 400km above our heads in the International Space Station. The British astronaut Tim Peake is about to become one of them and his daily routine will be both recognisably the same and also utterly different from ours.
