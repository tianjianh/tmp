A wildlife camera trap has captured the moment a red squirrel having a feed almost became food itself.
The squirrel was eating inside a tree-mounted feeding box when a pine marten appeared.
The marten did not find its potential prey and moved on.
Mike Hawkins, a volunteer with the Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels project, captured the image on a camera trap set up at Callander in the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.
"We've named it 'near miss'," said a spokesperson for the squirrel project.
"From the photos, the pine marten went away empty handed - it's good to know our feeder boxes make good hiding places for red squirrels too."
Red squirrels and pine martens are among Scotland's rarest animals.
Strongholds for both are in upland areas of Scotland such as Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and the Cairngorms.
