Hamburg have sacked boss Bruno Labbadia for the second time, after a poor start to the Bundesliga season.

Despite a spirited performance in Saturday's 1-0 defeat by champions Bayern Munich, Hamburg have lost their past four matches and have taken just one point from their first five games.
Labbadia, 50, was appointed Hamburg boss for a second time in April 2015.
He had been sacked just three days before a Europa League semi-final second-leg tie against Fulham in 2010.
"I am convinced we have to make a change in the coaching position in order to turn our disappointing season start around," said Hamburg sporting director Dietmar Beiersdorfer.
Former European champions Hamburg are the only club to have played every season in the Bundesliga since its formation in 1963.
Their next match is away to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, 1 October.
