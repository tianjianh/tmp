A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a pensioner in Northampton 22 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 39-year-old, who is from Northampton but now lives in West Yorkshire, is being held over the death of 76-year-old Arthur Brumhill.
Mr Brumhill was found with head injuries at Denton's Pet and Garden Store in Wellingborough Road on 22 January 1993.
Det Sgt Paul Hamilton said the man would be questioned in Northampton.
Mr Brumhill was found dead in the basement of the former pet and garden centre where he was a part-time worker.
Police said the previous evening an eyewitness saw what he thought was the shopkeeper and another man, who appeared to be a friend, in the shop.
The witness said the man was in his teens, about 5ft 5in (1.7m) tall and had "mousey-brown" hair.
At 08:30 GMT the next morning a shop assistant arrived to find Mr Brumhill's body with several heavy blows to the head, the force said.
Police believe Mr Brumhill had let the person in as there were no signs of a forced entry into the shop.
A tyre lever, similar to a crowbar, and a small amount of money were taken in the incident. It is believed the killer escaped through an upstairs window.
A number of arrests were made at the time, but nobody was charged.
Speaking when the murder inquiry was re-launched in 2013, Mr Brumhill's daughter Sue Blake called her father's death "brutal".
