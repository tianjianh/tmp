[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephanie Booth, 70, was driving the vehicle to cut the grass at her home in Llangar, Denbighshire, in September.
The inquest in Ruthin heard Mrs Booth was driving on the edge of a track on a steep field when the tractor tipped.
Coroner John Gittins recorded a conclusion of accidental death, caused by major crush injuries.
PC Richard Davies, a forensic collision investigator with North Wales Police, said: "It's probable that Ms Booth became unseated and the tractor rolled over her as they both descended to their point of rest."
The inquest heard Ms Booth was last seen by her husband David on 18 September when she went out to cut the grass and said she would be done within half an hour.
When she failed to return he went out looking for and found her about 4m (13ft) from her tractor, lying on the ground with the tractor upright.
Mr Gittins said Ms Booth suffered multiple injuries, including to her aorta, which meant her death would have been very quick.
No mechanical faults were found on the tractor which would have contributed to the accident and Ms Booth had no traces of drugs or alcohol in her system.
Ms Booth was born Keith Hull in in 1946 - she underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1982 and starred in the BBC's Hotel Stephanie.
She married her husband in Hawaii in 1989 and then had a ceremony in Wales in 2007.
Mr Gittins said: "I am aware this was a lady who was well known to a significant number of people and I'm sure there are very many people and the immediate family who feel her loss very deeply."
