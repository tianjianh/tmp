YOUR COMMENTS:
I think the naughtiest girl collection by Enid Blyton should be on the list.
Maggie, Newcastle, England
I would suggest the book Five Children and It by Edith Nesbit because, even though I have not read all of it, it is a great story so far. I would recommend it because it is it is exciting and there is a sand fairy that I'm sure anybody would like.
Sophie, Surrey, England
The book that would top my must-read list would be Diary of A Wimpy Kid because it is the best book ever!
Jessica, London, England
I think Hetty Feather by Jacqueline Wilson should be in the top books to read before your 12.
Samantha, Essex, England
I think girl online by Zoella should be on the list.
Alice
I think that the BFG by Roald Dahl and Boy in a Dress by David Walliams should be on the list as I love them so much and they are quite easy reads too.
Chloe, Oxfordshire, England
I think that The Guinness World Record books should be on the list because they are funny, interesting, astonishing and educational (in some of the sections).
Cerys
I think that the Geek Girl series should appear somewhere on that list as it is very funny and I know that avid readers would love it.
Hannah, South Northamptonshire, England
I think it should be Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone as it is a classic fiction book and you could never grow out of it!
Mariela, London, England
I must have the Butterfly Club by Jacquliene Wilson. It's so amazing and unique. Also Awful Auntie to give you a bit of a chill!
