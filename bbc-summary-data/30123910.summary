Ricky Gervais has revealed there will be a big "revelation" in the final episode of his Channel 4 comedy, Derek.

The award winning show returns for a one-off special in December.
Gervais, who also wrote and directed the show, told Newsbeat there'll be a "big confession" from Derek's best friend Kev.
Once he's finished filming the finale, the 53-year-old comic will then concentrate on his next project, the David Brent movie.
Speaking about the final Derek episode the actor said: "It's always been my favourite episode, the finale of The Office, Extras and this is probably my favourite episode of Derek.
"There's a scene where Kev confesses something to Derek, that's quite shocking for him."
Could a hidden romance be on the cards?
"No that's not the confession! That would...no, no, no."
Once filming is complete Gervais will return to one of his most loved roles, that of office manager David Brent.
But this time the wannabe rock star will be starring in his own movie.
"It's half written. You get to see what happened after The Office, his life and what he went through," Gervais said.
The movie will see Brent working as a sales rep, selling cleaning products, and following him as he struggles to attract an audience to a self-financed UK tour.
"He thinks this film is like [Martin] Scorsese following The [Rolling] Stones round, but he soon finds out it's a more of a 'where are they now?' So it's quite sad, funny and tragic."
The multi-award-winning actor has already brought Brent back for a series of videos on YouTube called Learn Guitar With David Brent, which led to him bringing the character back to life for a series of unlikely gigs.
But he doesn't think people are getting tired of the character.
"I think if I went back to doing Brent in The Office, that would be a bit cringey," he said.
"I've purposefully taken it away from that because things move on.
"In the day and age when everyone wants to be famous, it's not out the question that someone out there is still trying to be a rock star and thinks that someone like Simon Cowell will come along and make him in to a star for 15 minutes.
"There's no sure thing. You should never be complacent, you should never be arrogant. However big a comedy icon David Brent is, you've still got to deliver. No one is going to watch a bad movie."
The film is set to shoot next year with no release date yet announced.
