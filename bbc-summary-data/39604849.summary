[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Junior Brown headed the winner as Shrewsbury moved to the brink of League One safety with a victory over Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Hurst's side lifted themselves six points clear of fourth-bottom Port Vale, who have two games left but a goal difference 11 inferior to Shrewsbury.
Shrewsbury started brightly with an inviting cross from Joe Riley drifting just wide before Stefan Payne's low shot was turned wide by goalkeeper Christian Walton.
Will Atkinson's header was comfortably gathered by home goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler as Southend started to carry more of a threat and then Ryan Leonard's shot was deflected narrowly wide by Brown.
Nile Ranger went close twice at the start of the second half for Southend, who remain a point outside the play-off places, and then Simon Cox saw a shot pushed away by Leutwiler.
Shrewsbury, up to 18th in the table, grabbed the winner in the 64th minute when left back Brown headed in a corner from Shaun Whalley to spark jubilant scenes at the final whistle at the Greenhous Meadow.
