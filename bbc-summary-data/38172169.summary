Martin Allen: Eastleigh confirm new manager after Barnet departure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Martin Allen has joined National League side Eastleigh as manager after being granted permission to leave Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allen was released from his deal with the Bees after Eastleigh chairman Stewart Donald requested permission to speak to the 51-year-old.
His appointment follows Ronnie Moore's departure for "personal reasons" on Wednesday after three months in charge.
Allen's first match in charge will be Sunday's home FA Cup second-round tie against FC Halifax Town.
He guided Barnet back into the EFL from the National League in 2015 in his fourth spell in charge of the London club, who are eighth in League Two.
The Bees have placed development team coach Rossi Eames in caretaker charge, with academy manager Henry Newman assisting him.
Eastleigh, ninth in the National League and eight points off the play-off places, have appointed their third different manager of the season after sacking Chris Todd in August.
"The approach came out of the blue," Barnet chairman Tony Kleanthous said.
"It was quite clear that Martin had decided he wanted to take the opportunity Eastleigh were offering to him.
"He leaves with our best wishes having done a great job helping to rebuild the football club after our relegation into the National League."
