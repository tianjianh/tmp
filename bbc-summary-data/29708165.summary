Scarborough Borough Council announced Flamingo Land was the proposed bidder for the town's Futurist theatre.
If successful, the developers will demolish the sea-front theatre to build a rollercoaster, botanical gardens and cave-themed attraction on the site.
But the Scarborough Town Action Group said it was appealing against the plans.
The council decided to close the theatre late last year following a report published in June 2013, which said the site was "beyond the point" of refurbishment. The final curtain came down on the building in January this year.
Campaigners, who wanted to retain the 1920s-built Futurist as a theatre and cinema, said they were disappointed by the decision.
Flamingo Land, previously only known publicly as 'Bidder B', is a large visitor attraction in Malton, North Yorkshire.
'Flamingo Land Coast' is the working title of the proposed re-development of the Futurist site.
Cabinet Member for Strategic Planning and Regeneration, councillor Derek Bastiman, said the plans were "in their infancy" and there were still many months of negotiations to be had.
