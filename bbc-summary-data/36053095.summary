The Â£8m facility in Thornton will be opened on Wednesday, 20 April.
The new complex includes 12 grass pitches, two 4G pitches, a gym, meeting rooms and a restaurant, as well as seven changing rooms and office space.
Facilities will not just be for the Cod Army's first team and youth team, but also open to the public.
"Not only is Sir Alex a legendary manager but someone whose track record in discovering, honing and developing young home-grown talent is second to none," said Fleetwood chairman Andy Pilley.
"We really hope that now we have Premier League-standard training facilities and an academy to match, we can find and develop that raw talent which will not only be good for the future of Fleetwood Town but the players and future players themselves."
