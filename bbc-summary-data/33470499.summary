Murray and Australian John Peers beat Jonathan Erlich and Philipp Petzschner 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 to reach their first Grand Slam men's doubles final.
The 13th seeds were helped by Erlich struggling with a knee injury.
Jamie's younger brother Andy lost to Roger Federer in his singles semi-final on Friday.
Jamie Murray, who won the mixed doubles title at SW19 in 2007, has never reached this stage of the men's competition before in any Grand Slam.
With his mother Judy looking on, the 29-year-old and Peers, 26, were impressive winners.
They will play Dutchman Jean-Julien Roger and Romanian Horia Tecau in Saturday's final on Centre Court.
Murray said: "We got off to a slow start, especially me. We were helped out by Erlich struggling but we had to put it out of our minds.
"It will be a great match for Andy tomorrow, they have played so many times and I am sure tomorrow will be no different.
"People come and talk to me because they want to talk about Andy, which is fair enough. That's how it goes. I accept that."
When Murray won the mixed doubles in 2007 with Serb Jelena Jankovic, the pair split prize money of £90,000.
The Scot began playing with Peers two and a half years ago and they have won five Tour titles together.
Reaching the final at Wimbledon means they are guaranteed prize money of at least £85,000 each.
Murray said: "We are getting our rewards and we are excited to be here."
