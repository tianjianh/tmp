The couple married in the 28-year-old tennis star's hometown of Dunblane in April.
It is understood that Kim, 27, has recently had her 12-week scan, with the baby due in February.
Murray's mother Judy recently told a magazine that she was "really looking forward to being a granny".
Murray enjoyed a strong run of form after marrying his long-term girlfriend in front of family and friends at Dunblane Cathedral on 11 April.
He reached the semi-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon, and won his first titles on clay.
Speaking to Sky Sports earlier this year, he said: "It (marriage) has been nice and a lot of people have spoken about the honeymoon period.
"But we've been together a very long time and getting married was the next step."
Murray fans were quick to congratulate the couple after news of the pregnancy was reported, tweeting him their best wishes.
