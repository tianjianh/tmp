The 24-metre vessel was in a collision with the Cyprus-registered Daroja. No one was injured.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has been informed.
A coastguard statement said: "Aberdeen Coastguard requested the launch of Peterhead all-weather lifeboat and other vessels offered assistance.
