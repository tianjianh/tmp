Another 10 episodes of the big budget drama will air in 2017 or 2018, HBO programming editor Casey Bloys told the Hollywood Reporter.
"Westworld is such a big, ambitious show. I don't know if it will be fall of 2017 or into 18," he said.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Westworld is getting an average audience of 11.7 million viewers.
Westworld's ensemble cast includes Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, Thandie Newton, Luke Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins and Borgen's Sidse Babett Knudsen.
The first series is being broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK on Tuesday evenings.
Co-creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy said in a statement: "During the lengthy journey to the screen, our incredibly talented actors, staff and crew became a family, and we look forward to the privilege of continuing this experience with them.
"We're also thankful to all of our amazing partners at HBO, WBTV and Bad Robot for their steadfast support, imagination and ambition. We simply couldn't have made this show anywhere else."
Bloys would not reveal whether the stars of the current series will return for a second season.
"I don't want to speculate about cast because there's still three episodes left to air," he said.
Meanwhile, Abrams is also set to co-produce award-winning West End comedy The Play That Goes Wrong as it moves to Broadway.
The play will open at the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan in April.
