The pupils, from Charnwood College in Loughborough, Leicestershire began feeling unwell during school time on Tuesday morning.
Police said they were called to the school and arrested a 15-year-old on suspicion of supplying a Class B drug.
He has since been released on police bail pending further inquiries.
Principal of Charnwood College, Mark Sutton, said two Year 10 schoolboys who fell during class initially told staff they had "ingested a legal high".
A third student had returned home during a break after feeling unwell.
Mr Sutton said: "While we are confident that this is an isolated incident, it is one that the college is taking extremely seriously.
"All students involved are currently going through our disciplinary procedures."
He said they were now running assemblies to educate students on the effects and consequences of taking drugs and legal highs.
