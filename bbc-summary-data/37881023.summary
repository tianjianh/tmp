[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Jones' late goal helped Port Vale come from behind to beat Fleetwood Town in a match which saw both sides reduced to 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Long put the visitors ahead before late strikes from substitute Rigino Cicilia and Jones - his ninth of the season - turned the match on its head.
With just one minute of normal time remaining, Fleetwood goalscorer Long and Vale's Anthony Grant received their marching orders following a scuffle involving several players.
Having had the majority of the play, the Trawlermen will feel aggrieved not to have come away with at least a point after they took a deserved lead on 52 minutes when Long nodded in Devante Cole's back-post header.
But 15 minutes from time, a cross from the left fell kindly at the feet of Cicilia, who made no mistake firing past former Vale keeper Chris Neal.
Jones completed the turnaround in the 86th minute when he bundled the ball past Neal following good work by winger Jerome Thomas.
