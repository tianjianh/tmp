600 crayfish released after Talgarth pollution incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 600 juvenile crayfish have been released into a river in Powys after the deaths of others in a pollution incident in 2012.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 2km (1.2m) stretch of the River Ennig at Talgarth, near Brecon, was affected by the release of pesticide, killing other species.
But the crayfish deaths were a "particular concern" as the native white claw is already under threat.
The juvenile crayfish were raised at a Natural Resources Wales-run hatchery.
A further 1,000 juveniles are due to be released next year.
So far, more than 3,300 crayfish have been released in and around the River Wye, with future releases planned in selected areas in west Wales.
