[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four men from Derby, a man from Burton upon Trent and a woman from London have all been arrested on suspicion of engaging in the preparation of an act of terrorism.
Six properties in Derby, Burton upon Trent and London are all being searched as part of the investigation.
All six people are currently being held in custody.
The four suspects from Derby are aged 22, 27, 35 and 36, the suspect from Burton upon Trent is aged 27 and the woman from London is 32.
The investigation is being led by the North East Counter Terrorism Unit supported by local officers from Derbyshire, Staffordshire and the Metropolitan Police.
There is a large police presence in Leopold Street in Derby but police have not confirmed if it is part of the investigation.
Steven Allen, 32, who lives in Leopold Street, said: "I've just come out of my flat, saw a police car there, thought it a bit odd.
"I heard absolutely nothing, I literally got out my flat door, saw a police car, saw the vans.
"It's usually a very quiet street. It's just such a shock to the system."
Local officers will be patrolling the areas to speak to anyone with concerns, police said.
