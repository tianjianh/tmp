Williams, 28, left the Shots in June 2015 and had a spell at Stevenage before joining Rovers, where his five goals in eight starts helped them reach the National League play-off final.
Player boss Kevin Nicholson said: "Brett's a proven scorer at this level.
"He did well at Forest Green and did very well at Aldershot where he pretty much averaged one in two."
Williams scored 39 goals in 89 league appearances for Aldershot during two seasons with the club.
