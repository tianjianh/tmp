The complaint against the businessman was first made in October 2013, and an investigation was held, but no action was taken.
A spokesman for the Met said the force was now reassessing that inquiry after receiving new information.
Mr Al Fayed, 86, has strongly denied the allegations.
According to the Sunday Mirror, Mr Al Fayed said in a statement: "I am saddened that, after extensive investigations by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2013, the original complainant feels compelled to request the MPS to review their original decision.
"I fully co-operated with the MPS during their initial investigations after which no charges were brought against me and the file was closed.
"As I said originally, I completely deny any wrongdoing in this matter and refute the complainant's allegations."
The billionaire also formerly owned Fulham Football Club, among several other business interests.
He currently owns the Ritz hotel in Paris.
