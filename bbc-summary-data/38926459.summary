[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre is urging the Staggies to deliver another of their big-game performances against Aberdeen in Saturday's cup tie.

County host the Dons in one of three all-Premiership Scottish Cup fifth-round fixtures.
"Our best performances this season have been against the bigger sides," McIntyre told BBC Scotland.
"We know we're going to have to have a good performance again in order to get into the next round."
McIntyre's men beat Aberdeen when they visited Victoria Park in the league in December and also defeated them in Dingwall last season.
"Aberdeen are playing well at the moment," said McIntyre of the side sitting second in the Premiership. "They've got real pace in their team. They're a real threat at set-plays also.
"We know we need to bring the type of performance that we've had against them here in Dingwall over the last year or so. It's going to take something similar again.
"Their front four are very potent and they've got lots of goals in them and generally most of their goals come from that.
"You need to try and nullify that major threat that they have in that front four positions."
County drew 1-1 with Rangers at Ibrox in last weekend's Premiership match, having led 1-0 at the break.
And McIntyre's assistant Billy Dodds told Radio Scotland's Sportsound: "The Rangers game on Saturday, it's the best first 45 minutes we've played at any big ground, whether it's Aberdeen, Celtic, Rangers.
"We really deserved to probably be a couple in front but it wasn't to be.
"We've been a bit inconsistent in the league this year. We look a right good team sometimes.
"It's not the ideal draw [against Aberdeen] but it's a great game to take part in. It's such a tricky tie, it'd be hard to call.
"I would like to get through the tie at first time of asking. A trip to Pittodrie [in a replay], you would make Aberdeen probably heavy favourites.
"Our best chance is to go and do it first time. We'll be going all out to do that. Scottish Cup has a special feeling about it."
