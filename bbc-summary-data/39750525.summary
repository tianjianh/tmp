Community council in Powys to fold after 'detrimental' row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community council in mid Wales will fold after all of its councillors refused to stand for re-election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trefeglwys Community Council will cease to function after the polls close on 4 May with its responsibilities taken over by Powys Council.
It comes after a three-year dispute initially sparked by plans to build pylons in the area.
Councillors said the row was having "a detrimental effect" on their ability to serve the community.
Powys Council said temporary councillors may be appointed as an interim measure. A meeting about its future will be held on 18 May, after the elections.
The dispute, between a former clerk and the community council, sparked investigations by the Information Commissioner, local councils organisation One Voice Wales and the police.
A letter sent to Powys Council on Wednesday, on behalf of Trefeglwys Community Council, said two clerks had resigned and the ongoing dispute was causing "disruption and distress".
"The councillors feel that they are not in a position to best serve the community whilst having to deal with this matter as it is continuing to cause distress and has been extremely time consuming and disruptive to the smooth running of the community council," it reads.
"Bearing in mind that this is a small community, this ongoing issue is having a detrimental effect on the councillors and clerks personal and business dealings and has cost the community money due to the use of solicitors and extra hours paid to clerks etc.
"It is not fair on the community to continue spending its money on resolving this matter which the council feels has become vindictive in nature."
