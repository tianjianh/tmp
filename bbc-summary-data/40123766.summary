The 22-year-old German was hurt in a crash with Jenson Button in Monaco on Sunday, his car ending up on its side against the barriers with Wehrlein trapped inside.
He injured his back but has now had medical tests and is allowed to race.
"Checks all done, see you in Montreal," he tweeted.
"Great news! Medical checks done - ready for the #Canadian GP," added his team.
Button, the 2009 world champion, was making a one-off return to Formula 1 as a replacement for Fernando Alonso, who was taking part in the Indianapolis 500 race in the United States.
