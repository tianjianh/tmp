In the BBC Sport app and website, you can now create a My Sport page, this page becomes your one-stop shop with news, live coverage and stats tailored to your interests.
The key benefits of My Sport are:
As an example, choosing from more than 300 available topics, you might opt to follow Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Premier League football, the England cricket team, Formula 1 and tennis articles.
By adding these topics to a My Sport page, all the latest news, live coverage and reports for these sports and teams would be available in one place, as will football scores. This builds on the existing push alerts offering, with alerts available for football, cricket, rugby union and league and Formula 1.
What is My Sport?
My Sport is a new page in BBC Sport where you can easily keep up to date with the latest news and scores for the sports and teams you love.  It will let you follow more than 300 sport topics, including competitions, and teams.  You can add as many as you like to create your own My Sport page.  We'll be looking to add more features in future too.
What happens when I add topics?
When you add a topic, it will be added to your own My Sport page, where you can read the latest stories and scores just from your topics.  It will also show you the latest fixtures and results for any football team you follow.  You can even reorder topics, to see your favourite stories at the top of My Sport.
