Care home tycoon Tony Banks, 54, had denied assaulting Kimberley Anderson at his home in Kirriemuir last December.
During a trial at Forfar Sheriff Court, Ms Anderson, 28, claimed she lied to police and made up the allegation.
Sheriff Gregor Murphy asked the procurator fiscal to investigate the conduct of the witness and the evidence she gave to court.
Banks was accused of attacking Miss Anderson by throwing a mobile phone at her, striking and kicking her on the body and repeatedly seizing her by the hair.
He was further alleged to have repeatedly pulled her to the floor, repeatedly kneeled on her stomach, slapped her on the head, spat on her and seized her by the throat and compressed it, all to her injury.
After hearing Ms Anderson's evidence, the Crown said it no longer sought a conviction.
The court heard that the couple now lived together at the address in Kirriemuir.
In a statement released after the court case, Mr Banks said: "The whole episode has been a very traumatic and upsetting time for all involved.
"But I am pleased that justice has been done with this 'not guilty' verdict.
"My partner and I have already put this behind us and look forward to continuing with our life together as before."
Mr Banks founded the Balhousie Care Group in the early 1990s. It has since grown to become Scotland's largest private care home provider.
