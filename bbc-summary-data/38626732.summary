[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chelsea v Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea striker Diego Costa is available, having missed the win over Leicester because of a back problem amid widespread reports of interest from Chinese clubs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Club captain John Terry is available again after serving a suspension.
Hull top scorer Robert Snodgrass is a slight doubt with a muscle problem but David Meyler has returned to training and should be fit.
Right-back Omar Elabdellaoui, signed on loan from Olympiakos, is available.
Recent recruits Oumar Niasse and Evandro could make their first starts.
Jonathan Pearce: "Hull City transformed Chelsea's season.
"It was at the KC on 1 October where Antonio Conte started with a back three for the first time. It brought the first of 13 league victories in a row.
"It's difficult to see Hull stopping what they helped to start.
"Chelsea have won their last eight at home. The media storm over Diego Costa will quickly subside if he scores for a fourth game in a row against the Tigers.
"Hull have lost their last eight league games away. Marco Silva has invigorated survival hopes but this is a huge task.
"Hull to dismantle Chelsea's season? I doubt it."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "If you think this type of game is easy you make a great mistake, and you can pay for it at the end of the season.
"Hull are a good team. They have changed the coach and usually you have a great reaction from the players."
Hull head coach Marco Silva: "It will be a difficult game at Chelsea. They are the best team in the Premier League right now because they are in first position.
"The only difference this week is that we have had more time to prepare ahead of the game. That is important for me and my players.
"They have had more time to work with my ideas and hopefully we will see the benefits on Sunday."
The Tigers have won two of their last three games but it is a step too far to think they can challenge the leaders at Stamford Bridge.
