DUP 'dream ticket' ends as Nigel Dodds steps away from leadership contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigel Dodds has been tipped as a future DUP leader for many years  - but that future will now not come true.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Dodds says his priority has always been the party and the country - not himself - and his decision is true to that principle.
The Cambridge-educated barrister joined the DUP in 1978.
As the party moved from protest to power, Mr Dodds held many of the top positions in Northern Ireland politics.
These included lord mayor of Belfast, Stormont finance minister, and DUP deputy leader.
In 2010, he stood down as an MLA to concentrate on his role leading the party in the House of Commons.
Commentators had long believed that the party's "dream ticket" to succeed Peter Robinson was Mr Dodds as DUP leader and Arlene Foster as first minister.
And over the last few weeks, DUP members have privately expressed expectations that would be the case.
But Mr Dodds points out that he has been on record as saying the party would be at a disadvantage if it was led from Westminster rather than Stormont.
He says he would have had "no hesitation whatsoever" in putting his name forward from the leadership if he had still been an MLA.
And the North Belfast MP says his choice was a difficult one.
There was emotion in his voice as he told journalists it would be wrong  to put his own personal standing above the best interests of the party.
At 57, Mr Dodds's political career is still very much alive and well.
He will remain as deputy leader of the DUP, and foresees plenty of work over the next few years at Westminster - a political forum which he loves.
He has given a strong endorsement to Finance Minister Arlene Foster - recommending her as party leader.
Last week  East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said he would not stand for the post.
However, at that time he endorsed Mr Dodds.
Health Minister Simon Hamilton is often talked about as a potential future party leader.
But Mr Hamilton is still in his 30s and, if he does make that move, it is likely to be some years away.
Gregory Campbell has a high profile and mandates at both Stormont and Westminster.
However, Mrs Foster is now the firm favourite to be both first minister and leader of Northern Ireland's largest party.
It is understood no nominations have yet been received.
Nominations close on Wednesday and the election (if there is one) will take place on Thursday 17 December.
