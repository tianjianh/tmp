Harbhajan Singh: Last hurrah or career revival?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harbhajan Singh is arguably one of the most colourful Indian cricketers, both on and off the field.

He won many matches for his country before losing his spot in the national side to the next generation of spinners like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.
He last played for India in a Test match against Australia in March, 2013.
The maverick spinner always made headlines in his decorated career for his heroics on the field, but sometimes for his aggressive nature as well.
Harbhajan was involved in a controversy with former Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds during a Test match in 2008. He was charged with using abusive language. The case had sharply divided opinions at the time.
Reactions are not very different to his "surprise" call up to the national side on Wednesday against the upcoming series against Bangladesh.
Some cricket writers feel that the 34-year-old deserved another chance, but others feel a young spinner should have been given a chance.
Cricket writer Pramod Ananth agrees that he is "one of India's greatest bowlers" and "his records bear testimony of the excellent servant he has been for Indian cricket".
But the writer feels that "his recent performances in the 2014-15 have not been up to the mark".
"There have been other Indian spinners who have done extremely well, and deserved a chance ahead of him," he writes.
Harbhajan has been in good form in the ongoing Indian Premiere League (IPL) Twenty20 tournament.
But can good performances in the IPL be a reason for a Test recall?
An article in The Indian Express agrees that questions will be raised at his inclusion in the team.
"The selection will no doubt throw up the question why the IPL performances have translated into a spot in the Test team and what did Harbhajan do in Ranji Trophy (India's domestic Test tournament) last season?" it asks.
But there are others who feel Harbhajan needed another chance in the national team.
Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar has backed the spinner.
"Well he has more than 400 Test wickets to his name, he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone or depend on his Ranji Trophy performance. Sometimes it is not only about taking wickets, it is also about how you are bowling and Harbhajan looks to be in good form," he says.
There can be different opinions on Harbhajan's selection, but not many can dismiss the player's hard work and determination to make a comeback.
As an article says, his selections is a tribute to a" fighter who kept his motivation levels high despite being on the sidelines".
Some pundits have suggested that the selectors have given him chance to allow him a graceful retirement from international cricket.
The player, however, disagrees.
"I have played most of my cricket at the international level and I'm very much looking to play for another good couple of years, perform well and do whatever I can do for the team to be successful," he said.
