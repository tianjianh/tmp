[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 2-1 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anthony Limbrick kicked off his Woking tenure with a fine 2-1 victory over Gateshead in stormy conditions at Laithwaite Community Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Barrow striker Inih Effiong took just 18 minutes to open his Woking account, tapping in on the rebound after Heed goalkeeper James Montgomery saved his initial effort.
Danny Johnson, who notched 18 times for the visitors last season, equalised with a thunderous low volley from just outside the area after 26 minutes, but Joe Ward put the hosts back in front after being picked out superbly by Bobson Bawling just before the interval.
Chez Isaac skimmed the crossbar for Woking with a spectacular strike from 25 yards after 50 minutes while Effiong also spurned an open goal to make it 3-1 soon after, but they had already done enough to hand former Southampton and West Ham academy coach Limbrick his first win.
