Forest Green: Former Stoke goalkeeper Dale Eve signs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers have re-signed Bermuda international goalkeeper Dale Eve on a deal to the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His arrival follows his release by Stoke and the departure of Paul White, whose contract with Forest Green has been cancelled by mutual consent.
Eve played in an FA Cup qualifying-round tie against Margate during a loan spell earlier this season.
"This is a real test for me and I want to get as many games in as I can," the 20-year-old said.
