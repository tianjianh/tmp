The MSP will make the pledge in her keynote address to the Scottish Labour conference in Perth.
Ms Dugdale believes new taxes would not be necessary to pay for the plan.
She will advocate changes of approach such as ditching SNP plans to cut air passenger duty and Tory proposals to raise higher rate tax thresholds.
Ms Dugdale will say that parties in Scotland must "get serious" about what they would do with the major new tax and welfare powers coming to the Scottish Parliament.
The MSP reckons the restoration of tax credits could be achieved by making different choices in government.

She will add: "Scottish Labour will stand for the elections with a promise to restore the money Scottish families will lose from this Tory tax rise on working families.
"We will act as soon as the new powers make it possible. We don't need to tax ordinary Scots more to make this change.

He has signed an agreement with Ms Dugdale pledging a more autonomous structure.
Who would join Scottish Labour - a party with just one MP north of the border and a poor showing in the polls?
