[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kendal's 'Batman' Victoria Bridge reopens after delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flood-damaged Cumbrian bridge has finally reopened after river levels caused delays to repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Bridge in Kendal - known locally as Batman Bridge - has been completely closed for nearly a month.
Continuous fast flowing water had eroded the river bed under two pillars, Cumbria County Council said.
Divers had worked in the River Kent to temporarily stabilise the bridge but water levels and technical problems forced the reopening to be rescheduled.
The bridge had already been closed to westbound traffic when the additional damage was discovered.
Work to protect new foundations against future flooding is planned for the summer.
