Scottish berry research projects win funding

The UK government has announced funding for three new research projects which it said could "revolutionise" Scottish berry production.

It has provided £1.3m for studies led by the Dundee-based James Hutton Institute and James Hutton Ltd.
The research aims to identify traits in raspberries that make them more resilient to pests and diseases.
It will also look at how blueberries can better adapt to Scotland's cooler climate.
Industry is contributing a further £700,000 to the research.
UK Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said super-resilient berries could help boost yields and help Scottish producers meet the growing demand for home-grown berries.
She said: "Scottish berries are up there with Scottish beef and lamb as a top quality UK product and this research will only enhance our reputation for producing good food both here and abroad.
"These projects demonstrate that by investing in the most cutting-edge techniques, and working collaboratively across the UK to raise standards, we can boost productivity and help more Scottish and UK producers to compete in international markets."
According to the government, a combination of dry summers, fertile soils and better protection has seen strawberry and raspberry production in Scotland double over the past 10 years.
In 2014, 25,000 tonnes of strawberries and 3,000 tonnes of raspberries were produced, contributing £81m to the UK's growing soft fruit sector, worth an estimated £351m.
Prof Bob Ferrier, from the James Hutton Institute, said: "This research is essential for the sustainability and commercial success of the Scottish and UK berry industry.
"Through the UK government's investment in applying scientific innovation to address challenges faced across the agri-food supply chain, we can help producers grow more robust, disease resistant soft fruit varieties that are better suited to the UK market and climate."
