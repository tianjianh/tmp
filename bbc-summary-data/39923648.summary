The Edinburgh-based company is aiming to double its turnover to £25m by 2020 and triple beer production to 30,000 hectolitres in the next two years.
Its 12-strong sales team will seek to accelerate UK-wide growth of the brewer's portfolio in the off-trade.
There are also plans to expand the brand further into the on-trade in England and Wales.
In November the company, which has a brewery in Perth and runs several "beer kitchens" in Scotland, said it was speeding up its growth plans after raising £2.5m in a crowdfunding campaign.
Innis & Gunn, which has sold more than 40 million bottles of beer globally in the last 18 months, already has a distribution deal for China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Director of sales Crawford Sinclair said: "We had an incredibly exciting, and undoubtedly transformational 2016 in the business, and our investment in our sales team is a significant step to build on this momentum in the trade and give our customers the support they need to grow their business and ours."
