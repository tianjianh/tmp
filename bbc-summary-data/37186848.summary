Ciarán Maxwell, 30, from Larne, was detained in Somerset by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command on Wednesday.
It has emerged that when he was 16,  he was assaulted by loyalists and suffered a skull fracture.
The story was reported at the time in the republican newspaper An Phoblacht.
In an interview with the  newspaper in July 2002,  the then teenager described how he had been struck by a bottle, struggled to his feet and tried to run away.
The paper reported:  "At this point, up to ten loyalists arrived in two cars. This gang was armed with iron bars and golf clubs and they immediately attacked Kieran. He was beaten to the ground and lost consciousness."
The paper said some Catholic youths who witnessed the attack went to his aid. The eyewitnesses explained that loyalists, who seemed to be waiting in ambush, kept beating him "as he lay prone on the ground".
Mr Maxwell's parents told the paper they felt "angry and frustrated that Catholics in Larne were under constant threat and nothing was being done about it".
It added: "They were critical of the RUC/PSNI, who they say don't treat attacks on Catholics seriously".
Mr Maxwell was arrested after searches in Larne and Devon.
The arrest is understood the operation is connected to the discovery of two arms dumps near Larne earlier this year, suspected to be linked to dissident republican paramilitaries.
The operation involved several UK police forces, including the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
It is understood MI5 is also involved in the operation in England which is likely to continue all weekend.

Following the arrest on Wednesday afternoon, police in Devon searched a house in Exminster and a wooded area nearby.
The PSNI searched at least two houses on the Old Glenarm Road in Larne.
It is understood that a number of laptops and mobile phones were seized from the houses as part of the investigation.
A woman, who said she was the aunt of Ciarán Maxwell, expressed fears for her family's safety following his arrest.
She said the family only became aware this afternoon that police searches were being carried out.
The wider family are believed to be well known in the town.
In March, the PSNI said they had uncovered a "significant terrorist hide" of bomb-making components and explosives at Carnfunnock Country Park.
Among the items recovered were wiring, circuit boards, partially constructed power timer units and a small quantity of explosives.
In May, a second significant arms cache, including an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines, was found at Capanagh Forest, near Larne.
Mr Maxwell is suspected of being involved in preparing for acts of terrorism and is being held at a West Country police station.
Police said the operation was pre-planned and intelligence-led as part of a collaboration between the Met, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit.
Devon and Cornwall Police said they will be carrying out patrols to try to reassure the community following the anti-terrorism operation in Devon.
The force said there was no intelligence to suggest a threat to the community.
