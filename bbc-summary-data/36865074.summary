The book was part of a sale of more than 50 items, which included sketches and letters and raised £101,952.
Most of them were amassed by John Cawood from the Lake District, with which Potter had a long association.
Memorabilia was being auctioned to mark 150 years since the author's birth.
Mr Cawood started his collection in 1972 and set out to achieve a complete set of first editions of Potter's books.
Beatrix Potter did not stop at writing tales that would last for more than a century. In 1903 Peter Rabbit became the first literary character in the world to be licensed and turned into a doll.
It was all the author's idea too. She went on to invent a Peter Rabbit board game a year later and came up with further spin-offs, such as painting books, featuring her characters.
Beatrix Potter's legacy is a huge money-spinner for the Lake District, not only from the buildings and land she left to the National Trust but in the thousands of people who visit from all over the world, including Japan, where Peter Rabbit and other characters have acted as mascots for banks.
