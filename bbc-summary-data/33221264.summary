European police join UK forces to target foreign criminals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Foreign criminals hiding in the UK are being targeted in a police operation that has seen officers from across Europe travel to Britain.

Officers from Romania, Lithuania and the Netherlands are working alongside British forces to trace offenders who use the UK road network for crimes.
Supt Paul Keasey of West Midlands Police, leading the operation, said: "Borders are no barrier to justice."
Last October's Operation Trivium led to more than 1,000 arrests.
Police Scotland and all 43 police forces in England and Wales are taking part in the operation.
It is estimated there are up to 350,000 foreign-registered vehicles on UK roads at any one time.
European police agency Europol, which also has officers taking part in the investigation, has circulated details of more than 3,000 vehicles that are suspected of being linked to crime, ahead of the week-long operation.
Supt Keasey said the support of European officers, who will also help with language issues, was "invaluable".
He said: "Foreign nationals who commit crime in the UK, and who use the road network to facilitate that criminality, may feel untouchable by UK police - but operations like this demonstrate our commitment to cross-border policing and show that borders are no barrier to justice."
The week of action runs from June 22 to 26, with automatic number plate recognition being used to check foreign-plated vehicles.
Cameras will be able to tell immediately if the car is uninsured or linked to criminality.
"The operation has allowed us to forge strong links with eastern European police counterparts, share information on criminals and any emerging tactics used by offenders," Supt Keasey said.
"It is important to stress that we are targeting criminals, not the communities these offenders are from.  Trivium targets those who try to use borders to cover their criminal tracks through an international show of determination."
This is the fourth Operation Trivium. Last October's investigation saw 7,151 vehicles stopped, with 555 seized and 1,073 people arrested on suspicion of crimes including shoplifting, human trafficking and domestic abuse.
Another 3,458 people were given on-the-spot fines for traffic offences, or were cautioned or summonsed to court.
Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said: "Over the last few years, Trivium has proved invaluable, not only in terms of helping us catch foreign national offenders using our road network as part of their criminal activity, but also as an example of solid, collegial international collaboration with colleagues from a variety of countries helping us out since the operation's inception."
