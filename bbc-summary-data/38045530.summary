Jack Cork: Swansea City midfielder 'little bit disappointed' with point

Swansea City midfielder Jack Cork says their 1-1 draw at Everton in the Premier League felt like a defeat.

The Swans were denied only their second win of the season by Seamus Coleman's late equaliser at Goodison Park.
Bob Bradley's side are now prop up the Premier League table after Sunderland comfortably won 3-0 against fellow strugglers Hull City.
"At the start of the game we probably would have taken one point so it's a little bit disappointing," Cork said.
"If it would have been the other way around and we nicked something last minute then everyone would have been really happy.
"It would have been a completely different feeling."
Swansea have not won in the league since their 1-0 victory at Burnley on the opening day of the season in August.

They had looked on course to break their winless run and give Bob Bradley his first victory since succeeding Francesco Guidolin at the beginning of October.
Gylfi Sigurdsson had put the visitors ahead with a penalty in the 41st minute but Coleman scored a minute from time with a looping header.
Despite the disappointment of conceding a late goal and falling to secure a much needed three points, Cork was pleased with the team's display and is confident of an upturn in fortunes.
"The overall performance was good and better than it has been in recent weeks," Cork added.
"We showed a lot of determination which hasn't been there recently. Hopefully this can be a bit of a catalyst to get us going for the next few games.
"We've got a good December and some good fixtures coming up and it will be a good chance for us to get some points.
"We've had a tough month or so with games. It's only 12 games played but it's frustrating for everyone because we've got the players and we've got a good team.
"Everyone wants to be doing well but we've got to stick together and work hard to what we want to be."
Swansea are at home to Crystal Palace in their next game on Saturday, 26 November.
