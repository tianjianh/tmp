Wigan Athletic will "bounce back" after being relegated into League One, according to chairman David Sharpe.

The 2013 FA Cup winners dropped into the third tier, along with Millwall and Blackpool, after Rotherham's 2-1 win over Reading on Tuesday.
Sharpe told the Wigan website: "Our only target next season is promotion, nothing else will suffice.
"Football is full of examples of clubs who have come back stronger after relegation."
With only one game of the season remaining, Wigan, who recently appointed former club captain Gary Caldwell as their new manager after dismissing Malky Mackay, are second from bottom of the Championship table, with just nine wins from 45 matches.
They were relegated from the Premier League in 2013 and are returning to the third tier for the first time since 2003.
"It's a sad day for everyone associated with Wigan Athletic but we will bounce back, I want that to be the main message to our fans tonight," added Sharpe.
"The job of rebuilding the club is already well under way under Gary Caldwell and his staff.
"At Wigan Athletic we believe. So let's dust ourselves down and be ready for the challenge of getting this club promoted at the first attempt."
