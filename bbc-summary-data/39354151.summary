The show, called Shakespeare, Tolkien, Others & You, will see the Lord of the Rings and X-Men star look back on more than 50 years on stage and screen.
It's all for charity, with proceeds going towards London's Park Theatre.
According to Sir Ian, the Finsbury Park venue needs donations of Â£250,000 every year "just to keep the doors open".
"In a short time the theatre has established itself on both the theatrical and local maps," he said in a statement.
"I do hope you'll support this wonderful cause."
Sir Ian will reprise some of his best-known performances as part of the show.
It's not yet known which roles he'll focus on, but the title suggests Gandalf the wizard will be among them.
Shakespeare's Macbeth, which he famously played opposite Dame Judi Dench in 1976, is also expected to feature.
There'll be nine performances in all, which will take place at the Park Theatre between 3 and 9 July.
Jez Bond, the theatre's artistic director, said he was "grateful for and humbled by his incredible generosity".
"As one of our country's leading actors, I can't imagine there is anyone better placed to understand both the power and importance of smaller scale theatres and the challenges they face."
News of Sir Ian's latest endeavour follows his appearance at this year's Empire Film Awards, held on Sunday at the Roundhouse in London.
The 77-year-old was there to present a "legend" award to his X-Men co-star Sir Patrick Stewart, with whom he recently appeared in Harold Pinter's No Man's Land.
