[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A robber who "viciously" assaulted a man in his home on Christmas Day has been found guilty of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Starkey, 61, died five days after Wayne Muirhead broke into his home in Reney Crescent, in Sheffield.
South Yorkshire Police said he died from "paracetamol toxicity" after taking painkillers following the attack. The force said his liver was already damaged by alcohol dependency.
Muirhead, 41, of Batemoor Road, Sheffield, will be sentenced next year.
Sheffield Crown Court heard Muirhead forced his way into Mr Starkey's home on 25 December last year and stole Â£1,500 in cash, a mobile phone and a PlayStation.
He was arrested after the phone was recovered and a number of calls and text messages were linked to Muirhead.
A jury found him guilty of manslaughter and robbery. He was also convicted of a second robbery at Mr Starkey's home, when he stole Â£280.
Det Insp Richard Partridge said: "Mr Starkey was alcohol dependent and his liver was damaged, which when combined with painkillers for his injuries, resulted in paracetamol toxicity that tragically caused his death.
"Had Muirhead not viciously attacked Mr Starkey in his own home, there is no doubt in my mind he would still be alive now and celebrating Christmas with his family."
