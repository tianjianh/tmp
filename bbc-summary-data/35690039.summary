In the last couple of years, Evie has gone through a long process in order to become female which included prescribed hormones and surgery.
Now, she is transgender and she is proud of it!
However, it wasn't always easy. In her first of a series of  video diaries, Evie opens up about what life was like when she first transitioned and how opening up and telling her story has helped her to become bodypositive.
If you want to share your story, email us bodypositive@bbc.co.uk.
