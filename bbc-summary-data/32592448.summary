Election 2015: Viewing guide - and what to stay up for

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is set to be the most exciting general election night in years - here is a full guide to what you can expect after the polls close on Thursday and how to follow all the results and reaction on the BBC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Television
21:55 BST - BBC One
The BBC's main election night programme will be fronted by David Dimbleby, with live coverage from 220 counts. Andrew Neil will be interviewing the politicians, with Jeremy Vine on swingometer duties - there will be four of them this time to reflect the different permutations. BBC political editor Nick Robinson will be on hand to look at the bigger picture, with Laura Kuenssberg monitoring social media and Emily Maitlis analysing the results on a giant touch screen. Huw Edwards takes over from David Dimbleby at 07:00 BST on Friday and will continue anchoring the main programme until 18:00 BST. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will have their own overnight programmes but will join Huw Edwards from 07:00 BST on 8 May.
Radio
There will be joint overnight broadcast by BBC Radio 4 and 5 live hosted by Jim Naughtie and Carolyn Quinn. Presenters and reporters from across BBC radio programmes will be at key constituencies and at Westminster. The World Service will broadcast its own overnight election special and local BBC radio stations around the country will be broadcasting live from counts.
Online
There will be full coverage of results as they come in and reaction from politicians, pundits and BBC correspondents, in our election live page. There will also be a live updating results scoreboard and map, showing how the country has voted, and plenty more stats for those who like their election nights delivered to the last decimal point. In addition, there will be a breakdown of results for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Enter your details in our constituency postcode search box for your constituency result and brief updates from the area.
You will also be able to watch all of the BBC's election night programmes - the UK network programme and those focusing on Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales - or listen to radio coverage, on the election live page. And there will be an exclusive online-only channel there, showing live declarations from counting centres around the country.
On social media, our @BBCPolitics Twitter account will deliver updates, results and reaction galore, as will our BBC News Facebook page. At the same time, the BBC Election Instagram page will sum it all up in a series of short films, graphics and images. And if you tweet the first half of your postcode to @BBCElectionBot, you'll get a reply with the closest matching result.
Exit poll - Polls close at 22:00 BST and the BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll is published. In 2010, the exit poll was pretty much spot on in its prediction of how many seats the parties eventually got. This time, however, the surge in support for the SNP and UKIP could make it a bit trickier for the pollsters.
Seat projections - There are 650 seats up for grabs. To form a majority government a party needs 326, although 323 should be enough because Sinn Fein's MPs don't take up their seats. If no party gets this, it becomes a question of who gets the most MPs - and how many seats their potential coalition partners get.
Local elections - Elections for local councillors are taking place in all parts of England at the same time as the general election, with the exception of seven unitary authorities, a handful of districts and the 32 London boroughs.
Declaration times: The Press Association has posted a list of declaration times in chronological and alphabetical order.
(all these times are approximate and counts may be delayed in some constituencies)
22:00 BST to midnight
If you are settling in for a long night now might be the time to get the snacks and beverages sorted because not much will be happening in terms of results.
Houghton and Sunderland South is likely to be the first constituency to declare at about 22:45 BST. The two other Sunderland seats and three Newcastle seats are all expected to announce their results by midnight. But that's about it.
Midnight to 02:00 BST Friday
If you've committed to the long haul, this is when you'll start to see some reward.
Labour's 34th target seat, Nuneaton, is due to declare at about 01:30 BST. If Ed Miliband's party doesn't win here it could be an early sign that they are in for a disappointing night.
We should also get a sense of how big the predicted SNP swing in Scotland is going to be, when Na h-Eileanan an Iar or the Western Isles declares.
Keep an eye on the performance of the DUP, who the Conservatives might have to rely on to form a government, as the first Northern Irish seats announce their results, starting with North Antrim at about 01:00 BST.
Plaid Cymru could gain Yyns Mon, or Anglesey, shortly before 02:00 BST, if the UKIP surge takes a big enough chunk out of Labour's vote.
02:00 - 03:00 BST
This is when things start to get really interesting.
Scotland's results should be coming through thick and fast - including some juicy Labour targets for Nicola Sturgeon's troops.
Gordon Brown's old seat Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath is due to declare at about the same time. Labour is hoping to retain it - if the SNP win this we are into uncharted territory.
Polls suggest things look better for Labour in London. We'll see an early test of that with Conservative-held Battersea due shortly after 02:00 BST. This is being seen as an early sign of whether Ed Miliband is likely to be heading for Downing Street.
The Conservatives will be watching Bolton West (expected declaration 03:00 BST) - a win there, in their second target seat, is seen as vital for David Cameron's hopes of staying in Number 10.
This is also a critical hour for UKIP, with some of their Tory-held targets, such as Castle Point, on the Essex coast, Cleethorpes, in Lincolnshire, and Thurrock, in Essex, set to declare.
03:00 - 04:00 BST
This is primetime as far as results go. We should be getting a proper sense of who's winning and who's losing and if the exit poll was accurate.
Two key Tory/Labour marginals to watch out for are Bristol North West, due around 03:00 BST, and City of Chester half an hour later. If both remain in the blue column, things will be looking good for David Cameron.
It will be fascinating to see what happens in Bristol West, a three-way fight between Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens, due around 03:00 BST.
Labour election chief and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander should learn whether he has held Paisley and Renfrewshire South at about 03:00 BST.
Lib Dem veteran Simon Hughes is hoping to hold Bermondsey and Old Southwark against a Labour challenge, with the result due shortly after 03:00 BST.
This is also the hour of reckoning for the Lib Dems in their traditional West Country stronghold. Top Tory target Mid Dorset and Poole North is due at 03:00 BST. Polls suggest a battle in the region for the Lib Dems. Education Minister David Laws, hopes to hold Yeovil, with a declaration due at 03:30 BST.
Labour's leader in Scotland Jim Murphy will find out if he has held East Renfrewshire at about 03:20 BST.
04:00 - 05:00 BST
Crunch time for Nick Clegg. The deputy prime minister will find out he has managed to retain his Sheffield Hallam seat shortly after 04:00 BST.
Mr Clegg's Cabinet colleague Danny Alexander should find out how he's done in Inverness, Nairn, Badencoch and Strathspey at about 04:45 BST. This hour could well decide whether there will be another Lib Dem/Conservative coalition at Westminster.
Conservative Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will hope to hold on in Loughborough, which is 51st on Labour's target list but became a top priority for Ed Miliband's party when she joined the cabinet. The result is due in this hour.
05:00 - 06:00 BST
All eyes - or those that remain open - will be on Wirral West at about 05:00 BST, where Conservative minister Esther McVey hopes to again hold off Labour. Neighbouring Wirral South, a top Conservative target, is due to declare at about the same time.
It is also worth holding on for Bradford West, due around 05:00 BST. Can George Galloway retain the seat he won in such spectacular fashion at a by-election in 2012, in the face of a strong Labour challenge? Whatever the result, his election night interviews have often proved must-watch TV.
The Green Party's Caroline Lucas will find out if she has managed to retain Brighton Pavilion at about 05:00 BST.
Former Conservative MP Mark Reckless will find out if he has managed to retain the Rochester and Strood seat he won for UKIP in a by-election last year at about the same time.
06:00 - 08:00 BST
We may not know who is forming the next government yet, but we should have a good idea of who is going to be the largest party.
If you have already admitted defeat and headed for bed, it might be worth setting the alarm to catch one of the most keenly anticipated results of the night.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage is facing a fight with the Tories and Labour in South Thanet and has said he will quit as party leader if he does not win. His result is due at 06:00 BST.
former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy will he hold Ross, Skye and Lochaber or be defeated by the SNP at about 07:00.
Austerity: Spending cuts.
Ashcroft poll: Former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft has reinvented himself as an opinion pollster. His surveys of how people are going to vote in marginal seats have been a big feature of this election campaign.
Ballot: Another term for vote.
Core vote: People who always vote for the same party no matter what. Known in America as "the base". A "core vote strategy" is sometimes used as a put-down, suggesting that a party is not reaching out enough to undecided voters.
Coalition: When two or more parties join forces to govern as a single unit. The junior partners are given ministerial jobs and a joint programme for government is set out.
Confidence and supply: When a smaller party, such as the SNP or the Lib Dems, agrees to support a larger party, such as Labour or the Conservatives, in key Commons votes to keep it in power is called "confidence and supply". The smaller party will support the government in "confidence" votes and Budgets.
Debt: The amount of money owed by the UK government.
Deficit: When the government spends more than it receives in taxes it is said to be running a deficit.
Deposit: Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast.
Doorstep: A term politicians use to refer to public opinion - what people have been saying to them when they have been out campaigning. A handy way to deflect criticism as it is difficult to disprove: "That's not what people have been saying to me on the doorstep".
First Past The Post: The winner-takes-all voting system used in elections to the Westminster Parliament. The candidate with the most votes in a constituency becomes the MP. There are no second or third preferences.
Fiscal policy: Tax and spending.
Hung Parliament: When no single party can get enough MPs to form a majority on its own the Parliament is said to be "hung". This happened at the 2010 general election.
Majority: When one party has more MPs than all the other parties put together, enabling them to form a single party government.
Manifesto: A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually published during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver.
Marginal: A constituency where there is a close contest.
Safe seat: A constituency where one party is expected to win comfortably. A large proportion of constituencies fall into this category.
Target seat: All the parties have lists of the seats they believe they have a chance of winning. These are called targets. Under First Past The Post, the parties that are best at targeting seats gain an advantage.
Vote-by-vote deal: A looser arrangement than "confidence and supply". It means a minority government could count on the support of a smaller party in some votes but not in others.
Working through the night, through the decades, to bring you all the crunch information (sometimes literally).
