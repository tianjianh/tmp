Gregory, 21, from Waterlooville in Hampshire, beat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre 2&1 in the final at Royal Porthcawl on Saturday.
He is also guaranteed a place at the Masters and US Open next year.
"It feels quite surreal," Gregory told BBC Radio Solent. "It's not quite sunk in, but it's a dream come true for me."
Gregory, who plays at Corhampton Golf Club, near Winchester, plans to stay amateur so he can take up his place at the first two majors of next season.
"You can't turn down an invite like that," he added. "It's incredible and I'm in a very privileged position to win this tournament.
"To have the opportunities and the doors that open are out of this world.
"I can't wait for everything that's ahead and I just want to enjoy the experience and hopefully play some good golf along the way."
First up on Gregory's busy calendar will be this year's Open at Royal Troon, which begins on 14 July.
