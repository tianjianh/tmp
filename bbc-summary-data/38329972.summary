[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An angry neighbour wrote out a "revenge list" before killing a 73-year-old man and stabbing a young mum living in the same apartment block.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff Crown Court heard Andrew Seal of Ogmore Vale, near Bridgend, headed the note "Sunday Bloody Sunday".
Gwilym Jones died after the May attack.
Seal, 49, previously admitted Mr Jones' manslaughter through diminished responsibility and attempted murder of Bridie Jones, and will spend 12 years in prison as part of his life sentence.
Judge Sir Roderick Evans said: "You went to the flat of each victim, taking with you a knife and doing so with the intention of killing them.
"I am driven to the conclusion that you are a dangerous offender and it is not possible to judge how long that danger will last.
"Nobody can tell the court when the danger will no longer exist, therefore I have to impose a life sentence."
The court heard Seal had stabbed pensioner Mr Jones in revenge for an alleged attack on his nephew.
Police only found Mr Jones' body after Seal was arrested following the attack on 21-year-old Miss Jones in the same block.
The note was later found at Seal's home.
The court heard Seal was experiencing psychotic symptoms, which would have had a significant influence on his behaviour.
