Prince Charles champions Cumbria's rural economy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Prince of Wales has been in Cumbria meeting people who make a living from some of the most remote parts of the county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He met shepherds and hill farmers and those who are trying to help find sustainable ways of living high in the fells.
Among them were members of the Herdwick Project - an initiative designed to raise the profile of Herdwick Meat and to encourage wider trade links.
Later he spent more than an hour talking to local employers at the Westmorland County showground and praised the work of the organisers.
He ended the day with a visit to furniture maker Peter Hall and Son in Staveley near Kendal.
