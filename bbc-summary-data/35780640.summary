Sex case footballer Adam Johnson to be sentenced on 24 March

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sex case footballer Adam Johnson, who was warned by a judge to expect a "significant jail term", is set to be sentenced on 24 March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former England and Sunderland star admitted grooming and sexual activity with a girl aged 15 and was convicted of a charge of sexual touching.
Following the trial at Bradford Crown Court the 28-year-old was released on bail to set his affairs in order.
The judge warned him he faced jail and said "say goodbye to your daughter".
Johnson met up with the girl on 30 January 2015 after agreeing to sign football shirts for her, the court heard.
The player admitted kissing the teenager but told the jury the encounter in his Range Rover "went no further".
The jury found Johnson, who also played for Middlesbrough and Manchester City, guilty last week of sexual touching but cleared him of a charge relating to another sexual act.
He had already been sacked by Sunderland after admitting on the first day of his trial that he had kissed the girl.
