[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bryony Hollands, 19, from Berkshire, died after being struck by Thomas Burney's car on Woodthorpe Road in Nottingham last month.
Burney, 26, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to two charges when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court.
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 23 October.
Miss Hollands was a music student at the University of Sheffield, but was visiting Nottingham with her 20-year-old boyfriend Ben Evans when she died.
Speaking after her death, her father Mark Hollands said she was "prodigious in the arts" and could play the French horn, trumpet and piano.
"[Bryony] lit up the lives of those she met. Our loss is their loss too and the loss of those who will never know her," he said.
During her time in Sheffield she helped provide soup and sandwiches to the homeless.
She was also part of a group of students which helped decorate a remote village school in India.
"Bryony's life was touched by the love and affection of young children with so little materially, but full of joy and laughter," her father said.
"She longed to return there again."
