A teenager has appeared in court after a young Celtic fan with Down's syndrome was allegedly abused online.

Ross Gibson, 19, of Aberdeen, was charged following the Parkhead clash between Celtic and Aberdeen on 1 March.
It had been claimed that comments about Jay Beatty, 11, were posted online.
Mr Gibson appeared in private at Aberdeen Sheriff Court charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner. He made no plea or declaration and his case was continued.
He was released on bail and is expected to appear in court again later this year.
Jay, from Lurgan, County Armagh, won the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) Goal of the Month for January after he scored at half-time during Celtic's victory over Hamilton Academical.
He was presented with the award at the 1 March game.
