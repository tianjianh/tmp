A video of a schoolboy being punched to the ground a week before he was found dead in a Cheltenham park is being investigated by police.

Adam Tharia, 15, died three days after he was found hanged in parkland near Robert Burns Avenue last month.
The footage, circulated online, reportedly shows him being hit while surrounded by a larger group of boys.
Gloucestershire Police confirmed it was aware of the footage and would "assess all relevant information".
"We are keeping an open mind about what this might tell us," a spokesman added.
"It would be inappropriate to discuss the specifics of the investigation while it is ongoing."
Last week the Bournside School pupil's parents paid tribute to the "most wonderful" son who "will be missed by so many".
"The boy we knew and loved was an outdoorsy teenager who loved skateboarding and going out with his friends," they said.
"Adam was intelligent and worked hard at school and was well thought of by his teachers and peers alike."
Gloucestershire Police said the coroner had been informed of Adam's death, which was not being treated as suspicious.
