[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World Rally Championship driver Jari-Matti Latvala has received a suspended one-race ban after failing to check on a spectator following a collision.

The Finn spun into the spectator zone in Saturday's stage 11 at the Rally Monte Carlo and hit a photographer at low speed.
Latvala carried on driving, saying after the stage that he had not realised he had hit someone.
As well as the ban, Latvala has also been fined Â£3,800.
Explaining his failure to stop, Latvala said: "My visibility was hampered briefly by thick steam from the engine and mud that had sprayed up from the ditch."
But a statement from the rally stewards rejected that claim.
"Looking at the images, it would be hard to believe that the driver and/or co-driver had not realised that they had hit a spectator as the body could be seen quite prominently on the bonnet and right in front of the windscreen," it read.
"At that moment the visibility through the windscreen on the driver's side was not so bad and the body could be seen clearly."
