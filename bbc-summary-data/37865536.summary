Doctors leaders say a decision by another north Wales GP surgery to end its NHS contract is "extremely worrying".

The Rashmi practice at Old Colwyn, Conwy county, will hand back services to the region's health board in January.
It follows similar moves by surgeries in Denbighshire, Wrexham and Conwy.
The Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it will write to all 1,200 patients affected by the latest move.
Since September 2015, practices in Prestatyn, Rhuddlan, Wrexham and Conwy have also handed back their contracts, leaving the Betsi Cadwaladr board to run them directly.
"Surgeries handing back their contracts to the health board is a real-time demonstration of how some general practices are at breaking point and see this as the only solution open to them," said Dr Charlotte Jones, who chairs the British Medical Association's general practice committee.
"BMA Cymru Wales' GP committee recently undertook a survey of GPs across Wales, in which 82.1% of those surveyed voiced serious concerns about the sustainability of their practice."
A health board spokesman said there was no need for Rashmi surgery patients to register with a different practice.
"The health board is responsible for making sure that everyone in north Wales has access to GP services," he said.
"Over the next three months, we will keep patients and other members of the local population informed of our progress, and will respond to any concerns and questions."
