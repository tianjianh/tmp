A man has been jailed for seven years for his part in the death of a teenage girl in a car crash near Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lucy Commins, 16, was in a Mercedes driven by Ross Clark, 38, of Kent when it was hit by one of two racing cars.
The crash happened in Ansty Road, Walsgrave on Sowe, in February 2014.
In June, Clark was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and convicted of failing to provide a blood specimen while under the influence of drink.
He was also disqualified from driving for four years at his sentencing at Warwick Crown Court.
West Midlands Police said Clark, of London Road, Sevenoaks, had met Miss Commins and a friend at a pub and had taken them to get cigarettes from a nearby petrol station.
Reece Jones and Sean Sparkes, who were sentenced in November, were street racing when Clark pulled into their path.
A Ford Fiesta swerved to avoid the silver Mercedes but a VW Golf ploughed into the side of it, causing Lucy's death and serious injury to her friend.
Clark was also badly injured.
Sparkes, 33, of Nuneaton Road, Bulkington, was jailed for six years and six months and Jones, 24, of Attoxhall Road, Coventry, was sentenced to eight years and nine months over the crash.
Ms Commins' family said in a statement: "The people responsible have not only taken Lucy's life, they have taken the life from our whole family. We are left serving a life sentence."
Speaking after the sentencing, Sgt Adam Green said: "Reece Jones, Sean Sparkes and Ross Clark will have to live with their actions, as will Lucy's family. Throughout the court appearances Lucy's family have been commended by the judge for the dignity shown in such difficult circumstances."
