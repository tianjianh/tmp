About 20 people threw bottles and wood causing one man a head injury and two officers minor injuries, police said.
Five people were arrested on suspicion of disorder-related offences and remained in custody on Sunday morning.
The planned event had been approved by the Met to take place in Camden High Street on Saturday from 19:00 BST.
On their Facebook page, event organisers said: "The heart of Camden is being ripped out, pubs are being converted to luxury flats no-one can afford, venues are under threat, the market is flogged off to be a casino.
"Camden is a unique place and worth defending against this onslaught of dog-eat-dog economics."
Scotland Yard said within two hours of the event starting some of the protesters had moved into the road, forcing officers to close Camden Underground Station.
Additional officers, including the Territorial Support Group and Dogs Unit, were brought in to help disperse the crowd.
