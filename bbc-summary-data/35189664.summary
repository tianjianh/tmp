A woman believed to be in her 80s has died after apparently being shot by a fellow resident at a care home in Essex, police have said.

Police have begun a murder inquiry and a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police said the victim and the alleged assailant were residents in the home.
Officers were called to De La Mer House care home in Naze Park Road, Walton-on-the-Naze, at about 09:00 GMT after reports a woman was seriously injured.
DCI Simon Werrett said: "At this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation and our inquiries are ongoing."
The premises are being guarded while forensic searches are conducted.
Nearby resident and retired financial adviser John Knights said security was tight at the care home.
He said: "My mother had to go into  De La Mer about two years ago, and I can tell you that it was quite tricky to get in and out of there.
"You couldn't just go up to the building and get in. You needed a security code to get in. It had electronic key pads on the door, so to get inside you needed to know those."
A spokeswoman for the care home said there would be no comment until staff had spoken to police.
Douglas Carswell, the UKIP MP for the area, said he was "very shocked".
He said: "If you have got a loved one in a care home, you expect them to be safe. Walton-on-the-Naze is supposed to be one of the most peaceful and tranquil places there is. Of all the places you expect this to happen, this is the last."
