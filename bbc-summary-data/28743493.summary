[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Preparatory work on the Aberdeen bypass is to start this week, Transport Minister Keith Brown has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move comes after preferred bidder Connect Roads signed a pre-start works agreement for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR).
The agreement for preparatory work is worth about £8m.
Connect Roads will now start fencing, environment surveys and ground investigations ahead of the main works contract.
Connect Roads is a consortium comprising Balfour Beatty, Galliford Try (Morrison Construction) and Carillion.
The £745m project includes the bypass and turning the Balmedie to Tipperty stretch of the A90 a dual carriageway.
Work on the bypass is expected to be completed by the spring of 2018.
Announcing the pre-start works agreement, Mr Brown said: "The people of Aberdeen and the north-east have been waiting for decades for a sign that works are due to start on the AWPR/Balmedie-Tipperty scheme.
"Today, we can announce that the preferred bidder will be on site from this week actively preparing for the main works.
"This is an important indication that we will look for every opportunity to accelerate the work where we can."
