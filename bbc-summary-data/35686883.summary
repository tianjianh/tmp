Rochdale striker Grant Holt says he can act as a mentor to younger players after returning to the club.

After an unsuccessful loan spell with Wolves, the 34-year-old rejoined Dale from Wigan on a short-term deal.
"You've got to give advice at times in the game when we could have done things better," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"It's not naivety, it's youthfulness - they'll learn. You pass advice on and they take it and if they use it, it's fantastic."
Holt scored in Rochdale's 2-0 win against Sheffield United, his first goal in 19 competitive games, during which he has played for four clubs in a run stretching 15 months.
"Everyone can see I'm enjoying myself," he said. "It's been difficult, I haven't had much game time for the last few months.
"I've still got a career ahead of me and I want to keep playing football and keep enjoying it."
The former Norwich City and Aston Villa forward feels satisfied with his progression at Rochdale, despite being limited to substitute appearances since his return to Spotland.
"You always want to play and start games but that's a manager's prerogative to do what he feels, I haven't played 90 minutes for a long time due to injury," he added.
"We're doing it the right way, we're building it up. I'm doing what is needed to do and it's another step closer to where I want to be."
