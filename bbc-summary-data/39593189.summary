Ogogo, 27, has resumed training as he continues his recovery from a knee operation in early February.
"The physio and the surgeon are both impressed with how quickly he's got to this point," Shrewsbury boss Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Shropshire.
"If he keeps joining in and he feels good, I'm not going to rule him out but I'm not going to rule him in either."
Ogogo suffered medial knee ligament damage against Scunthorpe on 11 February but had still played in enough games this season to trigger a contract extension.
The former Arsenal trainee joined Shrewsbury from Dagenham & Redbridge in June 2015 and has made 79 appearances for the club.
