Earlier on Sunday DR Congo's AS Vita Club beat visiting Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa 1-0.
The overall winners of the tie will progress to the group stages.
While the losers will get a second chance in the Confederation Cup.
Udoh scored his first goal after nine minutes and then added a second for Enyimba after the break and completed his hat-trick with a powerful shot just before the end of the match.
It means Udoh is now the top scorer in the tournament with 7 goals so far.
Etoile played the last 19 minutes of the match with 10 men after Ghazi Abderazek was given a second yellow card for dissent and was sent off.
The tie is a repeat of the 2004 final that Enyimba eventually won on penalties after both legs had finished 2-1 to the home team.
Uganda goalkeeper Dennis Onyango had kept Sundowns in the game in Kinshasa with some fine saves as Vita Club's Ghanaian star Bernard Morrison proved a handful.
The only goal of the game was scored in injury time at the end of the game as Morrison was once again given too much time and while his shot was well saved by Onyango his parry fell to Kule Mbombo, who scored.
Vita's compatriots TP Mazembe have a tough task if they are to defend their title after a 2-0 loss on Saturday at Morocco's Wydad Casablanca.
Abdellatif Noussir scored his first goal of the campaign just before half-time for Wydad and Reda Hajhouj converted a penalty midway through the second half in Marrakech.
Coached by twice Real Madrid manager John Toshack, Wydad are attempting to  win the competition a second time, having previously succeeded in 1992.
Mazembe are chasing a sixth title, which would make them the second most  successful club after eight-time champions Al Ahly of Egypt.
Also on Saturday record eight-time title-holders Al Ahly earned a 1-1 draw in Tanzania with Young Africans.
Guided by former Tottenham manager Martin Jol, the Cairo Red Devils took an early lead when Amr Gamal headed in after 11 minutes to give Ahly an away goal.
The home side responded eight minutes later, forcing an equaliser from an Ahmed Hegazi own-goal.
Ahly's great rivals Zamalek, guided by another ex-English Premier League boss, Alex McLeish, defeated debutants Mouloudia Bejaia of Algeria 2-0 in Cairo.
Mahmoud 'Kahraba' Abdel Moneim put Zamalek ahead just before the hour and they doubled the lead eight minutes from time via Ahmed Hamoudi.
Asec Mimosas of Ivory Coast made the most of home advantage to beat Al Ahly Tripoli of Libya 2-0.
Dao Youssouf put the Ivorians ahead after 59 minutes, with Aka Serge adding a second 10 minutes from time.
Al Merreikh of Sudan and Entente Setif of Algeria drew 2-2 as they met for the second successive season.
On Saturday, Merreikh went behind to a Eude Dagoulou strike after 15 minutes.
Raji Abdalati put the hosts level after 20 minutes, only for Abdelmoumene Djabou to give Setif the lead again just three minutes later.
But Abdalati ensured the first leg would end in a draw with his second of the game to make it 2-2.
Stade Malien had hopes of becoming the first qualifiers from Mali all but dashed after a shock 3-1 home loss to Zesco United of Zambia.
The game began promisingly for the hosts as Moussakoye Diallo scored, but  Mwape Mwelwa levelled before half-time and Idris Ilunga bagged a late brace.
