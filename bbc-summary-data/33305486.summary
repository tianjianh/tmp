Trudy Jones, 51, from Blackwood, who was on holiday with friends, is thought to have been on the beach in Sousse when a gunman began firing on Friday.
Her four children said she was their rock, while friends described her as "adorable" and "fun loving".
Jac Randell, originally from Cardiff, said hotel staff in the resort were "prepared to take the bullets for us".
A statement from Ms Jones' family read: "Our mother of all people didn't deserve this, such a caring person who put everyone else before herself.
"She was the rock of our family and kept us all going. None of us have a clue how we're going to cope without her."
They described Ms Jones, who worked at Highfields Nursing Home, as "always willing to help others".
"She'll be missed by so many people," they said in the statement, issued via Gwent Police.
"She loved everyone around her including all of the people she cared for at work.
"We are all devastated and would appreciate if everyone can respect our privacy."
Colin Thomas, who has a brother in the care home where Ms Jones worked, said people remained in a state of shock over her death.
"She couldn't do enough for the inpatients up there," he said.
"She was just adorable. Everybody liked her - to see this happening is just terrible."
Hairdresser Ceri Lock described how she had done Ms Jones's hair just before she went to Tunisia.
"She was really looking forward to her holiday, she just couldn't wait to go," she said.
"She was always a fun-loving person, always wanted to help people.
"She was like a bottle of pop - she was always smiling - it's so, so sad.
"I think it has affected the whole village, the whole neighbourhood."
Another holidymaker, Jac Randell was in Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire.
Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back.
"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel," he said.
"They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough."
Mr Randell and Ms Nicklin, who live in Warrington, Cheshire, said it made them feel sick to think someone had been "watching and waiting to attack" while they were on the beach.
Ms Nicklin said: "I genuinely believed we were going to die. I genuinely believed that was it."
First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to the families of those who have been affected by the tragedy.
It has been confirmed 18 British are among the dead.
Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has reported links with Islamic State (IS), opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday.
More details have emerged of the attack, which saw Rezgui shoot at people on the beach near the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels.
He entered at least one of the hotel lobbies, where grenades were also detonated.
He then walked through the streets of Sousse where he was reportedly chased by local Tunisians, firing shots at them.
It has also been reported that local builders threw rubble down at him from rooftops as he passed by in the street. The attack eventually ended when he was shot dead by police.
Many British tourists returned on Saturday on special flights while the two scheduled flights to Cardiff arrived on Sunday.
An RAF C17 transport plane left Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Monday at lunchtime bound for Tunisia to help evacuate casualties.
All Britons injured in the attack will be returned to the UK within 24 hours, Downing Street said.
