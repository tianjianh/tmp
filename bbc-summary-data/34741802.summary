The BBC's John Sweeney, who led the search for five-year-old Azam, tweeted the news.
Azam had travelled ahead of his parents with an uncle and was seriously injured during the journey.
His story sparked the social media campaign #FindAzam.
Azam was not the only member of the family to be injured while making the journey from Syria to Europe.
His reunion with his parents on Thursday took place in a German hospital, where his father is being treated for a broken leg that he sustained during the journey through Greece.
John Sweeney met Azam in Serbia in September while making a documentary about the refugee trail for the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama.
The boy was crying in pain because a car had run him over while he was asleep, breaking his jaw.
But before completing his treatment in Belgrade, Azam vanished with his uncle.
For the BBC Newsnight programme, Sweeney retraced the steps of the refugee trail that Azam and his uncle took, travelling from Serbia to Hamburg where the child was eventually found by a BBC team after a long search involving the crucial use of social media.
The uncle told the BBC that a splinter had entered Azam's eye during shelling in Damascus and he was asked by the child's parents to take him as speedily as possible to Germany for it to be treated.
He said that he was forced to take the child out of hospital in Serbia because the priority was to get him to Germany as quickly as possible.
