North Yorkshire Police said 600 bottles of wine had been taken from a warehouse in Langbar, near Ilkley, at some point on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.
The haul included 300 bottles of expensive French wine, the force said.

Officers are appealing for anyone with information about the theft, or who is offered wine for sale in suspicious circumstances, to contact them.
