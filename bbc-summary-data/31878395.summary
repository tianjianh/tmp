Ms Randerson, a UK government minister in the Wales Office, was speaking to mark the launch of Wales Tourism Week.
Last year, 84 million tourism day visits were made by British residents to Wales, spending Â£2.5bn.
And there were 121,400 employed in the tourism sector - 9,000 more since 2010.
"Wales has some of the best beaches, landscapes, castles and cuisine in the UK," said Ms Randerson.
"We need good roads and a strong rail network for the industry to continue to thrive.
"The UK government has already invested in the rail infrastructure but we need to work in partnership with Welsh businesses and the tourism industry to make the improvements needed to grow our economy in the future."
There are plans for a Â£1bn motorway relief road for the M4 in south Wales along with a metro system serving Cardiff and south east Wales, while there have been calls to improve the A55 in north Wales.
The London Paddington and Swansea train line will also be electrified.
