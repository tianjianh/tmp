[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Harbinson, 42, of Benfleet, Essex, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with conspiracy to burgle.
The contents of 56 safe deposit boxes were taken from the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over Easter weekend.
Eight other men aged 48 to 76 appeared in court on Thursday charged with conspiracy to burgle.
Mr Harbinson, a taxi driver and father-of-three, is next due to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 4 June with the other men.
They have all been remanded in custody until their next court appearance.
Those who were previously charged are:
They were arrested after police raided 12 properties in London and Kent on Tuesday.
Brian Reader and Paul Reader - who is also known as Brian - are believed to be father and son.
At their court hearing on Thursday, the prosecution said that while the total value of the goods stolen was not yet known, it ran "in excess of Â£10m" and 73 safe deposit boxes in total had been opened.
Heavy cutting equipment was used to break into a vault at the building in London's jewellery quarter.
The Met's Flying Squad has also apologised after it emerged a security firm's call about an intruder alert at the premises shortly after midnight on Good Friday was deemed not to require a response.
