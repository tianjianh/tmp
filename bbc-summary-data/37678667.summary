A grandmother has described how the victim of a paramilitary-style shooting in west Belfast knocked on her door asking for help after the attack.

The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, said it happened just before 20:00 BST on Sunday.
She said the man was dressed in dark clothes and asked her to call an ambulance.
"It was a terrible shock. You just don't know who you're answering the door to," she said.
The shooting happened at Glenwood Drive, Poleglass.
The victim, a 56-year-old man, is in a stable condition in hospital.
The woman told BBC News she was waiting for her grandson to come over when the man came to her door and said there were lots of children in the area.
"I didn't get much sleep, I've been up all night with my stomach churning," she said.
"It doesn't bear thinking about if the kids had seen the shooting."
The woman said she and a neighbour tended to the man while waiting for the ambulance, which she said arrived quickly and took him away.
She said she does not think the man was local to her area.
Stephen Magennis, a Sinn FÃ©in councillor, said the man had been shot "five or six times in the leg".
"I've said for a long time now regarding punishment attacks that no guns at all should be brought onto the streets," he said.
"The message needs to come loud and clear in the community and hopefully these groups will listen."
