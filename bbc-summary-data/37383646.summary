Tony Pulis says the only way he will stop being West Brom manager is if he is sacked by the club's new owners.

China's Yunyi Guokai Sports Development Limited completed their takeover of the Premier League club on Thursday.
Pulis, whose position has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, said he was "pleased" the deal had been finalised.
However, the 58-year-old added: "I won't be leaving. If I leave, it will be the club's decision for me to leave, it won't be my decision."
Pulis, who has a year left on his contract, was disappointed the Baggies failed to land some of his preferred transfer targets this summer but chose not to quit.
"I've signed a contract and I'm going to see that contract through," he said, adding that he was "not worried" about his contract running out.
"If we sit down and talk about a new contract we do, if we don't, we don't," he continued.
"It doesn't change my view, my perspective or my attitude to doing my job.
"Every day I wake up I realise and understand how lucky I am to be in this game, irrespective of all the criticism you get or don't get. I'm a very fortunate lad and every day I'm in it I'm lucky."
Pulis thinks the club's new owners will run the club in a similar way to former owner Jeremy Peace.
"They've bought into Jeremy's model," said Pulis. "I think they are going to try to run it on similar lines. I still think Jeremy is going to be involved a little bit.
"[Chief executive] John Williams has moved in as chairman so there will still be that continuity."
Asked if he had spoken to the new owners, Pulis said: "That will come, I think."
