League One pacesetters Burton Albion had their lead at the top of the table cut to a point after being held by a resolute Sheffield United side.

Burton edged a cagey first half lacking noteworthy chances in which Nasser El Khayati posed the biggest threat.
The Dutch striker continued to shine after the break but blasted a great opportunity over after a flowing move.
But the Blades also went close as the game opened up, with Billy Sharp twice testing keeper Jon McLaughlin.
Martyn Woolford also had an effort saved by McLaughlin near the end, but neither side could find a winner.
Walsall's victory at Scunthorpe saw them move to within a point of Burton, while Sheffield United remain in sixth place.
Burton boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told BBC Radio Derby:

"We were not desperate and going out of our positions to score the goal because when you do that you get a goal against and all of a sudden you need two goals.
"The discipline was very important and it was about 'ok, if we can't score we can't score, they are definitely not going to score' and that's being very professional."
