Staff in the sterilisation and disinfection units at some south Wales hospitals have suspended strike action due to go ahead on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They had been set to walk out in a row over pay with Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU).
Unison said the suspended strike would "allow for consideration of the board's latest offer."
The health board has been asked to comment.
About 80 staff staged a 24-hour walk-out on 25 January. Another strike due to take place on 1 February was halted.
Unison have said affected members wanted "pay parity" with colleagues doing the same job in other hospitals in Wales.
