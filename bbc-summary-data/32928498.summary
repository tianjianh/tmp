Homeowner Clive Hunter told the Bath Chronicle, his wife Jane was sitting "right next to the window" when the car crashed through "inches away".
The BMW 320 hit the house on Southlands, at the bottom of Lansdown Lane, just after 23:40 BST on Thursday.
The male driver of the car escaped serious injury and no-one in the house was hurt, police said.
The crash comes just months after a tipper truck crashed further up Lansdown Lane, leaving four people dead, including a four-year-old girl.
