Aftermath of damning report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The aftermath of the damning report into standards of care at the Tawel Fan mental health ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital throws the debate about the state of the Welsh NHS into sharp focus.

The Welsh government's deputy health minister Vaughan Gething has warned his opponents not to treat the report's findings as a political triumph.
This is likely to be treated with disdain by the other parties. They know they can keep up intense pressure on the grounds of accountability.
Mr Gething has also tried to walk the tightrope of expressing unhappiness with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, while knowing that ultimate responsibility lies with the political leadership at the Welsh government.
This gets to the heart of the matter. A key question here is to what extent should ministers be responsible for all of the care in all of the wards across Wales.
Behind the scenes, there is frustration felt by the Welsh government that when there is a problem at a hospital in England the blame tends to rest with the local management, while in Wales the blame goes straight to the highest levels of government.
This is the latest in a long list of high-profile problems with services operated by the board running hospitals across north Wales.
On the weekend, Vaughan Gething said Betsi Cadwalader was under no illusions about what was expected of them which sounds to me like managers have been read the riot act.
But Wales is too small for the government here to simply blame the management in the way that tends to happen in England, and ministers are aware of that.
What Vaughan Gething is also attempting to do is isolate the problem.
This could be a more effective strategy because clearly the awful accounts included in the report are not being felt by most patients in most hospitals, including mental health wards.
This is the most widely used defence by government ministers to problems in the NHS, and an attempt to cross the bridge between many of the positive personal experiences people have and their perception of the NHS.
What helps the Welsh government is that the opposition parties can't agree on the best way forward.
The Welsh Conservatives are renewing their call for an independent inquiry into the overall state of the NHS.
The Liberal Democrats have focused on the watchdog Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. Their leader in Wales Kirsty Williams has said scrapping it should be considered.
So while ministers are coming under pressure about the standards of care at one mental health ward, they are facing calls to respond in different ways.
