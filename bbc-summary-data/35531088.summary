Storm Imogen, which battered parts of the UK on Monday, is thought to have been partly responsible for spreading a fire that destroyed a house and several classic cars.

A blaze started in a garage in Thorney, near Peterborough, at about 18:00 GMT and spread to the house next to it.
The house in The Causeway was gutted by the accidental fire and several cars including a Rolls Royce were destroyed.
The fire service said the blaze was "exacerbated by strong winds".
One man was treated by an ambulance crew at the scene after inhaling smoke and was taken to hospital.

It took about 60 firefighters almost four hours to bring the blaze under control.
It started in the garage and "rapidly spread... to the house owing to the strong winds and a fuel tank becoming involved in the fire," Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
Group commander Sean Brown said: "This was a particularly difficult fire to tackle which was exacerbated by strong winds, cylinders in the garage and the need for a large water supply.
"Sadly the fire has completely destroyed the garage, its contents and the adjoining house."
The building is owned by Classic Wedding Cars, which has a fleet of nine classic and vintage cars including a 1929 Ford A, a 1937 American Studebaker and a 1962 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud.
It is not known how many vehicles were destroyed in the blaze.
