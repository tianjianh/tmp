Children's homes staff qualifications concern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost half of the children's homes in Wales are failing to meet minimum Welsh government standards for the number of properly qualified staff.

A BBC Wales investigation has found that 49 of the 100 homes are not meeting the benchmark of 80%.
Chief executive of Youth Cymru, Helen Mary Jones, said a lack of qualified employees puts the children and staff "in a very risky position".
The Welsh government said it invests Â£8m a year in social care training.
In 2014, there were at least 550 children in residential child care settings in Wales.
Employees in these homes must have the relevant diploma in health and social care or a similar qualification recognised by the Care Council for Wales (CCW).
If they do not have this qualification, they have three years to complete it and at least 80% of staff in each home must have it.
Ms Jones said: "It's been set because it is regarded as the minimum standard to properly provide for the needs of those children. I'd like to stress that these are likely to be some of the most vulnerable children."
However, some who work in the sector said the standard is out of date.
Director of Genus Care, which runs children's homes in Wales, Gareth Hemming, said: "I've got people who have got degrees that they've spent three years studying all aspects of youth work and children and yet their qualification isn't cross referenced by the Care Council for Wales so they've got to go back to college and do their level-three diploma."
The Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales said it takes enforcement action where it thinks services are being compromised and there is a risk to the wellbeing of children.
Mr Hemming said the company achieved the 80% target by paying for staff training and offering bonuses to those who became qualified as quickly as possible.
Director of standards and regulation for CCW, Gerry Evans, said: "What happens is that people come into the sector, they achieve the qualification but then move on to work in other places and then are replaced by people who haven't got the qualification."
The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Dr Sally Holland, added: "We shouldn't be treating it the same as stacking supermarket shelves, for example, in terms of pay and conditions.
"I think we need to be saying to those workers 'we value you and we will pay you to do a really good job'."
A Welsh government spokesman said it has a "robust framework for the regulation of children's residential homes" and is currently reforming its approach to regulation.
