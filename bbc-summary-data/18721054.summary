Operation Tornado is a scheme involving scrap metal recyclers, designed to crack down on the stealing and selling on of metals such as copper and lead.
Scrap yards that have signed up to the voluntary scheme require a passport, national identity card or photo driving licence, as well as proof of address from dealers.
