12 November 2014: Two more Sheffield United patrons - 1960s pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham - resign. Sheffield United shirt sponsor DBL Logistics says it will end its association with the club if they re-sign Evans, while Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - the MP for Sheffield Hallam - reiterates his earlier statement that footballers have a "public responsibility to set an example for other people".

2 January 2015: Maltese side Hibernians say they want to sign the Wales striker on a deal until the end of the season and have made him an offer.
3 January 2015: The Evans camp deny any offer from Hibernians, while a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson says strict conditions imposed on sex offenders "effectively rules out working abroad".

Manager Lee Johnson says Oldham are in "a very difficult situation" and it would be "a board decision" if Evans is signed.
6 January 2015: A woman who started a petition against Evans's proposed move to Oldham says the player "doesn't know what rape is". The attorney general's office is considering whether Evans's website, on which he maintains his innocence, breaches contempt of court laws.

10 January 2015: Oldham director Barry Owen says he has "no regrets" over the club's attempt to sign Evans - explaining that the approach was "driven by football reasons" and its failure "came down purely to finances".
