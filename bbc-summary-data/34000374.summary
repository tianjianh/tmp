The final work of broadcaster Gerry Anderson has been shown on BBC One Northern Ireland on the eve of the anniversary of his death.

Gerry died on 21 August last year after a long battle with illness. He was 69.
A City Dreaming, a film of his memories of his hometown Londonderry - or Stroke City, as he called it - was aired on Thursday at 21:00 BST.
Written and narrated by Gerry, it uses archive footage to tell the story of the city as he saw it.
The film charts the city's rises and falls over the course of a half a century, touching on everything from Luftwaffe bombings to Amelia Earhart's unexpected landing to first civil rights protests.
It has been shown at film festivals around the world, and was screened in Belfast for the first time earlier this year.
The film's director Mark McCauley said the television premiere was a "wonderful chance to hear Gerry again in full flow".
"He just had a wonderful way with words, he really enjoyed life," Mr McCauley said.
"He wasn't a man for great formality or sticking by the rules. We love that type of character and he was the embodiment and the spirit of that.
"We're all missing him terribly."
Gerry's family have said it has been a "difficult year" since his death.
But the "continuous outpouring of support from friends and fans" had been a great source of comfort, they added.
"In many ways it has been hard to accept that Gerry, the husband, father and grandfather, is no longer with us," his family said.
"We are just now able to start looking at and uncovering the wonderful writings and works he left behind, and with them he has left a wonderful legacy for his grandchildren.
"We still miss him and love him and always will."
A City Dreaming is available to watch again on the BBC iPlayer.
