The 16ft (5m) hole appeared on Monday afternoon at the Hexagon Housing estate in Plumstead.
Residents were given assistance at a council-run rest centre and provided with overnight accommodation by the housing association.
It is not yet clear what caused the hole but structural engineers are working to secure the site.
Thirty households were able to return to their homes by Tuesday afternoon, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added: "Ten households will be notified once Hexagon Housing confirm that their properties are safe for residents to return."
