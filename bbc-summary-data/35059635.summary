After her Bercy arena concert on Wednesday, she tweeted she was heading to the Place de la Republique, which has become a shrine to those who died.
Madonna, who is in the city for her Rebel Heart tour, was filmed singing along with her 10-year-old son David.
She began by singing Ghosttown and then moved on to John Lennon's Imagine and her classic track Like A Prayer.
Madonna's surprise appearance in the city also saw her accompanied by guitarist Monte Pittman, who is currently on tour with the artist.
"She wanted to pay tribute, she loves this city," Pittman told AFP.  "It is magical. I will never forget this."
One hundred and thirty people were killed in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers carried out a series of attacks in the French capital.
Madonna told Wednesday night's onlookers: "Everybody knows why we're hereâ€¦ we just want to sing a few songs about peace, just to spread love and joy, and to pay our honour and respect to the people who died almost four weeks ago.
"And to spread lightâ€¦ we all need it."
Pete Hall, a British tourist, told AFP: "It was inspiring, it was raw, it was real.
"She was paying her respects to Paris."
Reaction on Twitter included praise from fan MadonnaEffect, who said: "Madonna yet again reminding me why she is my absolute IDOL.
"So proud of her, she is the gift that just keeps on giving."
At her concert earlier on Wednesday evening, Madonna had wrapped herself in the French flag and sang the country's national anthem, La Marseillaise.
She told the audience: "We will not bend down to fear. I think of what happened almost four weeks ago now. The heart of Paris and the heart of France beats in the heart of each city.
"I came here when I was 20 and it was here, in Paris, that I decided to make music. Thank you Paris for planting that seed in my heart."
