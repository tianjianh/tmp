Appeal after 'racist' boys run amok at Motherwell train station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Transport Police (BTP) want to trace a group of boys who ran amok at a rail station in North Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group racially abused a man at Motherwell station and let off a fire extinguisher. A woman was also spat on.
About 10 to 12 boys, aged between 14 and 17 years old, were involved just, after 18:45 on Wednesday.
The group was also involved in disorder after boarding the 18:20 Glasgow to Lanark service at Bellshill before getting off at Motherwell.
BTP said officers were reviewing CCTV images in a bid to identify those involved.
Det Con David Merchant said: "This sort of appalling behaviour is unacceptable and I am appealing for anyone who was on the train or at the station and can provide information which can help identify the youths responsible to contact BTP."
