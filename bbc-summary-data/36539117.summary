Back-row Cameron Thompson, 25, who played eight times for Albion last season, is the most experienced of the new signings.
He is joined by 19-year-old props Rory Briers and Curtis Reynolds.
Reynolds was part of Wasps' academy side and also played at Albion's National One rivals Old Albanians, while Briers is a Dutch under-18 international.
"Last season was frustrating for me as I picked up a groin injury shortly after getting into the team," said Thompson.
"On my comeback game I rolled my ankle which put me out for a further two months.
"It looks like Albion will be keeping the bulk of last season's squad and there is no reason why we can't be challenging at the top end of the table.
"On a personal note I'm now injury free and looking to make a fresh start. After a good pre-season I really want to be challenging for the number seven shirt."
