Rodrigo Duterte, known for his tough anti-crime approach, has claimed victory in the 9 May election.
His spokesman said he would also impose a "nationwide curfew" for children.
Official election results have not yet been announced, but Mr Duterte has an unassailable lead.
He has credited his success in the presidency campaign to his tough stance on law and order.
His record as the crime-crushing mayor of the southern town of Davao, once notorious for its lawlessness, earned him the moniker The Punisher and resonated with voters.
Among other measures in the city, he banned the sale of alcohol between midnight and 08:00.

His spokesman Peter Lavina told local media in Davao on Tuesday this could be extended across the country.
"Mr Duterte will impose a curfew on unescorted minors and might also impose a liquor ban in public places, upon consultation and a review of laws."
He said it had "nothing to do with denying us of our freedoms," and that the public would not be prohibited from drinking in their homes.
Mr Duterte's proposal sparked a lively reaction on social media.
"To all who voted Duterte, I hope you're ready to cut smoking, drink less alcohol, go home early and segregate trash," tweeted university student Glenn Ong from the capital Manila.
"All blood and no alcohol for a Duterte win," tweeted Hannah Garay. "Hope the ones who voted for him won't have a hard time swallowing this."
"You want a dictator? Well, you got one now," said Facebook user Angelica Mercurio from Cavite, who compared his actions to martial law rule.
"It may be for our own good but I just cant wait to see how bummed alcohol enthusiasts will be once Duterte comes into power," said Keiza Chan.
But other Filipinos came out in support of Mr Duterte's plan to end drinking on the streets.
Rojun Angeles from Manila said he was looking forward to the liquor ban. "Less crime, less accidents and less 'pokpoks'," he said, referring to prostitutes.
Anzel Deschanel, who voted for Mr Duterte in Iloilo province, said on the Facebook of Philippines news site GMA: "This is the reason why my vote went to him.
"I am sick of criminals and want a stop to crime on the streets so I welcome this ban. Children need to be staying indoors at night anyway for their safety. For a better Philippines!"
