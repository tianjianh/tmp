He was one of eight people detained by police in connection with alleged offences in and around the stadium.
The man has been charged under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act.
Police said they were also aware of an alleged racially motivated incident and inquiries were ongoing.
It is understood someone allegedly made a monkey gesture at Celtic player Scott Sinclair.
The 23-year-old man was expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Celtic won the game against Rangers 5-1.
A 30-year-old man was also arrested and detained in connection with offences under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act.
A 36-year-old man and a 16-year-old were detained for allegedly trying to enter the ground while drunk.
Another 16-year-old was charged in connection with the possession of alcohol within the stadium.
Two men, aged 34 and 53, and a 15-year-old were charged in connection with alleged breaches of the peace.
A Rangers spokesman said: "Rangers does not condone any form of unacceptable behaviour and the matter is now in the hands of Police Scotland."
Asked about the incident of a man allegedly running on to the pitch, Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers said: "I haven't seen it again, there was so much more happening in the game.
"It's not nice when something like that happens, but I only caught the tail end of it, really."
