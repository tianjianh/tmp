[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-0 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradley Barry scored his first goal of the season as he fired Swindon to a 1-0 victory over Port Vale at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry - the nephew of Everton midfielder Gareth Barry, who also found the net on Saturday - smashed into the roof of the net two minutes after half-time to celebrate his first senior goal.
The defeat for Port Vale ended their unbeaten start to the season and also stopped them registering a fourth consecutive clean sheet.
Swindon started the better of the two teams but had it not been for resilient defending from Lloyd Jones they could have gone in at half-time trailing.
Jones made a last-ditch tackle to block what looked to have been a certain goal from Port Vale striker JJ Hooper in the 33rd minute.
However, Port Vale switched off early in the second half to allow Michael Doughty to run down the wing and play the ball into Barry, who left Vale goalkeeper Jak Alnwick watching the ball as it soared into the roof of the net.
