A mental health unit previously criticised for mistreating patients has staffing problems and a ward "not fit for purpose", a report has found.

Patients at the Tawel Fan ward at the Ablett Unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire were treated "like animals in a zoo", a report in May found.
The latest inspection found Tegid ward provided a "caring approach" but was unable to meet patients' needs.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said progress was being made.
It added: "The report highlights a number of significant issues that we are working to address with urgency.
"Progress is being made, with six of the recommendations completed.  We are on schedule to deliver actions with a 31 October target date."
The Ablett Unit has four wards including Tawel Fan, which was closed in December 2013.
The three others, Cynnydd, Dinas and Tegid, were given an unannounced inspection in July by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, which found "significant environmental issues on the unit".
Inspectors found problems with the layout and decoration of Tegid ward, which caters for older people, including cramped eating areas, dirty and worn dining chairs and insufficient space for wheelchair users.
The report noted staffing level problems on Tegid and Dinas wards which had the potential to compromise patient safety.
Inspectors also found male patients could be put in the female area on Tegid ward due to bed shortages.
However they reported positive improvements since a 2014 inspection, including the appointment of an activities co-ordinator which had "really helped by enhancing the social and recreational activities for patients".
The inspectors made more than 20 recommendations, saying: "The significant environmental issues identified on Tegid ward clearly highlighted that the ward was not fit for purpose and was unable to meet the needs of the patient group.
"The health board must review and address the concerns and provide assurance of long and short term provision."
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board was placed in special measures in June after the original report was published.
