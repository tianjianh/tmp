Fire crews were called to Balhousie Clement Park Care Home, in Clement Park Place, at about 01:20 where they found a small fire in a first floor bedroom.
The injured man was treated at the scene and then taken to hospital.
An investigation into the cause of the blaze is under way, however it is not being treated as suspicious.
A spokeswoman for Balhousie Care Group said sadly one of its residents had been injured and the group's thoughts were with the resident and his family.
She added: "The priority was, of course, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of residents and staff.
"A small number of residents were moved from their rooms to a place of safety inside the building, before being allowed to return to their bedrooms. No residents were evacuated outside.
"There were 48 residents in the building at the time, along with six staff members. Relatives are being contacted directly to update them on the situation."
