The Ecuadorian damaged his right fibula in a Europa League qualifying tie in July.
Valencia, 25, scored four goals in 32 Premier League games last season.
Midfielder Alex Song, 28, who is yet to make an appearance this season because of an ankle injury, is "a maximum of three weeks away", according to Bilic.
Valencia apologised to the club and its medical staff in August after claiming he had been "forgotten" by the Hammers in a radio interview after his injury.
Striker Andy Carroll, 26, and defender Angelo Ogbonna, 27, are available for Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace (15:00 BST) after recovering from injuries.
Left-back Aaron Cresswell, 25, and defender Winston Reid, 27, have minor knocks and are rated at 50/50 for Saturday.
