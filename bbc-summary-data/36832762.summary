A former St Louis Cardinals scouting director has been jailed for 46 months for hacking into a rival team's computer system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Correa, who illegally accessed Houston Astros' scouting reports and email system, must also pay $279,000 (£212,000) restitution.
The 35-year-old was sacked by the Cardinals last year after his arrest.
Correa pleaded guilty in January to five charges of unauthorised access of a protected computer.
The data breach was first reported in June 2014 when Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow, who used to work for the Cardinals, raised the issue.
Correa, reading a letter in court before he was sentenced, said he was "overwhelmed with remorse and regret for my actions".
"I violated my values and it was wrong," he said.
"I behaved shamefully. The whole episode represents the worst thing I've done in my life by far."
Correa admitted that from March 2013 until at least March 2014 he hacked into the Astros scouting database and staff email accounts to access confidential information.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Justice Department officials said the Astros lost about $1.7m (£1.29m) because of the hacking.
Major League Baseball (MLB) will wait to receive the case details from federal authorities before deciding on any action against the Cardinals.
