At least 11 people were shot dead at a girl's 15th birthday party in Mexico's Guerrero state, its governor says.

Hector Astudillo Flores said a disturbance occurred at the traditional coming-of-age party in Cundancito, in the west of the region.
After the shooting, authorities tried to reach the area but were met by gunfire, he said.
Two years ago, 43 students disappeared in Guerrero, which is one of Mexico's most violent states.
Figures compiled by the La Jornada newspaper found that at least 324 people were murdered in Guerrero between October and December last year, most related to the drug trade.
Mr Astudillo, who said details of the case would be passed to Mexico's attorney general, did not say whether arrests were made in Cundancito.
