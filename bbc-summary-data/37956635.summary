Hanagan, 36, was announced as Sheikh Hamdan's first-choice rider in 2012 after the retirement of Richard Hills.
The alliance came to an end with two rides at Wolverhampton on Friday.
"Sheikh Hamdan is a true gentleman," said the Warrington-born jockey. "It's been a privilege to ride for him."
Hanagan was crowned champion jockey in 2010 and 2011 before he was appointed by Sheikh Hamdan, a member of Dubai's ruling family.
"It is too early to say what my plans are for the future, but I will continue to work as hard as ever," said the jockey.
Hanagan is close friends with Freddy Tylicki, 30, who was paralysed from the waist down following a four-horse pile-up at Kempton on 31 October.
"I am sure that I speak for everyone when I say that we are all praying for him," said Hanagan.
