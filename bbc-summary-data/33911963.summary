About 15,000 party members and 6,000 affiliated and registered members are entitled to take part in the ballot.
MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh are vying for the role vacated by former MP Jim Murphy in June.
Members will also vote in the Scottish party's deputy leadership race which is being contested by Richard Baker, Alex Rowley and Gordon Matheson.
Both Ms Dugdale and Mr Macintosh have been making their final pitches to voters.
If she was elected leader, 33-year-old Ms Dugdale said she would start rebuilding trust in Labour straight away.
The Lothians list MSP explained: "If I win this election it will be a clear signal of a new generation ready to take Scottish Labour forward.
"The role of the next leader is to set out a positive Labour vision for transforming Scotland and to hold the SNP Government to account for their major failings on schools, the NHS and policing."

Ms Dugdale added: "Too many people in Scotland tell us that they just don't know what Labour stands for anymore. Under my leadership there will be no doubt what we stand for and who we stand with."
Mr Macintosh, who is MSP for the constituency of Eastwood, said he wanted to offer the Scottish people "hope again".
The 53-year-old added: "I want to transform the Scottish Labour Party into a positive force for real change in Scotland.
"Throughout this leadership contest, I have spoken in detail about the changes I will make, about the new leadership style and approach to politics I will bring as party leader.
"Above all, my message to undecided members is simple: I'm asking for your support as I believe I have the ideas, the vision and the determination to help Labour win again."
Party members will find out who their Scottish leader is at an event in Stirling on Saturday.
Mr Murphy resigned as Scottish Labour leader after the party lost 40 of its 41 seats in the Westminster election in May.
As well as the contest in Scotland, party members are also in the process of choosing their next UK leader.
MPs Jeremy Corbyn, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper are fighting for the post, the winner of which will be announced during a special conference on 12 September.
