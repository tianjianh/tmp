Former England captain Borthwick, 37, has reportedly been approached by Lions coach Warren Gatland, along with Ireland's defence coach Andy Farrell.
England head coach Eddie Jones said: "I'm happy for all of my coaching team except me to be involved."
The Lions will play three Tests against New Zealand in June and July next year.
Borthwick, who won 57 caps for England between 2001 and 2010, joined Jones' coaching team in December 2015.
England beat Fiji on Saturday for their 11th win from 11 games under Jones and are next scheduled to face the All Blacks in 2018.
"If they (his coaching team) are offered a job I will encourage them to take the job and get down there and work out how to beat New Zealand because that is one of our aims. They can help us and the Lions," the Australian said.
"What a great opportunity to spend six weeks in New Zealand on the Lions tour.
"Ten weeks of hearing 'bro' seven million times and getting to understand everything about New Zealand rugby."
England scored nine tries in their 58-15 over Fiji at Twickenham, a performance Jones described as "good fish and chips", a reference to the traditional style he said his side would play with before the match.
"It doesn't mean fish and chips is basic," he said.
"I thought we played some sparkling rugby, really good stuff. The ball movement, crispness of passing was fantastic.
"To score 58 points against Fiji is outstanding because they are a fair team, so I'm really happy with aspects of our game."
Winger Semesa Rokoduguni scored two tries against Fiji - on his second England appearance - as did Jonathan Joseph and Joe Launchbury, while fly-half George Ford also impressed.
"Rokoduguni has definitely got a smile on his face," said Jones.
"I'm really pleased for him because he worked hard to get this chance. He got a lot of reward for the hard work he's done.
"Some of George Ford's alignment on some of the phase ball was absolutely outstanding, the best I have seen for a long time.
"We are not going to play the perfect game - everyone wants to play the perfect game, when you play the perfect game you can retire. We haven't done that."
Elsewhere on Saturday, Wales needed an 80th-minute drop-goal from Sam Davies to beat Japan 33-30.
And Jones, who coached Japan from 2012 to 2015, said it was "not a good result for Wales".
"The Japanese cry when they win and they cry when they lose, so there will be plenty of tears," he said.
"It's a fantastic result for them and Wales were obviously complacent again.
"You look at the side Wales put out, they shouldn't be winning by three points against a Japanese team that has seven or eight new caps."
