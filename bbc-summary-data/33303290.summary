NI construction industry 'haemorrhaging jobs'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's construction industry is "haemorrhaging jobs" and the impasse at Stormont is a cause of concern, a construction expert said.

Stephen Kane told the BBC's Inside Business programme that there was uncertainty in the sector.
"We recently went out to survey our members," he said.
"Thirty associations all reported back that they would see a negative impact on employment, their turnover and investment in the future."
Mr Kane, chair of the Construction Industry Group of Northern Ireland, said the Stormont impasse was causing "quite a concern".
"Also, a lot of them don't have that much work here in Northern Ireland left for the next three to six months.
"Most importantly very few of them have any work past 12 months."
