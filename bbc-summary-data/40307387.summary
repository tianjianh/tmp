Wayne Bulpitt, UK chief commissioner of the Scout Association from 2009-16, was one of four Guernsey residents recognised in this year's honours.
He introduced the alternative promise, welcoming all young people regardless of their faiths or religious beliefs.
Mr Bulpitt said it was "a privilege and an honour" to be recognised.
"If I've been able to help today's generation and future generations... I think that in itself is the only reward I think many volunteers would ask for," he said.
"As I've said many times before, scouting and in particular, the volunteers who make it happen, gave me the skills I needed to succeed in life.
"Any success I may have achieved, in whatever field, is down to those volunteers, and so it has been very satisfying to be able to help future generations in similar ways myself, especially in recent times when the needs are even greater."
Judge Russell Finch was also recognised in the honours, and was appointed an OBE for services to the judiciary in Guernsey.
He said the nomination was a surprise, adding: "You can't count on anything and it came to me out of the blue."
Businessman Stephen Landsdown was made a CBE for services to business and the community.
Lilan Bale, who was made an MBE for services to fostering, said the award was "humbling" for something she loved to do after her own troubled childhood.
"I felt called to do it," she said.
Beatrice Webber was also awarded the British Empire Medal for services to the blind on the island.
