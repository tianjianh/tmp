"I'm excited about the opportunity to test myself in the Southern Hemisphere," he said.
"Hopefully I can add value to the Rebels, and help the team continue the great growth and profile of rugby in Victoria."
Parling began his career with Newcastle Falcons, and also had a six-year spell with Leicester Tigers where he won two Premiership titles, before joining Exeter in 2015.
"Geoff's signing is a strategic recruitment for the club as we look to evolve our squad and program for 2018 and beyond," Rebels chief executive Baden Stephenson told the club website.
