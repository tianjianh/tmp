The bomb was planted at a bus stop near a market in the town of Matani, about 20km (12 miles) south of Peshawar, police commanders told news agencies.
Matani is close to Pakistan's lawless tribal regions and the Afghan border.
It is not clear who carried out the attack but Pakistan has been battling Islamist militants and its own version of the Taliban.
At least 10 people were wounded in the attack in Matani.
It is the latest violence in Pakistan since the US special forces raid last month that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the north of the country.
It comes a day after reports that a top al-Qaeda operative, Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a US drone strike in the tribal region of South Waziristan.
Since Bin Laden was killed, a paramilitary academy, a naval base, government buildings, a police station and a US consulate convoy have been attacked.
