The traffic lights at Inverness's Longman Roundabout are to change quicker in an effort to ease congestion at the busy site on the A9.

The lights at the roundabout close to the Kessock Bridge have been the cause of frustration for motorists.
Transport Scotland four options to ease travel have been considered, including removing the lights.
However, it said speeding up the timing of the signals "was shown to deliver the best results".
Following consultation with Highland Council, the new timings will be trialled between mid-August and mid-September.
Transport Scotland's operating company manager, Jonny Moran, said: "We are very aware of the concerns of those who use the Longman Roundabout and we want to address these to improve conditions for road users.
"Our analysis has shown that changing the timings of the signals will have a positive effect on traffic flows and we will trial the new approach at the end of the summer.
"Many people in the area have told us that they want the lights to be switched off permanently and we did consider this option.
"However, the assessment showed that the timing changes that we intend to trial delivered better results for all road users, especially at peak times."
Mr Moran said the trial would be monitored and then evaluated before a decision was made on the future operation of the lights.
He added: "We very much appreciate the patience of those who use the roundabout during this process.
"It does take time to collect the information required to make any changes as we have a responsibility to maintain road safety and an evidence based approach is the most effective way of doing that."
A flyover to take traffic crossing the Kessock Bridge up and over the roundabout has been proposed as part of the Inverness City Region Deal, which was announced in March.
