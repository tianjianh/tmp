The 37-year-old, who stopped playing one-day international matches earlier this year, lost his place to Peter Nevill during Australia's 3-2 Ashes defeat by England in July.
He will also stop playing for his domestic state team New South Wales, but will continue in the Twenty20 Big Bash League for the Sydney Sixers.
"I've enjoyed the 17 years and am comfortable with my decision," he said.
"I've had a privileged run, but I lost the hunger on the Ashes tour. It was an easy decision to retire."
Haddin, first capped in 2001 in an ODI, played 66 Tests, 126 one-day internationals and 34 Twenty20s for his country.
He is the fourth Australian to retire in the wake of the Ashes defeat following captain Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers and Shane Watson, with the latter still available for limited-overs cricket.
Having had to wait until the age of 30 to make his Test debut because of Adam Gilchrist's prowess, Haddin played a starring role in Australia's 5-0 Ashes triumph in 2013-14, scoring 493 runs at 61.62.
He helped Australia win the World Cup in March, before announcing his retirement from ODIs in May.
He played in the first Ashes Test match defeat by England in Cardiff in July, but missed the second Test at Lord's to spend time with his ill daughter Mia.
Having made himself available for the third Test, Australia's selectors chose to stick with Nevill, drawing criticism from former players including Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting.
Haddin then flew home for family reasons before the fifth Test at The Oval.
