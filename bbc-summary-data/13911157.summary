AFC Wimbledon have confirmed they have signed defender Mat Mitchel-King from Crewe Alexandra.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 6' 4" centre-half was released by Crewe at the end of last season.
A former Histon team-mate of current Dons' players Jack Midson and Gareth Gwillim, Mitchel-King suffered back and hernia injuries last season.
The 27-year-old, who can also play in midfield, underwent an extensive medical before Wimbledon completed the signing.
Mitchel-King made 147 appearances for Histon, and was a member of the side that beat Leeds United in the FA Cup in November 2008. After moving to Crewe in June 2009 he was made captain, and made 46 appearances before injuries interrupted his progress.
Wimbledon have also confirmed they have taken up contract options on forward Luke Moore and defender Fraser Franks.
