Union warns against more Police Scotland cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The union representing Scotland's police officers has said the force can take no more operational cuts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chairman of the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) made the warning at the body's annual conference.
It comes after the chief constable of Police Scotland said cuts of Â£10.8m were needed over the next 12 months.
Scottish leaders from the four main political parties will be speaking at the event which marks the second anniversary of the single force.
On Tuesday, Police Scotland chief constable Sir Stephen House said savings could be achieved, but it would take "extreme measures".
SPF chairman Brian Docherty dismissed this as "fanciful nonsense".
He told the conference in South Ayrshire: "Expecting the police to do more with less is fanciful nonsense.
"All that can be delivered with less, is less."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson addressed members of the SPF, which represents 98% of Scottish police officers.
She told the conference her party would scrap automatic early release for prisoners and supported whole-life terms for certain forms of murder, including that of police officers.
Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said a lack of resources for support staff meant meticulous police work was coming to nothing.
He said Labour's plans to increase taxes for those earning more than Â£150,000 a year would help raise money to tackle the problem.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie were also due to speak at the event at the Trump Turnberry Resort.
The conference follows the publication of a critical report into the use of non-statutory or "consensual" stop-and-search by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland and a second report on the issue by Police Scotland.
The Scottish government responded by setting up a new advisory group to examine the use of stop-and-search powers in Scotland.
It will present recommendations by August so that any legislation needed can be included in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
