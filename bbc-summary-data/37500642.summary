Matalan workers Zoe Morgan, 21, and Lee Simmons, 33, were found dead close to the store on Queen Street at about 05:50 BST on Wednesday.
Police said Andrew Saunders, 20, of Castleton, was arrested within an hour of their bodies being found.
He will appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on Friday morning.
In a tribute, Miss Morgan's family described her as a "beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter and auntie who had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody."
The statement continued: "She was taken away from us tragically, too soon, and has left a massive hole in our lives that will never be filled. Zoe will always be in our hearts forever and always. We are all broken hearted. xx"
Det Supt Ceri Hughes of South Wales Police said: "What happened to Zoe and Lee is an absolute tragedy. Their families are devastated.
"Our thoughts remain with them. This has shocked the community of Cardiff."
She asked anyone who saw what happened to contact the force and said anyone traumatised by what they saw would be offered support.
Matalan staff in Cardiff attended a tearful meeting on Thursday and former colleagues of the couple later went outside to look at the many floral tributes which have been left.
The store remained closed for a second day on Thursday but will reopen on Friday.
Former University of South Wales fashion student Miss Morgan, of Llandaff North, worked as a visual merchandiser at the store, while Mr Simmons, of Grangetown, was a sales assistant.
The pair had been in a relationship since July.
The discovery of Miss Morgan and Mr Simmons's bodies closed part of the city centre street for several hours on Wednesday.
Some shops were also closed for much of the morning until police investigations were concluded and the street reopened at about 12:50.
