Glasgow Warriors' Mark Bennett will make his debut at outside centre and Adam Ashe will play at number eight.
"We've selected a group we believe can do the job against Argentina," said head coach Vern Cotter.
"There is a genuine desire for this squad and those selected for the Test to play well for the jersey."
On 17 November 2013, Jonny Gray made his debut for Scotland against South Africa, replacing brother Richie just after the hour mark.
Ten of the starting XV are made up of players selected from Glasgow Warriors, who have started the PRO12 campaign in blistering form with only one loss in seven matches this season.
"We have several performance-related themes, and have looked for people who have the ability to control games, take initiative, can pick up the ball and run with it, who like physical confrontation and can keep the ball alive," said Cotter.
"These are things that we have prioritised in our selection and we're now all looking forward to getting out there and putting in a good performance in front of the Scottish people on Saturday."
On debutant Bennett, Cotter added: "I really appreciate what Mark has done because he has been very patient and has been developing his performances week in, week out for Glasgow Warriors.
"Patience and working hard is what you want from your players.
"You can see his determination in the way he breaks the line and scores tries. I'm really pleased he's developed that over the last couple of years and will now make his debut for his country, which is a very special achievement."
The Gray brothers will support an experienced front-row trio of Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford and Euan Murray, who share a total of 173 caps going into the game.
The forwards are completed by the back-row combination of flankers Rob Harley and Blair Cowan forming a unit with Ashe for the first time.
In the backs, all but one player - captain Greig Laidlaw - have been picked from the Warriors' attacking stable, with Finn Russell the half-back partner at stand-off, and Alex Dunbar starting alongside Bennett in midfield.
The back three of Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland and Tommy Seymour in the wide channels complete the side.
Cotter reaffirmed his desire to empower his players' attacking form, adding: "When the players run out they'll do it with a lot of pride and a lot of respect.
"There will be a common cause to have the confidence to attack and take the initiative against Argentina, which is arguably the most improved country in the world.
"We'll try and put a cohesive effort out there technically and tactically, but I can assure you the players are, emotionally, very attached and are working extra hard to put in a good performance.
"So let's be strong, let's be passionate as we always are; play for the people that come to the stadium and the Scots in this country and around the world."
