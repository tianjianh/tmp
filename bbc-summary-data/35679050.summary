The North Down MLA was speaking at the Greens' annual conference in Belfast on Saturday.
The Green Party will field candidates in all 18 constituencies for the first time.
Mr Agnew is currently the party's only assembly member.
However, he said the Greens were going into the election in a confident mood.
"We're expecting not just an increase in Green Party votes, but an increase in Green Party seats and an increase in change we can achieve at the other side of the Assembly elections," he said.
In his conference speech, Mr Agnew said the party was standing for "zero waste", in terms of both the environment and inefficiency at Stormont.
He told delegates: "Waste is what's holding back Northern Ireland from prosperity."
Mr Agnew also criticised changes to the welfare system, saying "some of the poorest people in society will have a further cut to their income".
He added that he was "very saddened" by this.
However, he suggested the deal on welfare in the Fresh Start Agreement in November 2015 was better than that agreed in the Stormont House Agreement the previous year.
The Green Party leader claimed his examination of the figures had "brought honesty to the discussion" on welfare.
Mr Agnew said that during his five years as leader the party had gone through an "incredible" change, with membership trebling and the Green vote doubling in Westminster elections.
He said the party had taken a "radical step" in achieving 50-50 gender balance in their list of assembly candidates.
He told the conference: "Our list of candidates reflect society as it is - and more importantly - reflects the assembly as it should be."
More than one hundred people attended the conference at a hotel in Belfast city centre, where delegates also passed a motion on the EU referendum.
It committed the Green Party in Northern Ireland to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU.
