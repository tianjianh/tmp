[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Town came from behind after being reduced to 10 men to rescue a point against League One leaders Scunthorpe United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took the lead late in the first half through Josh Morris' curling free-kick from the edge of the box.
Northampton had Matt Taylor sent off on the hour mark for a bad tackle on Scunthorpe midfielder Neal Bishop.
The Cobblers restored parity when Jak McCourt's initial shot was blocked, but he was on hand to tap in the rebound.
The result meant Scunthorpe remained at the top of the table, but saw their three-point cushion cut to just a point after second-placed Bradford City beat Shrewsbury 2-0.
Meanwhile, Northampton jumped two places to fifth in League One after recording a fourth draw away from home in the league this season.
At the end of an opening half with few chances, Morris scored 13th goal of the season and sixth in his last four consecutive games to give the Iron the lead.
Northampton's job was made harder when Taylor was sent off for the first time since February 2012 after he lunged in on Bishop, but McCourt scored his first goal in senior football to earn a point.
