James Stevens No 10 lifeboat sinks in Hayle Estuary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A restored lifeboat that saved 227 lives between 1899 and 1933 has sunk during the stormy weather that has been battering the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The James Stevens No 10 lifeboat, which served in St Ives, Cornwall, is said to be one of only two remaining boats of its kind.
The 35ft (10.6m) vessel was restored in 2002 and had been in use for pleasure trips around St Ives.
But it was seen submerged in Hayle Estuary on Wednesday morning.
Alex Pym was out walking his dog when he saw the boat at about 09:00 BST.
He said the lifeboat had previously been used for trips in St Ives harbour but had been moored in the estuary for at least a year.
It is not known who owns it.
The vessel was one of 20 bought by the RNLI in the late 1890s paid for with a legacy from James Stevens, a property developer from Birmingham.
The only other remaining James Stevens boat is the No 14, which is in regular use and maintained by the Frinton and Walton Heritage Trust in Essex.
