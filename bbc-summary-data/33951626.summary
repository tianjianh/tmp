Restrictions have been lifted following a case of bird flu at a Lancashire farm, the government has said.

An estimated 170,000 birds were culled after the disease emerged at a farm in Preston in July.
Farms within 10km (six miles) of the premises were not allowed to move poultry, captive birds or other livestock, except under licence.
The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said the bird flu was "contained to a single farm".
The movement restrictions at the Goosnargh farm - which produces table eggs - were lifted 21 days after initial cleaning and disinfection of the premises was completed.
It was the earliest point allowed under EU rules to end the controls, Defra said.
Chief vet Nigel Gibbens said: "Protecting our country from animal disease is vital for our economy."
He added the UK "remains at a constant low risk of an incident of avian influenza and this latest case should serve as a reminder for the poultry industry of the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity to minimise the risk of infection".
The high severity H7N7 strain of the disease was confirmed in chickens on 13 July but posed a very low risk to human health, a spokesman said.
Investigations suggested the most likely source of infection was contact with infected wild birds.
It was not linked to the strain found at a Hampshire farm earlier this year.
