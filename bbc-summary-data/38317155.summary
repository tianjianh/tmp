The crossing assistant, known as Sheila, at St Illtyd Primary School in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, was asked to stop earlier this week.
Parents have reacted with outrage at the move which is said to have come following two complaints.
Vale of Glamorgan council said there were guidelines crossing patrol staff needed to follow.
Grandparent Victoria Dixon â€Žtold BBC Wales: "It just seems so unfair. There's a special needs unit in St Illtyd's primary school and a lot of the children are very shy.
"They get a high-five from Sheila and it sets their day off. I think somebody has complained that it's taking too much time."
During the school run on Wednesday afternoon, one mum shouted "we love you Sheila" as she crossed the road.
Mrs Dixon described the lollipop lady as "inoffensive" and said she was "upset" over the issue.
She said she intended to speak to the council about having the move lifted.
Parent Rebecca Pearce said: "I think it's disgusting. It should be up to us parents to decide if she should have contact with the kids."
Emma Reed, the council's head of visible services and transport, said: "Like most councils our school crossing patrol teams operate in line with the Road Safety GB National Guidelines.
"These guidelines make clear that patrol officers should 'avoid any distractions or activities that could divert your attention from your important task of seeing pedestrians safely across the road' and should not remain in the road longer than is necessary as this causes undue delays to traffic.
"This is why after receiving complaints from members of the public we had to remind this member of our team of the importance of putting safety first at all times."
Lucy Heffernan: "I think it's ridiculous. She's doing her job and high-fiving the children as they walk past. It puts a smile on the children's faces.
David Dewhurst: "The world has gone PC mad. All she is doing is being pleasant for the children.
Nicola Griffiths: "The lovely lady is fabulous. It's a little bit silly."
