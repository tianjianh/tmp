Appeal over near miss after driver jumps road-block

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are searching for the driver of a silver Mercedes after the car breached a rolling road block on the A55 and nearly hit a traffic officer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened at about 14:00 BST on Monday between junctions nine and 10, near Parc Menai.
North and Mid Wales Trunk Road Agency officers set up the road block to help a man retrieve a fencing panel which had fallen off his roof.
North Wales Police said there were clear signs for drivers not to pass.
After ignoring the sign, the car slowed down for a moment before accelerating away westbound.
PC Dave Thomas said: "This was an extremely dangerous manoeuvre. To breach a rolling road block is an offence which in this case could have had disastrous consequences."
Any witnesses are asked to call 101.
