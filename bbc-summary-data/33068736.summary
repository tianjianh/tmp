Constable Daniel Woodall, 35, and another officer were shot while serving an arrest warrant at a home in west Edmonton on Monday night.
Woodall, an eight-year veteran of the police force who had been recruited from the Greater Manchester Police, died at the scene.
Police said on Twitter that they are "no longer looking for a suspect".
Woodall worked for the Edmonton Police force's hate crimes unit, and the arrest warrant he was serving was for criminal harassment.
Another officer, Sgt Jason Harley, 38, was shot at the same time, but was protected by his bulletproof vest. He has since been released from hospital.
Shortly after the shooting, a fire erupted at the home where the officers were serving the warrant.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement, "Constable Woodall's service to Edmonton and to Canada will be remembered and honoured.  We grieve his loss today with Alberta and the rest of the country."
The CBC reports that the last member of the Edmonton Police force to be killed while at work was in 1990.
Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht is expected to offer more details at a news conference on Tuesday.
