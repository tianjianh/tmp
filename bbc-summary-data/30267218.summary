Sheffield holds first 'green commission' public meeting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "green commission" set up in Sheffield is to hold its first public meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group, made up of representatives from the business, economic, environmental, academic and health sectors, aims to ensure environmental issues are given a greater prominence.
They will come up with a series of short and long-term recommendations to the council.
Some places are available to the public for the meeting on 2 December.
The 19 commissioners will sit over several months and collect evidence, both oral and written, as well as holding debates and hearing from expert witnesses in areas such as health, fuel poverty, sustainability and transport.
Frances Wells, one of the commissioners, said: "This is the start of a public conversation about a sustainable future for Sheffield.
"It will help us understand more about the ideas, know how and initiatives that will be good for a sustainable economy and business, good for our environment and good for local people's health and well-being."
