John Atkinson, 28, from Radcliffe in Bury, was among 22 people who died when a suicide bomber attacked concertgoers at Manchester Arena on 22 May.
Paying tribute, his relatives said he was the "life and soul of his family".
They said he had been with his partner, Michael, for 15 years and was "well loved for his 'on point' eyebrows and his Nike flip-flops".
He was "the devoted son of Daryl and Kevan, a caring and thoughtful brother to Stacey, Laura and Amy, and also a dear uncle, nephew, cousin and friend".
Relatives told how he would text his mother and sisters every day to make sure they were OK.
