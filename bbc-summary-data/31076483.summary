Support Stafford Hospital campaigners, who oppose the transfer of services to Royal Stoke University Hospital, have been at the entrance since July.
They now plan to open a campaign office and stand as independent candidates for Stafford Borough Council.
They would put up candidates in all wards bar two where councillors have fully backed the campaign, they said.
The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which ran Stafford Hospital, now known as County Hospital, was dissolved in November after a Â£6m inquiry into care failings.
