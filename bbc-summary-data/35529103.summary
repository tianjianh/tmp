Main replaces 19-year-old paceman Bradley Wheal in the only change from the recent tour to Hong Kong and Dubai.
The 20-year-old opted to play in New Zealand this winter but will return for the associate nation when they face Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Hong Kong.
Preston Mommsen leads a squad in which all 15 men have been capped at international level.
Northants batsman Kyle Coetzer, Scotland's leading run-scorer in T20 internationals with 687, is vice-captain.
Head coach Grant Bradburn said: "It is great to be announcing an extremely strong and well balanced T20 squad for India. We have an excellent mix of youth and experience, with every player offering dynamic specific skills in this format.
"Competition for places in the final 15 has been hotly contested and everyone has great respect for the quality of players in the wider squad.
"India presents a huge challenge for the team, however it also presents a fantastic opportunity which we are all looking forward to. We have five warm-up fixtures in India to adapt to conditions and to complete our team preparation to unleash our very best skills, at this global tournament."
Scotland, ranked 10th in the International Cricket Council's T20 rankings, are without a win in the competition, having lost three of their four matches, with one no-result, while they have not qualified for the past three editions.
Their recent tour of Dubai saw them lose by nine runs to the United Arab Emirates before beating the Netherlands by 37 runs in their two T20s with official ranking points at stake.
Scotland squad for ICC World Twenty20: Preston Mommsen (capt), Kyle Coetzer (vice-capt), Alasdair Evans, Calum MacLeod, Con de Lange, Gavin Main, George Munsey, Josh Davey, Mark Watt, Matt Machan, Matthew Cross, Michael Leask, Richie Berrington, Rob Taylor, Safyaan Sharif.
