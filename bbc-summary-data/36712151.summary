The department, which has 320 staff, analyses local media from 150 countries in 100 different languages, but the operation is to be scaled down.
The World Service said the Mazar-i-Sharif bureau in Afghanistan will be closed and new bases will open in Istanbul and Jerusalem.
The team will relocate from Caversham Park in Reading, its base since 1943.
The BBC said it would begin consultations with unions shortly.
The loss of jobs will mean a reduction of nearly a third.
It is understood that the service's new headquarters will be based in London.
At least 65 jobs in the department are being cut in the Reading office.
The service, which provides international content and communications to BBC News, governments and commercial clients, was previously funded by the UK government, but since 2013 it has been paid for by the licence fee.
World Service Group director Francesca Unsworth said: "Like all media organisations, BBC Monitoring has to keep pace with the new landscape of digital and social media.
"And, like the rest of the BBC, Monitoring needs to make savings."
The service's budget for 2016/17 was £13.2m, but £4m has been cut amid cost-cutting across the BBC.
