[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Music's Ten Pieces scheme - designed to engage a new generation of children with classical music - is being expanded to secondary schools.

Teenagers will be introduced to a new list of 10 classical pieces from "a wide range of styles and eras".
They include Haydn's Trumpet Concerto, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Bernstein's Mambo from West Side Story.
Chart stars Clean Bandit, violinist Nicola Benedetti and cellist Julian Lloyd Webber are backing the scheme.
They join composer and musician Nitin Sawhney as ambassadors for the project.
"Children need to challenge their imaginations and a formal education in the arts instils children with confidence and an ability to learn through intuition as well as intellect," said Sawhney.
"It empowers children to understand their own identity and emotions."
Trombonist Peter Moore, 19 - a former BBC Young Musician of the year who is now part of the London Symphony Orchestra - is also an ambassador, along with BBC 6 Music presenter Cerys Matthews and Radio 3's Suzy Klein.
More than half of the UK's primary schools have taken part in Ten Pieces since it launched last year.
"I'm so proud of this campaign," said BBC director general Tony Hall, calling it "the biggest commitment the BBC has ever made to music education in our country".
A special film featuring the BBC Philharmonic playing the 10 selected pieces of music has been made by music video director Nick Wickham, who has previously worked with Rihanna, Katy Perry, Foo Fighters and Madonna.
Teachers and students from the age of 11 will be able to watch the film in cinemas across the UK from October.
It is hoped the initiative will be "a spring-board for creativity", inspiring school projects in dance, animation, performance poetry, composition and digital art.
"The glowing success of Ten Pieces is a testament to the dedication and passion of its executive producer, Katy Jones who sadly passed away earlier this year," said director of BBC Music, Bob Shennan.
"It's a fitting tribute to her that we now launch Ten Pieces Secondary featuring a diverse and entertaining range of pieces which Katy herself loved."
BBC Radio 3 and Radio 2 will join forces to present a special two-week long Ten Pieces season in September.  Two special Ten Pieces Proms concerts are taking place at the Royal Albert Hall in July as part of this year's BBC Proms line-up.
