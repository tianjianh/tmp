Clement links up again with Carlo Ancelotti, who has succeeded Pep Guardiola as boss of the Bundesliga champions.
The pair have previously worked together at Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain.
Clement was sacked by Championship side Derby in February following an eight-month spell in charge.
Bayern have also retained long-serving assistant coach Hermann Gerland, who worked under the reigns of Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes and Guardiola.
Ancelotti's son, Davide, has also joined the German side's health and fitness team as part of the coaching restructure.
