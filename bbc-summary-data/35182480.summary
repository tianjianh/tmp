An annual Boxing Day event where bathers take a dip in the North Sea for charity has had to be called off due to stormy weather.

Up to 200 people had been expected to take part in the Nippy Dipper fundraising event in Aberdeen.
Organisers the Aberdeen Lions Club said they could not guarantee the safety of dippers due to rough seas.
The event is to be rescheduled for Saturday 2 January, weather permitting.
Several participants clad in fancy dress turned up for the cancelled event at 10:30 and took to the seas regardless, including members of the Grampian Haemophilia Group.
Coordinator Chris Southworth said cancelling the event was "the only sensible thing".
He said: "We saw the rough state of the sea, the onshore wind, and we felt that it was unsafe.
"There was too much of a risk, particularly with the strong wind, of hypothermia. I've been involved for 16 years and it's the first time it's been cancelled in that time."
