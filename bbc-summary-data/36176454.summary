Notts County 0-5 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Mark Cooper has left Notts County following their heavy League Two defeat by Carlisle on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Radio Nottingham reports Cooper will take over at National League side Forest Green, after only 10 games in charge at Meadow Lane.
Alex Gilliead stroked Carlisle ahead from the edge of the box and Danny Grainger's shot doubled the lead.
Jabo Ibehre struck either side of half-time before Charlie Wyke walked the ball into the net to cap the rout.
Carlisle moved up to a final position of 10th, an improvement of 10 places on last season, while the Magpies finished 17th in their first season following relegation from League One.
Cooper's departure meant Notts must search for their seventh manager in 14 months.
The former Swindon Town manager won three and lost five of his 10 matches since taking over from Jamie Fullarton in March.
