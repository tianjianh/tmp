Jose Mourinho faces probe over Barcelona fracas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho is to be investigated by the Spanish Football Federation following last week's bad-tempered Supercopa loss to Barcelona.

The Portuguese coach appeared to gouge the eye of Barca assistant Tito Vilanova near the end of the match.
Madrid duo Marcelo and Mezut Ozil and Barca's David Villa were sent off in the game, which the Catalan side won 3-2 to go through 5-4 on aggregate.
All three players have been given suspensions by the federation.
All three red cards came at the end of the game; the first to Marcelo, whose tackle on Cesc Fabregas sparked a melee that saw the other two players dismissed and Mourinho clash with Vilanova.
Barcelona said on Monday that they would not be reporting Mourinho, but the Spanish Federation (RFEF) have intervened.
A statement on their official website read: "We will examine the images of the behaviour of Jose Mourinho and Franciso Vilanova that could be in violation of Article 98 and/or Article 100 of the disciplinary code of the RFEF."
The flashpoint was the latest in a string of unsavoury incidents between the two clubs since Mourinho took over as Madrid coach last summer.
The 48-year-old double Champions League winner was constantly outspoken about Barca last season, while his side were reduced to 10 men in all but one of their five meetings throughout the campaign.
He was also sent to the stands during the first leg of the two teams' Champions League semi-final, which Barca won before going on to lift the European Cup.
