Mark McGhee: Motherwell boss faces SFA misconduct charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee has been issued with a Scottish FA notice of complaint over his conduct during the Premiership loss to Dundee this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is charged with adopting "aggressive behaviour" and using "offensive, abusing, and/or insulting language" towards a match official and a steward.
The 59-year-old has until next Tuesday to respond and a principal hearing date has been set for 1 December.
Well lost the game 2-0 but were controversially denied a goal.
The Steelmen claimed the ball had crossed the line when home goalkeeper David Mitchell collided with a post while clutching an over-hit Scott McDonald cross.
The incident took place with the match still at 0-0.
