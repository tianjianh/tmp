The visitors dominated the first half for long spells and took a 1-0 lead into the break, but a much better second-half display saw Morecambe hit back to take their first point in eight games.
Two former Morecambe players combined to put Hartlepool in front after 39 minutes.
Lewis Alessandra received the ball in space on the edge of the box and played a neat ball through to Padraig Amond, who scored against the Shrimps for the second time this season with a neat finish from 12 yards.
The Shrimps levelled just before the hour. Defender Ryan Edwards saw a shot cleared off the line but the ball rebounded perfectly for Paul Mullin to head home from three yards.
Both teams then had chances to take the three points with Amond seeing a shot superbly blocked by Edwards at one end and Kevin Ellison foiled by a superb low save from Joe Fryer in the closing stages.
