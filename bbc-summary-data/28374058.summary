Trojan Horse: Reaction to council and government reports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The findings of two reports into the "Trojan Horse" allegations of an attempted takeover of some Birmingham schools have been published.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Clarke's report, ordered by the government and leaked to The Guardian, found there was a "co-ordinated effort" to impose an "Islamist ethos" in some schools.
A council-commissioned report by Ian Kershaw found "no evidence" of a conspiracy.
The BBC gathered a number of responses.
Mr Kershaw's report did find evidence of "key individuals" moving between schools but stopped short of identifying an overarching plot or conspiracy.
Mr Hobby said the NAHT could not "fully support the conclusions" of the city council's report because it has used "too narrow a definition of extremism" and limited its process and terms of reference "in a way which excludes critical evidence".
"We entirely understand the pressures faced by the council but do not feel that their conclusions reflect the full reality in schools," he said.
"The Clarke review, sections of which have been reported on in the press ahead of formal publication, reaches a very different set of conclusions from access to a different evidence base.
"The discrepancies between the two are regrettable and unhelpful."
He said the union would continue to support the council in its efforts to address issues raised.
Ruby Kundi, head of Highfield School, one of the 25 investigated in Ian Kershaw's probe, said she thought the differing accounts could create more confusion.
"I'm thinking the differences in the reports could cause more mess, with people denying what Clarke said because Kershaw didn't find it," she said.
"Compared with Clarke, he played some of the findings down, though he did suggest the council are not really giving the full picture and are too frightened to upset Islamists or Muslim people."
"He said it was only a few governors and not a co-ordinated effort, but to me what he described was co-ordinated and all these people, governors at different schools, were connected.
"There should have been just one investigation where they worked together. I feel sorry for the parents and children in all this."
Labour MP Mr Mahmood said he agreed with Mr Kershaw's finding that identified the issue as a "minority problem" caused by a handful of disruptive governors, but said there was "still more to look at" and called for Birmingham City Council to be held to account.
"Kershaw's report confirmed what I've been saying for a long time and now the idea that the letter was a fake can be put in the dustbin and the real issues raised can be dealt with," he said.
"Unfortunately, some people still have their heads buried in the sand but we're moving forward with new governors to change the culture in the schools involved.
"This is the main issue, to do this as quickly as possible to get our children back to proper integrated education for the new school year."
Ms Bano has two daughters at Oldknow Academy, one of five schools placed into special measures by education watchdog Ofsted.
"First they were out to isolate us, now they are out to divide us by talking about different forms of Islam," she said.
"The Birmingham city council report totally contradicts what Peter Clarke is saying.
"The authorities need to pull their socks up.  I've lost complete faith in Peter Clarke.
"It's all going to end with no apology, it's all going to end with children paying the price."
