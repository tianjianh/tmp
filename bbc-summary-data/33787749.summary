Pregnant mother transferred between four hospitals while giving birth to twins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is a pregnant woman's worst nightmare - being told you will have to move hospital during labour.

But for Eleanor Brown, it was a reality. It didn't just happen once, but four times.
Eleanor went into labour nine weeks prematurely with her twins.
Arriving at the Ulster Hospital just outside Belfast, where she had been for all her pre-natal care, she was told there were not enough intensive care incubators for both babies.
She was moved to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, but because she had been given medication to slow her labour during the journey, she was sent home.
The next morning it was back to the Ulster Hospital, but there still were not enough specialised incubators, so Eleanor was then taken to Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh.
Once she arrived there, it was more bad news - the incubators were no longer available, so it was back into the ambulance.
After an hour and half she arrived at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, just in time for the arrival of her twin girls.
Each time she moved hospitals the process of taking bloods, and examinations had to begin again.
"I was so scared with strangers coming in," Eleanor said. "You were always constantly having to introduce yourself and trying to just get on with it. To be honest all I wanted was just to be in the one place with the one doctor, someone who was a bit familiar."
After a few days in Altnagelvin, word came that there was space in an intensive care unit (ICU) incubator at the Ulster Hospital, but only for one baby. The other twin would follow at some point, but it was not known if it would be days or weeks.
The couple refused to have the girls moved to hospitals that are 75 miles apart.
Eleanor told the BBC other mothers should not have to go through the same thing.
"It's common knowledge, it happens, and it's just kind of brushed under. It will continue to happen which is why we've decided to speak out."
Her husband Ross Brown said the solution is simple. "They need more ICU cots, and they definitely need to not say to people that they don't want to worry women.
"At the start of their pregnancy they should just say there's a chance you're not going to give birth here. No-one should have to go through what we went through."
The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) agreed with his point about communication.
At the moment, it is normal practice with multiple births to tell mothers having three or more babies that they may have to go to a different hospital.
Breedagh Hughes from the RCM said that this case has highlighted that mothers of twins should be told that too.
"Even if a unit does its best to keep two cots available, they have to deal with whatever comes through the door, and it may be that somebody comes in in more urgent need. But I do think there's a job of work to be done about explaining this to women so it doesn't come as a shock."
A spokesperson for the Ulster Hospital said they always make "every effort when there is a multiple birth to inform parents if there is a possibility that they may not be able to give birth in the Ulster Hospital."
Ross and Eleanor said the key is the timing of that conversation. They believe that during labour is not the appropriate moment to start explaining to a woman why she needs to be moved.
The Health and Social Care Board's spokesperson said there are 21 intensive care incubators in Northern Ireland - which is proportional to the size of the population.
The board said: "Whilst the service endeavours to provide care as close to the families' home as possible... this cannot be achieved on all occasions.
"Where babies have to be moved to a neonatal unit outside of their own trust for clinical reasons, trusts make every effort to repatriate babies back to their home trust as soon as possible."
The number of hospitals in Northern Ireland means the incubators are spread relatively thinly, and as multiple births become more common, stories like Eleanor's may become more common.
