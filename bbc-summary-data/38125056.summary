Ireland women suffered a 38-8 defeat by New Zealand after a disappointing second-half display in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Selica Winiata scored an early try for the Black Ferns but Ireland were only 5-3 behind at the break.
New Zealand surged clear in the second half with three tries from Portia Woodman while Winiata and Kelly Brazier also touched down for the tourists.
Niamh Kavanagh went over for a late consolation try for the Irish at the UCD Bowl.
The try was converted by full-back and captain Niamh Briggs, who returned to the team after missing the defeats by England and Canada because of a hamstring injury.
It is the first time Ireland have failed to win any of their games in the November Series.
Ireland: Niamh Briggs; M Coyne, N Fowley, S Naoupu, C McLaughlin; N Stapleton, L Muldoon; L Peat, C Moloney, A Egan; ML Reilly, O Fitzsimons; C Griffin, C Molloy, P Fitzpatrick.
