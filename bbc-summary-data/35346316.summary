World Snow Day at Scottish ski centres 'a success'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunday's World Snow Day at Scottish mountain ski centres was a success, according to Ski-Scotland, a national body that promotes snowsports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The day is marked at CairnGorm Mountain, Nevis Range, Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe Mountain every year when there is adequate snow cover.
All five were able to host events this year, including skiing, snowboarding and snowman building.
In total, Scotland has had more than 18,000 skier days so far.
Ski-Scotland said this figure was much higher than would be expected for this time of year.
A skier day means one person who skis or snowboards on one day. Many of the same people return to the slopes several times during the season.
Last season involved 230,634 skier days. There were 235,303 in the 2013-2014 season.
