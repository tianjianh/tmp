Do we need to wipe out clingons?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bid has been launched to uncover the secret life of clingy sea creatures.

Biofouling by barnacles, mussels and similar animals could pose problems for the growing offshore renewable energy industry.
The UK government's Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult has commissioned the study to see if these "sessile" creatures could harm attempts to harvest power from offshore wind, wave and tide.
The partnership involves the commercial arms of the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, and the paint and coatings company AkzoNobel.
One outcome could be a map showing what kinds of creatures are where - and how the renewables industry can avoid them.
Viewed up close - for which you'll typically need some Scuba gear - they can look pretty disgusting.
Luckily Dr Raeanne Miller loves them.
"I think these are incredible little micro-worlds," she says, "with lots and lots of different types of creatures, each one doing their own thing to survive in some incredibly harsh environments.
"And I think that's really amazing."
Formally they're called sessile animals, creatures that spend their adult lives anchored to one spot on rocks, jetties and piers.
In most situations they do little harm, even though boat owners consider them a pain in the keel.
Some species are soft and unassuming. But the hard-shelled ones like barnacles and mussels can add as much as twenty kilos to every square metre of a structure.
And when they set up home they do it quickly.
In the laboratories of the Scottish Association for Marine Science at Dunstaffnage near Oban, Dr Miller shows me two black plastic plates that have been for dip in the Firth of Clyde.
She said: "Originally these were completely clean plates. After eight weeks all sorts of animals have come and they've settled down to live.
"They've grown bigger and bigger and bigger over these eight weeks."
They have indeed. Both plates are covered with a variety of fascinatingly shaped creatures.
In the sea they'd be fascinatingly coloured too, but the alcohol in which they've been preserved has turned them all a faintly disappointing shade of beige.
It's the sessile sea animals' weight problem that has the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult particularly concerned.
It's been set up by the UK government to be its flagship technology and innovation centre for offshore renewables.
With offshore floating wind, wave and tidal projects in varying stages of preparedness, the Catapult doesn't want these clingy creatures to be a drag on a developing industry.
That's why it is leading this study.
Its project manager, Vicky Coy, has questions she hopes it will answer.
"Do things grow on devices? How quickly do they grow? Where do they grow?
"We want to really fend off that issue before it becomes something that affects developers."
The study's outcomes could include new coatings or designs to deter marine life from moving in.
Another possibility is a map of UK waters showing which species are clinging on and where.
That might give developers the chance to avoid marine organisms which might gum up the works.
It's an approach which particularly interests Dr Miller
She added: "By allowing renewable energy developers to predict what types of creatures could grow on their structures, they could be able to plan for their maintenance and how they operate their turbines or other devices."
True to the scientific method, the project will be making no assumptions. Before seeking a solution to the problem it will establish whether a problem exists.
But if it works, knowledge really will be power.
