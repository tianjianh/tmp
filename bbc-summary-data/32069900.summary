The BBC archive and lessons from elections past

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Whenever I talk to former colleagues who have left the BBC and gone to work for a rival news organisation (obviously no names since they are officially dead to us) there are usually plenty of things they say they don't miss about the corporation.

The lifts at New Broadcasting House are normally high on the list.
However, there is one thing that they usually concede their new employer cannot hope to match: the BBC archive.
Like the British Library or the Parliamentary Archives, it is one of the jewels of British culture. A visual and audio record of our history that few countries can come close to.
From its earliest days the corporation recognised that record keeping was one of its core functions and today we reap the benefits. As a journalist, access to this archive gives me the opportunity to weave into my reports a rich context that is simply not available anywhere else.
The fact is that looking back at the past helps us to make sense of the present and see further into the future. Looking at the fabulous themed collections of political videos on BBC News Timeliner we can make some pretty safe bets about this election, in the form of four lessons.
Revisit Election Broadcasts from the three major parties
Timeliner: Tory PEBs
Timeliner: Labour PEBs
Timeliner: Lib Dem PEBs
Look back at Neil Kinnock in 1987 or Tony Blair in 1997. Look at Margaret Thatcher's election broadcast in 1979, or Michael Howard in 2005. These are very different politicians with very different agendas and yet the themes are all the same - "it's time for a change". That's because it is really the only campaign an opposition can run.
Now look at Ed Miliband's speeches and broadcasts from this election campaign so far. The policies are selected and packaged to optimise their fit into this overarching meta theme of "time for a change".
If you are in government the opposite campaign theme is equally imposed upon you - "we're on the right track, don't turn back".
That's what Margaret Thatcher is saying in her broadcast of 1983. Look at Alan Sugar's election broadcast for Labour in 2005 - he's saying the same thing as Mrs T.
There is one exception to this cast-iron rule. Every now and then the appetite for change in the electorate is irresistible.
Conservative MPs thought this in 1990 and brutally defenestrated their most popular leader in history. "You think it's time for a change", they were saying, "there you go".
So at this election Ed Miliband is running the "time for a change" campaign and David Cameron is running the "don't let the other lot ruin it all" campaign. Neither had a choice.
Where does that leave the Lib Dems? In a bind, because their usual campaign is "time for a change", aimed at people who don't like the government but can't bring themselves to vote for the main opposition. Now the Lib Dems have been in government, that campaign is far harder to calibrate and project.

Timeliner: Meeting the voters
Timeliner: Of the people
Timeliner: When they were young
Why was Gordon Brown's encounter with Gillian Duffy in 2010 so toxic for the Prime Minister?
The answer is that it shone a light on Mr Brown's character that chimed with voters' suspicions of the man. It also chimed with the views of journalists covering the campaign.
The Hague baseball cap is another example. The electorate thought the new Tory leader was trying to be hip and down with kids. But they also knew what he was like when he really was a kid and he came across as inauthentic. This dogged him for the rest of his leadership.
Voting does not always go how you expect
Timeliner: A Major surprise
Timeliner: Polling tales
Remember election night 1992? Big Ben strikes ten, signalling the end of voting, and David Dimbleby gives the nation the results of the BBC exit poll - Major short by 25 seats, a hung Parliament. In fact the poll was wrong as many of the polls in that election were wrong. The fact is that voters are sometimes shy of giving their honest opinion, especially when they support the governing party.
Even in the Labour landslide of 1997 the polls tightened over the course of the campaign, although by nowhere near enough to make a difference to the result. What seems to happen is that some voters will contemplate support for the opposition when the election is more distant, but reconsider when that distant prospect solidifies into an imminent change of government.
This is often reported as one side or the other running a good or bad campaign but it is really nothing of the kind.

Timeliner: General elections
If you look back at previous general elections on Timeliner, it's obvious that campaigning has become slicker, more stage managed and more professional. Gone are the days of jumping on a battle bus and seeing where you end up.
But even now, with the armies of advisers and PR people, the sheer amount of activity during a campaign means that "gaffes" are bound to occur. Outside an election campaign, there is no way that Sharron Storer would have got as close to Tony Blair as she did in 2001. Will these "gaffes" make any difference? It depends (see the Brown and Hague 'incidents' above).
When someone in a slick suit is trying to sell you a new pension they are obliged to point out that "past returns are no guide to future performance". Wearing the rather scruffier attire of a journalist, I think the past is a very good guide to future performance.
I don't mean in the specifics. I don't think that John Prescott is going to punch a voter again as he did in 2001 (but, let's be honest, we can't entirely rule out the possibility).
I mean that in politics we can look at the past and get glimpses of the future.
