Stacey Burrows, 16, was with 17-year-old Lucy Pygott when they were hit by a Ford Focus in Aldershot on Tuesday evening.
A statement from Stacey's family said she was "highly dedicated" to running.
Both girls were members of Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club (AFD).
In a tribute released through police said: "Stacey really was the perfect daughter and sister - perfect in every possible way. Stacey was highly dedicated to what she loved doing, running for Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club.
"We as a family know Stacey will be greatly missed by her teammates, coaches and club. It is a tragedy that it has ended so soon for her. Work hard was her motto and that is exactly what she did."
The crash happened on Queen's Avenue just after 19:10 GMT. Dozens of flowers have also been left at the crash scene.
Lucy was this year's England Under-20 3,000m champion and European Youth Championships bronze medallist. Stacey was the Hampshire Under-17 3,000m champion.
Hampshire Athletics Club said a minute's silence would be held in memory of the girls at the Hampshire Cross-Country League fixture at Bournemouth on Saturday.
A serving soldier has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of careless driving while unfit through drink or drugs. He has been bailed until February.
