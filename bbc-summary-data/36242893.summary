Celtic, who were all but assured the title, clinched the Premiership with a 3-2 win over closest challengers Aberdeen, who have 71 points.
After trailing 3-0, Niall McGinn and Andy Considine netted for the Dons at Celtic Park.
"To beat 75 points would be a fantastic achievement," said McInnes.
"It's important that we still try to play with an edge. I think that demonstrates a proper team, if you can keep going all the way to the end of the season.
"It's important for me to try and beat our points tally for last season.
"We've got two games to go and try and do that and we'll try and finish the season strong because I think it's important we finish properly."
Aberdeen finish their campaign with home matches against Hearts and Ross County.
McInnes's men - who will finish as runners-up for a second year in a row - started the season strongly with eight straight league wins but slipped below Celtic in the autumn.
A second home win of the season over Ronny Deila's side in February kept Aberdeen in the hunt but Celtic's consistency ultimately secured them a fifth straight championship.
"There's been a lot of criticism at times over the season for the manager and the team but I think their league form is up there with any championship-winning team," McInnes said of Celtic.
"For them to go through the full campaign only losing three games, you can see why they've won it and we congratulate them for that."
And, of Sunday's match, McInnes said: "We had great chances to score again. And probably easier chances - harder to miss than score.
"Second half, at least we showed fight, we showed our ability on the ball. We showed good aggression with our play and we created chances.
"Similar to the season, we fell just a bit short but we gave them a fright and we had to make them work for it.
"The two goals were no more than we deserved."
