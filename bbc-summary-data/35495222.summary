Sian Williams column: World Cup dream follows Caribbean disaster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a freak accident. I was away in Trinidad and Tobago, playing rugby and there was a bottle top on the field. I dived to score a try and it cut through my patellar tendon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cut ruptured the tendon, so I missed the 2013 season, and then I broke my knee cap, 12 weeks on after rehab - that put back my recovery by a further six to eight months.
It was a long old slog of injury after injury but, because it was something I always wanted, I knew - deep down - I would be back wearing the shirt for Wales.
It was my goal as soon as it happened. I knew I would get back, but when and where? That was a different question.
So I could not be happier or prouder to go into the opening Six Nations game in Ireland on Saturday.
I was so grateful that our coach Rhys Edwards kept me in the international set-up. I was well looked after. He kept faith in me. I made the Six Nations squad in 2014 despite not playing any rugby, and I was extremely lucky he had that faith in me.
Knowing that I had his backing gave me even more faith that I could come back stronger and fitter and be back to where I was before. It really helped me.
I know I am tough enough to could come back from that now.
I've never ever feared injury. I was never riddled with injuries before, never since I started playing rugby at the age of seven or eight. Before then, my dad took me tap dancing, but I was a dreadful, dreadful dancer, so I started playing rugby instead.
My older brother Rhys, who plays rugby league for Wales and London Broncos, has been an inspiration to me. He is a great player. He's always been professional and seeing his lifestyle made me want to strive to be a professional rugby player and be the best.
I have two older brothers who play, so I wanted to do what they did. They played a big part in my early rugby life. They were a massive influence. There is a lot of competition within our family to be the best and do well at sport.
The three of us were always in the garden, playing two-on-one and practising tackling each other. We used to constantly have a rugby ball in hand and my dad used to play as well so, when we were really little, we used to go down the rugby club every weekend.
Our mum used to get a bit furious at rugby balls flying into lampshades in the house constantly. We must have been a nightmare.
Now the dream is to qualify for the World Cup with Wales.
To do that, we need two wins in this year's Six Nations. Our must-win games, looking at previous years, are against Scotland and Italy, but there are other games we can take as well.
We have a fresh young squad starting in Ireland on Saturday, which is really exciting. There is so much experience on the bench as well - we haven't had that before.
There's a nice calm mood in camp. But there is excitement as well and you can feel that excitement brewing.
The girls are really positive, everyone wants to win and we are all ready to play.
