Solihull Moors 3-3 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull hit back from three goals down inside the first 25 minutes to earn an incredible draw against Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had lost their past two games, but got off to a great start when Reece Hall-Johnson's free-kick from the left evaded everyone on its way into the back of the net after just six minutes.
The visitors doubled their lead in the 17th minute when a free-kick was headed back across the face of goal for top scorer Michael Cheek to turn the ball home.
It looked to be game over six minutes later as Joel Kettle brought down Cheek, who dusted himself down to convert the resulting penalty for his 17th goal of the season, but Simeon Maye pulled one back in the 26th minute, heading in Dapo Afolayan's free-kick.
Harry Lee nearly restored the visitors' three-goal lead when his free-kick struck the post, but Afolayan burst into the box with just 11 minutes to go and scored with a powerful left-footed shot which beat Ben McNamara at the near post.
And with four minutes remaining Ashley Sammons delivered a great free-kick which was powerfully headed home by George Carline.
