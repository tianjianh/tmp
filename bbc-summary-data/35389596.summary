[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 0-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe's 46-year-old goalkeeping coach Barry Richardson made his first appearance in more than a decade to help his side earn a surprise victory over promotion-chasing Plymouth Argyle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richardson came on in the 15th minute to replace the injured Alex Lynch with his side already 1-0 up, but was barely tested in his first game since 2005.
Gozie Ugwu hit the third-minute winner, smashing the ball in from close range.
Argyle almost levelled, but Curtis Nelson's shot was cleared off the line.
Michael Harriman ensured Richardson, who had not played a league game since 2002, kept a clean sheet with his second-half intervention.
But aside from that Wanderers were comfortable, and only two fine reaction saves from Luke McCormick stopped Matt Bloomfield adding to the lead.
Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"After losing Alex Lynch in the first twenty minutes, the boys had to really battle hard to try and keep Barry Richardson away off the ball as much as possible.  We dug in and ran the clock down really well.
"The game is all about opportunity, and what an opportunity Barry Richardson has had this afternoon. He is now the oldest player to play for Wycombe, and not only did he keep a clean sheet but I think he is the first to do so at Plymouth this season. I won't be looking to start him next week though!
"From our last few league games, I feel we have only really deserved something out of one match because we have been poor, but today was different and we are really pleased to come away with the points."
