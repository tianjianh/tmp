Pilot Bertrand Piccard brought the plane in from Phoenix, Arizona, in a flight that lasted just over 18 hours.
The zero-fuel aircraft has now reached halfway across America, with its immediate goal of getting to New York firmly in sight.
The Swiss team wants to be on the East Coast at the start of June to begin planning the big Atlantic crossing.
To complete its circumnavigation of the globe, the solar-powered aeroplane needs to get to Abu Dhabi, UAE. That is where the adventure got under way in March last year.
