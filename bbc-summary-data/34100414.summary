Everton defender John Stones is a potential future England captain, says Toffees boss Roberto Martinez.

Stones, 21, produced an accomplished performance as Everton drew 0-0 with Tottenham at White Hart Lane.
The centre-back did so on the back of intense scrutiny about his future after a transfer request was rejected.
"He was under a lot of pressure, so his performance was that of someone who has the potential to become an England captain," Martinez said.

"He shows incredible composure and you would never say he's only 21 years old."
Martinez reiterated Everton's stance that Stones is not for sale after Chelsea had three bids refused and claims the player "accepts" the club's position.
He added: "Absolutely he accepts he is an Everton player. We want to be a winning team and John is a big part of that.
"We have our own ambitions and project and John is a big part of that. He showed a really strong face against Tottenham."
Everton midfielder Tom Cleverley and Tottenham's Mousa Dembele were both taken off on stretchers at White Hart Lane.
Cleverley, 26, was injured in a first-half challenge with Spurs' Eric Dier and Martinez admitted that at first he had feared the worst.
"We'll assess him over the next 24 hours," said the Everton boss. "Straight away we thought it was ligament damage plus something else.
"It was a big worry, but we feel quite confident now that it was just ligament damage. It was a really strong challenge and it shows how fit he is to escape that incident with just ligament damage."
Dembele, 28, suffered a self-inflicted injury, his right boot appearing to clip his left Achilles after passing the ball. An update on his injury is expected on Monday.
