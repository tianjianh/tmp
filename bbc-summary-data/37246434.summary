County Championship: Northants' Keogh and Duckett demolish Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire set Glamorgan an improbable target of 451 after spinner Rob Keogh took a career-best 9-52 and Ben Duckett hit 185.

Part-time bowler Keogh proved unplayable on a turning wicket as Glamorgan lost all 10 wickets in the morning, collapsing to 124 all out.
Duckett then raced to a hundred off 81 balls and passed 1,000 first-class runs for the season before the hosts declared on 305-7.
Glamorgan ended on 0-0 at stumps.
Keogh, who had only taken three wickets in an innings previously, bowled unchanged through the first session with fielders clustered around the bat from the start.
Only experienced left-handers Jacques Rudolph (37) and Mark Wallace (25 not out) had the confidence to last for long.
Keogh's figures were the sixth-best of all time by a Northamptonshire bowler and the best ever against Glamorgan.
Duckett dominated century stands with both Rob Newton (25) and Keogh (40) as Glamorgan had to turn to Graham Wagg's occasional spin for wickets.
The England Lions left-hander had no mercy on the Glamorgan attack and his rapid scoring allowed Alex Wakely to declare just before the close, although Glamorgan survived without scoring until stumps.
Northants all-rounder Rob Keogh told BBC Radio Northampton:
"It's been an interesting day, three-for was my previous best and I wasn't expecting that at all, but it's spinning and 450 looks a long way away for them.
"I saw their young debutant (Kiran Carlson) spin a couple and we were saying that if he can get five, then Whitey (Graeme White) or me should be getting five-for, but things went my way and I ended up getting nine.
"Ben (Duckett) is an unbelievable player of spin and he didn't let their spinners settle at all, he's in the form of his life and hopefully that sort of pitch sets him up for a trip to Bangladesh (with England.)
"Apparently there's a bit of bad weather around Saturday, but 450 behind is a lot on this wicket."
Glamorgan all-rounder Graham Wagg told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's not a 120 all-out sort of wicket, we batted quite poorly and their spinners got some purchase out of the wicket, I don't think it's acceptable to get bowled out in a session and we're looking to put that right second innings.
"(Rob Keogh) was looking to hit my footmarks and it worked for us with Kiran (Carlson) getting five-for, Rob Keogh did make it spit but there's no excuses.
"I do enjoy bowling spin but Ben Duckett played me fantastically well, take his score out and it's a different game- so hats off to the guy.
"It's going to be a heck of a task getting 450 but if we bat two days, and it is a big hope, we're going to be somewhere near- so we've got to set our stall out to bat two days."
