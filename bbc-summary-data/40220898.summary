Hartlepool have signed striker Jake Cassidy, goalkeeper Scott Loach and midfielders Jack Munns and Luke George.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cassidy, 24, has joined from Guiseley, where he scored eight goals in 30 National League appearances in 2016-17.
Experienced Notts County keeper Loach joins after making nine appearances for York City while on loan last season.
Munns, a 23-year-old attacking midfielder, made 19 League Two appearances for Cheltenham last season, while George captained Chester.
The quartet are Hartlepool's first signings since they finished 23rd in League Two and were relegated from the Football League for the first time in their history.
They follow the appointment of former New Saints boss Craig Harrison, who joined the club on 26 May to succeed Dave Jones as manager.
