[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British woman who went missing while on holiday in Cyprus after falling down an embankment has died in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pauline Pridcock lay undiscovered for three nights after falling while on a day trip from Paphos.
The 64 year old and her husband had set off for Omodos with a tour group.
After a major four day search, Mrs Pridcock was found unconscious on Sunday morning. She died in hospital on Monday morning.
Emergency services, volunteers and terrain specialists were involved in the search, which lasted from Wednesday to Saturday and followed a number of reported sightings.
Mrs Pridcock's cousin Steve Dykes said she was badly dehydrated and had suffered cuts and bruises.
He said she died in Limassol General Hospital and that it was possibly because of a "heart attack or organ failure due to dehydration".
"She was making progress up until Sunday evening, but three days and three nights out in the countryside with the possible added dehydration unfortunately took its toll," he said.
