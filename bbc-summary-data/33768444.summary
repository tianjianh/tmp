Jack Marriott beat two defenders before finishing to put the home side ahead, with Paul Benson adding the second with a low strike after the interval.
Marriott got his second of the game after with a composed finish.
Aston Villa loanee Callum Robinson pulled a goal back for City, but they lost for the second game in a row.
Luton manager John Still:
"We played against a good side and said before the game that they're very fluid with the 3-5-2, so we matched up and knew we were going to have to work hard early on to work out their movement.
"It's very clever and you can't coach that, you've got to work it out as you go. Once we did that, we exploited their players going forward and the first goal was a classic example of that."
Bristol City boss Steve Cotterill:
"We were on top then gave away a silly goal, before Aden's (Flint) slipped for the third. By the time that third one goes in, then it's a real uphill struggle.
"We needed to get another goal very quickly after we got that first goal in order to be really pushing at the end. We've put enough balls in the box tonight, enough balls across the face of goal, but we need to be putting those chances away."
