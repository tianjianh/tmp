The 26-year-old, who made 37 league appearances for the Cards last season, has agreed a one-year contract with the option of a further year.
"He is more than capable of making the step back up to league football," Reds head coach Dermot Drummy said.
"In fact, he will thrive on an opportunity to establish himself again at this level."
Arthur, who has previously had spells at Northampton and AFC Wimbledon, becomes Crawley's seventh signing of the close season.
Meanwhile, 26-year-old midfielder Lewis Young has agreed a new one-year deal with the West Sussex club.
