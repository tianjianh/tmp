[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brecon Beacons pair 'electrocuted' by lightning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men were electrocuted after being struck by separate bolts of lightning in the Brecon Beacons, a coroner has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeremy Prescott, 51, from Telford, Shropshire, and Robin Frederick Meakings, 59, both died on 5 July.
Mr Prescott was hit while manning a checkpoint on Corn Du and Mr Meakings was struck while walking on Cribyn.
Powys coroner Andrew Barkley gave the provisional cause of death for both men as electrocution by lightning strike.
Aberdare Coroner's Court was told experienced mountaineers said it was the first time they had dealt with such cases on south Wales' highest mountain range.
After the tragedy, the family of part-time youth worker Mr Prescott - known to pals as Jez - said he died doing something he loved.
Two others were struck by lightning on the same day but survived.
Brecon Mountain Rescue team leader Mark Jones said the chances of two people getting hit on the same range on the same day were exceptionally unusual.
The inquest was opened and adjourned until 3 September.
