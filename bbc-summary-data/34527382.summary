Wales has around 60,000 so-called Neets - roughly one in five 19-24 year olds and one in 10 of those aged 16-18.
The latest scheme will target 6,000 young people in the poorest communities for advice and financial help.
Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said young people should have "the skills they need and the opportunity to reach their full potential".
