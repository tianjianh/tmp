[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish economic advisors hold first post-Brexit meeting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first minister's council of economic advisers has met for the first time since the EU referendum result.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Council members discussed the current state of Scotland's economy following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
The group will continue to monitor the country's economic performance as the impact of Brexit becomes clearer.
Nicola Sturgeon said the council plays a critical role in growing the economy.
She said: "We have acted to take further measures to stimulate the economy and support jobs by adding an additional Â£100m to our capital infrastructure programme this year.
"While Scotland's economy has a range of fundamental strengths, in the face of the continuing uncertainty following the Brexit vote Council members will consider the current economic outlook, prospects for growth and advise on our economic approach as our potential future relationship with the EU becomes clearer."
Chairman of the council Crawford Beveridge said: "This is a challenging time for Scotland's economy given the uncertainties that lie ahead.
"In our role as an independent advisory group, our members bring expertise from across a range of areas, both nationally and internationally, and benefit from direct links to the Standing Council on Europe.
"We act as a 'critical friend' and sounding board to advise the first minister on key areas impacting on Scotland's performance, including on the economic implications of the EU referendum outcome, innovation and inclusive growth."
