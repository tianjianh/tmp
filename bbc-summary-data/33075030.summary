A website illegally selling valium has been shut down by the government following a BBC investigation.

An undercover BBC Kent reporter was sold the Class C drug, also known as diazepam, via a Surrey-registered site.
He was sent capsules, said to have been imported from India, through the post by a man calling himself Conan.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] said it worked with the internet service provider to have the site removed.
The BBC reporter, posing as a man seeking valium for his wife, paid Â£60 for capsules of valium - a strong and addictive sedative in the benzodiazepine family.
When they arrived they were analysed by scientists in Cambridgeshire who found them to contain the active substance diazepam and an "unknown impurity".
Simon Hudson, of LGC testing laboratory in Fordham, said drugs bought online were "potentially dangerous" as the product could contain impurities or other drugs.
When Conan was confronted by BBC Kent, he claimed he was doing nothing illegal and said the BBC's time "would be better spent covering proper crimes".
He also told the BBC the police "had better things to do with crack cocaine and all sorts".
A spokesman for MHRA said: "Prescription medicines are, by their very nature, potent and should be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional who can make informed choices about the appropriate medicine for a particular patient and monitor their effects."
Those convicted of selling prescription-only drugs without proper permission face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and an unlimited fine.
However the Home Office said the matter had not been referred to Surrey Police after the website was closed down.
