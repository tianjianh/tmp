Manager Allan Johnston insists Dunfermline will not be distracted in Hamilton replay

Manager Allan Johnston says a possible Scottish Cup quarter-final away to Rangers is not distracting his Dunfermline players ahead of their replay against Hamilton Accies.

The sides drew 1-1 at East End Park on Saturday and face each other again on Tuesday at New Douglas Park.
"I was expecting the players to be buzzing about the Rangers draw this morning," Johnston told BBC Scotland
"But everyone was talking about the Hamilton game."
And the Pars boss added: "Rangers at Ibrox would be a tough task but we've got to get there first."
Paul McMullan's strike gave the Pars the lead on Saturday but Danny Redmond equalised in the second half to force the replay.
The potential trip to Ibrox in the last eight would excite Johnston, who scored a famous hat-trick there for Hearts in 1996 and went on to sign for Rangers in 2000.
But he is reluctant to shift his focus away from Tuesday's fifth round replay.
"I don't like talking about ifs, buts and maybes," said Johnston.
"The Hamilton game is massive for the club, it means a lot to us financially as well.
"Hamilton have a lot of good players but we can take a lot of confidence from the last game."
Dunfermline have only lost one of their last 13 matches under Johnston, whose side took time to adjust to life in the Championship following promotion.
They sit sixth in the second tier and the Pars boss reckons Saturday's draw with Accies proved there is not a huge difference between his men and the Premiership's bottom six teams.
"There's not a massive gap but you can still tell they've got a wee bit of quality and they can hurt you at any time," added Johnston.
"That's the difference in stepping up the leagues. And that's probably what took us a little bit of time coming into the Championship as well after playing in a lower division.
"It's good to test yourself against better teams because ultimately that's where want to be."
