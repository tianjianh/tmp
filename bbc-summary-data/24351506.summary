The official opening is on 14 November but South West Trains said it wanted to open the Berkshire station to the public "as soon as possible".
The project was due to be completed in August, but issues with ground works caused delays.
The station will be officially opened by Transport Minister Norman Baker.
The upgrade includes a new main building with retail units, lifts and a footbridge.
The former station building will be demolished once the new adjacent facility is ready for use.
Robin Ashton, from the Wokingham Chamber of Commerce, said: "We are delighted and it is very good news for the town.
"But we will be more pleased on the 14th (of November) when the site is properly delivered".
A South West Trains spokesperson said more than two million journeys were made through Wokingham station each year.
She added the upgrade would "encourage more passengers to travel by rail to work and for pleasure".
