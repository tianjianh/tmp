The 6ft 8in forward was a four-time BBL title-winner, helping Leicester Riders to the BBL championship, play-offs and Trophy treble this season.
Sullivan also played for Newcastle Eagles, Mersey Tigers and London Lions and led Team GB at London 2012.
"It is bittersweet. I enjoy playing for this club but it has to happen at some stage," he told the Riders' website.
Twice named the BBL's Most Valuable Player, Sullivan also won 100 caps for Great Britain before bowing out of international duty in July 2016.
"The time is right and I look forward to starting the next chapter of my life," said Sullivan, who operates a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club.
"I have been playing basketball for over two decades. I have had an amazing time representing my county, some amazing clubs and playing here [Leicester] for five seasons.
"Representing Great Britain at the Olympics and playing in London, a stone's throw from where I grew up with family and friends able to watch me play, and winning the first league title here in Leicester, those are the kind of moments I am going to take away."
Sullivan moved to the United States in 1996, where he played college and university basketball, before joining BBL side Newcastle Eagles in 2004.
He capped a highly successful two-year spell by helping Eagles win a clean sweep of the four domestic trophies in 2005-06, when he was also named BBL player of the year.
After that, Sullivan played for Spanish club Joventut Badalona, Dexia Mons-Hainaut in Belgium, Russian side CSK VVS Samara and Apollon in Cyprus.
He then returned to England for brief stints with Newcastle and Mersey Tigers, before joining Leicester in 2011.
Sullivan was part of the Riders roster that completed the treble in 2012-13, a feat repeated earlier this month in his second spell at the club, after a year with London Lions.
Internationally, Sullivan represented Britain at three EuroBasket competitions and was part of the England team that won a bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.
He then captained the British team at the London Olympics, but they were eliminated at the group stage and failed to qualify for Rio 2016.
