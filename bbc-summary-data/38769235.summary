[SN]TITLE[SN]
Book returned to Orkney Library 43 years overdue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A book has been returned to Orkney Library more than 43 years after it was meant to be brought back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The biography of local poet and writer Edwin Muir by P.H Butter was due to be returned before 24 October 1973.
It was finally checked back in after being found during a house clearance.
Library manager Gary Amos told BBC Scotland: "The person who returned it was amused. There was no fine - it was from too long ago. These things happen periodically."
He added: "It will be looked at carefully, before going back into stock."
