The Virgin train, travelling from London Euston to Chester, hit the platform after pulling in to its destination at about 12:10 GMT.
A 64-year-old passenger was taken to hospital suffering back injuries, the North West Ambulance Service said.
Jake Pickering posted on Twitter: "The @VirginTrains train I was on from London has just crashed at Chester station. I believe everyone is okay."
No other trains were involved and there were not believed to be any serious injuries, Virgin confirmed.
A Network Rail spokesman said the train hit the buffers at slow speed.
He added: "Network Rail is assisting Virgin Trains and the British Transport Police in dealing with this incident.
"Both the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the Office for Rail Regulation have been informed."
