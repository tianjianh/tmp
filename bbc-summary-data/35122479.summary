[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fantasy writer won the prestigious medal in 1979 for Tulku and in 1980 for City of Gold.
He wrote almost 60 books which have been translated into 53 different languages and was awarded an OBE for services to literature in 2009.
He died in Winchester, Hampshire, on December 16 after a brief illness, with his family by his side.
His Dark Materials writer Philip Pullman is among the authors who have paid tribute to the Dickinson.
"I was very sorry to hear of the death of Peter Dickinson. He was a fine writer and a lovely man," he tweeted.
Fantasy author and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman added: "The Weathermonger books hit me hard when I was a boy. He was a warm and satisfyingly brilliant writer. Giant Cold was a true dream.
"A real loss to literature. I wish I'd known him and my thoughts and love go to his wife, Robin McKinley."
Dickinson was born in Africa but was educated in England and started his career at the satirical magazine Punch.
He was the first person to win the Carnegie medal twice and was nominated for the prestigious medal nine times, including his last book In The Palace Of The Khans, which was published in 2012.
He was the first and so far only author to win the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger award for two consecutive novels for his detective books Skin Deep in 1968 and A Pride Of Heroes in 1969.
He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and former chairman of the Society of Authors.
