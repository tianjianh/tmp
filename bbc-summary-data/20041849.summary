[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Vazquez's decisive victory in the 2014 run-off presidential election over right-wing challenger Luis Lacalle Pou cemented left-wing rule for another five years.
A cancer doctor by profession, Tabare Vazquez served as president in 2005-2010, being succeeded by his party colleague Jose Mujica. Uruguayan presidents do not serve consecutive terms.
Mr Vazquez pledged to focus more attention on improving education standards and fighting crime, while maintaining the generous social welfare policies of Mr Mujica.
