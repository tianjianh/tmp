Marcus Rashford says "it doesn't seem real" to be part of England's Euro 2016 squad less than four months after making his Manchester United debut.

The 18-year-old striker scored eight goals in 18 appearances for United before finding the net three minutes into his England debut in May.
"At Christmas, I was trying to work my way into United's Under-21s side," he said. "To be here now is just amazing.
"It doesn't seem real, when you look back at it."
In an interview with FATV, the teenager added: "I wasn't really thinking about the England set-up as much because at United there were a lot of games coming thick and fast, so all of my focus was on those games.
"When I first went into the England changing room and saw all of the players' names on the back of their shirts, it didn't seem real.
"I tried not to think about it too much because that's probably where the pressure and stuff starts to get to people's heads and affect their performance."
Rashford did not feature in England's final pre-tournament friendly as Wayne Rooney started behind Tottenham's Harry Kane and Leicester's Jamie Vardy in an unimpressive 1-0 win over Portugal.
England's Group C campaign begins against Russia in Marseille on Saturday before matches against Wales on 16 June and Slovakia on 20 June.
