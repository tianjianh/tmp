Ex-Yeovil MP David Laws 'not suited to endless holidays'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Liberal Democrat MP David Laws has confirmed he will not stand for Parliament again after taking a new role with an education think-tank.

The ex-Cabinet Minister lost his Yeovil seat in May's general election after 14 years as the constituency member.
Mr Laws, 49, will serve as executive chairman of Centre Forum but is still considering various job opportunities two months on from his defeat.
He described himself as not suited to "navel gazing and endless holidays".
In his first full interview since the election, the former Minster for the Cabinet Office, Minister for Schools and Chief Secretary to the Treasury described his dismay at the "tsunami sweeping away lots of Lib Dem MPs" on 8 May.
"I was extremely disappointed and upset for people like my staff who've worked in my office for years and years. I was very sorry on their behalf," he said.
"I suppose it [the scale of the defeat] meant that it didn't feel quite as personalâ€¦ when you see all of your colleagues being knocked over like ninepins then it feels something that it's much more difficult to do anything about."
But the disappointment was clear to see as the former investment banker shunned the media scrum and left the count with barely a word to reporters.
Having been integral to the negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition government in 2010, he had been "hoping and expecting" to do the same again.
Instead, he went home to sleep.
His new job for Centre Forum, a liberal policy think-tank, will take up two days a week but he hopes to have a full-time plan by the end of the summer.
"I've already got one role as chairman which I'm very pleased about as it will allow me to take forward my interest in education and education policy, and I've been talking to other people about other work I may do next," he said.
But that plan will not include standing for election again.
"I'd already got the view that serving four terms in parliament, had I been re-elected in May this year, would have been about the right amount of time to do," he said.
"I don't think that MPs should go on forever and I think it's not therefore likely that I would stand again as a member of parliament."
Despite the loss of the Yeovil seat to the Conservatives, he remains optimistic of the seat being recaptured by his party.
"In areas like Yeovil where we have had big and strong base at the local government level and a national presence for many years I would think that there's every chance we can win back the Yeovil constituency at the next general election in 2020 and I'll do everything I can to support our new candidate to become the next MP."
