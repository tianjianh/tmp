The 22-year-old, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury, made his debut in the 2013-14 season and has made 49 Blues appearances so far.
Former Wales youth international Jenkins signed his previous deal with the region in January 2014.
"Ellis has produced some fantastic rugby this season and continues to improve," head coach Danny Wilson said.
"He is a local lad who has come through the system at Cardiff Blues and wants to be part of what we are building here over the coming years."
The exact length of the new "long-term" deal for Jenkins has not been disclosed.
He said: "I have been at Cardiff Blues since I was 15-years-old and this is where I want to play my rugby under the guidance of Danny Wilson.
"I have spoken to Danny about his long-term plans and I know the calibre of signings he also wants to bring in to take us forward."
The announcement of the new contract comes a day after the Blues revealed back Rhys Patchell had turned down an offer of a new deal and will move to rivals Scarlets at the end of the season.
