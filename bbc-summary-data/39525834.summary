The network has said that separate awards for best actor and actress will be replaced by "non-gendered" prizes.
This means female actors like Emma Watson from Disney's Beauty and the beast will now be competing with male actors like Hugh Jackman from Marvel's Logan, for the best actor award.
At the moment most big award ceremonies, like the Oscars and Baftas, still have separate categories for men and women.
But some ceremonies like the Grammys have never had separate awards.
Many people believe that men and women should be treated equally so there should be no need to separate the genders.
Some people also believe that people shouldn't be defined by their gender and should get to choose which one they identify with.
