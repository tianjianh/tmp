An elderly man has been injured in an unprovoked attack on a street in Inverness, Police Scotland has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The assault in the Kingsmill Road area of Inverness happened at about 17:30 on Thursday and involved a man in his 20s.
The injured man was taken to Raigmore Hospital for treatment to his face. He has been receiving support from police.
Sgt Craig Stuart, of Police Scotland and who is leading the investigation, said incidents "of this nature" were "unheard of" in Inverness.
The man suspected of the attack has been described as being about 6ft tall, of a slim build with "very scruffy" dark - possibly shoulder length - hair.
He was dressed in black trousers, a blue anorak and was carrying a grey rucksack.
He was seen in the Culcabock Road area before crossing over onto Kingsmills Road. The attack happened on a street near Fraser Park.
Sgt Stuart said:  "The elderly man involved sustained facial injuries as a result of this incident and was taken to hospital for treatment.
"He was understandably shaken by what happened and we are liaising closely with him to provide support.
"Incidents of this nature are unheard of in the area - and in the city generally - which makes this particularly disappointing.
"I can reassure the local community that all efforts are being made to identify and trace the person responsible."
Police have appealed for witnesses.
