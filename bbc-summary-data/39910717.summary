Championship Rovers lost a penalty shoot-out against League One Brechin in the Championship play-off semi-final.
A brief statement on the club website read: "Raith Rovers FC announces that we have this evening parted company with manager John Hughes and assistant manager Kevin McBride."
Hughes, 52, took over from Gary Locke in February on a short-term deal.
Speaking to BBC Scotland after the play-off defeat, which ended 3-3 after extra-time, Hughes regretted that the team kept "shooting ourselves in the foot".
And he added: "I really feel for the supporters. This club, with the supporters, needs to come back strong.
"I feel for everyone involved with Raith Rovers. There will be repercussions, that's for sure, but I'm hoping that the club can stay full-time. This club will get back to where it should be.
"I've really enjoyed working with them. There are a lot of guys hurting in there."
Hughes played for Berwick Rangers, Swansea City, Falkirk, Celtic, Hibernian and Ayr United.
He led Falkirk to the top flight as manager before spells at Hibernian, Livingston, Hartlepool United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, leading the latter to their first Scottish Cup win two years ago.
