Stephen Akinyemi death: Nightclub attack 'may be relevant'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nightclub stabbing could provide a clue to the death of a suspected gangster, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen "Aki" Akinyemi died in a fight with businessman Arran Coghlan in 2010. A murder charge against Mr Coghlan was later dropped.
The coroner at an inquest into Mr Akinyemi's death said a nightclub attack in which Mr Coghlan was wounded two years earlier could be of interest.
The inquest heard a hooded man may have carried out the stabbing.
Coroner Bernard Richmond QC, sitting at London's Royal Courts of Justice, told Mr Akinyemi's brother John who was in the witness box: "One of the matters which may be relevant is any potential motive or bad feeling for your brother.
"This episode is one such episode."
The coroner suggested it was possible, "some people, potentially your brother, having been told what [the attacker] had done, helped him get away".
Mr Akinyemi said he was not aware of any cover-up.
Mr Richmond ordered the arrest of a man who, Mr Coghlan's legal team claims, had been in a bitter row with Stephen Akinyemi because they used the same nickname.
He described Phil Atkinson's absence from the inquest as "both voluntary and intentional".
David Mason QC, representing Mr Coghlan, had previously told the inquest both men had Porsches with the number plate 'Aki'."
Concerning the death of Stephen  Akinyemi, Mr Coghlan told a previous inquest in 2011 that Mr Akinyemi pulled a gun on him and it went off during a struggle.
At the time, Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg recorded an open verdict, saying he had "difficulty" accepting Mr Coghlan's version of events.
Mr Coghlan was initially accused of murdering Stephen Akinyemi, but the Crown Prosecution Service later dropped the charge.
The inquest continues.
