Loyle Carner is a Liverpool fan, who says he started following the Reds after watching Michael Owen burst on to the scene at the 1998 World Cup.
"I basically became a Liverpool fan through a love of Michael Owen," he told BBC Sport. "When I was really young I was watching England play Argentina with my dad and I saw him score.
"I was like 'who is that?' and my dad told me that he played for Liverpool. From then on it just stuck. I started off just being hooked on Owen but then I realised I could not just support a human, I had to support a whole team."
You can make your Premier League predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results, with no perfect scores, from the 10 games for a total of 50 points.
He lost out to BBC NFL analyst Osi Umenyiora, who got seven correct results, including one perfect score for a tally of 100 points.

Match report
Bournemouth v Manchester City (20:00 GMT)
Gabriel Jesus rescued Manchester City with the injury-time winner against Swansea last week but I can't help but think he should have scored their decisive goal with his initial effort at goal, rather than relying on Lukasz Fabianski dropping the ball after stopping his header.
Football can be funny like that sometimes - imagine if he did not get a second chance, and City did not win the game. Instead of being the hero, people would have been asking how on earth he missed.
Swansea made life difficult for City but I think Pep Guardiola's side will have an easier time of it on the south coast.
The Cherries are conceding goals for fun at the moment - 16 in their past five league games - and they are always going to be open because of the way they try to play.

Bournemouth's run of one win from their past eight games has left them looking over their shoulders and, having been in mid-table for most of the season, they have now got some work to do to get safe.
Anywhere 17th or upwards will do for them, because another year in the Premier League will guarantee them enough money to continue to improve.
Looking at them, the biggest thing for them to address in the summer is bringing in better quality defensively.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Loyle Carner's prediction: 2-3
