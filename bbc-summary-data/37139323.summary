[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 1-2 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mansfield earned a win at Leyton Orient with second-half goals from Mitchell Rose and Matt Green, while skipper Liam Kelly netted for the home side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a closely-contested opening half, Rose broke the deadlock on 68 minutes when a cross by Kevan Hurst eluded the home defence and Rose was on hand to slam home the simplest of close-range chances.
Orient were back on level terms four minutes later when midfielder Kelly collected his second goal in as many matches.
Substitute Jordan Bowery fed him a pass and the former Oldham midfielder placed his shot from 18 yards wide of keeper Brian Jensen.
Green, who had been linked with a transfer to Orient this week, had missed a first-half penalty when he blasted his spot-kick high over the crossbar following a clumsy foul by Yvan Erichot on Krystian Pearce.
But all was forgiven when he popped up with the winner two minutes from time after Rose had chested the ball down into his path and the unmarked Green drove the ball into the net.
