There will also be a bicentenary celebration of the birth of Charlotte Bronte, led by Tracy Chevalier, Lionel Shriver, Kirsty Gunn and Joanna Briscoe.
Other writers bringing new works to the festival include Edna O'Brien, Fay Weldon, James Runcie, Joanne Harris, Rose Tremain, Peter Carey, Mark Haddon and Jonathan Coe.

As well as Mendes discussing his film-making, screenwriter Andrew Davies will talk about his recent acclaimed adaptation of War and Peace.
