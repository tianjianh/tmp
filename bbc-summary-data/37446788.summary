[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Kirk, 19, from Bannockburn, was driving a car which was involved in a head-on collision on the town's Falkirk Road on 3 April 2015.
As a result, a female passenger in his car suffered a serious leg injury which resulted in amputation.
Kirk was convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was disqualified from driving for 10 years.
Insp Andrew Thomson, of Police Scotland, said:  "This collision has had serious life-changing consequences for both Lewis Kirk and his passenger.
"This sentence demonstrates that this type of driving without consideration of the consequences is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
"I would hope that this custodial sentence will act as a deterrent to those who put others at risk by driving dangerously on our roads and would urge all young drivers to understand the risks involved when they sit behind the wheel."
The sentencing took place at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
