The Thai player finished five under after a level-par 72, two shots clear of Ana Menendez who carded a 75.
Due to her amateur status, Thitikul is not eligible for the 45,000 euros prize money (Â£40,000) - Mexican Menendez will receive the top prize.
Thitikul turned 14 on 20 February.
She said: "It makes me feel very happy and so proud of myself. This trophy, I give to Thailand and the Thai people.
"My family do not play golf. When I was younger, aged six, my father told me to play sport and he offered tennis or golf and I watched golf on TV and I liked it."
Canada's Brooke Henderson had held the previous record, winning an event on the Canadian Women's Tour in June 2012 aged 14 years, nine months and three days.
Henderson's record for a male or female player came in a 36-hole event, bettering the mark by two days set by New Zealand's Lydia Ko in January 2012 at the New South Wales Women's Open.
Ko held the record on the Ladies European Tour, having won the 2013 New Zealand Open aged 15 years, nine months and 17 days.
Menendez had started the final round at Phoenix Gold Golf and Country Club in Pattaya with a one-shot lead over Thitikul.
The 14-year-old opened with a two-under round of 70, shooting 71 in round two and a 70 in round three on Saturday.
Wales' Amy Boulden, 23, finished tied for fourth after a 73.
