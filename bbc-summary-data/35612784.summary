Axed RAF air show could return at another Lincolnshire base

There are hopes that an RAF air show in Lincolnshire that was axed amid security concerns could return to another airbase in the county.

The annual show at RAF Waddington ran from 1995 and attracted more than 150,000 people a year.
But it was abandoned last year after protests at the base, which is the home of the RAF's Reaper drones.
The RAF Charitable Trust (RAFCT) has said the event could return next year at nearby RAF Scampton.
Andy Armstrong, the chief executive of the RAFCT, said there was "still an awful lot of detail to be ironed out".
"This will be a completely new, unique event and will have all of its own style to it," he said.
"It will be what you would expect and I would hope that the RAF display assets would all be available.
"We would invite foreign air force participation and also planes in private hands as well."
RAF Scampton is located five miles (8km) north of Lincoln and is the home to the Red Arrows aerobatic team.
During World War Two, Lancaster bombers flew from the base on the 1943 Dambusters raid to destroy the German dams in the Ruhr valley with "bouncing bombs". Out of 133 crew, only 77 returned.
