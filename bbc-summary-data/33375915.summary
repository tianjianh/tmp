The new cabin-completion factory for A330 jetliners is worth a reported â‚¬150m ($166.3m; Â£106.5m) and is aimed at attracting new orders for Airbus.
The plant will be built alongside an existing site in the city of Tianjin.
The signing on Thursday was witnessed by China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang at Airbus's headquarters in France.
Earlier this week, China signed a deal for 45 new Airbus planes worth more than $11bn.
"The signature of this [latest] framework agreement on the A330 completion and delivery centre will open a new chapter of strategic cooperation on wide-body aircraft with China," said Airbus' president Fabrice BrÃ©gier.
"Together, we will develop new facilities and capabilities, and attract new suppliers and businesses in China," he added.
