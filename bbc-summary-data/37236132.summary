[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall have signed Scunthorpe left-back Scott Laird on loan until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taunton-born Laird, 28, comes in on the day that Walsall sold fellow left-back Rico Henry to Dean Smith's Brentford.
He began his career at Plymouth Argyle, where he was loaned to Torquay before moving to Stevenage in January 2008.
After four-and-a-half years at Broadhall Way, where he made 216 appearances, he followed his old manager Graham Westley to Preston, before joining Scunthorpe in June 2015.
Laird is new Saddlers boss Jon Whitney's 15th signing of the summer transfer window.
