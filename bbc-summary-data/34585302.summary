Canada reopens market to EU beef after long ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Canada is reopening its market to beef exports from 19 EU member states, lifting a ban that was imposed in 1996 because of BSE "mad cow disease".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK and Ireland are among the countries that can now sell beef to Canada. France and Germany - the EU's biggest producers - are also included.
The EU Commission said it was a welcome move, as EU farmers "are going through a particularly difficult period".
A Russian import ban and weaker Chinese demand have hit Europe's farm exports.
Last month the EU announced a €500m (£365m; $567m) aid package, following many street protests by farmers.
The dairy sector has been hit especially hard, with many producers saying current prices are barely enough to cover their costs.
The Commission - the EU's top regulator - said Canada's move was "part of a growing trend to recognise the robust, comprehensive and successful measures put in place by the EU to eradicate BSE".
The spread of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the 1990s - linked to a fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans - led to the mass slaughter of cattle and big losses for beef farmers.
The US has also resumed importing beef from the EU, under strict monitoring, a process that began with Ireland in January.
Canada has signed a far-reaching free trade agreement with the EU, which is now going through the ratification process.
