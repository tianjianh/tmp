[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people with life-threatening injuries have been flown to Southampton General Hospital and eight people with "serious injuries" to Salisbury, South West Ambulance said.
The collision happened in a field near Westdown Camp at 18:30 BST.
Three military ambulances were at the site of the crash.
A spokesman for South West Ambulance said a number of "walking wounded" had also been treated at the scene.
Wiltshire Police said: "The [collision] happened on a by-way which cuts through The Plain, hence why we were called.
"It is still regarded as a Wiltshire Police matter as it's on a by-way, although it's off the main road."
Salisbury Plain is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is the largest military training area in the UK.
It is understood that a two-week joint exercise between the Indian and British armies is currently being conducted at Westdown Camp.
