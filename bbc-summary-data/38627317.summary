Jack was knocked down in the first round but ended strongly and floored DeGale in the last round in New York.
One of the judges gave the decision to DeGale by 114-112, but the other two scored it 113-113, meaning both fighters retain their world titles.
Floyd Mayweather, who promotes Jack, called the decision "bad for boxing".
DeGale, 30, suffered damage to his ear drum and teeth during the contest but wanted a rematch with the 33-year-old.
"I thought I'd done enough but it was the knockdown," DeGale told Sky Sports.
"I've had 25 fights, I'm going to get better and I want the rematch.
"I'm glad I'm still the champion and I'm coming home with the title but I'm so upset that I didn't come with the WBC belt. The main thing is I didn't lose, I'm still the champion and I can move forward."
DeGale has now won 23 times, drawn once and lost once as a professional, while Jack failed to win for only the fourth time in his 24-fight career.
The British fighter was making the third defence of his IBF belt and made a bright start, knocking Jack down with a straight left inside the opening three minutes.
But Jack got back into the contest and had success with a number of body shots in the sixth round, and dislodged DeGale's gumshield with an uppercut in the eighth round, which later led to DeGale losing one of his front teeth.
DeGale landed some punches in the 10th, but was floored by a short uppercut in the final round, which ultimately cost him the victory.
Former five-weight world champion Mayweather said Jack would not fight DeGale again and would move up a weight instead.
"We don't need to figure it out, I'm the promoter this is my fighter," Mayweather said. "Badou Jack has got too big for 168lbs. We have plans after this fight to move up to light-heavyweight.
"This [result] is bad for boxing when it's all said and done, this is really bad for boxing."
