[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Meacher, 75, had been MP for Oldham West and Royton since 1970, retaining the seat with a 14,738 majority in May.
The funeral service was held at St Mary's Anglican church in Wimbledon Village, London, for Mr Meacher who died on 21 October.
Mourners included Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former leader Ed Miliband.
In eulogies from family, friends and Reverend Mary Bide he was described as a man of "great integrity" with "huge intellect and learning" and a "wonderfully dry sense of humour".
His son David told mourners his father "approached work and life with boundless enthusiasm.
"He would be moved to real anger and sorrow to hear about people who were suffering from benefit cuts."
Former Labour MP Chris Mullin referred to Mr Meacher as a "serial dissident," who was "razor sharp, had a boyish charm and a naivety that never left him".
"He had been calling for a national living wage since 1970. Almost to the day of his death he was thinking of ways to resist tax credit cuts and making plans.
"He never lost his radical streak or infectious good humour," he said.
A by-election for the Oldham West and Royton constituency takes place on 3 December.
