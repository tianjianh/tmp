The official participants - estimated to be about 4,500 people in 63 bands - paraded through the city centre as spectators looked on.
The main County Grand Orange Order march began at George Square, ending with a rally on Glasgow Green.
Police Scotland later said eight arrests had been made for minor disorder and alcohol-related offences.
It was estimated that about 4,000 people lined the streets to watch the marchers.
Earlier, a number of smaller "feeder" marches took place in various areas of the city.
Police had warned of the possibility of considerable traffic disruption, with a number of key thoroughfares closed off for the march.
A number of side roads leading to the parade route were also shut.
Speaking ahead of the event, Police Scotland Supt Alan Murray, the officer in charge of policing the event, said public safety was his priority.
He said: "As everyone should be aware by now, drinking alcohol in the street or in any public place is illegal and officers will be ensuring that people comply with this legislation.
"Previous experience shows that it is the unwelcome minority who use the event to drink too much and cause offence. However, be assured we will not tolerate any sectarian or antisocial behaviour."
Jim McHarg, Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said the parade comes after more than 4,000 Orangemen from Edinburgh and the east of Scotland recently rallied at Prestonpans in an "entirely trouble-free" event viewed by hundreds of spectators.
