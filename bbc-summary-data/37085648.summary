[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rob Newton scored a maiden double century to help Northamptonshire frustrate promotion hopefuls Leicestershire at Wantage Road.

Starting the day on 69, with the hosts at 142-4, Newton brought up a fine 202 before Northants declared at 397-7, while still 122 behind at Northampton.
Newton shared a steadying 81-run stand with Saif Zaib before Steven Crook joined him for a 101-run partnership.
Leicestershire saw out the final 15 overs to reach 49-0 and lead by 171.
However, the visitors' hopes of a win took a knock earlier on as paceman Clint McKay (2-78) was forced off with a suspected calf injury, which will likely force him out for the remainder of the Division Two match.
