Wreath laid in Gwaelod-y-Garth for 1875 Llan blast victims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wreath has been laid to mark 140 years since 16 men and boys were killed in Cardiff's only recorded mining disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The explosion at Llan Colliery, Gwaelod-y-Garth, was described as the most serious pit disaster of the year, with a 12-year-old boy among the dead.
Defective ventilation caused the blast and the overman in charge of the colliery was found to be negligent.
The service took place at Main Road, Gwaelod-y-Garth, at 11:00 GMT.
The pit was opened in 1872 by TW Booker and employed 300 people.
