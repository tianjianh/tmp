The short video featuring an officer dressed as a clown was filmed during an event for youngsters.
It was posted on South Wales Police's Twitter feed to warn young people to watch how they behaved as they went out out trick-or-treating.
A force spokesman said it received one complaint and took the decision to remove the video.
