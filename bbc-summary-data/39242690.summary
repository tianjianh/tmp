[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water has been restored to most of the homes which lost their supply after a mains pipe burst, Scottish Water has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 6,500 homes in the Castlemilk and Croftfoot areas of Glasgow and some parts of Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire had been affected.
Some properties lost all water supply, while others experienced low pressure or discoloured water.
A water main in Castlemilk Drive burst at about 07:00 on Saturday.
Scottish Water said engineers were still working on the repair but had been able to restore normal water supplies to the "vast majority" of affected properties.
Homes still without water are likely to be on higher parts of the network.
The company said in a statement: "When normal supplies are restored, affected customers might experience discoloured water as the system recharges.
"If so, customers are advised to run the cold water tap in their kitchen gently until the water starts to run clear.
"Scottish Water apologises to all affected customers for the inconvenience and thanks them for their patience and understanding."
The road where the burst occurred remains closed to allow engineers to work on the pipe.
