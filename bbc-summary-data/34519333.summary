Interstate 84: Plane makes emergency landing on US road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plane has made an emergency landing on a motorway in the US state of Idaho, just at the start of the busy morning commute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pilot of the single-engine aircraft was headed toward Boise Airport when he encountered a problem with the fuel tanks and the engine stopped working.
The plane "belly" landed on Interstate 84 - about a mile from the airport - without its landing gear deployed.
No-one was hurt in the crash, which snarled traffic for several hours.
Andy Patrick, owner of Boise-based charter business SP Aircraft, said the pilot was the only one on board the plane.
Mr Patrick said the plane, which was travelling from Seattle, Washington, was hauling cargo.
