[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-0 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry failed to score for the third league game running as they played out another 0-0 draw in front of their home fans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In fact City failed to muster a shot on target as Bury were well on top in the first period as they pressed Coventry all over the pitch and made it hard for the home side to create chances.
The visitors were, by no means, free-flowing going forward but they looked most likely to break the deadlock.
Full-back Greg Leigh ran 40 yards before shooting straight at Reice Charles-Cook and then centre-back Anthony Kay blazed over the crossbar.
Coventry's tactical changes just after the break brought them into the game as the pace of Jodi Jones and Kyel Reid finally gave Bury something to think about.
Jones laid on chances for Jordan Willis and Dion Kelly-Evans but both were off target while Reid was wayward with his shots on a couple of occasions.
At the other end Kelvin Etuhu could have won it for the visitors but shot over from 12 yards after a neat turn and then Tom Pope headed wide at the death.
