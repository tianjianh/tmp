MPs have branded the new funding relationship between BBC and S4C "a shotgun marriage".

The culture, media and sport select committee said it was "extraordinary" that S4C found itself governed by the BBC without having had any say.
In a wide-ranging report into the BBC MPs said it was "unclear" how S4C could retain its independence under the new funding arrangements from 2013.
A BBC Trust spokeswoman said the BBC was committed to an independent S4C.
S4C currently receives most of its funding from a government grant, worth about Â£100m in 2009/10.
However, after a decision confirmed by Chancellor George Osborne as part of last autumn's Spending Review, from 2013 most of its funding will come from the licence fee.

The BBC Trust itself says the BBC has no ambition to take over S4C and that they are committed to a creatively independent S4C.
S4C gets some revenue from the licence fee and they share S4C's determination that the channel should retain it's strong relationship with the independent production sector in Wales.
But it was all about this very hasty deal last autumn as part of the wider government search for cuts.
It all happened very quickly and what the committee says is that they think the overall licence fee settlement was reasonable, but the BBC has taken on lots of extra responsibilities not just S4C but funding the World Service, funding local television, funding BBC Monitoring and they say it's not at all clear how far the licence fee payer will actually benefit.
It's also not clear how far the BBC now needs to change the shape of its services to cope with all of this
In their report the committee commented: "The shotgun marriage of S4C and the BBC is an awkward match.
"We... find it extraordinary that the government and the BBC, which is fiercely protective of its own independence, should find it acceptable to agree a change in the funding and governance arrangements for another statutorily independent broadcaster, S4C, without the latter having any involvement, say or even knowledge of the deal until it has been done."
The BBC Trust spokeswoman added: "The BBC has no ambitions to take over S4C.
"We are committed to a creatively independent S4C, which attracts revenue from a range of sources, including the licence fee.
"We share S4C's determination that the channel should retain its strong relationship with the independent production sector in Wales."
However, John Whittingdale, chair of the culture, media and sport committee, likened the deal to a "takeover".
He also called for "greater clarity" on how the BBC Wales-S4C relationship was going to work.
"The BBC does talk about overseeing the spending of the (S4C) money and that does sound to us rather like a takeover,"  he told BBC Radio Wales.
"So I think there does need to be safeguards built in and there needs to be much greater detailed knowledge about precisely how this relationship is going to work."
He offered hope to opponents of the planned changes, saying the UK government had indicated that if it was not working then they would take the money back and possibly directly fund S4C.
They might also examine whether or not the money "could be spread more widely in order to support public service programming in Welsh".
Last week a report by the Welsh affairs select committee said the deal for S4C to be funded by the licence fee was made in haste.
They said it was "regrettable" that UK government ministers and the BBC agreed the deal in hours.
An umbrella group of unions and language campaigners, reiterated its call for the UK government, BBC and S4C to end talks and for the proposed arrangements to be scrapped.
"No-one wants this, it's not good for the Welsh language, Welsh language broadcasting or public service broadcasting in general," said the group, in an open letter.
