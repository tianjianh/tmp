ThyssenKrupp Woodhead Ltd, on Kirkstall Road, was under 4ft (1.2m) of water and suffered severe damage following the Boxing Day floods in December.
The company said it had been unable to reopen, with the risk of future floods leaving the site "permanently exposed".
It employs 93 people, with a staff consultation under way. A sales and engineering office will stay in Leeds.
The company, which specialises in springs for the automotive industry, has been manufacturing at the West Yorkshire site since 1999.
Matthias Koll, from ThyssenKrupp Woodhead, said: "We are shocked and saddened by what has happened to the Kirkstall Road site as a result of the Boxing Day floods.
"Since the flood, the Leeds employees have worked tirelessly in cleaning the plant, equipment and stock, and supporting production at overseas locations to ensure that our customers continue to receive products.
"In spite of these efforts, because of the severe damage to the production equipment and the ongoing flood risk, it is not possible to continue operations."
Options are being considered for a new production site, with "Eastern Europe the most likely location", the company said.
