Watson, 40, has been in charge of the team since Iestyn Harris' departure in July 2015, going on to guide them to safety in his first season.
The former Salford and Wales scrum-half kept the club up after they beat Hull KR in the Million Pound Game last year.
"We're looking to get some stability within the club," said Blease.
The 52-year-old told BBC Radio Manchester: "We like where we're going at the moment on the field. I think we've got a good group of players and Ian's delivering the right culture for those players.
"We've had a chat with owner Marwan Koukash and we've decided to enter negotiations with Ian to see if we can sort a longer-term deal for him."
Blease also said they are in talks with their players who are out of contract at the end of the season and announcements could be made within the next few weeks.
