[SN]TITLE[SN]
No overall control at Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council run by a Labour minority administration still has no overall control following the local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour lost its majority on Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council in February when two councillors stood down after not being reselected to stand in May.
A recount in the remaining Ravenscliffe ward earlier saw Labour's Sarah Pickup gain the seat from independent councillor Gill Burnett.
It means Labour retains 29 seats out of the 60, not enough for a majority.
The Conservatives increased their number of seats by five to 20 in the administration, which elects a third of its councillors each year.
Gill Burnett and Paul Waring stood down from Labour in February after they were not reselected.
Elsewhere in the local elections, Labour has lost overall control in Stoke-on-Trent and the Conservatives have taken control of Staffordshire Moorlands District Council and held onto Cheshire East and Stafford Borough Council.
