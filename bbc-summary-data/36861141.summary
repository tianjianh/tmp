The group that buys health services in York and Selby is being put into special measures, the NHS has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Vale of York Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) was branded "inadequate" under a new ratings system.
CCG leader Dr Mark Hayes, a former GP, has stepped down from his role, it has been announced.
Helen Hirst, the CCG's interim accountable officer, said the rating wasn't unexpected, and did not reflect the group's current performance.
"It is widely understood that the CCG is currently in a financial turnaround situation", Ms Hirst said.
The new performance rating was not an indication of the quality or commitment of its staff, she added.
John Lethem, a local GP on the CCG's governing body, said the news would not have "an impact on the treatment and care of patients".
The NHS in Yorkshire and the Humber has overseen the CCG's financial plans since 2015.
In 2013, primary care trusts were abolished and their finances passed on to clinical commissioning groups.
The Vale of York CCG serves a population of about 337,000 people in York, Selby, Tadcaster, Easingwold, Pocklington and surrounding areas.
