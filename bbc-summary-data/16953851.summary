February 2010: Strips Terry of captaincy after problems in his private life. Confirms Rio Ferdinand as his replacement.

June 2010: Confirmed as England manager for the remaining two years of his contract.
WORLD CUP 2010: Ferdinand injured on first day of training so Gerrard takes over as skipper. England draw opening games with United States and Algeria when Wayne Rooney condemns England's fans. Terry criticises atmosphere in camp. England beat Slovenia to secure a knockout phase berth, but Germany defeat them 4-1 in Bloemfontein. FA confirm they are assessing Capello's position.
July 2010: FA conclude their analysis and confirm Capello will remain in his job until after Euro 2012.

November 2011: Final games turn out to be friendly wins over world champions Spain, and Sweden, whom they had not beaten since 1968. Terry captain for latter game, with Capello stating he is "innocent until proven guilty" of racism allegations.
December 2011: Rooney ban reduced to two matches, and one suspended, after Capello says he made a mistake by not taking the striker off.
January 2012: Disagrees with FA over decision to strip Terry of captaincy. Tells FA chairman David Bernstein in private, then voices his opinions on Italian TV.
