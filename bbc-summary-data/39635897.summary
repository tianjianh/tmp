The 30-year-old will face Nina Meinke in a WBA lightweight world title eliminator.
"It's a massive fight for me on a massive night of boxing," said Taylor.
"I've only been a professional for five months and I've been lucky enough to box on some huge events, but Wembley Stadium will be something else again."
Taylor joins fellow Olympic gold medallist Luke Campbell on the undercard.
Briton Campbell, 29, faces Darleys Perez of Colombia in an an eliminator to become the mandatory challenger for the WBA lightweight title.
Taylor, who turned professional in October, saw off Milena Koleva last month to remain unbeaten in the professional ranks after four fights.
She also fought on the undercard of Tony Bellew's win over David Haye in London, stopping Italy's Monica Gentili in the fifth round.
Speaking about her upcoming bout she added: "I've watched Meinke and she's a very strong opponent. She's unbeaten so it's a step up for me and I'm sure she'll be very confident.
"It's my first scheduled 10 round fight so I'm relishing the challenge.
"I'll be in great shape come fight night and I'm just really looking forward to being part of such a historic event."
