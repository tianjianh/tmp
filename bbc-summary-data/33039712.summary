Victoria Street in Victoria flooded at about 18:00 BST on Saturday and the water gushed into several businesses including the Curzon Cinema, which had to be evacuated.
Fire crews then helped some people in the venue cross the flooded pavement.
Thames Water said a large pipe burst damaging the road but no customers were without water on Sunday.
A spokesman for the company said: "Our team is on site arranging emergency repairs.
"We apologise for any inconvenience caused and we will fix the pipe as soon as possible."
The road remained closed between Palace Street and Buckingham Gate on Sunday morning and several buses in the busy area were on diversion.
On its website Curzon Cinemas Victoria said: "Due to a burst water main, Curzon Victoria has had to close tonight (Saturday 6th June).
"We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
