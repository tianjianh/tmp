Jason and Shaun Dullaghan were working on Byfield Road in Wythenshawe when they discovered it at the bottom of a manhole.
An online campaign #ReuniteMe has been launched to reunite the medal, inscribed 32266 PTE W Harrison, with the soldier's family.
Jason said: "At first we thought it was a coin of some sort."
The utility worker, who is employed alongside his brother by infrastructure firm Amey, said: "It wasn't until we looked closer that we realised what it was.
"We know that getting the medal back to the soldier's family 100 years after the war is a long shot but it would be nice to hand it over to the rightful owners.
"We were really lucky to spot the medal when we did - another minute or so and we'd have cleared the drain and it would have been lost forever."
Tony Griffiths, from water company United Utilities, added: "We find all kinds of odd things in the sewers, from false teeth to stolen goods, but this is the first time we have found anything with such emotional value as this medal.
"It's sad to think how it was lost but we're glad to have found it now."
According to National Archive records, Private William Harrison served with the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment in France and enlisted on 15 December 1915 at the age of 20.
About 5,725,000 Victory Medals were issued after the end of World War One. Each was struck in bronze with a figure of Victory on the front and the inscription "The Great War for Civilisation 1914-1919" on the reverse.
Anyone with information about Pte Harrison or his family are recommended to call 01772 317500.
