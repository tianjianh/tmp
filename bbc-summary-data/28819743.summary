The 22-year-old competitor's car left the road and crashed near Fivemiletown.
Alan Elliott, from the Northern Ireland Motor Club which organised the rally, said the motorsport industry was "devastated" by his death.
Co-driver Dai Roberts, from Carmarthen in Wales, who was also injured remains in a stable condition in hospital.
Mr Cathcart was from Enniskillen in County Fermanagh,
Mr Elliott said the driver "came from a family steeped in motorsport".
"He, at 20 years of age, was into his second year of competition in the British Rally Championship and he had a very good and promising career in motorsport.
"The motorsport fraternity are just devastated, as we are, at this tragic incident."
The organisers have said this was the first major incident in the Ulster Rally's 35-year history.
The event is part of the British Rally Championship and attracts a significant number of spectators.
This year, it was scheduled as a two-day race meeting with stages across County Fermanagh and parts of County Tyrone.
However, following Friday's fatal crash, the organisers cancelled the remainder of this year's rally as a mark of respect to Mr Cathcart's family and friends.
The crash happened on the Fardross stage of the rally on Friday afternoon.
Mr Roberts was airlifted to hospital in Belfast in a police helicopter.
