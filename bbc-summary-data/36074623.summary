Christian Wade: Wasps winger's six tries 'a reminder' to England coach Eddie Jones

Wasps boss Dai Young says that winger Christian Wade's record-equalling six Premiership tries in Saturday's victory at Worcester might prove a timely nudge to England coach Eddie Jones.

Wade, who has won seven England caps, missed two months this season with a foot injury picked up in late November.
But, having missed the Six Nations, Young backs the 24-year-old to make the England tour to Australia in June.
"Hopefully it's a timely reminder to Eddie that he's still about," he said.
"There's not many better finishers in the game. I certainly wouldn't swap him for any other winger.
"He'll always finish the ones that need to be finished, but he'll score one or two tries that come out of nothing as well for you.
"If you expect him to score, he'll score. There are very few opportunities he doesn't take, but he also makes tries out of nothing - when there's not much space there and there's people to beat, he finds a way to score."
"He's been threatening to really cut loose over the last couple of weeks and things went his way at the weekend."
Wade's six tries at Sixways matched the Premiership record, set 16 years before to the very day by Saracens' Australian centre Ryan Constable.
One of Wade's England rivals, in-form Saracens winger Chris Ashton, is tipping him for further international stardom by suggesting that he should make Great Britain's sevens squad for the 2016 Olympic Games - in Rio De Janeiro in August.
"He is amazing at sevens. Impossible to defend. He's so jinky and quick off the mark," said Ashton. "I'm sure he's thinking about Rio. If I was him I would be too."
