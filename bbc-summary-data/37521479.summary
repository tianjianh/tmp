[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A programme to encourage more disabled and non-disabled people to enjoy being active together has been introduced by a consortium of partners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£4.5m Get Out Get Active programme will concentrate on "fun and inclusive activities" over three years.
Statistics show disabled people to be the least active group in the UK.
"For many of those we are trying to attract, these opportunities have been out of reach or unappealing," said EFDS chief executive Barry Horne.
"Changing people's mindsets is not an overnight solution and that's why we've called upon so many partners to help make it happen."
The campaign - funded by Spirit of 2012 - will take place in 18 areas in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Recently, 100 people involved in GOGA met in Manchester for the first group conference.
The other home nation disability sport organisations, as well as Volunteering Matters, Disability Rights UK, Women and Sport, Sporting Equals and Age UK, are backing the programme.
"It's a very ambitious initiative designed to increase physical and mental wellbeing by supporting physically inactive people around the UK to improve their health," said Spirit of 2012 chief executive Debbie Lye.
"The programme has the potential to change how we encourage, enable and engage more people through active recreation opportunities."
