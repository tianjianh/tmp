[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 0-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom-of-the-table York came close to securing their first National League victory since September but Torquay forced a goalless draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Minstermen dominated from start to finish at Bootham Crescent, with Jon Parkin and Rhys Murphy both troubling visiting goalkeeper Brendan Moore on numerous occasions.
Parkin lobbed Moore - and the crossbar - before stabbing wide in the first half, while Murphy came closest with an attempt at the near post in the 78th minute.
Torquay's best opportunity came in the third minute, Kyle Letheren forced into a smart one-handed save to deny Ben Gerring from close range.
