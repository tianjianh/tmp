Caithness Limekiln wind farm refused consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Energy Minister Fergus Ewing has refused to give consent for a 24-turbine wind farm near Reay in Caithness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Ewing said he agreed with the outcome of a public local inquiry into the Infinergy's proposal.
Highland councillors unanimously agreed in 2013 to lodge an objection to the project.
The move, by members of Highland Council's north planning applications committee, triggered the inquiry.
Landscape conservation charity, the John Muir Trust, has welcomed the government's decision.
It said the wind farm would have been constructed close to an area of wild land.
Helen McDade, head of policy for the trust said: "As someone who grew up in Caithness, I am delighted for the local community which campaigned strongly to prevent the unique character of this landscape."
