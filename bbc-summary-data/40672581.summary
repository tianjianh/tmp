Barry McNamee's first-half goal was enough to earn the Candystripes a 1-0 win, despite having to play the final six minutes with just 10 men.
Aaron Barry's dismissal put the visitors under pressure but Kenny Shiels' men held on to move above Bray Wanderers and Shamrock Rovers.
It was Derry's seventh consecutive win over Bohemians across all competitions.
The visitors made a bright start with McNamee flashing a shot just wide and they should have taken the lead in the 24th minute when Rory Patterson's goal-bound shot was touched by Nathan Boyle as he was returning from an off-side position.
The Candystripes finally broke the deadlock in the 39th minute when a shot from Ronan Curtis was saved by Bohemians keeper Shane Supple but McNamee reacted quickest to score from the rebound.
The second-half introduction of Ismahil Akinade gave Bohemians some much needed momentum and the striker was immediately involved in a tussle with Barry which earned him a yellow card and left the Derry defender needing treatment.
The pressure on the Derry defence increased in the closing stages when Barry was shown a straight red card for pulling back Akinade on the edge of the penalty area.
However, the visitors managed to protect their clean sheet in the final minutes to claim a valuable away win.
Bray's 3-1 defeat to St Patrick's Athletic at Richmond Park means Derry are now back up to third spot in the table with Shamrock Rovers travelling to face Dundalk on Sunday.
Derry next travel to face Finn Harps in a rearranged fixture on Monday night.
