Pep Guardiola: Man City boss bans unfit players from training

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has exiled some of his players from first-team training until they meet certain weight targets.

Defender Gael Clichy says the Spaniard has told his squad to avoid pizza, some juice and certain "heavy food".
"They are not overweight, but I want my players fit," said the new City boss.
"The weight is so important. When you are not fit, danger is coming. You're not fast enough or quick enough in the head. That's why you need to be fit."
French full-back Clichy says he is fully behind Guardiola's approach.
"For my part, it's the first time any manager has really done it," added the 31-year-old. "And we have a few players who are not training with the team yet.
"If your weight is too high, you're not training with the team. You have to know that if your weight is 60 kilos and you are on 70 kilos, then you cannot play football.
"Some people think that's normal but, in truth, it's not always like this. I know because I've been playing football for a long time. It's really refreshing and very exciting."
City face Borussia Dortmund in the International Champions Cup in Shenzhen, China, on Thursday.
The Premier League side's pre-season friendly against Manchester United in the Bird's Nest stadium, Beijing, was called off on Monday after the pitch was left unplayable by heavy rain.
Guardiola said that more care should have been taken over the state of the surface.
"The pitch was unacceptable," he said. "We didn't come here for a holiday. We came for two friendly games.
"Maybe there is a lesson. The pitch is the most important thing. Maybe nobody cared about the pitch. It was not about the water. It was because the people [organisers]didn't care.
"We have played on pitches in bad conditions but that pitch was impossible. It was unacceptable."
And the new City boss said that although he felt sorry for the fans who missed the match, the decision to cancel it was correct.
"It is about the fans," he said. "They paid for a ticket to see the amazing players from United and City do as well as possible.
"What would the game have been? It was not acceptable. That is why we cancelled. It was the right decision."
Referring to Thursday's match, he added: "We are so happy to finally play here in China."
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager also spoke about letting the players decide who would deputise for injured skipper Vincent Kompany.
The Belgian defender missed Euro 2016 with a groin and thigh problem which required surgery.
"He is the captain. If he is not there players have to choose the captain," added Guardiola.
"We have a lot of experience - Joe Hart, Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta, who have been here a long time. They have to decide who is the captain for them.
"I am not in the locker room. I am not in the meetings when they have to decide they need to change something. They have to choose themselves. They have to decide who is the best guy to represent them on the pitch."
