Bomb hoax accused Adam Busby 'unfit for trial'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of making hoax bomb threats and alleging water supplies were going to be poisoned could be unfit to stand trial, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Busby was not present to face the allegations at the High Court in Glasgow.
The 67-year-old is accused of two charges - dated between 2009 and 2010 - including one under terror laws.
It is claimed he told various Scottish media organisations that explosives were present at a number of locations.
They included the Forth Road Bridge and Glasgow's Argyll Arcade.
Mr Busby is also said to have made a threat to "contaminate" water in England.
He was extradited from the Republic of Ireland earlier this year to answer the allegations.
But he is yet to appear in a Scottish courtroom to face the claims despite the case calling several times.
His QC Gordon Jackson told the latest hearing that Mr Busby was "physically and mentally incapable".
Mr Jackson added: "He is never, as far as I can see, coming to trial."
The advocate said Mr Busby had flitted between being on remand in Low Moss prison and being kept under 24-hour guard in Glasgow's Royal Infirmary hospital.
The court was told prosecutors had now agreed to grant Mr Busby bail.
However, he would be transferred to a care home in the city's Drumchapel, where he would remain.
Describing Mr Busby's current mental condition, Mr Jackson concluded: "He really is done. Whether there will be steps taken to take him back to Ireland, I don't know."
Prosecutors moved to effectively shelve the charges against Mr Busby meantime.
However, the case could be re-raised should circumstances change.
