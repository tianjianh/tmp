Residents in Whiterock Gardens have followed the lead of their neighbours in nearby Iris Drive.
"It all started last year when the street got together for different events," said Whiterock Gardens resident, Linda Sloan.
"We had fancy dress at Halloween, the Easter Bunny at Easter and now, this summer, we organised this Euro sweepstake.
"I got the Republic of Ireland - I don't think I'm in with a chance."
Last week it was revealed that residents in Iris Drive were proudly flying the flags of the participating countries ahead of the Euro 2016 football tournament.
