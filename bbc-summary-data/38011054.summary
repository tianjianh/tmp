England took early wickets before centuries from Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara put India in control on the first day of the second Test in Visakhapatnam.

Stuart Broad removed KL Rahul before James Anderson had Murali Vijay caught at gully to leave India 22-2.
However, a 226-run partnership between Pujara (119) and Kohli took the early impetus away from England.
Captain Kohli ended the day on 151 as India reached stumps at 317-4.
It was a good toss for India to win on a pitch that will get harder to bat on, but Pujara and Kohli benefited from England's off-target spin attack.
Anderson, playing his first Test since August in place of Chris Woakes, took 3-44 but it was a tough day in the field for England.
"The day started brilliantly for England. After that, it was all India until towards the end," said ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on BBC Test Match Special.
Kohli has struggled against England in the past. He averaged 13.40 during India's tour of England in 2014 but his unbeaten 49 on the fifth day in Rajkot showed a determination to change that.
Arriving at the crease with his side 22-2, Kohli played himself in before putting away the bad balls. He punished the spinners when they dropped short, coming down the pitch to drive them to the boundary.
He offered only one real chance when Rashid, diving forward at fine leg, could not hold on to a pull off a furious Ben Stokes.
Kohli guided Pujara through a tricky period before lunch, the pair working away singles, before going on to register his 14th Test century.
"It's been a measured innings, and Kohli is never dull because he's such a beautiful player," said former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special.
England's spinners could not back up their improved performance in the first Test, with Kohli and Pujara refusing to allow them to settle.
Broad and Anderson's aggressive start snared two wickets, Rahul edging to Stokes at third slip before Vijay was caught via the shoulder of his bat.
The pitch began to break up after the first few overs but England found little turn. Zafar Ansari was targeted from the start, first patiently and then aggressively, and Moeen Ali could not keep a consistent line to either batsman.
It meant that the bulk of the bowling fell to Adil Rashid, who improved as the game progressed but still bowled too many short balls in his 26 overs.
"Cook has had to turn to Rashid to bowl in a role you would not expect," said Marks. "It tells you that he is more valued and trusted than he was."
Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special:
India have learned they can put England's spinners under more pressure. This is always the challenge for England bowlers, spinners in particular. Can they hold length? So far they haven't been able to do that. Ansari has bowled some right out of the pie drawer.
I look at Ansari, and he's a batsman who bowls a bit. Rajkot and the way England played is just a memory now. This has more of a feeling of what we saw from the spinners in Bangladesh.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:
It isn't quite a case of win the toss, win the match, but batting first in these conditions does give India a huge advantage.
England went 39 overs without bowling a single maiden and the spinners reverted to pre-Rajkot type, with at least one bad ball per over to be fully punished.
Pujara, who made 124 at Rajkot, began serenely before a half-hour spell that saw him narrowly avoid running himself out three times.
The 28-year-old has torn the anterior cruciate ligament in both his knees in the past, forcing him to have surgery and restricting his running at the crease.
Paired with Kohli, who used quick singles to put pressure on the spinners, Pujara struggled, twice setting off for singles and having to dive to make his ground. It took a word from the captain to calm him down.
He played patiently but struck the bad balls away, smashing Ansari for six into the stands as he hit 13 from one over. His century was brought up in emphatic style, a long hop from Rashid clattered away for another six.
It took the return of Anderson and a short, wide delivery to dismiss him as he tried to cut and edged to Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps.
When Broad turned at the top of his mark for the final over before tea, he was stopped by the umpire as a dog dashed across the outfield.
The groundstaff chased the dog off the pitch, before the dog evaded them and hared back on to the wicket.
The umpires were then forced to call tea midway through the over as staff, after throwing a shoe at the intruder, finally managed to remove the dog safely from the ground.
England bowler James Anderson, returning from a fractured shoulder, told Sky Sports: "I knew there was going to be some rustiness there in the early stages. To get into the game and get a wicket early, that made a big difference.
"It's the sort of wicket as a seam bowler, where if you get anything out of the day you feel as if you've really achieved something because there's not a lot there.
"It's one of those pitches where if you get in, and get set, you can bat on it for a long time. The cracks are already misbehaving a little bit so this pitch will deteriorate more than Rajkot."
India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, who made his third successive Test century:"I am happy with the way I started this series and I wanted to continue that today.
"Especially after we lost the two wickets, we wanted to build a partnership and bat through the sessions. I was confident because I scored a hundred in the last game.
"The way we have started anything above 500 is good for us but we just want to keep batting. Hopefully we'll build a big total and won't have to bat again."
