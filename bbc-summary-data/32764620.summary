He has faced criticism since saying he would be standing down from the assembly but would continue to lead the party from Westminster as an MP.
Deputy leader, Dolores Kelly, said voters had expressed concerns about Dr McDonnell during the Westminster election campaign trail.
But the SDLP executive said they would "support" Dr McDonnell.
"The party executive met today to discuss the result of the Westminster election," a statement said.
"We're delighted that the party has defended its three seats.
"The executive endorses the strategic direction and development of the party under the leadership of Alasdair McDonnell and will continue to support him in that regard."
Alasdair McDonnell has made it clear he does not intend to stand down.
Earlier this week, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan said the party leadership needs to change in time for next year's assembly election.
Speaking on BBC One programme The View, Mr Durkan, who stepped down as leader in 2010, said Dr McDonnell's leadership was "a real issue" posed by voters on the doorstep during general election canvassing.
"If Alasdair thinks that just resigning from the assembly deals with the questions, well it won't because these questions will all surface again once he resigns from the assembly," he said.
"As we move towards an assembly election, the questions won't go away and therefore I think if we're going to be in a better position to fight the election, then the leadership needs to change."
Dr McDonnell earlier rejected criticism by party grandees Seamus Mallon and Brid Rodgers that he should step down, telling the programme: "I'm not going to run away from a task half done."
