The East Kilbride-based five-a-side football company saw group sales increase by 1.3% to Â£33.4m in the 12 months to the end of December.
The firm said its performance had been aided by a modernisation programme, which included upgrading 136 pitches.
Last year Goals launched a new strategic plan following a major review of its operations.
It was set up after the company reported its first annual loss in 12 years.
Goals also brought in leisure industry veteran Mark Jones to lead the company.
Goals currently operates 46 centres in the UK and one in California. It is planning to open a second US centre next month.
In a trading update, chairman Nick Basing said: "I am positive that we have turned the corner with this result.
"The new refocused strategy under strong new executive leadership is working and I hope momentum will build further in 2017."
