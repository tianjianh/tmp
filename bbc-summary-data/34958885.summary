Newcastle United manager Steve McClaren says his side are "doing the right things" and will not panic, despite defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday.

That 5-1 loss leaves the Magpies second bottom and two points from safety in the Premier League after 14 games.
McClaren says experience shows him the club as a whole needs to stay calm.
"That's the key thing, that there's no panic. We know we're doing the right things every day," said the former England boss.
"Everybody knows and everybody can see that. In time that will turn around and work.
"We're having huge disappointments that I hope will toughen us up and make us stronger in the long run."
McClaren believes the players must adopt an element of "peer pressure" in getting the best out of one another, after conceding eight goals in their last two outings and scoring once in five games.

"The players have to learn quickly," said the 54-year-old. "The players aren't doing it for each other at the moment.
"Sometimes it's not about me, it's about each other. And that's a team. When you're playing, you've been a coach or a manager, the dressing room is about peer pressure.
"It's about pride, working for each other and not letting down the man next to you - at the present moment we've not got that."
But Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer does not believe Newcastle's current crop are good enough.
That, he says, along with a lack of "a plan" from the manager is why they are struggling.
"You cannot coach players who do not want to be coached, who are not good enough," said the club's record goalscorer.
"You've got too many Monday to Friday players; good in training, but don't want to perform on a Saturday.
"Recruitment; the guys in charge at Newcastle have got a way with it for such a long time because the players they've signed are just not good enough."
Next up for the St James' Park outfit is a home game against Liverpool on Sunday, before visiting Tottenham and welcoming relegation rivals Aston Villa.
And McClaren says his players need to start reacting better to setbacks if they are to turn their season around.
"The players lose heart easily: it's not rocket science, everyone can see it and that's what's happening," he added.
"We need to get to work and start winning games. We're in a relegation battle, and we've got to make sure we're right into that."
