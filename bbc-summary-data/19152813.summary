Communities across Wales were hit by Sunday's deluge and North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said they received 30 calls.
In Wrexham, homes and streets were hit in Llay, Rossett and Gresford.
Residents in at least four properties on Llay New Road are being rehoused while repairs are carried out.
Brother and sister Peter and Mandy Jones spent Monday surveying the damage at their father's home.
He is being rehoused for the next several months until repair work is completed.
They described the situation as "distressing" saying cars passing through Sunday's floodwater sent waves of water into their father's home on Llay New Road.
Wrexham council said it was assisting tenants at five council houses in Llay and two in Rossett and knew of other private homes affected by the floods.
In Pembrokeshire residents described an "ocean of water" after a river burst its banks near homes in Narberth.
And in Whitland, Carmarthenshire, five people were rescued by boat after their car was submerged in flood water.
