Jurgen Klopp: Where will the German manager go next?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jurgen Klopp has long been considered one of European football's most charismatic and coveted coaches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A difficult season at Borussia Dortmund may have chipped, very slightly, away at his burgeoning reputation but the floppy hair, the stubble, the designer frames, the unique sense of humour and the hugely engaging manner have long marked him out as a man who stands out from the crowd.
His decision to end his seven-year love affair with Dortmund came as a shock to many and immediately prompted speculation about his next move. Having ruled out a sabbatical from the game, BBC Sport looks in detail at where 'Kloppo' may end up next.
Manchester City: The latest information I have on the long-running 'Klopp to Manchester City' talk, is that the German is no longer on the club's radar. Now, clearly it is dangerous to be definitive about anything in football but it seems Klopp goes in the 'no interest in him' list alongside Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone.
In the past Klopp has hinted that his philosophy may not tally with City's anyway, having said: "I don't want the most money for a team because that brings problems. I don't want these problems." It is no secret that City, along with Chelsea, discussed Klopp as a candidate before appointing Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho respectively two summers ago.
At the time, he indicated that he wanted to stay with his outstanding young Dortmund team, intent on rising to the challenge posed by the arrival of Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich that summer. With Pellegrini's tenure looking increasingly under threat, City want Guardiola, although it remains to be seen if the feeling is mutual. Chances: 1/10
Manchester United: A year ago, Old Trafford felt like a very different place. David Moyes was no longer the chosen one, but the sacked one, and the search had begun for a new manager with Louis van Gaal very much to the fore from the early stages.
Klopp was asked whether he wanted the United job and responded by saying: "Man Utd is a great club and I feel very familiar with their wonderful fans. But my commitment to Borussia Dortmund and the people is not breakable." With Van Gaal in the process of turning United into contenders again, the door is now firmly closed.
It is far more likely we will see centre-back Mats Hummels making the journey from Dortmund to Manchester, than his manager. Chances: 0/10
Liverpool: The Liverpool owners may have had their faith in Brendan Rodgers tested at times this season, particularly in early December, but the Northern Irishman is very much their man for now.
Klopp's name featured prominently on the shortlist put together by Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group in the wake of Kenny Dalglish's departure in 2012, but he quickly made it clear that he had no wish to leave Dortmund, then champions of Germany.
Almost three years later and Rodgers has already mounted one title challenge and, for now, is still seen as the man to mount another, despite this season's problems. Chances: 1/10
Any other Premier League club? In an interview last November, Klopp made it clear that England was his next challenge. "It's the only country, I think, where I should work, really, next to Germany, because it's the only country I know the language a little bit and I need the language for my work."
With Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea apparently out of the running, it remains to be seen if he is still as interested as he was before.
West Ham are likely to be in the market for a new manager, as will Newcastle, but neither match the ambition of a man who wants to conquer Europe again.
Arsenal admire Klopp, the German admires them and - whenever the Gunners endure a rough patch - his is the first name on the lips of many of their fans. However, the chances of him replacing Arsene Wenger this summer are miniscule.
Wenger is less than a year into a new deal that runs until 2017, he has never broken a contract, his current team are looking better than any of their recent predecessors and few are calling for the Frenchman's head. In the future it might happen but, barring a disastrous end to the season, not now. Chances: 2/10
Real Madrid: The Bernabeu is certainly a potential destination for Klopp because Carlo Ancelotti's future is far from clear.
Notably, at a recent news conference staged to deny he was on the verge of sacking Ancelotti, Real president Florentino Perez pointedly stated Ancelotti would be in charge for "days and weeks" ahead - but refused to commit himself further than that.
The major stumbling block is Real legend Zinedine Zidane, who is being groomed as a future manager by Perez and is currently gaining experience in charge of the club's reserve team.
If this summer comes too early for Zidane, however, Klopp would be a major contender. Chances: 7/10
Barcelona: Despite leading his team to 20 wins from their last 22 games, Barcelona boss Luis Enrique may be out of a job after one season in charge because of presidential elections which will take place in June or July.
Current president Josep Maria Bartomeu is mandated to serve until 2016, but he recently brought elections forward by a year after a series of damaging scandals.
Former president Joan Laporta - Bartomeu's sworn enemy - is expected to stand for election, and whoever wins the battle will want to make a statement by appointing their own man as coach.
Whether Klopp is prepared to enmesh himself in Catalonia's political infighting remains to be seen. Chances: 5/10
Atletico Madrid: In many ways, Atletico Madrid are the best natural fit for Klopp in Spain.
Like his team at Dortmund over the past few years, Atletico have overachieved by marrying a fast-paced, counter-attacking style with whole-hearted physical effort, backed up by passionate fans who revel in their ability to get one over the nation's big boys.
Current Atletico boss Diego Simeone, though, has just signed a new five-year contract to stay at the Vicente Calderon and appears fully committed despite strong interest from elsewhere.
But if Simeone broke Atletico's hearts by making a U-turn and deciding to leave, Klopp would be the perfect replacement. Chances: 2/10
A manager jumping ship to join their biggest rivals, it could never happen could it? Unless your name is Harry Redknapp perhaps, no.
Treble-seeking Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has a watertight contract until 2016 and, according to chairman of the board Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the Spaniard is "unsackable".
Even if Guardiola chooses not to prolong his stay in Bavaria, there isn't a vacancy at Bayern until next year.
By that time Klopp will, rest assured, be safely installed as an employee of a money-rich Premier League club, where the effervescent German will astound everyone with his near flawless English skills, as well as his coaching ability and motivation skills. Chances: 3/10
A move to Italy or France would be very unlikely.
It's not that there is no love to be had in Serie A or Ligue 1, it's more like arriving at the disco two hours too late, everyone good is already taken.
It's hard to see Juventus divorcing Massimiliano Allegri, a man who has just masterminded a comfortable Champions League win over Dortmund in favour of the very coach he outthought over two legs.
Only Klopp knows for sure but it seems the established elite are what may well tempt him, but a move to (for example) Inter Milan is also unlikely. After too many years in the shadows of Jose Mourinho, former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini looks like he's beginning to turn things around there.
Despite sitting two places above Inter in eighth, their city rivals are perhaps the most likely (or least unlikely) Italian destination. Former AC Milan player Zvonimir Boban is one of many to voice strong criticism of current boss Filippo Inzaghi in recent weeks.
If he's likely to swipe "no" to Serie A on world's football's management carousel then the pool of potential in France may be even smaller.
If everything we hear about Klopp is correct it's hard to see anyone outside of Paris St-Germain or Marseilletempting him.
PSG have had a great season under Laurent Blanc and are in the Champions League quarter-finals as well as chasing a domestic treble.
While Marseille would have been screaming out for a suitor like Klopp 12 months ago, they are now firmly in a relationship with Marcelo Bielsa, who has them challenging again domestically for the first time in years. Chances of Ligue 1 or Serie A move: 3/10
