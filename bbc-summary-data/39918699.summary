The Tokyo Stock Exchange had given the Japanese giant until 15 May to report, but Toshiba said its auditors were still examining the figures.
The estimated loss for the year to the end of March is slightly less than it had predicted last month.
In April, the firm admitted its future may be in doubt.
Toshiba, originally known for its consumer electronics products, has faced a series of difficulties.
An accounting scandal, uncovered in 2015, led to the resignation of several members of the firm's senior management, including the chief executive, after the company was found to have inflated the previous seven years' profits by $1.2bn.
Problems came to a head again in January this year, when it became clear its US nuclear unit, Westinghouse, was in financial trouble.
Westinghouse was put into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, which protects it from creditors while it undergoes restructuring.
Toshiba is the world's second-largest chip manufacturer, with its products used in data centres and consumer goods worldwide, including iPhones and iPads.
It is widely expected to sell its computer chip business, in a move which could help shore up the losses.
But US-based Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main chip operations in Japan, has filed a request with the International Court of Arbitration to stop the sale going ahead.
