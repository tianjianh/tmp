[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen 1-0 Motherwell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen struck late to beat Motherwell and move nine points clear of third-placed Rangers in the Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Rooney twice came close for the Dons in the first half, heading over then having a shot saved.
Nial McGinn and Kenny McLean also tested goalkeeper Craig Samson while Well rarely threatened.
It looked as though the visitors had done enough for a point until McGinn converted Jonny Hayes' low cross in stoppage time.
The gap between Aberdeen and leaders Celtic, who host Rangers on Sunday, now stands at 24 points while Motherwell remain three points above second-bottom Hamilton Academical but are now just four ahead of Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
One thing about Aberdeen under Derek McInnes is that they find ways to win matches and this was another example.
It was the eighth time this season a late goal has secured victory.
They hit the same opponents for seven less than a month ago, but the points accumulation is the same.
For long spells they dominated Motherwell with Samson pulling several good saves out of the top drawer, in particular from Rooney and McGinn in the first half.
McGinn's goal came way too late for Motherwell to be able to do anything about it, slotting home from Hayes and once again underlining his value to the club and illustrating just why McInnes wants to retain his services.
And whilst the Steelmen left the Granite City empty handed again, there were plenty positives to take.
Motherwell came to Pittodrie with last month's 7-2 hammering still fresh in the memory.
That was an evening to forget for the Steelmen with former Well boss Mark McGhee's altercation with the home fans producing as many headlines as Aberdeen's ruthlessness.
But Stephen Robinson's impact has been clear to see since he took interim charge with last week's win at Kilmarnock a positive start to his reign.
They were resolute and continually kept their hosts at arm's length with Scotland squad keeper Samson looking determined to make up for February's horror show.
However, the long wait for an away clean sheet in the league goes on for Motherwell, having failed to do so for a year now.
Robinson has certainly strengthened his hopes of getting the Fir Park job full-time despite the defeat.
Victory at Killie followed by a strong performance in Aberdeen has certainly made a statement and the Northern Irishman has to be in pole position for the post after confirmation he is on a five-man shortlist to replace McGhee.
In truth, Motherwell were a shambles on their last visit to Pittodrie, but in just a couple of weeks Robinson has brought organisation to the leakiest defence in the Premiership.
Aberdeen assistant manager Tony Docherty: "It just shows you the spirit of the side - it shows we never know when we're beaten and today was an example of that.
"There was only one team here to win the game and the other team to try and spoil it and we got exactly what we deserved out the game.

"You credit Motherwell, they were here to stop us. They were stuffy. I thought their centre-halves played particularly well but we again found a way.
"It's a great finish from Niall but I wouldn't single out anybody. That was a real team effort to get over the line and get the three points and I feel we fully merited that."
Motherwell interim manager Stephen Robinson: "It's difficult to take. I thought we matched them every step of the way.
"We came here with a game-plan, we frustrated the life out of them. They had possession in areas that weren't going to hurt us. We defended very well.
"We get punished from switching off once.
"They worked hard. They worked the system we asked them to play and it's a massive improvement on the last time they were up here but obviously still very disappointed.
"We've done okay, we're really disappointed in terms of result and how it happened and where the five minutes of added time came from we're not too sure. You deal with that and we get on with it.
"I'm going to have a chat with the board on Monday, see what they feel about the club and where they want to take the football club and we'll go from there."
