An 81-year-old footballer - believed to be the UK's oldest - is looking for a new club to sign him up.

Dickie Borthwick, from Weymouth, Dorset, started playing football in 1947 when he was 12.
He had been a member of Wyke Veterans before it folded but admitted he is now "too old" for the Veteran's League.
He told The Mirror he had been invited to join a walking football team but said he wanted to take part in something more fast-paced.

Mr Borthwick, who recovered from prostate cancer three years ago, said he was "still mentally and physically fit" and "can still run around".
Ideally, he said he hoped there was a chance "these guys that are playing walking football can get themselves fit and maybe speed up a bit".
He added he was willing to travel anywhere in Dorset to join a team of people aged over 60.
He said he has scored about 400 goals during his 69 years on the pitch, and has never been booked in any of the 1,600 matches he has played.
