Charges against ex-Sport NI head McKeown dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport NI understands that an independent appeals panel has overturned the charges of gross misconduct against the former chief executive of Sport NI.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoinette McKeown was suspended on full pay in March 2015 and dismissed last November on the recommendation of an independent disciplinary panel.
However, an independent appeals panel has overturned the ruling.
It said it found flaws with the previous disciplinary process.
Ms McKeown had been appointed as the head of Sport NI - the body charged with encouraging participation in sport - in June 2013.
