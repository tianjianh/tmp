Froome, bidding to become the first man in 38 years to win the Tour and Vuelta in the same season, finished fourth on the climb to Mirador de Ezaro.
He is 11 seconds behind overall leader Ruben Fernandez, who came second.
France's Alexandre Geniez claimed his second career Grand Tour stage win, with Alejandro Valverde third.
"It's been a difficult season after a crash in Italy and I'm extremely happy for this moment," said FDJ rider Geniez.
Fernandez's fellow Spaniard and Movistar team-mate Valverde is second overall, four seconds ahead of Froome in third.
"I'm delighted to wear the red jersey. I did not expect to wear it today," said 25-year-old Fernandez.

Team Sky's Froome, 31, had displayed his remarkable climbing abilities in his third Tour victory this summer, and he put those skills to good use on the finale of the 176.4km route from Marin.
Froome eked out time on rivals Nairo Quintana and Alberto Contador on the short, but steep, 1.7km climb to the finish line.
Movistar's Quintana lost six seconds on Froome, with seven-time Grand Tour winner Contador another 22 seconds further back.
The Vuelta is the third Grand Tour on the cycling calendar after the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France.
Spaniard Contador was the last man to win more than one in a season - claiming the Giro and Vuelta in 2008.
