Former Middlesbrough and Bournemouth forward Tomlin, 28, has been used as a substitute for struggling Bristol City's past two Championship games.
"I don't know where people get it from. Me and the gaffer sort of laughed at it," he told BBC Points West.
"There is nothing going on. Niggles in training have kept me out of the team."
Bristol City have lost a club record eight straight league games and Tomlin has not scored since 3 December's win over Ipswich, the Robins' only league victory since October.
Tomlin starred during a loan spell at Ashton Gate last term, netting six goals in 18 games, prior to signing a three-year deal in July - but has been in and out of the starting side in recent weeks.
"I've been ill. I'm in a bad way at the moment," he added. "For me personally, from the the first month or two of the season, my standards have been nowhere near [what I expect].
"I've not been buzzing as much as I should be. I take full responsibility for that. I'm desperate to get back to where I was last season, when I loved everything."
Owner Stephen Lansdown has given Johnson his backing despite a run of 11 defeats from 12 league games that has seen the club slip to 20th in the table.
"The gaffer is doing the right things," continued Tomlin. "We speak to each other every day. I have so much respect for him.
"I want to get to the top again. I'm working so hard to do it. I'm desperate to win."
Johnson's side face Burnley away in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday before consecutive home league games against Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham on 31 January and 4 February.
