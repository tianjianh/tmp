As part of a survey carried out by BBC Sussex, more than half of those who responded said they had been emotionally affected.
The Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during a performance in August.
More than 140 people took part in the online survey.
Out of those who responded, 68% said Shoreham Airport should still host airshows in the future.
And 10% of people said they feel guilty following the crash.
52%
of people still feel affected by the plane crash
18%  said they feel anger over the incident
10% have described feelings of guilt following the disaster
One respondent wrote: "Attended as part of the emergency services response, [I have] empty feelings about not being able to help more of the victims."
Another wrote: "It was the most horrific, harrowing, terrible thing I have ever witnessed. I was distraught as I saw it coming out of the loop and knowing that he wasn't going to make it and thinking of the people on the road driving and watching.
"It is a terrible moment I shall never forget and thinking and typing now makes me shake and cry."
And another said: "It was horrendous, couldn't believe what had happened. Was terribly upsetting and had reoccurring nightmares of it for many weeks, couldn't stop seeing it in my mind."
The pilot of the jet, Andy Hill, survived the crash and spoke to the police for the first time on Friday.
An initial report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the jet had expired ejector seat parts and an out-of-date technical manual.
Its report said the seats were a "significant hazard" that delayed rescue teams until they were made safe.
