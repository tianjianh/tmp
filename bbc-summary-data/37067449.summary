[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 2-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Maguire's injury-time penalty gave Oxford United a 2-1 victory over in-form Peterborough at the Kassam Stadium, and their first win back in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maguire was tripped in the box by Jack Baldwin, who was sent off for a second yellow card, and Maguire converted the penalty into the right corner with the match in the third minute of added time.
Posh were bidding for a fourth win in five league and cup games this season, and had put five goals past Millwall in midweek.
But they needed a 62nd-minute equaliser from Tom Nichols, who fired Paul Taylor's cutback into the roof of the net, to get back on level terms.
Wes Thomas had struck straight after the restart to put Oxford in front.
Thomas worked the ball on to his right foot and saw his shot deflect past keeper Ben Alnwick just 12 seconds into the second half, before many fans were back in their seats.
Posh had the better of a scrappy first half. Simon Eastwood superbly tipped over a close-range shot from Gwion Edwards.
In the second half Eastwood made one outstanding save, spreading himself to block Jermaine Anderson's effort. He also showed great agility to prevent a miscued clearance from Josh Ruffels crossing the line for an own goal.
