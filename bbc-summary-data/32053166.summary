New consultation begins on T in the Park move plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The second consultation on T in the Park's proposed move to Strathallan Castle has begun after new information was submitted to Perth and Kinross Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority had requested an addendum to DF Concerts' original application, which has now been validated.
The first consultation drew a mixed response from the public.
A spokeswoman for DF Concerts said the new document "thoroughly answers" questions raised.
Perth and Kinross Council had requested additional information from the event organisers "to address issues raised" in consultation on the original plans, lodged in January.
Subjects covered in the addendum include wildlife, from badgers and bats to red squirrels and otters, and traffic management at the event.
The first 28-day consultation drew a total of 523 public comments, 274 opposing the plans, 240 supporting them and nine neutral.
Concerns have also been raised in recent days by campaigners and RSPB Scotland about attempts to relocate an osprey nest near to the site.
Comments on the new information can be submitted via the council's planning portal website. The authority aims to make a decision on the plans in May.
