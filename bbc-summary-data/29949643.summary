Millwall's footballers took to the pitch in camouflage colours on Saturday, ahead of Remembrance Sunday.

It's the first time an English football club has played in an army-style kit. They used a special Football League rule to make the tribute.
Rule 38 states: "Each club is authorised on one occasion per season to play a home match in an 'away' or 'alternative' strip."
The team lost 3-2 to Brentford at The Den in south London.
Lions fans had the opportunity to buy a replica version of the special kit but it's already sold out.
They hope it will raise more than Â£25,000 for Headley Court, a defence medical rehabilitation unit in Surrey.
Millwall marketing director Alan Williams came up with the idea.
He told Newsbeat: "The one thing I've learnt since being at the club is how amazing the fans are at donating to charity.
"We raise an awful lot of money by doing this.
"I wanted to give the fans recognition for being a real positive credit to the club and players.
"I wanted to do something for the anniversary of World War One and mark it in some way.
"We chose Headley Court because they do fantastic work rebuilding lives as well as bodies."
