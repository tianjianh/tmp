Swansea council scraps cheaper winter beach parking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Visitors to some of Swansea's beaches now have to pay full price for parking over the winter months after cheaper rates were scrapped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea council has made summer charges apply all year round as it looks to deal with £80m of savings in the coming years.
It means winter charges at some beach and foreshore car parks will treble.
The council said car parks "have to pay their own way and be sustainable" and changes will avoid a summer rates rise.
Car parks at Clyne, Southend, Bracelet Bay, Caswell Bay, Caswell Hill, Langland Bay, Sketty Lane, The Baths and Knab Rock all had a winter charge of 50p for an hour, but that will increase to the summer charge of £1.50.
Car parks at Port Eynon and Horton were free in the winter, but they will now cost £1.50 for an hour.
Blue badge concessions also face price hikes, while coach parking fees remain unchanged.
