A Suffolk man once known as the "fattest man in the world" has undergone an eight-hour operation to have excess skin removed from his body.

Paul Mason, from Ipswich, weighed 70 stone (440kg) at his heaviest before he had gastric by-pass surgery.
Surgeons at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York have carried out the operation to remove 10lbs (4.5kg) of loose skin.
Mr Mason, who gave up hope of having the procedure performed on the NHS, said it had "gone well".
"My arms feel like feathers and my chest is back where it should be," he said.
It is the second time Mr Mason has undergone such surgery after he had excess skin removed from his legs and midriff in May 2015.
Mr Mason, who lost 45 stone (285kg) after the initial gastric by-pass in 2010, said once he has recovered from the latest operation he will embark on a fitness regime.
"I will be having treatment for my severe arthritis in my knees and left foot, which will give me my mobility back," said the former postman.
Mr Mason said he plans to ride his bike, complete a 5km (3.1m) run and go regularly "to the gym and swimming pool".
He also thanked Dr Jennifer Capla, who donated her time for the operation, and her team, as well as "everyone else that made this surgery happen".
