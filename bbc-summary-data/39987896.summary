[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil McCann was "embarrassed" by Dundee's 4-0 loss at Hamilton, with the interim manager unsure on his future.

The television pundit took over for the post-split matches, replacing Paul Hartley after a run of seven defeats.
McCann steered his former club to safety, winning two and drawing one before finishing with two losses.
"I'm very proud to be involved with the team to get us out of trouble but I'm not proud to be associated with that," he said after the rout in Hamilton.
"Hamilton looked hungrier. They were aggressive and I have to question the desire of the players and the will. That's nothing to do with tactics.
"Both of our centre-halves were forced to play with muscle tears but there's no excuse for a performance like that.
"Hamilton wanted it more, they got it, and I'm embarrassed by the result.
"I happy that we're safe. That's the only consolation. The first three games, the boys were exceptional.
"In this league, if you are not up to the challenge and go and meet it head on, then you'll get rolled over."
Asked if the performance may have an influence on his decision to take up the position on a permanent basis, McCann replied: "Maybe.
"I have to take into consideration all of the five games," he said.
"And I'm a Sky employee. They've allowed me to come out of this job to do this one and the objective has been met. I've managed to keep the club in the Premiership.
"But that's not the way I wanted to finish the season. That was not acceptable.
"I'm not in a position to discuss my future right now. I'm still hurting about that result.
"That's something that I'm going to carry now for a long time because that's not something you want to be associated with."
