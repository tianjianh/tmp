The 77-year-old's career highlights will be celebrated at a gala in the city next April.
The society, which organises the annual New York Film Festival, said that Redford's "impact is hard to measure in many ways".
Recent Chaplin Award recipients include Barbra Streisand and Nicole Kidman.
The honour is given to the movie industry's most notable talents, and has also lauded Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin, after whom the award is named.
He was the first recipient in 1972, while last year's winner was director Rob Reiner.
Lesli Klainberg, the film society's executive director, said that Redford's contribution as an actor has been significant, but also pinpointed his work as founder of the Sundance Film Festival.
"Without the Sundance Institute and Sundance Film Festival, we'd likely have a different industry. And they continue to have a huge impact," she said.
"Obviously he's a star that many of us have grown up watching from his films in the early '60s to his current work.
"I happen to think he's also had some of the greatest co-stars ever, from Natalie Wood to Faye Dunaway, Barbra Streisand, and, of course, his great bromance with Paul Newman," added Ms Klainberg.
Redford starred in All is Lost in 2013, which was shown at the New York Film Festival. His performance was greeted with a standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere last year.
