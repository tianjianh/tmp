[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man admits Galashiels post office robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court has heard how the owner of a Galashiels post office was robbed by a masked intruder who jumped over the counter with a hammer in his hand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farrukh Sair, 33, was told to get on the floor while the man opened the till and took out the notes and coins.
When a customer entered, he too was told to get on the floor and forced to hand over his mobile phone and wallet.
At the High Court at Dumfries, Jordan Renwick, 24, of Galashiels, admitted the assaults and robberies in February.
The robber, who lived opposite the post office, smashed the lock of a drawer and took the week's takings, estimated at up to Â£2,500, as well as stamps estimated to be worth up to Â£700 from a second drawer.
Advocate depute Bill McVicar told the court that Mr Sair tried to grab the hammer but was punched about 10 or 12 times on the head.
Customer John Hardie, 61, who was also robbed, managed to escape from the shop during the struggle to flag down a passing car to call the police.
Renwick was seen running off towards the Gala Park flats.
He was later traced and a number of items from the robbery found at his home, including Â£293 in cash.
Mr McVicar said that Mr Sair suffered a cut to the back of his head which required six stitches.
Lord Burns called for background reports on Renwick who was said to have 30 previous convictions including an assault to severe injury and danger of life and an assault with a hammer.
Sentence was deferred to 26 June at the High Court in Edinburgh.
