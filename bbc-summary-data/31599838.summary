Key points: Greece economic pledges to Europe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greece's government has pledged reform to try and satisfy the demands of creditors in Europe while maintaining its pre-election pledges.

Below are some of the main points from Greece's list of reforms - contained in a letter from the Greek government to its European partners - alongside analysis and comment from BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker.
Andrew Walker: Improving tax collection has been a persistent theme in the discussions between Greece and its bailout lenders. It's an area where it's easy to see a shared view between the two sides. The idea of getting the well-off to contribute to the financing of public policies is right in line with Syriza's wider agenda. Anything that brings in more revenue and so helps stabilise the government finances is likely to be welcome to the lenders as well. Creating a new culture of tax compliance is a bit "motherhood and apple pie". Who could object? But it will take a long time to achieve.
Andrew Walker:The lenders are also likely to welcome the commitment to review every area of government spending and to identify cost savings.
Andrew Walker:There is more motherhood and apple pie on tackling corruption, smuggling and money laundering. The aim is not controversial. But will they be able to achieve significant improvements?
Andrew Walker: The line on privatisation is striking - accept those that have been completed and respect those that are underway. New cases are not ruled out, far from it. The letter only calls for an emphasis on maximising public revenue - which is after all one of the reasons there is a privatisation programme in the first place. How will this go down with Syriza, especially the left of the party? Even so the IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde isn't impressed on this point.  Privatisation is one of a number of areas where she notes "a lack of unequivocal undertakings to continue already agreed policies".
Andrew Walker:Also on that list is labour market reforms, another area that Ms Lagarde of the IMF regards critical for Greece. Even so, the party is likely to be suspicious at best of some of the labour market stuff that is included. Linking the minimum wage with productivity and competitiveness could well limit the scope for raising it, which was a central element in the party's election offer.
Andrew Walker: The independence of the statistical authority might play into the debt debate later. One idea has been to use growth-linked debt payments. That has more chance of getting off the ground if the growth data come from a genuinely independent and adequately resourced agency.
Andrew Walker:The humanitarian crisis had to be in there in some form. It was so central to Syriza's political campaign. But the commitment to use non-pecuniary measures and to ensure the fight has no negative fiscal effect shows how hemmed in the Greek government is. It will be hard to land many blows with such constraints on how they can fight.
