Reading's home Championship game with Fulham was abandoned at half-time because of fog.

Following a goalless first half in increasingly fogbound conditions at the Madejski Stadium, referee James Linington called off the game.
The match official had twice consulted with Reading and Fulham officials.
It was the second of Friday's four Championship fixtures to fall foul of the freezing fog, following Brighton's postponement against Cardiff City.
Much of the fog cleared during the interval and the second half looked set to take place. However, an announcement said that conditions outside the Madejski Stadium had deteriorated and the game had been abandoned.
Fulham had made the better start to the action that was possible, left-back Scott Malone venturing forward to send a low drive skidding wide.
With the fog getting worse in the 35th minute, especially at one end, the referee spoke to Reading manager Jaap Stam and Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic.
Mr Linington ruled the conditions were fit to continue but, four minutes later, he again spoke with Jokanovic.
The game resumed, Fulham keeper David Button saving well from Callum Harriott in first-half stoppage time, before it was abandoned.
Reading assistant manager Andries Ulderink told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"In the first half a couple of times, the fog was very, very bad and you couldn't see the opposite sideline. So the linesman found it very difficult to make a decision on a couple of occasions, to call for an offside.
"He didn't want to take the risk to make a bad call or one that he couldn't see, so that's what made the referee's decision to call it off.
"When you look at how things were in the first half, it's the right decision. But, when we came out again after half-time, the weather had cleared up a bit.
"But, it's hard for the referee to know what will happen with the weather and I understand he has to make that call before both sides take the pitch again, so it's the right decision."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London:
"The linesmen have explained they cannot guarantee doing their job and were not sure of what was happening on the other side of the pitch and they decided to cancel the game.
"It was not a decision that was in my hands. I am not involved in the making of this decision. But I can understand this decision.
"I am so sorry for our supporters. We are going to play another day and that's it."
