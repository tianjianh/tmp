A pilot had to abort landing as people were directly under flight paths of the aircraft on Friday at RAF Scampton, in Lincolnshire.
Red 10 Sqn Ldr Mike Ling said people were taking "unnecessary risks" to get pictures of the aerobatic team.
They are urged not to stand on private land and "jeopardise their safety".
Photographer Claire Hartley, who regularly takes pictures of the Red Arrows at the base, said: "I was on the other end of the runway at the time, but we saw the pilot abort the landing.
"We heard people were walking across the direct centreline as they were coming into approach.
"It's quite dangerous and quite worrying.
"The jets come in quite low, so it hinders their visibility as they are approaching and the person's safety as well."
Mr Ling tweeted the message: "Truly enjoy seeing the photographs that are taken everyday but it has come to the point where people are taking unnecessary risks to get those photographs.
"On Friday, Air Traffic Control had to stop our pilots performing circuits as there were people on the centreline of each runway.
"People are endangering themselves and others and ATC had no choice but to stop us. Thereby curtailing crucial training for our pilots.
"Could we please request that people think sensibly about where to stand in order not to jeopardise their safety and our operations?"
