Hampton Sainsbury's car park stabbings: Accused 'felt hypnotised'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of stabbing four women at random in a supermarket car park "felt hypnotised" during the attack, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ethem Orhon, 67, told police he felt like he was being "remote-controlled" before the attack outside Sainsbury's in Hampton, west London.
Mr Orhon said he launched the attacks because he felt "mistreated" by police.
He denies two counts of attempted murder and two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
Suzanna Brand, 53, Janet Morsy, 63, Jean Sullivan, 68, and Charandasi Chandiramani, 71, were randomly targeted in the car park on May 20, suffering "appalling injuries", prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said.
Excerpts from police interviews were shown to jurors at Kingston Crown Court
After being released on bail the previous day, Mr Orhon said, he went to the supermarket, which he described as "the most crowded place that I know".
Once there, he began "stabbing and stabbing", he said.
During the police and medical interviews, the defendant said he "became a different person" at the time of the attacks.
"There was one thought in my mind - which was go home, grab the spare knife and assault people," he said.
He added: "These were innocent people. They have done nothing to me. No conversation. I was out of control of myself. I was just stabbing and stabbing."
The court heard Miss Brand, was struck 13 times when she was attacked from behind, and left with two collapsed lungs.
Ms Morsy thought she was "going to die" as she was struck in the arm and chest as she tried to defend herself, the court heard.
Ms Sullivan was stabbed in the back, causing her chest wall, right lung and liver to be damaged, while Ms Chandiramani was stabbed twice in the back.
Mr Orhon, who is originally from Turkey, said he realised what had happened much later.
Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told the jury about Mr Orhon's suffered from paranoid psychosis, which may put a person out of touch with reality.
Jurors were also told the "bravery" of two Hampton Grammar School pupils probably prevented more bloodshed.
The boys alerted police, distracted Mr Orhon and warned other passers-by he was armed and dangerous, the court heard.
Under cross-examination the accused said he remembered assaulting one person and following two men - who turned out to be the schoolboys.
Mr Orhon said he "had no memory of going to the Sainsbury's car park" or of stabbing the women - contrary to what he said during the police interview.
He told the police he had "rushed" at someone in the car park and remembered "stabbing someone in the back".
Mr Orhon dismissed the prosecutor's suggestion that he wanted to take revenge on the police who had strip-searched him.
He said: "It was a police trap and I have been framed. If there is hypnosis, there is a conspiracy.
"Even this voice (on the police tape) is not my voice. I'm inside a conspiracy and these things are easily set up."
The trial continues.
