The 1999 Open winner has dropped to 424th on the world rankings from a high of 26.
"I hate the position I'm in," the Aberdonian told BBC Scotland. "I don't like not being a good golfer.
"I've been putting off an operation on my foot for about four or five years now and I'm going to go in and get it done this winter."
Lawrie explained that he has a bone spur and cist on his foot.
"Once I hit 100 balls, my foot is in total bits and I can't handle any more," the Scot revealed. "My game is not in the best of states.
"I'm going to go in, get it done and hopefully next year I'll come back a little stronger.
"I'm going to bite the bullet and it's going to be a couple of months recuperating with it.
"I want to be up there. I want to be challenging and I've had a few bits and pieces in the last few years that have stopped me.
"It's just so difficult when you've got an injury and you're playing against these guys who are all younger, all fitter, all stronger, all hitting it past you but you still feel competitive."
Lawrie, who is a vice-captain with the European Ryder Cup team, will be at Castle Stuart this week for the Scottish Open, which acts as a dress rehearsal for the Open at Troon.
"I can't wait," he added. "Castle Stuart has been a brilliant venue in the past.
"The thing a lot of players didn't want was to be battered on a golf course that was mega-tough before the Open.
"They didn't want their swing wrecked and Castle Stuart is just perfect.
"You want it to blow round there and be a challenge, but you don't want it to be silly tough before you go into the Open."
