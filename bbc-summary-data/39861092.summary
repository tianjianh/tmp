A London Underground advert featuring Khloe Kardashian, by the company behind the controversial "beach body ready" campaign, has been cleared for use.

The poster depicts the reality star wearing a leotard alongside the text: "Can you keep up with a Kardashian?"
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 14 complaints about Protein World's "socially irresponsible" promotion.
But it ruled the campaign did not "encourage harmful dieting behaviour".
The firm told the ASA the overall response to the advert was that it was motivating and empowering, and it did not believe it was socially irresponsible.
It added that Transport for London had approved the poster.
The watchdog decided the poster "promoted Khloe Kardashian's body image as desirable and aspirational; this was supported by her pose and the airbrushed style".
"We did not consider that she appeared to be out of proportion or unhealthy."
The firm's 2015 ad campaign, which asked "are you beach body ready?", drew 380 complaints amid widespread social media outrage.
Then, the ASA had already ruled the advert could not appear again in its current form due to problems with its health and weight loss claims, but it concluded it was "unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence".
A spokesman for eating disorder charity Beat, said: "Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses with very complex causes.
"While we wouldn't say they are likely to be the sole and direct cause of eating disorders, adverts that do not promote healthy body image or encourage restrictive eating habits can exacerbate the problem in people who are suffering."
