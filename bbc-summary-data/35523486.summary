Royal Shrovetide Football has been played almost every year in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, since at least the 17th Century.
The two-day event pits the Up'Ards - those born north of Henmore Brook - against the Down'Ards with the Up'Ards taking the first day's honours.
A second game will resume at 14:00 on Wednesday.

Buildings in Ashbourne were boarded up early on Tuesday to protect windows from the sometimes violent game.
The game was "turned up" by former Queen Elizabeth Grammar School teacher Barry Greenwood with the Up'Ards "goaling" the ball by banging it three times on a post at Sturston after three hours of ceaseless action.
The second game, generally a quieter affair played on Ash Wednesday, will be started by D-Day veteran Bill Milward on his 100th birthday.
He took part in the sporting tradition right up until the outbreak of the World War Two, when he drove an amphibious vehicle during the Normandy landings, carrying supplies to troops.
The honour of turning up the ball went to former Queen Elizabeth Grammar School teacher Barry Greenwood with a 99-year-old D-Day Veteran due to start the second day on Wednesday.
