[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A robot has demolished parts of a site associated with the first reactor to achieve criticality in Scotland almost 60 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dounreay Materials Test Reactor (DMRT) achieved criticality, a nuclear term referring to the balance of neutrons in the system, in 1958.
The robot, Brokk 180, was used to dismantle parts of the interior of the reactor's support buildings.
DMRT is part of the Dounreay nuclear power complex near Thurso in Caithness.
The site is being decommissioned and its buildings demolished.
Bill Lambie, who has been managing the project at DMRT, said the completion of the robot's work meant the support building could now be demolished.
He said reaching this phase was "a significant achievement, made possible through the skills, ingenuity and hard work".
Robots are frequently used in the decommissioning work at Dounreay, as they can operate in areas of the site with dangerous levels of radiation.
They include a 75-tonne machine nicknamed Reactorsaurus.
