[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan off-spinner Mohammad Hafeez has been banned from bowling in international cricket after his action was found to be illegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An International Cricket Council analysis of his bowling style revealed that his elbow exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance allowed.
Hafeez, 34, has played 40 Tests, taking 43 wickets at an average of 35.23.
He was reported after the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi last month, which Pakistan won by 248 runs.
The analysis on his bowling action was performed in Loughborough, although he can apply for a re-assessment once he has amended his technique.
Hafeez, who has played in 149 one-day internationals for his country, will be hoping to be able to bowl again in the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. That competition begins in February.
Fellow Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal is also currently suspended after he failed a biomechanic test in Brisbane in September.
