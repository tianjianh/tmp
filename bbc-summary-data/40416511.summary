England opener Hales made the highest individual one-day score at Lord's off just 167 balls as Notts chased 298 to win with 13 balls to spare.
Mark Stoneman had scored an unbeaten 144 off 149 balls in Surrey's 297-9.
They lost in the final for a third season in a row as Notts won their first trophy since 2013.
Hales, who hit four sixes and 20 fours, and Notts captain Chris Read (58) shared a 137-run partnership for the sixth wicket to guide the Outlaws to victory.
But it had looked like being a day to forget as early as the first ball of the match when Surrey's Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner for England, was dropped after edging a simple chance to Riki Wessels at first slip off Luke Fletcher.

The Outlaws also dropped century-maker Stoneman twice and fielded sloppily before recovering to restrict Surrey to just under 300 from their 50 overs.
While Hales dominated from one end, at 150-5, their run chase looked in jeopardy as the rest of the top order failed to provide support at the other end.
But former England wicketkeeper Read joined Hales and struck a run-a-ball half-century to play his part in a domestic final victory in his last season before retiring from county cricket.

In years to come, observers will look back on this final and call it 'The Alex Hales Show'.
Handed an early life on nine when Ollie Pope dropped what appeared a regulation chance at cover, Hales went on to punish Surrey, setting all manner of personal, ground and limited-overs records in the process.
He raced to his half-century off just 35 balls and then recorded the fastest Lord's domestic final century from 83 deliveries.
Smashing Sam Curran over midwicket for the first six of the game signalled his intent to dominate the bowlers, and he did so with a mixture of often effortless drives straight down the ground, or through the covers, and powerful pulls and slog-sweeps on the leg side.
Such was his dominance in the early stages of Notts' chase, his side were on just 133-4 from 21 overs as he reached three figures.
Registering his 150 from just 120 balls with a glanced four off Jade Dernbach, he broke a 52-year-old record for the highest individual score in a Lord's domestic final. Geoffrey Boycott's 146 for Yorkshire against Surrey in the 1965 Gillette Cup Final was the previous best.
Not content with that, Hales surpassed the highest one-day score at Lord's, beating David Boon's 166 for Australia v MCC in 1989 and then his own one-day best of 171, for England against Pakistan at Trent Bridge last August.
He still had time to set a club-best List A individual score, beating team-mate Michael Lumb's 184 of the previous season.
Before Hales stole the show, Surrey's Stoneman appeared likely to be the match-winner for Surrey.
Having been overlooked for England's first Test squad to play South Africa, Stoneman was handed lives on 32 and 73 during his 149-ball innings.
But the left-hander, who moved to The Oval from Durham in the winter to enhance his international chances, showed impressive application to guide his team through the 50 overs.
He became the first Surrey batsman to score a century in a Lord's final when he struck his 10th boundary.
After a first-class career-best of 197 for Surrey against Essex and scores of 58 and 86 for England Lions against South Africa A in the past month, Stoneman may not have to wait too much longer to make his Test debut.
In the first season of a revamped county calendar, the 50-over final was staged on the first Saturday in July, rather than its traditional end-of-season slot in September.
After a short turnaround between the group stage and semi-finals in mid-June, Lord's looked at best two-thirds full.
Tickets ranged from £30-£50, and the prices did not entice a surge in last-minute or casual sales.
Under the ECB's preference to play competitions in blocks of fixtures, the 50-over One-Day Cup is set to remain in its own designated block from May through to early July.
Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores told BBC Radio 5 live:
"It's a brilliant win. What an innings from Alex Hales - and fantastic for Chris Read to be there in the partnership to win the game.
"It's brilliant for the club, it's been a team job all the way through the competition."
Surrey captain Gareth Batty:
"It's a pretty bitter pill to swallow, but Nottinghamshire were magnificent today.
"I'm really chuffed for Chris Read, 20 years in the game and to finish like that is magnificent for him. Alex Hales was the man who took it away from us - no complaints."
