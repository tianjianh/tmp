[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 40 patients at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary are suffering from norovirus, the NHS has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four wards have been affected by the outbreak over the last eight days but two have now reopened.
Ward 14 and ward 10 are still closed to admissions, transfers and routine visiting.
A total of 44 patients currently have the bug and 11 members of staff have reported experiencing the sickness and diarrhoea symptoms.
Dr Martin Connor, consultant microbiologist and infection control doctor, said the visiting restrictions would reduce the spread of infection and ensure safe patient care and dignity.
He added: "Where circumstances are such that relatives are concerned about the need to visit their loved ones in Wards 10 and 14, they are asked to contact the ward before coming to the hospital.
"All members of the public who plan to visit other areas of the hospital are asked not to visit if they have symptoms of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, and to comply with the hand hygiene and infection control measures in place.
"About 50% of those exposed to norovirus (the winter vomiting bug) will also get sick. If you catch it, stay at home at least 72 hours after the symptoms stop."
