Thousands of people have turned out for the annual Dorset knob throwing contest.

The event in Cattistock, which also incorporates a food festival, sees participants hurling the locally-made buns in pursuit of a new record.
The existing record holder, Dave Phillips, lobbed his winning knob an astounding 29.4m (96ft) in 2012.
For the first time this year, winners were presented with a bronze knob, cast by local foundry Coles Casting.
Other games include guess the weight of the big knob, knob archery, knob and spoon racing, pin the knob on the Cerne giant, and the knob eating cup.
