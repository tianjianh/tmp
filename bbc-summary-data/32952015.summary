Caley Jags beat Falkirk 2-1 to win the trophy for the first time in the club's history.
Dozens of fans pitched up at the Caledonian Stadium to see the team board an open top bus.
Thousands more gathered in Inverness' Northern Meeting Park for a party. The crowds braved cold winds and cold sharp showers to applaud the players.
Those who gathered at the stadium were given shelter inside the ground from lashing rain.
