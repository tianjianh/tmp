[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A takeaway delivery driver was killed in a "snatch and grab" robbery for three pizzas, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pizza Hut worker Ali Qasemi, 45, died in May, two days after he was punched and left dying on the pavement in Peterborough.
Mark Lintott, 29, of Peterborough, denies robbery and manslaughter.
A jury at Peterborough Crown Court heard Joel Lawson, 25, of Norwich, admitted both charges ahead of the trial.
Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, said the pair had been drinking with friends when they plotted to take the food without paying.
"They intended to take it using threat or force," he said.
"Mr Lintott gave the restaurant a false address, so when Mr Qasemi arrived, he had to call the number of the person so he had to ask where they were.
"Then they came out of the flat intending to take those pizzas by force."
Mr Perrins said Lawson punched Mr Qasemi, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head.
He told the jury: "While he was on the ground they collected the pizza they had taken from him and continued to drink and party inside Mr Lintott's flat.
"While outside Mr Qasemi lay dying, and a passer-by alerted the emergency services."
The prosecution said that although Lawson, of Goodhale Road, threw the punch, he and Mr Lintott, of Shrewsbury Court, were "equally responsible".
Mr Qasemi, a married father of two, died from a serious head injury following the attack on 8 May.
The court was told his wife Fawzia was pregnant at the time of his death.
