Aaron Ramsey could 'play in any team in world', says Chris Coleman

Wales manager Chris Coleman says Aaron Ramsey is a talent worthy of "any team on the planet" with the midfielder set to return for Saturday's crucial World Cup qualifier against Serbia.

A hamstring injury means Ramsey has not played for Wales since their Euro 2016 quarter-final win over Belgium.
The 25-year-old was named in Uefa's team of the tournament and Wales have been hindered by his recent absence.
"Take him out of any team and it's a loss," said Coleman.
"That's not a biased opinion because I'm a Welshman and we all love Rambo. I'm looking at it clinically. Playing in tournament against the top teams, he was head and shoulders above.
"In my personal opinion there's not a team on the planet he couldn't play for."
Ramsey's return is timely for Wales, who are third in Group D and two points behind leaders Serbia.
After an opening 4-0 win over Moldova and a creditable 2-2 draw in Austria, Wales were held to a surprising draw at home by minnows Georgia.
Their lack of creativity was glaring on occasions without Ramsey, who was injured on the opening weekend of the Premier League season before returning to action with Arsenal in their Champions League victory at Ludogorets on 1 November.
The former Cardiff midfielder played 75 minutes on that occasion, and made a second-half substitute appearance in the 1-1 North London derby draw with Tottenham on Sunday.
And although Ramsey's return to Wales training was initially hampered by a stomach bug, Coleman confirmed he would start against Serbia at Cardiff City Stadium.
"He's ready and he looks great," Coleman added.
"We were without him for the first three games, which was a blow for us - it would be a blow for anyone. It's disappointing and frustrating.
"So it's nice to have him back. He's not played too much football for Arsenal - of course he's going to start the game as we sit here now.
"However long he'll last, physically, we don't know, but we do know he's generally probably one of the fittest players playing football."
