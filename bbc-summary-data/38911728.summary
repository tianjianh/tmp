A nursery which was offered a stay of execution is once again facing closure.

Rocking Horse Day Nursery in Warmley, near Bristol, had its eviction notice extended in October to allow for a search for a new site.
But owner Julia Davies said 20 jobs and 70 nursery places were now at risk after a planning wrangle over an alternative site.
South Gloucestershire Council said it had suggested other options and was supporting the nursery's search.
The family-run nursery has operated out of its Grange School site for 25 years but the council wants the land back.
It had wanted to build on land at the nearby Sir Bernard Lovell Sports Centre but says the council has refused the move due to concerns over parking.
Mrs Davies said she was "devastated" at the news and "extremely disappointed to be back to square one".
A spokesman for the council urged parents concerned about finding a new nursery place to contact them.
