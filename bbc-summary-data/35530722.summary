[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At least 39 people were killed inside the Weiguan Jinlong (Golden Dragon) apartment complex in Tainan.
About 320 people have been rescued but more than 100 people may still be under the debris.
It was one of the few buildings to suffer serious damage, sparking questions about its construction.
With hopes fading of finding more survivors, rescuers are now using heavy equipment to knock down parts of the toppled structure.
Hundreds of soldiers are involved in the rescue effort, helped by high-tech equipment, sniffer dogs and cranes.
On Tuesday, distraught relatives frequently interrupted Mayor William Lai as he gave a briefing on the progress of the search, after the passing of the 72-hour so-called "golden window" for finding survivors.
An investigation has been launched into whether the construction of the Weiguan Jinlong building contributed to its collapse.
The shallow 6.4-magnitude quake was powerful but few other buildings were damaged, thanks to strict building standards on the earthquake-prone island.
