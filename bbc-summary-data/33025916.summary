Thousands had attended the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) final rally ahead of Sunday's vote.
The cause of the blasts is not clear, and the HDP leader has called for calm.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described the blasts as a "provocation" intended to destabilise the upcoming general election.
HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas also said: "All our friends should very careful and not to give in to provocation."
The death toll was confirmed by Mehmet Mehdi Eker, a Diyarbakir MP and the country's agriculture minister.
Speaking at his own election rally in the nearby city of Gaziantep, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu promised an investigation into the explosion.
"Whatever is behind this incident... whether it was a power transformer explosion, an assassination attempt, an act of provocation - we shall investigate it and get the result as soon as possible," he said.
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz denied earlier statements that the explosion was caused by a fault in a generator at the rally site.
"It suggests there was an outside agent," he said, without providing further details.
The fortunes of the HDP as seen as key to the result of Turkey's election.
Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu said at least 20 of the people who were injured in the incident have been hospitalised, according to the Associated Press news agency.
Under Turkey's electoral system a party needs to win 10% of the overall vote to enter parliament, which polls show the HDP are close to achieving.
If this does happen it may end the single party rule of President Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AK).
