The women, who are from Fife, were outside the People's Palace in Glasgow Green when they were attacked.
Police have described the incident, which happened on Friday, as a "violent and unprovoked assault".
Both victims were treated for facial injuries at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary before returning home.
Officers say the women were approached by a man at about 14:30. He ran off along Monteith Row towards London Road following the assault.
He is described as white, about 20 years old, 5ft 8in tall and of medium build. He was wearing dark clothing and carrying a dark rucksack.
Det Con Paul Fraser from Police Scotland said: "This was a completely unprovoked and cowardly attack on an elderly woman and her daughter who had come to Glasgow to enjoy a day out.
"Both victims have been left very distressed by the ordeal and have returned home to Fife.
"Glasgow Green would been busy around the time of the incident and I would appeal to anyone who saw what happened to get in touch.
"In particular we would like to speak to the driver of a coach who witnessed the attack and went to their assistance.  We would urge him to come forward as soon as possible."
