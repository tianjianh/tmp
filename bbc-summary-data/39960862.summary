Martina Zupan, a fourth-year product design student, designed and produced the product called "Colleggtion".
The process to make the disposable circular plate with tearaway cutlery currently has a patent pending.
Ms Zupan, 26, hopes to develop her idea into a business when she finishes her studies.
The product is one of hundreds of exhibits at Edinburgh Napier's More Than A Degree Show.
The student believes her tableware could help highlight the opportunities that upcycling waste eggshells can bring.
Ms Zupan said: "The idea literally came to me one day as I was making scrambled eggs in the house and after some extensive research I found that despite eggshells carrying a range of beneficial components, very little was actually being done to upcycle waste product.
"I tested eggshell powder in a range of formats - including adding it to muffins, into plaster for egg cups and even cement and other resins but it was the tableware idea that really caught my imagination."
She added: "I think I've managed to produce a sophisticated product that has the potential to highlight a new method of producing sustainable tableware and cutlery - it's been really exciting to work on."
Richard Firth, programme leader for the product design course, said: "Martina's commitment, determination and drive to try and try again has been rewarded in a design project that is truly unique with the potential to achieve real change with regard to how we think about materials, design our products and how we engage with producing our products within the 21st Century."
Edinburgh Napier's More Than A Degree Show is an annual showcase of creative talent from its School of Arts and Creative Industries and School of Computing.
The exhibition runs at the university's Merchiston campus and is open to the public from 19-28 May.
