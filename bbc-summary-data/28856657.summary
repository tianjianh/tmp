Green Party objects to solar farm near Reigate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a 60 acre solar farm in a field near Reigate, Surrey, have been opposed by the local Green Party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plans, submitted by Southern Solar Ltd, will be considered by Reigate and Banstead Borough Council.
Jonathan Essex, who is a Green borough and county councillor, said he objected to the farm as it would be sited on greenbelt land.
Southern Solar said the farm would provide enough electricity for 3,500 homes.
Howard Johns, from the company, said: "We have taken pains to site this in what we hope is the most sensitive place in the area on this particular farm."
However, Mr Essex, who represents Redhill East, said despite his party's support for solar power, solar farms still needed to be built "in the right place".
"Our first view when looking at this proposal is that it is on land that can be used for arable, it's in the green belt, it's in an area of great landscape value - it's not the ideal place to put something of this scale," he said.
"It would make more sense to put solar panels on farm buildings first and farmland second."
