The successful pitch, which was sent to Lego's Ideas website, included plans for a Tardis and figures including Peter Capaldi and David Tennant.
Lego have yet to reveal exactly what will feature within the set.
The initial concept, created by Doctor Who fan Andrew Clark, included monsters and villains like the Angel and a Dalek.
The images he has shared are of models he has made, rather than pictures of what the final product will look like.
"Both Doctor Who and Lego enjoy a particularly close relationship with their fans and I can't wait to see what Lego produce," said Marcus Arthur, managing director at BBC Worldwide UK.
Along with the Doctor Who set, Lego also announced plans for a new design based on Wall-E.
Emma Owen, UK spokesperson for Lego Ideas said: "We're extremely excited to announce that a Doctor Who and a Wall-E set will be released as our next Lego Ideas fan based sets, congratulations to the designers Andrew Clark and Angus MacLane!
"After receiving over 10,000 votes from the online community and having gone through rigorous toy testing from our expert panel, these awesome sets are on track to be on shelves later this year.
"The final set designs, pricing and availability are being worked out as we speak, so watch this space for the final details."
Previous Lego Ideas sets, which have now become a reality, include one based on The Big Bang Theory and another featuring a a range of birds.
