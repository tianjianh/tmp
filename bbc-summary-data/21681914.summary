Gloucester MP campaigns for dangerous driving laws reform

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gloucester MP is trying to enforce tougher sentences for those convicted of dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conservative Richard Graham is leading a campaign to increase the maximum sentence to up to 14 years.
Mr Graham said he is supporting the widow of Paul Stock, 53, from Tredworth, who died in March 2012 when he was knocked down by a disqualified scooter rider.
The man responsible for his death was jailed for two years.
Mr Stock's widow Mandy contacted Mr Graham to say the law needed to be changed to reflect the consequences of such a crime.
Mr Graham subsequently raised this issue in Parliament at Prime Minister's Questions.
Prime Minister David Cameron said the issue needed to be reviewed and the Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, agreed the maximum sentences for disqualified drivers who caused death or serious injury were too low.
Mr Grayling has since confirmed plans to include a new clause in a Justice Bill later this year which will increase the maximum sentence.
Mr Graham said: "If in due course just one life is saved by this new clause, then Mandy's determination will have been worthwhile, and I will be very glad to have helped make it happen."
