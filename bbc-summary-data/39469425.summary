Winks was taken off on a stretcher in the first half after injuring his ankle when he fell into the dugout.
Wanyama was also forced off before the break after taking a knock to the back.
Striker Vincent Janssen became the third injury worry when he was substituted in the second half.
Winks received oxygen after he fell into the Burnley dugout following an attempted tackle on Stephen Ward.
"He is in hospital now, doing scans. Now we need to wait," Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said.
"We wish it is not a big issue and we hope it's not a big problem for the future for him."
Tottenham are already without midfielder Erik Lamela, who will miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery on a hip injury.
Striker Harry Kane and left-back Danny Rose are also sidelined with an ankle and knee injury respectively, although Pochettino was hopeful of Kane's return.
"Harry Kane is good, he's doing things on the pitch and may be back in a few weeks," he added.
