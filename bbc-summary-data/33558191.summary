Police Ombudsman clears PSNI over arrest of boy, 14

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers have been cleared of allegations that they used excessive force when they arrested a 14-year-old boy in County Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager was detained in connection with a suspected petrol bomb incident in April 2013, but was later released unconditionally.
He claimed that two police officers threw him against a wall and that one officer nipped and verbally abused him.
But a Police Ombudsman investigation cleared the PSNI of the allegations.
A Police Ombudsman investigator reviewed footage of the incident, filmed from a police aircraft, and found that it did not support the boy's accounts of excessive force.
Having interviewed the officers involved, and reviewed relevant PSNI records, the investigator concluded there had been sufficient grounds to arrest the teenager.
