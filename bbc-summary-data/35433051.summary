Adam Haywood denied causing 29-year-old Louise Wright's death by careless driving in Nottingham in 2014.
The city's crown court heard Mr Haywood, 30, of Langley Mill, Derbyshire, had failed to indicate when Ms Wright was crossing a city centre junction.
A retrial will take place at Derby Crown Court on 19 September.

Ms Wright suffered "catastrophic" injuries as a result of the collision at the junction of Lower Parliament Street and Pennyfoot Street in July 2014.
The prosecution alleged Mr Haywood had not indicated and hit Miss Wright's rear wheel.
He previously told the court he had checked his mirrors while at traffic lights and did not see the cyclist.
He said he would usually indicate on approach to a junction but on this occasion he could not remember if he had done so.
He had not realised anything was wrong until he heard people screaming and shouting, he said.
Judge James Sampson said the reason for discharging the jury could not be reported.
