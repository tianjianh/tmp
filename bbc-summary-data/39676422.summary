[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland v Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland manager David Moyes has fitness concerns over four players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Cattermole, Darron Gibson, Jack Rodwell and Jason Denayer are all nursing injuries and will be assessed, while Sebastian Larsson must complete a three-match ban.
Bournemouth midfielder Dan Gosling will miss the game because of a calf problem sustained in last weekend's 4-0 win over Middlesbrough.
Cherries manager Eddie Howe otherwise has no fresh injury concerns.
Steve Bower: "Sunderland's mission has looked bleak for some time; defeat at Middlesbrough in the week made it impossible and 10 successive seasons in the top flight will come to an end if they fail to at least match Hull's result at Southampton.
"The one remaining hope is that they go down fighting, although even that is looking increasingly unlikely. A team that have failed to score in 17 of their 32 games were always going to be in the bottom three.
"Bournemouth's comfortable win against Middlesbrough last weekend was a welcome one.
"Now they have been challenged to avoid their season tailing off and get the five points needed to beat last season's tally."

Sunderland manager David Moyes: "While we still have a chance we will keep fighting. We want a winning momentum and we want to rediscover that winning feeling.
"A long-term plan is definitely needed for this football club. Unfortunately, a lot of people want to talk about it but they don't actually want to see that this is the way it has to happen.
"But we will put it in place. There are a lot of things done behind the scenes we are trying to improve on."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "It is difficult to have sympathy with an opposition manager until after the game as the focus is so much on your team.
"We would love to get over 40 points this weekend, that is the one every one talks about, then we can move on from there.
"We will not be underestimating Sunderland. I have seen many amazing things in football, so our mentality has to be to go out against a tough side fighting for their lives."
Sunderland have not won at home since 17 December, and I cannot see that run ending against Bournemouth.
The Cherries are all but safe after hammering Middlesbrough last time out, and I don't think it will be long until they are mathematically sure of staying up.
