On the way to what would have been one of the biggest games in their history, the team - and journalists travelling with them - had shared pictures and video on social media, describing the journey as "the flight to history".
But as the news emerged of the crash, excitement turned to shock and disbelief with supporters tweeting "#ForÃ§aChape", meaning "Strength to Chape". It quickly became the top trend on Twitter.
Police say six people survived the crash, but the rest of those on board are thought to have died including many Chapecoense players and the head coach.
There has been an outpouring of grief and support on social media, while fans gathered close to Chapecoense's home ground.
In a poignant tribute to the victims, Chapecoense changed the colour of their logo on Twitter from its usual green and white colours to black.
Atletico Nacional, the club they were due to play in the final of the Copa Sudamericana added a black ribbon to their crest on Twitter as a mark of respect. The club has suggested people go to the stadium where the match would have been played tomorrow dressed in white and carrying candles as symbols of solidarity.
Several other Brazilian clubs shared messages of solidarity on social media, including Brazilian champions Palmeiras, Vasco da Gama, Flamengo and Corinthians. Writing on Twitter, Brazilian football icon Pele offered his condolences to the victims.
"Brazilian football is in mourning," he said.
"It is such a tragic loss.
"My sincere condolences to the families of the deceased. Rest in peace."
Neymar, the FC Barcelona forward and most celebrated Brazilian footballer playing today, used the prayer emoji to mark the tragedy.
Atletico Madrid, whose former player Cleber Santana, was on board tweeted, "We are shocked by the plane crash, which carried the Chapecoense team and our former player Cleber Santana."
And outside of Brazil, members of the football community around the world have been quick to offer their own condolences, including England captain Wayne Rooney and Manchester United teammate David de Gea.
Spanish team Real Madrid tweeted a picture of the squad holding a minute's silence before training on Tuesday as a mark of respect to the victims, while FC Barcelona's Denis Suarez also shared an image of his team paying their respects.
