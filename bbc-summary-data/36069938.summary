Police are investigating the death of a man who was found near a Highland harbour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers found the 61-year-old on the ground close to Kyle of Lochalsh harbour in the early hours of Saturday.
It is thought he had been there for some time before he was taken to hospital where he died on Sunday.
Detectives were keen to establish his movements and appealed for anyone who was in the harbour area on Friday night or Saturday morning to contact them.
The man, who was known locally, was wearing blue jeans, a maroon top and a dark jacket with grey sleeves.
Det Insp Caroline MacKay said: "We are keen to establish how this man came to be lying at the harbour-side.
"He appears to have lain there for a period of time and was suffering from the effects of exposure to the cold when he was taken to hospital for treatment.
"We understand that he had been at the Lochalsh Hotel and the Co-Operative shop on Friday evening and we would like to know what his movements were after that.
"If anyone saw him or spoke to him that evening or Saturday morning, we would like to hear from them."
