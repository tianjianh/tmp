The Hampshire batsman, 18, has been named as skipper of the 16-strong squad, who leave on Wednesday and will play seven games during the trip.
"He popped into our training camp 10 days ago and it was great to see him.
"A lot of the guys found him easy to relate to and really down to earth," Weatherley told BBC Radio Solent.
"That was important for us. He's a had a tough time recently but he has done so well in the game and been so successful.
"To pick the brains of such a good player was really useful for the batting unit. As part of the unit I will be looking to call on his advice."
England Test captain Cook believes several members from the squad have the ability to make the step up to senior international cricket.
"It was interesting for me to see the next generation and see what level they are at.  I'm pretty sure we will see a few England players from this group," he said.
"It took me back to when I was an Under-19.  Eleven or 12 years ago I was in the same boat, dreaming of playing professional cricket, so it was great to come back."
During the month-long tour from 25 March-25 April, England will play a one-off four-day match against Australia Under-19s, followed by a five-match one-day series, with all fixtures taking place in Western Australia.
Weatherley admitted to being "happy and delighted" at being appointed captain and is relishing the start of the series.
"We've been together quite a long time, have had mixed results, but things are positive going into Australia," he added.
England Under-19 Squad: Hugh Bernard (Kent), Mason Crane(Hampshire), Ryan Davies (Kent), Will Davis (Derbyshire), Aneurin Donald(Glamorgan), Ben Green (Somerset), Haseeb Hameed (Lancashire), Max Holden (Middlesex), Mosun Hussain (Yorkshire), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Matt Parkinson (Lancashire), Brad Taylor (Hampshire), Callum Taylor (Essex), Aaron Thomason (Warwickshire), Jared Warner (Yorkshire), Joe Weatherley (capt, Hampshire).
