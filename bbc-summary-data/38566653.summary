The Belfast Telegraph says a "toxic election" looms following Monday's dramatic events and quotes a DUP source warning that it would be "impossible to see a return to devolution for a considerable time", if Sinn FÃ©in attempt to renegotiate the St Andrew's Agreement.
The Irish News shows Mr McGuinness leaving Stormont Castle looking through a rain-drenched car window under the headline "Into The Unknown".
Inside the newspaper, its political correspondent John Manley says it appears the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal was the catalyst that brought republicans "to their senses", but he adds that the origins of the crisis "go much deeper and reflect Sinn FÃ©in's growing frustration with the entire power-sharing project".
The News Letter focuses on Arlene Foster's accusation that Mr McGuinness had put "politics before principle" by tendering his resignation.
It also notes that Mr McGuinness appeared frail and sounded unwell as he spoke to journalists. Mr McGuinness has denied that his health problems had influenced his decision.
His health is a theme picked up by the Daily Mirror on its front page.
Elsewhere, it has analysis from Quentin Oliver, political consultant at Stratagem, who says Sinn FÃ©in has seized the initiative and left "their opponents gazing at their navels" by their surprise move.
The Irish News reports that 11 applicants to the RHI scheme have had payments suspended pending investigations. The figures were disclosed by Economy Minister Simon Hamilton in response to a question from SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan.
In other news, the Belfast Telegraph has an interview with the mother of student Enda Dolan who died after he was struck by a van on Belfast's Malone Road in October 2014. The drunk driver who knocked down and killed the student, had his sentence increased  on Monday.
Enda's mother Niamh said she had not "slept properly" since her son's death.
The News Letter continues its coverage of a County Tyrone man who is due to stand trial next month on charges linked to the murder of prison officer David Black, but who has not been seen since November.
It says the police ombudsman is considering the "relatively unusual step" of starting an investigation into the PSNI's handling of a situation which led to the revoking of the accused's bail.
Meanwhile, on a lighter note in the Daily Mirror, U2 star Adam Clayton has said the group has "unfinished business" as they return to Croke Park in Dublin this summer to celebrate their Joshua Tree album.
"Before the Joshua Tree we were a small band doing good that some people had heard of - after the Joshua Tree I think everyone had heard of us," he added.
