The off-spinner, 30, has been named in the squad for this week's double header at The Grange in Edinburgh.
He is currently tied with John Blain on 41 wickets.
Gordon Drummond is in the 13-man pool after relinquishing the captaincy and Freddie Coleman is included after making 64 against Essex on Sunday.
New captain Kyle Coetzer skippers the side, with Preston Mommsen, who has scored 130 runs in two games against Hampshire and Essex in the YB40 without being dismissed, as vice-captain.
Five of the six players cleared to represent Scotland through a change in the rules on eligibility in January are selected.
All-rounder Rob Taylor is included after performing well for Leicestershire, while there is a place for Northamptonshire wicketkeeper David Murphy.
Matt Machan, Neil Carter and Iain Wardlaw will also be looking to make an impact.
"It will be an immense honour and a fantastic occasion which will fill me with pride leading out my country against a cricketing powerhouse like Pakistan," said Coetzer.
"More importantly though, we are seeing this as a great opportunity to showcase our skills and test ourselves against one of the best teams in the world."
The second one-dayer takes place on Sunday.
Scotland squad: Kyle Coetzer (capt), Preston Mommsen (vice-captain), Richie Berrington, Neil Carter, Freddie Coleman, Josh Davey, Gordon Drummond, Majid Haq, Moneeb Iqbal, Matt Machan, David Murphy (wk), Rob Taylor, Iain Wardlaw.
