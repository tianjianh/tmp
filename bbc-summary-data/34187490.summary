Gurpreet Sandhu hit Horace Downes as he crossed Brassington Avenue, Sutton Coldfield, to go to place a bet.
Mr Downes died of an infection four months after the November crash.
Sandhu, 27, of Church Lane, Handsworth, who previously admitted dangerous driving, was jailed for three years and banned from driving for seven.
He was driving about 56mph in a 30mph zone when he hit Mr Downes, West Midlands Police said.
Mr Downes, known as John to family and friends, suffered a life threatening head injury but was moved from hospital to a rehabilitation centre just over a month after the collision.
But he died as a result of infection after being readmitted to hospital in February this year. A post-mortem examination did not establish a link to the collision.
His family have since allowed footage of the crash to be released in the hope it will deter others from driving at speed.
Mr Downes's daughter Janet Turner described her father as "the heart and soul of the family".
Reading a statement at Sandhu's sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday, she said: "It is not possible to put into words the pain and distress felt by the family."
Sgt Adam Green, from West Midlands Police, said Mr Downes's family had endured suffering because of "the selfish actions of one individual".
"Gurpreet Sandhu was late for work on the day of the collision. He drove at twice the speed limit in heavy rain, in an area where the likelihood of pedestrians being present was high.
"In allowing the graphic CCTV footage to be released, John's family hope that people will realise the impact of speeding and it will prevent another family suffering the same consequences."
