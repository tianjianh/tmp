New footbridge opens over Forest of Dean river

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new footbridge over a Forest of Dean river is to be officially opened later, five years after an unsafe 350-year-old stone bridge was closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new wooden bridge over the River Lyd at Upper Forge near Lydney has been built by Forest of Dean Ramblers.
Members of the group raised Â£4,500 to pay for its construction by selling copies of a book of guided walks.
It has also been made a Public Right of Way after it was discovered the well-trodden route had no official access.
Project leader, Rod Goodman, said: "It's been a really long journey. Since January 2012 when it was decided the bridge would be replaced there have been a number of challenges along the way.
"We had to obtain permission to change the footpath from a Permissive Path to a Public Right of Way and resolve problems of potential dormice and Japanese knotweed, so we're really pleased to be officially opening the wooden footbridge for everyone to enjoy."
Alan Fisher from the group said: "When the bridge at Upper Forge was closed due to deterioration, it was necessary to provide an alternative route and the group's committee agreed that we would use the funds from the book to finance a replacement."
