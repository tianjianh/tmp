SSE Airtricity to cut prices by 1.3% from next week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's second largest electricity supplier, SSE Airtricity, is cutting prices by 1.3% from next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bills from other energy suppliers are also set to fall with the Utility Regulator reviewing electricity and gas tariffs.
The reviews will conclude during February.
This is to allow any changes to bills to take effect from 1 April.
The regulatory framework for energy in NI means movements in wholesale costs should be reflected in consumer bills.
It is expected that the fall in electricity bills is likely to be more substantial than that for gas bills.
Wholesale gas prices, a major component in both gas and electricity bills, have been falling in recent months.
The Utility Regulator regulates the electricity and gas prices for domestic and small business customers of Power NI, Airtricity Gas (in Greater Belfast ) and Firmus Energy (outside Belfast).
In a statement the regulator said: "We continuously monitor the components that make up regulated electricity and gas tariffs and then approve any resulting tariff change when necessary."
SSE cut prices by 8% in April last year - it said that with the additional cuts a typical bill will be Â£63 lower than a year ago.
