David Wood left his holiday home in Marie in the Alpes-Maritimes region last Tuesday, as reported in The Sun.
The family of the 61-year-old, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, said on Facebook police, mountain rescue teams and a helicopter were involved but there has been no sign of the "strong" walker.
The Foreign Office said it was supporting the family.
"It is with much pain that we have to report the disappearance of our beloved father, husband and best friend, David Wood," the missing man's son Danny Armstrong-Wood wrote on social media.

The 3.7-mile (6km) walk from Marie to Clans was "a relatively straightforward and a well-known route from the village", but it includes "sheer drops, rocky patches and a number of rivers".
Mr Wood is described as having "a full head of curly white hair".
He was wearing an orange cap, beige trousers, a brown T-shirt and walking boots when he set off.
His son said he was "strong, with a reasonable level of fitness but was recently diagnosed with slightly raised blood pressure".
Writing at the weekend, he said: "It is now the fifth night, our worry has turned to confusion, fear, sadness, and back to worry again, nothing is making any sense.
"Our concerns are that the sun might have affected him, or that he fell over then woke with concussion - maybe he walked down to the mountains in a confused state."
Mr Armstrong-Wood said his mother had called her husband twice during his walk.
"The second time he admitted to tiredness," he said.  "After these two calls his phone continued to ring, but he did not answer."
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with local authorities and providing support to the family after a British national was reported missing in France."
