Defender Callum Howe has signed a new one-year deal with National League champions Lincoln City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Howe, 23, spent the first few months of the 2016-17 season on loan at Southport and started just four league games for the Imps after his return.
But the former Scunthorpe youngster, who joined Lincoln in 2015, has now agreed an extension to his contract.
Captain Luke Waterfall and goalkeeper Paul Farman have also signed new deals since promotion.
