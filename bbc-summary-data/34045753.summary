[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tube strike suspended by unions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two 24-hour Tube strikes planned for this week have been called off after talks between unions and London Underground (LU) managers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tube workers have been in dispute with LU over rotas and working conditions on the new Night Tube service.
The Unite union said it had suspended its action as a "gesture of goodwill" to allow further talks.
Unions have put forward new strike dates of 8 and 10 September if a deal is not reached.
The industrial action scheduled for Wednesday and Friday would have been the third round of strikes this summer, following walkouts on 8-9 July and 5-6 August.
Unite regional officer Hugh Roberts said there were still some "remaining sticking points" but the union felt enough progress had been made to suspend industrial action.
He added he hoped LU would "seize this opportunity to reach a deal that fully addresses our members' concerns".
Rail union leaders met LU managers under the chairmanship of the conciliation service Acas on Monday in the hope of reaching a last-minute deal.
The drivers' union Aslef had already decided not to strike.
The night service was originally scheduled to start at weekends from 12 September.
LU has said it is operationally ready for the launch but unions believe it will be delayed because of the protracted row.
