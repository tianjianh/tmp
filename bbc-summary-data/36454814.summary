'Potty calls' cost London Fire Brigade thousands a year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London firefighters are called out about four times a day to rescue children who are stuck in railings, potties and toilet seats.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London Fire Brigade said that in 2015 there were 1,499 incidents of under-18s getting stuck in things and put the cost to the service at Â£488,675.
Some of the incidents have also included a toy train being stuck on a finger and a hand stuck in a door.
It was also called out to a 13-year-old stuck on a baby swing in a park.
Mark Hazelton, community safety group manager said: "I'm a father so I know it's impossible to watch your children every second of the day but with a bit of extra forethought and careful supervision it's far better to prevent youngsters getting in a tight spot in the first place.
"Many of the incidents we get called to could be avoided with a little bit of common sense.
"I would ask parents to keep an eye on their children and only call 999 if it is a real emergency."
The service released the figures ahead of Child Safety Week.
