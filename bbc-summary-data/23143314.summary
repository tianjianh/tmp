The cyclists, believed to have been on a Land's End to John O'Groats trip, were pronounced dead at the scene.
The lorry driver - a man in his 30s from Holsworthy, Devon - was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and later released on bail, police said.
The collision happened at about 08:30 BST on the A30 eastbound at Summercourt, near Newquay.
BBC reporter David George said the vehicle was a local articulated delivery lorry.
The road was closed eastbound between Fraddon and Carland Cross for most of the day.
Devon and Cornwall Police said officers were still identifying the cyclists' next of kin.
