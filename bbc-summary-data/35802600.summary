Transgender people in Wales need more support as they face bullying and barriers in many areas of life, the communities minister has said.

Lesley Griffiths has launched a Transgender Action Plan following consultation and focus groups.
Health, housing and sport have been named as key areas where action was needed to remove barriers, she said.
Young people will be made more aware of transgender issues, and action will be taken to reduce hate crime and abuse.
More people are identifying themselves as transgender at a younger age, the plan notes, quoting a report which suggests they could account for 1% of a school's pupils.
Anyone working with young people should be given specific training on transgender issues, the plan recommends, as well as staff and volunteers in areas such as domestic abuse.
Sport Wales will be asked to review guidelines on equality, after some transgender people reported problems joining teams or using changing rooms.
Employers will be offered guidance on how to support transgender people in the workplace via the Business Wales website.
"I am absolutely committed to ensuring barriers to trans equality are removed," said Ms Griffiths.
"I want this action plan to be a living document which can develop further as we continue to work with the trans community."
Welsh Liberal Democrats equalities spokesman Peter Black dismissed the plan as "completely unambitious".
"Our calls for a gender identity clinic in Wales have been completely dismissed, and many other important issues have been kicked into the long grass through endless reviews," he said.
