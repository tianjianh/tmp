Football League: Five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another managerial departure, a remarkable comeback, a ten-match winless run and a miserable return to a former club for one League One boss.

BBC Sport has picked out some of the day's main talking points from Saturday's action in the Football League.
Charlton's Guy Luzon became the 10th Football League manager to lose his job this season after a 3-0 loss to Brentford at The Valley.
The Addicks were third in the Championship after four games, but now sit 22nd after losing seven of their last nine fixtures.
Owner Roland Duchatelet is now left looking for his fifth manager since buying the club in January 2014, with only Damian Matthew having lasted longer than a year in the role since his takeover.
It is the second time Luzon has been fired by Duchatelet in 13 months, having been dismissed as Standard Liege manager by the Belgian in September 2014.
His dismissal also means that, on average, a Football League manager has lost his job almost every week since the opening day.
Kit Symons might also have been feeling the pressure this week, after Fulham owner Shahid Khan called for the Cottagers on Friday to challenge for the play-offs this season.
His team got off to a less-than-ideal start at Craven Cottage, falling 2-0 down after 49 minutes to goals from Lucas Piazon and Orlando Sa.
But Sa's strike seemed to spark the hosts into life, as three goals in six minutes from Ross McCormack, Alexander Kacaniklic and Moussa Dembele turned the game on its head.
Dembele's second goal put the result beyond doubt, as Fulham picked up their first win in more than a month.
Shola Ameobi had reportedly failed to win a contract in trials with four different clubs since leaving Crystal Palace in May, but the Nigerian finally found a home with Bolton on Friday.
And he made an instant impact for the Trotters in their 1-1 draw with Leeds United on Saturday.
The man who has made more substitute appearances than any other player in Premier League history did what he does best - come off the bench to volley an unstoppable opener past Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri.
It was the former Newcastle striker's first goal in English football since May 2014, and came only 20 minutes after replacing the injured Gary Madine.
Unfortunately for Ameobi, his goal was not enough to earn the Trotters a first win in seven games, as Mirco Antenucci's second-half penalty kept Neil Lennon's side bottom of the Championship table.
Peterborough ensured Doncaster Rovers boss Darren Ferguson's first trip back to London Road since leaving the Posh for a second time was one to forget.
Ferguson won three promotions and a Johnstone's Paint Trophy in his spells with Posh, but was unable to get the better of Graham Westley at his former stomping ground, as Peterborough ran out 4-0 winners.
The 43-year-old said he believed Rovers could challenge for promotion when he replaced Paul Dickov earlier this month - yet defeat leaves his side back in the relegation zone.
Swindon's miserable start to their League One campaign led one fan to return his season ticket, shirt and more than Â£1,000 worth of memorabilia earlier this week.
The Robins drew 2-2 with Coventry to avoid a ninth defeat in ten games, however, though they remain 23rd in the table, having been play-off finalists last season.
The Wiltshire club fell two goals down in chairman and interim manager Lee Power's second game in charge, as Romain Vincelot and Marcus Tudgay looked to have earned City a first win in three matches.
But on-loan Ben Gladwin's strike ended Reice Charles-Cook's remarkable run of 535 minutes without conceding, before Nicky Ajose's stoppage-time penalty rescued a much-needed point for the hosts.
