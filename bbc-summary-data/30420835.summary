[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A concert in memory of Ann Maguire, the teacher who was fatally stabbed in her classroom, will be held later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mrs Maguire was attacked and killed by a pupil at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.
Her attacker, 16-year-old Will Cornick, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years at Leeds Crown Court in November.
The concert, at Corpus Christi Church, Leeds, at 19:30 GMT has sold out. It features a choir consisting of many of Mrs Maguire's former pupils.
The 61-year-old mother of two had worked at the school for more than 40 years and was due to retire just months after she was killed.
Mrs Maguire taught Spanish and had a keen interest in music and the arts.
Proceeds from the concert will go to the The Ann Maguire Arts Educational Fund.
The charity was founded by the Maguire family to provide bursaries and funding for the personal development of people under 18.
Her daughter, Kerry Maguire, said: "I think it is very important for the family to continue her work and to bring something positive to such a devastating situation.
"My mum was a modern languages teacher however she also had a key role in the music education at Corpus Christi College, be that in a folk group or directing the choir.
"She always saw the student at the centre of her teaching and whether it was through the Spanish or through music, singing or guitar playing, she understood that through the arts she could allow the child to further develop."
She said the family had been very grateful for the support and help they had received from many of Mrs Maguire's former students.
