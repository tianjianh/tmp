Police called in the underwater team to help recover the weapon and ammunition, still missing after the shooting at Headley, near Epsom.
The 34-year-old victim, who is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be from the Croydon area.
Two suspects arrested after the shooting on Monday remain in custody.
A 38-year-old man from London is being held on suspicion of murder.  A 30-year old woman is being questioned on suspicion of assisting an offender.
More than 400 people were at the private party at a hired house in the village.
The annual event had been organised by reggae dancehall artist Jason White and his girlfriend Summerlyn Farquharson.
He told BBC Newsbeat they used seven security staff with metal detectors to check all the guests as they arrived.
The divers, from Specialist Group International in Dorking, returned to Headley earlier and part of the village remains sealed off.
