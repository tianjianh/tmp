Southend can learn a lot from Burton after beating the League One leaders, according to Shrimpers boss Phil Brown.

Goals from Anthony Wordsworth, Tyrone Barnett and David Mooney gave the play-off hopefuls a 3-1 win at Roots Hall.
"They're top of the league for a reason and that's because their basics are very, very good, and that's what we've got to learn," said Brown.
"I thought we outdid the best basic team in the division with the basics and consequently we've won the game."
He continued to BBC Essex: "I think we'll have a video session in the week to show them what I mean by the basics: the regaining of possession, being in the right place at the right time - it's not a fluke, it's good judgement from good players."
The victory moved Southend up to seventh, two points behind the play-off places.
But they had gone in at half-time level after controversy surrounding Stuart Beavon's 44th-minute equaliser for Burton, who have now lost three of their past six matches.
"At 1-1 at half-time, you're bemoaning your luck because of the way they got the equalising goal," said Brown
"A lot of people say the ball was out of play, but two three of our players stopped at that moment and consequently Beavon stuck the ball in the back of the net.
"Now the half-time team talk changes but I thought we were good for going in 1-0 up.
"It was a tight game, a little bit of quality in front of goal eventually won it, but you're never off the hook with this Burton team and you've got to beat them, and we did."
