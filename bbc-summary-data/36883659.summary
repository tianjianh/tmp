After recently having her three-month scan, the 25-year-old scored her 11th league goal of the season on Sunday to help the WSL 2 leaders beat Durham 4-0.
The Wales striker previously spent six months with Manchester City Women before re-joining Yeovil in 2015.
"It was a massive surprise. Obviously, I'm very happy," she told BBC Somerset.
"Not playing football is going to be very hard. I've been very lucky in my football career - I haven't been injured for longer than three months.
"But I'll be here every week with the girls and I know we can do it and push for promotion."
Wiltshire's fellow striker Annie Heatherson, who netted twice in Sunday's home win, added: "It's hard to lose a player who has got 12 goals under her belt, but it's for amazing reasons.
"She's been absolutely phenomenal for us this year. As much as we're going to miss her, we'll be OK.
"This is something I know she wants. She's getting married [this summer]."
Yeovil are two points clear of Bristol City Women at the top of the second division table, with two places available for promotion to the top flight.
Everton are third, six points behind, but with two games in hand on the Lady Glovers and Bristol.
On missing Wiltshire for their six remaining league games, Yeovil manager Jamie Sherwood said: "The squad is a strong squad. This just gives somebody else an opportunity."
Sherwood's side travel to Aston Villa Ladies on 31 July, before a four-week break.
