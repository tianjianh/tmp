Chisora threw a table at Whyte in Wednesday's news conference.
He has received a two-year ban from boxing, which comes in if he commits another offence, been fined £25,000 and told to pay another £5,000 in costs.
The British Boxing Board of Control withdrew their sanction for the fight being for the title, which Whyte keeps.
He has not been punished.
It remains a WBC world heavyweight title eliminator fight, but the pair will weigh in at different times and not face-off.
There will also be a hearing at a later date to discuss any action towards the other people at the melee.
During Wednesday's news conference, promoters and coaches sat between the pair but Chisora, 32, picked up the table and threw it at his rival, with security stepping in.
That came after Whyte, 28, told Chisora he would attack him after the fight if he saw him. Chisora, who has six defeats from 32 fights, said he was reacting to a threat on his life.
The fight was due to be the first British title defence for Whyte, whose only defeat in 20 professional fights was by IBF world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua.
Joshua headlines the Manchester Arena bill on Saturday, when he defends his world title against Eric Molina.
