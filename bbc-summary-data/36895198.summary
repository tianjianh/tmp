The 6ft 7ins helped Spanish second division side Marin to a league and cup double last season.
"He's got a vast amount of experience playing in Spain," head coach Paul James told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"We're really looking forward to having him on board."
Navajas, who will replace France-bound Pavel Losonsky, joins a new-look squad at the University Arena as James make a fresh attempt at winning silverware in 2016-17.
The 2014 BBL Championship play-off and BBL Trophy winners have already signed points guard Marek Klassen, forwards Danny Huffor, Jermel Kennedy, Deondre McWhorter and Trevor Setty, while guard Ashton Khan has agreed a new contract.
