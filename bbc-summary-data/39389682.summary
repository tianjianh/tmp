[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham boosted their survival hopes with a home win over 10-man Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With manager Gary Johnson watching from the stand as he recovers from heart surgery, the Robins started strongly.
Dan Holman's shot was cleared off the line by Aaron McGowan and Danny Wright's downward header bounced over the crossbar.
But Jordan Cranston tripped Paul Mullin in the box and Morecambe were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute. Michael Rose stepped up, but goalkeeper Scott Brown pulled off a fine save diving to his right.
Only a fine stop from Barry Roche denied Carl Winchester in the 15th minute.
Cheltenham opened the scoring in the 33rd minute when a free-kick was intercepted by Billy Waters who found Cranston on the left and his cross was nodded in by Harry Pell.
Wright put Cheltenham 2-0 up from the penalty in the 48th minute after Alex Kenyon handled Will Boyle's header on the line and he was sent off.
Pell crashed in the third from a 20-yard free-kick and Cheltenham were cruising before an own goal from Emmanuel Onariase gave the travelling fans something to cheer in the 79th minute.
