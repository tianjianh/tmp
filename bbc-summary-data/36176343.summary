Wednesday face Brighton at Hillsborough in the first leg on 13 May before the return at the Amex Stadium on 16 May.
Wolves went ahead when Michael Turner put Matt Doherty's ball into his own net while George Saville made it 2-0 from a Doherty cross before the break.
Wednesday's Lewis McGugan scored from the spot when Doherty handled late on.
The result means Wolves finish the season 14th in the table, seven places down on their seventh-placed finish last term.
Wednesday, who face the Seagulls in the play-offs after they drew 1-1 in the automatic promotion place decider against Middlesbrough, suffered just their second defeat in their last 10 games of the season.
Turner's early own goal marked six hours and six minutes since the last goal at Molineux - an injury-time winner scored by Doherty against Bristol City on 8 March - as the hosts avoided the unenviable record of becoming the first team in Football League history to draw five consecutive home games 0-0.

Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett: "A win is always important whatever situation you are in and we are delighted to get that.
"Now for us it is about the summer, capitalising on the strengths that we have in the side and then addressing the quite obvious weaknesses that we have."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: "Brighton will be a strong opponent, like all of the teams in the play-offs, but each of the four teams has a 25% chance.
"We have drawn against them both times this season in balanced games and we understand we are playing a top team but I think we are a better team now than in the past.
"We have a positive environment. We will be underdogs but that can be a positive for us."
