[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former scout master Ian Beeby jailed for abusing boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted abusing boys while working as a scout leader, telling one "it is the sort of thing that scouts do", has been jailed for five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Beeby, 62, of Edditch Grove, Bolton, carried out his crimes on four victims in Cumbria in the 1980s.
He admitted 16 charges including indecent assault, indecency with a child and making indecent images when he appeared at Carlisle Crown Court.
Cumbria Police said Beeby's actions were "completely inexcusable".
A trusted figure at that time, Beeby told one unassuming victim: "It is the sort of thing that scouts do."
He was first brought before a court last year and admitted two indecent assaults on one boy.
Publicity generated by the case prompted other abuse victims to come forward.
Judge Peter Davies told Beeby he had "victimised and assaulted" the four youngsters.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Con Ryan Parker, from Cumbria Police, praised the victims for their bravery and urged others to report sexual abuse.
He said: "Beeby's behaviour was completely inexcusable.
"It is never too late to report sexual abuse and I would urge anyone who has been a victim to come forward."
