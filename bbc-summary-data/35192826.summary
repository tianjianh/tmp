The 37-year-old forward, who retired from international football in 2015, is in her third spell with the Women's Super League 1 club.
Smith will combine playing with assisting Gunners manager Pedro Martinez Losa on the touchline.
She was sidelined for the majority of last season with an ankle injury suffered against Sunderland in April.
Smith, who was nominated for the 2015 Women's PFA Players' Player of the Year award, had been in negotiations over a new deal throughout the close-season.
The former Boston Breakers and New Jersey Wildcats player also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I'm Arsenal through and through," Smith told the club website.
"The club means everything to me. Ever since I first put the shirt on, I've been so proud to do it every time.
"I feel a bit like part of the furniture. It is just a privilege to represent such a great club."
The Gunners, who finished third in WSL 1 last term, begin their 2016 league campaign at home to promoted Reading on Wednesday, 23 March.
