One member of staff said: "I don't feel safe now, especially when we have skeleton staff at night. I am worried about my safety. What if somebody had used it? It does not bear thinking about."
Other workers expressed surprise at the news and said they had not been told anything.
One woman said she "didn't have a clue it happened" and another said it was the "first she had heard about it".
In a statement, the force said: "Detectives are investigating after a gun was found concealed in public toilets in a Birmingham department store on Corporation Street just before 19:00 GMT on Monday 2 January."
House of Fraser said in a statement: "We are currently working very closely with West Midlands Police supporting them with their investigation and cannot comment further at this stage."
