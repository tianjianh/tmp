Rio 2016: Get your mobile ready for the Olympics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With much of the action taking place in the early hours UK time, these are going to be the first truly mobile Olympics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
You will have a simple choice - stay up or catch up? Watch the action at 3 in the morning (with work the next day), or relive it in the morning, with breakfast, on your commute to work, at your desk or from the comfort of your sofa.
We've got loads of ways to follow the Games on the BBC website, in the app and on Red Button. We've even got a 360 degree virtual reality app if you want to really immerse yourself in the Games. They didn't have that for the first modern Games back in 1896.
Here's just some of what we're offering...
Alerts
If you've already got the BBC Sport app, you might already be getting alerts for football scores or sport news.
For the Olympics, you can add medal alerts - you can find out every time Team GB wins a gold (or every time Botswana win a bronze, for that matter).
You can set news alerts for top stories so we'll let you know when the really big stuff happens - Usain Bolt breaks the world record or Bradley Wiggins wins his eighth Olympic medal, for example.
And you can set event reminders - you do that from our Live Guide. Speaking of which...
Live Guide
We've got a live stream for every sport and every session, so how do you choose what to watch? Simply head to the Live Guide and you can see all the available streams, as well as those for the other non-Olympic sport taking place (the Premier League, Formula 1, Test cricket...)
You can also set a reminder for an event by going to that session in the app and hitting the 'set reminder' option. That way you'll ensure you never miss the sports you're passionate about.
TV coverage
We'll be broadcasting up to 24 streams concurrently, with more than 3,000 hours of live coverage including 550 on BBC One and BBC Four. BBC Radio 5 live will also have extensive radio coverage.
You can see full details of what each channel will be broadcasting and when by heading off here - and, rest assured, all the TV and Red Button coverage will be available online.
Daily catch-up
Every day we will have daily catch-up video; this will be one of the best ways to get all the key action from the night before.
We also have a dedicated video page with all the best clips from Rio and we have made a slight tweak to videos so they now autoplay the next related content. That means you can sit back and watch a stream of the best highlights and clips.
The Olympics Playlist, a downloadable catch-up highlights programme, will be available on BBC iPlayer every morning too.
Olympic schedule
Want to know when any event is on - you can find out in our schedule, but it's much more than just a schedule.
It will also have the latest live video for any sport you select and have handy links to the results. There's a medals table on the site too, of course.
Social media
We are, of course, on Facebook. And Twitter. And YouTube. And Snapchat.
Simply head to your social media platform of choice and search for BBC Sport. We'll be using social media to give you more of a behind-the-scenes look at the Games and Rio.
Personalise with MySport
By signing into the website or app, you can create a personalised sport experience.
You might want to add Rio 2016, cricket, tennis and athletics - by doing so your My Sport area will display the latest articles and videos from those topics, and also relevant information such as latest scores and results.
My Sport also works across devices, so if you set preferences in the app, they will work on the website and vice versa, as long as you are signed in. To set up a MySport account, head here - if you've already got a BBC log-in you're halfway there.
Want the best of the Games sent to you in a daily, easy-to-digest newsletter?
We'll send you highlights, news, features, analysis and funnies too. Head here to sign up.
VR 360
This one is definitely a first - you can put your smartphone into a headset and then experience the Games in full 360 degree virtual reality.
This one needs a bit more explanation - head this way for full details.
Red Button and Connected TV
All of our streams will be available on Connected TV, while there are extra sports available on Red Button too. You can see the full Red Button schedule and details on this page.
Award-winning journalism
We'll have a report for every event, plus features, analysis, reaction and news.
With thousands of hours of live broadcast, highlights of all the key moments as well as news articles, features and exclusive material on social media you won't be short of ways to enjoy what promise to be a stunning Olympics.
