Headers from Peter Hartley and Marvin Morgan proved enough for the Pilgrims.
Reuben Reid should have added to the score, but failed to capitalise on a goalkeeping error when he fired wide.
The Coasters, 44 league places below their hosts, had chances of their own but Richie Allen shot wide and Michael Barnes saw his effort saved.
