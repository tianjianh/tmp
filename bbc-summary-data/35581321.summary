[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solitary first-half goal from Arnaud Djoum was enough to give Hearts victory over Partick Thistle and move them closer to the Premiership's top two.

Djoum notched his first goal of the season with a header from Don Cowie's corner.
Igor Rossi and Juanma Delgado came close to adding to the hosts' advantage.
Sam Nicholson had a shot saved late on while Steven Lawless was Thistle's main attacking threat.
The win was Hearts' third in a week at Tynecastle and takes them to within six points of Aberdeen and 10 behind Celtic.
Just as the game kicked off a small plane flew over the stadium carrying the banner saying, "No style no bottle Neilson out", which instantly brought about chants from the Hearts faithful of, "There's only one Robbie Neilson".
Jamie Walker had an early chance for the home side, the winger able to go round Jags goalkeeper Tomas Cerny but fluffing his effort as the Thistle defence closed him down.
At the other end Neil Alexander was called into action to deny Mathias Pogba, who rose high to direct a header towards goal following a Lawless cross.
John Souttar has settled in well at the back for Hearts since making the move from Dundee United and looked to carry the ball forward at every opportunity.
And one of his runs eventually led to the opening goal. Souttar was fouled just outside the box and Cerny was forced into a decent save from Alim Ozturk's free-kick.
Cowie then delivered for Djoum to thunder his header into the net.
The home side came close to a second goal when Ozturk and Cowie combined to set up Rossi but his effort was just wide.
Thistle were dealt a blow just before half-time when influential midfielder Stuart Bannigan injured his knee after a challenge on Alexander and had to be replaced.
Lawless was proving to be a real thorn in Hearts' side and early in the second half he was able to create space for himself 20 yards from goal only to shoot straight at Alexander.
The game was being stretched as Thistle tried to respond and Hearts striker Juanma fired just wide after being set up by Cowie.
Jamie Walker set up substitute Abiola Dauda inside the box but he blasted high over the Thistle crossbar.
Nicholson was next to try his luck on goal but Cerny this time was able to save at his near post.
