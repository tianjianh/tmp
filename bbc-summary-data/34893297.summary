Cheshire guard Jo Leedham scored a game-high 20 points and 13 rebounds on her return from a two-year absence.
The home side led 42-28 ahead at half-time but GB closed to three points before Montenegro pulled away late on.
It was a debut defeat for new GB coach Jose Maria Buceta, whose side next play Italy - who hammered Albania 121-38 - in Manchester on Wednesday.
