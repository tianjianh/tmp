[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The French striker put away a loose ball after just five minutes, and made it two when Ryan Cresswell miscued a shot into his path.
Fortunes nosedived further for Neil Smith's men when midfielder Connor Dymond was dismissed for a high tackle on Jason Taylor.
It was no surprise that Eastleigh pushed on in the second half, and defender Jake Howells added a third.
Mandron completed his treble with 25 minutes still remaining, following a one-two with Andy Drury.
And James Constable swerved in a cross for Adam Dawson to add a fifth on 71 minutes.
