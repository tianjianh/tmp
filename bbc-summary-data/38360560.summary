[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 0-2 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham continued their rise towards the Championship play-off places with a comfortable victory at Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan striker Chris Martin put the visitors in front with a well-struck free-kick from 25 yards.
Substitute Ragnar Sigurdsson then headed in Stefan Johansen's corner after the break to make it 2-0, leaving Fulham seventh in the table.
Mick McCarthy's side, who have only won once in their last five league games, were booed off at full-time.
Floyd Ayite and Martin both had early chances to give the hosts the lead before the latter curled in a direct free-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
Sone Aluko went close to making it 2-0 before David Button did well to prevent Michael Madl heading into his own net at the other end.
Ayite then had several chances to add a second after the break - first, he saw a shot from a tight angle saved by Bartosz Bialkowski, before missing from close range when unmarked and then firing straight at the Town keeper when through on goal.
But Slavisa Jokanovic's side finally claimed a deserved second when Sigurdsson diverted Johansen's corner into the net.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"We were well beaten by a much better team with better players on the day.
"I can't take any criticism away from us as we weren't particularly good. It would be easy for me to blame my players but we tried our best, as we always do, but they were better than us.
"We could have been beaten by more and we now need to pull together - we all need to do better.
"I fully understand the fans' reaction. I much prefer them to shout 'super Mick' but I have no complaints about it."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"It has been a great day for us. I am very happy with how we played, it has been a very good Boxing Day for us. This is a very important three points in our fight towards our target.
"It was another clean sheet and we dominated the game to the end. Ipswich didn't get a shot on target which was good news for us.
"I know what the target of this club is and what our supporters want, but I prefer to think about the next game."
