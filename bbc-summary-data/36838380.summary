The 31-year-old Briton is looking to win the Tour for a third time after claiming victory in 2013 and 2015.
The yellow jersey wearer is currently one minute 47 seconds ahead of his nearest rival Bauke Mollema.
"Coming into this last week, myself personally I feel more ready for this third week than in previous editions," he said.
"Starting this season later helped that, having a quieter run-in to the Tour helped that. My personal ambition is to be at my best in the third week of this race and I think I'm on track for that."
Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour sees the riders go 184km from Berne to Finhaut Emosson.

Froome has disputed suggestions that other riders have been unwilling to challenge the Team Sky rider and his team-mates.
"I think the race has been that hard. People say that the guys didn't attack two stages ago (stage 15) but actually (Fabio) Aru attacked, (Alejandro) Valverde attacked, Romain Bardet attacked - the only guy who didn't was Nairo Quintana.
"I think that's who everyone was waiting for to attack, other people tried and they're going to keep trying."
Colombian Quintana, who is two minutes and 59 seconds behind Froome, praised Team Sky as "really strong".
He added: "Some of his team-mates who are helping him could be leaders in other teams. The main idea is to try to get him on his own."
Fellow British rider Adam Yates, 23, has said he would be willing to attack the lead if the opportunity presented itself.
Yates, currently third in the standings and in possession of the white jersey, said: "Why not? (Froome) looks strong. I can't see him having a bad day, but why not? If he does have a moment's weakness, why not try something?"
Meanwhile, sprinter Mark Cavendish has dropped out of the Tour to aid his preparations for the Olympics in Rio.
