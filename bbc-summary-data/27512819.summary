Holly Lodge Girls' College has captured events including sports days, school plays and a trip to Nazi Germany, where pupils watched the Hitler Youth taking part in a tug-of-war.
The archive will be catalogued by Liverpool Central Library so it can be made available to the public, reports Lindsey Prosser for North West Tonight.
