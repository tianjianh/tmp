The 28-year-old was the best-placed British driver in the opening round of the WRC in Monte Carlo in January.
He and co-driver Daniel Barritt finished in sixth place overall and won three out of the 17 stages.
Snow and ice are likely to cover the gravel track and Evans hopes to be competitive from the start.
"It is a completely different concept to what we had in Monte Carlo, and may see some surprises," Evans told BBC Wales Sport.
"Conditions will differ quite a lot from Monte Carlo, but we will of course have snow and ice, but Monte Carlo is based on a tarmac-based rally, whereas here it is on a gravel road.
"But the conditions are quite a bit more extreme, so that gravel is normally covered by full snow that has a frozen layer underneath.
"There are quite a few new stages this year so that will be a challenge in itself to write new notes and to get them right.
"Everything is feeling pretty good, but we do not know where we are compared to the others."
The Welshman drove for M-Sport in the top class for two seasons in 2014 and 2015, but was demoted to the WRC2 class in 2016.
Evans made his return to the top class in 2017 after a 12-month absence.
