Ursula Presgrave, 23, from BBC's The Call Centre, said she was "sickened and ashamed" at her own Facebook comment about disabled children.
She said they should be killed to avoid a "pointless life of a vegetable".
At Swansea Magistrates' Court, Presgrave admitted maliciously sending offensive messages on social media.
She was given an eight-week sentenced, suspended for 12 months, and was also told to pay Â£315 in costs and charges.
Magistrate Carole Green said Presgrave had caused "serious offence and substantial distress to many people".
Mrs Green said: "Given the degree of abuse we considered it fell into the category of a hate crime."
The court heard the post attracted thousands of comments after being shared by other Facebook users - and police received several complaints.
More than 550 people commented on the post and described it as "vile", "sick", and "attention-seeking".
Mark Davies, defending, said: "I make a public apology on behalf of my client.
"To say she is deeply upset is an understatement, and she's doing everything she can to put matters right."
