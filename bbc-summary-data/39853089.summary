[SN]TITLE[SN]
Arsenal v Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal will monitor top scorer Alexis Sanchez, who suffered a kick to the thigh at Stoke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laurent Koscielny could miss out after suffering a recurrence of a calf problem, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain remains out with a hamstring injury.
Sunderland pair Jason Denayer and Victor Anichebe are doubts with respective thigh and hamstring problems.
George Honeyman is also struggling to shake off a back injury.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "Our chances depend on winning our games. We have 69 points, we can get to 75. That will be four points more than last year, so let's focus on finishing as well as we can.
"We have created a momentum again. We had a difficult period and we recovered from it. The only chance we have to be in the top four is to win our games."
Sunderland manager David Moyes on the performance against Swansea - which Alan Shearer described as "pathetic and disgraceful": "I'd have to say that I think in many ways, he was right. I was incredibly disappointed with the performance.
"I don't think any player ever goes out to try to perform like that. There were some reasons for it, but I'm actually privy to the stats, I can see the physical stats and on much of that, I couldn't disagree."
