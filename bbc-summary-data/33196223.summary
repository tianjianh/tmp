[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers want to build seven large stores on the site of the former Asda supermarket, which would be renamed the Northern Quarter.
The 70,000 sq ft (6,503 sq m) space will be given a new entrance, with shopping and public art areas.
The work is part of a five-year plan for the centre which will see construction start on the Southern Quarter start in the summer.
Tim Binnington, chairman of developers Sovereign Land, said: "Modern retailers are looking for larger stores which this development will provide, enabling us to attract new brands and the latest concepts to Telford."
Members of the public will soon be asked to give their feedback on the plans on Telford and Wrekin Council's website.
