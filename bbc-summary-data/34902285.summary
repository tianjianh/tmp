Ian Paisley donation to settle libel case with Sinn Féin's Martina Anderson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DUP MP Ian Paisley is to make a charity donation as part of a libel settlement after he was sued by a Sinn Féin MEP over comments he made on radio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martina Anderson brought defamation proceedings against Mr Paisley over an interview he gave about the closure of a County Antrim cigarette factory.
The case was due to be heard in the High Court in Belfast, but the judge was told the dispute has been settled.
Mr Paisley will donate to the Pink Ladies cancer charity in Londonderry.
Ms Anderson's defamation action began after she took part in a radio interview with him in October 2014, about the closure of Gallahers cigarette factory in Ballymena.
Hundreds of jobs losses had just been announced at the plant, which was one of the biggest employers in Mr Paisley's North Antrim constituency,
No details of the libel dispute were disclosed in court on Monday and neither Mr Paisley nor Ms Anderson attending the hearing.
However, the Sinn Féin MEP's solicitor, Padraig O Muirigh, said: "The claim was settled in Martina Anderson's favour.
"Costs are being paid by the defendant to include a payment to the Pink Ladies cancer charity in Derry."
