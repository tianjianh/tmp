The 30-year-old Wales international has made 78 Premiership appearances for Bath since his 2012 move from Scarlets.
"I've absolutely loved my time with Bath, and will be sad to leave," Day told the club website.
"At this stage in my career, I just felt the time was right for a fresh challenge, and that will certainly be the case in Japan."
Day, who made his Wales debut against Ireland in Cardiff in 2015, featured for his country in the World Cup against Uruguay.
"We're sad to see him go, but understand the decision he has made," Bath head coach Mike Ford said.
"We wish him all the very best, and I'm sure he'll be a success in Japan."
