Wasps' win over Leinster saw them snatch first place in the group, leaving Toulon to qualify as one of three runners-up.
Steffon Armitage and Bryan Habana went over for the French side either side of half-time at the Rec.
Anthony Watson scored Bath's only try, as George Ford kicked three penalties.
The Premiership side's hopes of progressing out of the pool were over last weekend after their 25-11 defeat by Leinster.
Mike Ford's team exit the competition with two wins from six games and finish third in the table.
Toulon went into the final pool game on top of the group by one point, after their last-gasp victory over Wasps last weekend.
But the Premiership side ran in seven tries against bottom side Leinster on Saturday, and they went through as group winners because of their head-to-head record against Toulon.
Bath had nothing to play for in Saturday's game, but they were looking to kick-start their season, after winning only three from eight in the league.
They fell behind to two James O'Connor kicks, before fly-half and captain Ford got the hosts off the mark with the boot.
Toulon extended their lead when England exile Armitage, whom Bath had tried to sign last year prior to the World Cup, was left unmarked and he powered over.
The hosts got off to the perfect start in the second half when Watson touched down after a sublime passing move from Horacio Agulla and Kyle Eastmond.
Ford missed the conversion before landing a penalty to give Bath a narrow 14-11 lead, but it did not last.
Scotland flanker David Denton gave the ball away to South Africa wing Habana and he sprinted over to score an easy try for Toulon.
Full-back O'Connor missed the conversion but he went on to slot his third kick, as the three-time champions booked their place in the knockout stages.
