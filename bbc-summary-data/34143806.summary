BBC London has taken a look at the care system in the capital and how the city has come up with some innovative solutions to some of its biggest care challenges.

A mental health worker from north-west London explains how she feared she would never find the right childcare to cover her flexible working pattern.
She and her husband both work weekend and evening shifts.
Her situation was resolved when she came across a scheme run by Brent Council which matches approved childminders with families working unsociable hours.
Almost a million adults in London have some form of mental illness from anxiety or depression or something more complex requiring specialised help.
Many people do not find it easy to talk about their condition, especially to their employer. But others have found huge support.
Jessica, who works for an auditor and has depression, said she was initially "frightened" about telling her colleagues but found that her employer KPMG was very understanding and lets her to work from home when needed.
A woman who left care at the age of 15 has said she hopes to launch a clothing range thanks to help she has received.
Kevani said she was initially excited when she became self-sufficient but said "I didn't anticipate that with such a small budget I had to pay for so many things".
The turning point came when the Who Cares? trust helped her with practical and emotional support.
An 88-year-old widow who was struggling with day-to-day challenges including washing and ironing has invited a young person to live with for free in exchange for help.
Mary said she found out about the home-sharing scheme in Camden and took in Stella who pays for her room by giving time to Mary and helping with the cooking and putting Mary's shoes on in the morning.
Mary said: "It's nice to have a young person around and likes the same sort of television as I do."
