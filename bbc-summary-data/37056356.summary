The 18-year-old has been provisionally suspended from taking part in the Games while the test result is investigated.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed an earlier report from China's Xinhua news agency, which said she tested positive for diuretic hydrochlorothiazide on Sunday.
That was the day Chen finished fourth in the women's 100m butterfly final.
She was scheduled to compete in the 50m freestyle at 17:02 BST on Friday but did not take part.
