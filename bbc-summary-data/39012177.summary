[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City v Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull will be without midfielder Sam Clucas this weekend because he is serving a one-match suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dieumerci Mbokani is doubtful due to illness, but Abel Hernandez could return after a hamstring injury.
Burnley winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson is out after tweaking a medial knee ligament against Lincoln.
Fellow midfielder Steven Defour is back in training after a hamstring injury but won't feature on Saturday, while Jeff Hendrick is still suspended.
Steve Bower: "At the turn of the year Hull looked doomed; devoid of any confidence and hope. The impact Marco Silva and his new faces have had since has been remarkable.
"The atmosphere has changed and, so too, have their chances of survival. They have used the break to continue to bond at a week-long training camp in Portugal.
"Now the Tigers have an opportunity to record three consecutive home wins in the Premier League for the first time.
"They face a Burnley team who, incredibly, only have a solitary point on their travels.
"That has to change at some stage and Sean Dyche's team will hope for a response after last weekend's cup shock.
"A trip to Hull, though, is a different proposition to earlier in the season."

Hull head coach Marco Silva: "The pressure always stays with the team and the coaches.
"It's one more game and of course we respect Burnley. We want to win and prove ourselves on the pitch."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche on his side's run of four away games in a row:  "I think it's brilliant for us because the timing's magnificent.
"The teams on the opposite side, they are expected (to win) now, we're not because everyone looks at the form book and goes, 'Well it's going to be hard for them to win away because they haven't won any away'.
"Expectancy grows on the team you're playing now. Statistics work in your favour over a season and mindset works in your favour because the pressure is on the opposition."
I think most Burnley fans would rather see their side win this game than have beaten Lincoln in the FA Cup.
Having said that, I don't see Sean Dyche's side beating Hull. The Tigers are scrapping for anything they can get at the moment.
