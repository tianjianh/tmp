An abandoned dog that could not "stand on her back legs" because of two large tumours has been described as "blooming" after undergoing surgery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Staffordshire bull terrier, named April by Salford council staff, was found on Cholmondeley Road by the RSPCA and passed to dog warden Erica Eaton.
Ms Eaton said she "feared the worst but we had to give her a chance".
The non-cancerous growths, which weighed about 3.3lbs (1.5kg), were removed in a two-hour operation.
Ms Eaton, who cared for April along with colleague Will Harris, said she believed the tumours on the dog's stomach "had been growing for months".
"She couldn't jump up or stand on her back legs," she said.
"She didn't want to play and was subdued... but her tail never stopped wagging.
"She's a lovely dog and everyone who has met her has been giving her a big fuss."
Following the surgery on Wednesday, April has been placed in a foster home and will be put up for adoption by Rochdale Dog Rescue.
