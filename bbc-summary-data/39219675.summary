Reality Check: Do 60% benefit from the changes in National Insurance?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond was on the BBC's Breakfast programme on Thursday, talking about the changes made in his Budget.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The claim: 60% of self-employed people will pay less National Insurance as a result of these changes.
Reality Check verdict:  60% of people according to Treasury estimates will pay less, but only if you combine the abolition of Class 2 National Insurance contributions, which was announced in 2016, with the increase in Class 4 contributions announced on Wednesday. Nobody will pay less National Insurance as a result of the changes announced in Wednesday's Budget alone.
He said that 60% of self-employed people would pay less National Insurance as a result of the changes.
What changed on Wednesday was that in April 2018, Class 4 National Insurance contributions will rise from 9% of profits earned between £8,060 and £43,000 a year, to 10%.
The following year it will rise again to 11%.
National Insurance of 2% will still be payable on earnings above £43,000.
George Osborne announced the previous year that Class 2 National Insurance contributions, which are paid at a flat rate of £2.80 a week by self-employed people earning profits of more than £5,965 a year, would be abolished from April 2018.
Mr Hammond was keen to combine the effects of these two changes, describing the net effect as raising £145m a year by 2020-21.
The Budget documents predict that just raising Class 4 contributions will raise £495m in 2020-21, with the measure raising a total of just over £2bn over the next five years.
If you look at the two changes together, the Treasury says that 2.6 million people will be better off by an average of £115 a year, while 1.6 million people will lose out by an average of £240 a year.
The latest labour market figures estimated that there were a total of 4.8 million self-employed workers, but some of them will be earning less than £5,965 so will be neither better off nor worse off, which means the total is feasible.
From those figures, it appears that 60% of self-employed people could be paying less in National Insurance.
But it would be a bit surprising if all self-employed people looked at it like that.
They were expecting a tax cut in April next year, and as a result of this Budget, 40% of them will now face a tax increase instead.
It will be the higher-earning, self-employed people who lose out.
The Institute for Fiscal studies has worked out that anyone earning profits of less than £15,570 a year will be better off, while the maximum loss will be £589 a year.
