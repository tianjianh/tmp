The Baggies face the Swans in the Premier League on Wednesday hoping to halt the Welsh club's progress after Saturday's 3-0 win over Sunderland.
Spain international Llorente scored twice in that victory, and Pulis admits he tried to sign the striker when he was in charge of Stoke.
"He picked Juventus instead of Stoke," said the Welshman.
"We watched him when we were at Stoke City and when he was playing for [Athletic] Bilbao and doing exceptionally well there.
"We thought he was a very good player and someone who would suit us but he went on to Juventus."
The 31-year-old Llorente was signed for Swansea by Francesco Guidolin, who was replaced by American Bob Bradley as manager in October after he was sacked.
Llorente scored twice in the win over Sunderland which lifted Swansea off the base of the Premier League.
The goals took his tally to five for the season and four in his last three Premier League matches.
West Brom are eight points and eight places above Swansea, who dropped back into the relegation zone after West Ham drew 1-1 with Manchester United on Sunday.
American Bradley is looking for his third win since taking over at the Liberty Stadium but expects a tough challenge from Pulis' team, who were beaten 1-0 by Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday.
"His team has a lot of very tall guys and they utilise that with some direct play, while it also gives them good match-ups at set-pieces," he said.
"They do a lot of things well, and we will have to do the same if we are going to get a result there."
