The mother of a Welsh football fan who died as a result of a crush in the Hillsborough disaster has welcomed a conclusion he was unlawfully killed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McBrien, 18, from Holywell, Flintshire, and David Steven Brown, 25, from Wrexham, were two of 96 Liverpool fans who died on 15 April 1989.
An inquest jury found police errors and defects at the stadium contributed to the disaster.
Mr McBrien's mother Joan Hope said she was "very pleased" with the conclusion.
After a 27-year campaign by victims' families, the behaviour of Liverpool fans was exonerated.
The jury found they did not contribute to the danger unfolding at the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of Sheffield Wednesday's ground.
"I'm very pleased that it's gone that way. I didn't dare to hope for it to happen but it did happen so it's very encouraging," Mrs Hope said.
"It's not the end of the road of course, it's only the verdict of the coroner's court which is quite different to a criminal court.
"But it's a step in the right direction.
"The families have been very loyal to the cause. They've done well to stick it out, setback after setback. It must be pleasing for all the families to hear that."
Student Mr McBrien travelled by coach to Sheffield for the FA Cup semi-final organised by the Deeside Liverpool Supporters' Club from Flint.

14 questions the jury answered
During the inquest, another fan who lost consciousness in the crush told how he "came to" and began trying to save Mr McBrien lying next to him.
Stuart Gray gave him a heart massage and chest compressions but said Mr McBrien was in a "desperate state" and he was "fighting a lost cause".
Mrs Hope added she was pleased with the outcome because she had no fight left in her.
"You can't be angry forever, you've got to accept what happened," she said.
"You were just unlucky you lost a son who you dearly loved. Nothing can bring him back again but there'll always be that empty space. "
