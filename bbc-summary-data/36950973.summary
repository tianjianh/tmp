Carlile became the youngest Olympic coach when he led the Australian swimming team at the 1948 London Games at the age of 27.
He was the first person to represent Australia at modern pentathlon at Helsinki 1952 before again coaching the swimmers at the 1956 Melbourne Games.
Swimmers coached by Carlile secured 12 Olympic medals, including five golds, and 31 individual world records.
Carlile, who worked with athletes such as Shane Gould and Karen Moras, also established Australia's first commercial swimming school.
"He was a true legend in Australian Olympic history as both an athlete and a coach," said Australian Olympic Committee chief Kitty Chiller.
