Nick Scott and Joe Buckle scored early tries to put Jersey in control, but Munster hit back through Gavin Coombes and Kevin O'Byrne scores.
Kieran Hardy went over for the visitors to make it 25-14.
However tries from David Johnston and Alex Wootton, along with Johnston's precise kicking, saw the hosts celebrate the narrowest of wins.
The Channel Islanders were ahead after just 72 seconds when Scott used his speed and strength to go over after good work from full-back Ross Adair.
The dream start continued for Jersey as Callum Sheedy's kicking, coupled with Buckle's well-worked try from a line out, helped them to an 18-point advantage.
But Coombes went over in the final play of the half to spark the Munster comeback.
O'Byrne's try in the opening moments of the second period gave the Irish side further momentum, but scrum-half Hardy darted in to briefly steady Jersey nerves.
Johnston's try followed by Wootton's brilliant solo score put the home side ahead for the first time, before Sheedy's penalty edged the away side in front.
With 10 minutes to go though, Johnston's nerves held strong to kick Munster ahead again with what turned out to be the winning penalty.
The triumph was Munster's second B&I Cup success, five years on from their previous final win.
