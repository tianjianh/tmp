[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundreds had gathered at Westfield in Shepherd's Bush for the so-called "die-in" demonstration in December 2014.
They were supporting rallies in the US prompted by the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died during an arrest in New York in July.
Fifty-four people remain on police bail.
