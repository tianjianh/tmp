Jodrell Bank: New homes would 'impair' telescope, rules government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build 120 new homes in Cheshire have been blocked on the grounds they would interfere with the Jodrell Bank radio telescope.

Gladman Developments had denied the use of household appliances in Goostrey would affect the observatory's ability to receive radio signals from space.
But Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid ruled against the proposed development.
It would "impair the efficiency" of this "world-class facility", he said.
The proposed site, off Main Road in Goostrey, is 1.95 miles (3.14km) from the observatory, home to the world famous Lovell Telescope.
Cheshire East councillors rejected the plans last year.
But the developer appealed the decision claiming there was "no evidence" their plan for 119 extra homes would cause a significant increase in radio interference.
A public inquiry disagreed, saying the observatory, "as an established world class facility, should be afforded reasonable protection".
"This proposal could damage the world-class work being carried out by the observatory," the government ruling said.
"The harm to the efficiency of the Radio Telescope carries substantial weight against the proposal."
It also concluded the proposal would "be at odds" with the council's strategy for development in the countryside.
Cheshire East Councillor Ainsley Arnold said he was "delighted" and glad "the long-term protection of vital scientific work has prevailed over the short-term high demand in housing supply."
"Jodrell Bank observatory is a vital asset to this borough, the nation and the international scientific community".
The council is "doing everything possible to meet the housing needs of our area" but "this was simply the wrong development in the wrong place," he said.
