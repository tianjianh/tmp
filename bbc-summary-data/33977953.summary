Seven schemes worth about £3bn are at varying stages of development.
They include Swansea University's second campus, a tidal lagoon and the St David's civic centre regeneration.
But it is understood even more plans are due to be unveiled in the future, adding to what is already taking place.
"It is the biggest landscape change since the Second World War," said Rob Stewart.
"When you look at Swansea then [after the blitz], there was one building left. Now the buildings here were built in the 1950s.
"There isn't one area of the city centre that wouldn't be touched by this development.
"It would be unrecognisable from even now."
The 69-acre (28 hectare) site off Fabian Way will focus on science and innovation as well as providing student residences.
