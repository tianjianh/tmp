A stowaway kitten, which survived freezing temperatures in the cargo hold of a jet from Egypt, has been saved by a Derby cat rescue centre.

"Cairo" was put in quarantine and was due to be put down after being found at Birmingham Airport in a fruit shipment.
But after being contacted by Solihull Council, Lina's Cat Rescue took the kitten in, as part of their "no kill" policy for healthy cats.
Airline, Emirates, is paying for her three-month quarantine stay.
Sheryl Leonardi, founder of Lina's Cat Rescue, said: "We have a strict 'no kill' policy for healthy cats and when contacted by Solihull Council, we were happy to take on the responsibility of all her costs.
"We are so grateful to Emirates for offering to fund her quarantine period, which means this money can now be spent on other needy cats in our care.
"Cairo has another three months or so in quarantine before she can be released into our care, but we do go to visit her and are pleased to announce she's settling in very well."
It is hoped the domestic short-haired kitten will be re-homed once she has been checked by vets.
