[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Britain's largest building societies has announced it is to close branches and rebrand two of its mutual societies as part of an overhaul.

Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) Group said it would be rebranding Barnsley Building Society and Chelsea Building Society under its own name.
The move will see 22 of the group's 230 branches close, including six Barnsley and seven Chelsea branches.
YBS said 13 jobs were at risk, but most staff would be redeployed.
The group merged with Barnsley Building society in 2008 and Chelsea Building Society in 2010.
The Barnsley branches marked for closure are in Cudworth, Doncaster, Mexborough, Rotherham, Wakefield and Wombwell, while the Chelsea Branches include Croydon, London Kings Road, Exeter, Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton and Westminster.
The branches that remain open will be rebranded as Yorkshire Building Society.
Nine Yorkshire branches will also shut.
A YBS spokeswoman said the closures largely fall where branches were less than a mile apart, and would happen between April and September.
Chief executive Chris Pilling said the changes would make the group "more efficient" and support the changing needs of its members.
"Our branch network always has been, and remains, at the heart of our business, providing the face-to-face service that many of our members prefer," he said.
The group said its Norwich & Peterborough Building Society branches would not be affected by the overhaul.
