Fewer people are dying from cancer in Wales despite more being diagnosed with the disease, a report has said.

The third all-Wales annual report for cancer looks at the progress made in the Welsh NHS against the Welsh government's cancer delivery plan.
It focuses on early diagnosis and more effective cooperation between GPs, hospitals and other health care providers.
More than 18,000 people were diagnosed with cancer each year by 2012.
But there has been a 25% reduction in deaths between 1995 and 2012 among people under 75.
The Welsh government report also shows that since 1995, there has been a 17.5% improvement in the number of people still alive a year after diagnosis, with a 20.1% improvement in the number of those still alive five years after diagnosis.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: "New and more effective treatments mean that many more people can now expect to live longer after their cancer treatment.
"However, the report also sets out the challenges the Welsh NHS faces. We do expect to see improvements over the coming year in the percentage of patients, newly diagnosed with cancer who are treated within 62 days."
Dr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of NHS Wales, said: "We will continue to track our progress in future years to ensure that we are in a sustainable position to achieve our vision by 2016."
