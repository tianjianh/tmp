[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fifth consultation on Haverfordwest schools shake-up agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fifth public consultation into the future of secondary education in Haverfordwest will take place after a Pembrokeshire council vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The amended proposal is for one new English-medium school with a sixth form and this would involve merging the town's two existing schools.
Previous proposals, which involved centralising sixth forms to a new centre at Pembrokeshire College, were met with a series of protests.
The consultation will begin next month.
A final decision on the new school is then set to go back before the council in July.
