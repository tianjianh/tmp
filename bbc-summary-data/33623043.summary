Isobel Parker, 23, who was known as Becky, died at a property in Booth Place, Burnham-on-Crouch, on 17 July.
Her mother described her as a "bubbly girl" and a "fantastic mother who adored spending time with her two precious children".
Matthew Smith, 23, of Wood Corner Caravan Park in Maldon, has been charged with murder.
He will next appear in court on 28 September.
A post-mortem examination found Miss Parker had been strangled with a ligature.
Her partner Shane said: "Becky was the best woman I could have ever wished to meet.
"We were so looking forward to the birth of our first child together, a little girl, who we were going to name Charmaine."
