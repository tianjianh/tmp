Rory McIlroy hopes his thrilling FedEx Cup triumph helps give Europe momentum as they attempt to win an unprecedented fourth successive Ryder Cup.

The Northern Irishman beat Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell in a play-off at the Tour Championship to earn Â£8.8m, as he also won the end-of-season FedEx Cup.
He is now finalising his preparations for the Ryder Cup, which starts on Friday at Hazeltine National.
"Hopefully, in some way, it helps the team," said McIlroy, 27.
"I've obviously never gone into a Ryder Cup with this much excitement."
After Chappell was eliminated at the first extra hole, McIlroy finally edged out Moore at the fourth play-off hole.
McIlroy's victory was his second in the PGA Tour's season-ending play-off series and was some compensation for not adding to his four major titles in 2016.
Having won the Deutsche Bank Championship three weeks ago, his latest triumph continued his turnaround in fortunes since his missed cut at the US PGA Championship in late July.

"I always feel like from a low point you can work yourself back up, and you can really assess what you need to do," said McIlroy, who shot a closing 64 at East Lake to force his way into the play-off.
"I think it was blatantly obvious what I needed to do after Baltusrol, in terms of trying to fix my putting or to at least address some issues in it.
"I started on a process to do that and I didn't think results were going to come as quickly as they have done really."
McIlroy holed a tricky five-footer to stay alive at the third extra hole before sinking a 20-footer to secure the biggest financial prize in golf.
"I've converted more of my chances I'm giving myself," added McIlroy.
"The margins are so small in this game so it was nice to just set the reset button after the PGA."
McIlroy was scheduled to meet up with his European team-mates on Monday.
