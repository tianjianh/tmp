[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called after a woman and four men entered the River Medina, next to Newport's Seaclose Park festival site, on Friday.
The woman was assisted by a passing vessel, three men made it ashore but one was unaccounted for.
However, the coastguard said it was confident no-one was left in the water.
An "extensive search", involving two coastguard rescue teams, the coastguard helicopter, the police boat and Cowes lifeboat, was carried out between 22:00 BST on Friday and 00:40 on Saturday, a coastguard spokeswoman said.
