West Brom have signed Bournemouth's Marc Wilson on loan until the end of the season, with the defender leaving the Cherries for personal reasons.

The Republic of Ireland international failed to make a Premier League appearance for Eddie Howe's side after joining from Stoke in August.
"We felt we could not stand in Marc's way after the reasons he gave, which will remain private," said Howe.
Wilson, 29, has been out with a hamstring injury since 7 January.
He picked up the injury in the last of his three appearances for Bournemouth, a 3-0 defeat by Millwall in the FA Cup third round, having also featured in two EFL Cup ties earlier this season.
Baggies head coach Tony Pulis previously signed Wilson when in charge of Stoke in 2010.
