The decisive final bout of the night saw Frazer Clarke beat Ahmed Bourous in the super heavyweight division.
Wins for flyweight Muhammad Ali and lightweight Luke McCormack had given the British franchise a 2-0 lead before Morocco fought back.
The Lionhearts' campaign opened with victory over USA Knockouts last month.
They next face the Mexico Guerreros at York Hall in London on 18 February.
The World Series of Boxing also serves as a route to Rio 2016, with British fighters who represent the Lionhearts eligible for selection for an Olympic qualifying event in May.
