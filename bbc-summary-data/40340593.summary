It is hoped a new pavilion to replace the Ross bandstand will revitalise West Princes Street Gardens.
The current Ross bandstand hosts hogmanay and festival concerts but lies empty most of the year.
The competition to design a new year-round arts venue attracted 125 entries. The Â£25m cost has been met by private and public funding.
Public views are being invited with judges due to announce the winning design in August.
The seven shortlisted architect firms are Adjaye Associates, Bjarke Ingels Group, Flanagan Lawrence, Page Park Architects, Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter, wHY and William Matthews Associate Architects.
