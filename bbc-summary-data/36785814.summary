Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Theresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campaigned to Remain in the European Union
The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years.
Theresa May: Full profile
How does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?
Campaigned to Leave the EU
Boris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department.
Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.
Read how the world has reacted.
Leave campaigner
David Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.
Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.
Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.
Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.
Leave campaigner
Liam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.
Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.
He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.
Remain campaigner
The appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.
David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.
Remain campaigner
Karen Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.
She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.
Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.

Leave campaigner
Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.
The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy.
Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe.
Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.
Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.
Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.
She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.
Remain campaigner
Damian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.
Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.
Leave campaigner
Priti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.
Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.
She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of "divide and rule politics" during the referendum campaign for claiming that "biased" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.
On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.
Remain campaigner
Greg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.
His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.
Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the "climate change" part of its name.
Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.
But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was "an excellent appointment", saying he "understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy".
Remain campaigner
James Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.
He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one "which I felt I could take on".
Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.
From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.
His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's "extremism taskforce". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.
Read more on his appointment here.
Remain campaigner
David Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons.
The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.
Campaigned to Remain in the EU
Philip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.
Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".
He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.
Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.
Remain campaigner
Amber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.
During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.
The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".
She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014.
Remain campaigner
Liz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.
A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.
She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.
Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.
Remain campaigner
Justine Greening has said she is "absolutely delighted" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities.
Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.
Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.
MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.
At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".
Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.

Chris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.
The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.
He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.
The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from "blue-on-blue" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage.
Remain campaigner
Patrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.
As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was "very pleased indeed" with his new role.
Remain campaigner
Sajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.
Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank.
The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a "joint ticket" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.
Remain campaigner
Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.
He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.
A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.
Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a "pretty reluctant Remainer" after the EU referendum.
Remain campaigner
Despite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.
The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.
He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.
Remain campaigner
David Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.
Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on "ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations".
Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.
Remain campaigner
May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?
Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.
He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position.
The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010.
He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly.
Remain campaigner
George Osborne has been fired as chancellor.
He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015.
A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a "privilege" to be chancellor, adding: "Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it."
Leave campaigner
Michael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.
He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.
His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.
Remain campaigner
Nicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary.
The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.
London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.
In a tweet, she said she was "disappointed" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was "committed to excellence in education".
Remain campaigner
Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government "in the best interests of my family". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.
BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend.
Read more about Mr Crabb here.
Leave campaigner
John Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary.
The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.
In a tweet, he said it had been "a privilege" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor "every success".
Leave campaigner
Theresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.
Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.
In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.
She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been "kind enough to offer me a role" but added that it was "not one which I felt I could take on".

Remain campaigner
Oliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.
A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.
However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London.
Remain campaigner
Chief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.
In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: "I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."
Remain campaigner
Baroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.
Of her successor, she tweeted: "Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats."
Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.
Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party.
