Chat: Let It Shine or The Voice, what will you be watching?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strictly and X Factor have finished but don't be sad, it's time for two different shows to dominate our screens on Saturday night.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This weekend, ITV becomes the new home for the singing contest The Voice.
And the BBC are launching a new singing show called Let It Shine, which sees Gary Barlow leading the search for the cast of a Take That musical.
We wanted to know if you'll be sitting down to watch some Saturday night television and if you are, which one will you be watching....

I will be watching Let It Shine because The Voice is a little boring and old

I think I'll be watching The Voice because it's been on longer and some of The Voice winners turned into successful singers.
