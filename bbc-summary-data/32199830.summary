[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took the lead after only three minutes as Nicky Ajose chipped the ball into the area and Lauri Dalla Valle fired past keeper Ben Alnwick.
Peterborough equalised in the 66th minute, ending a goal drought of over eight hours, as Conor Washington turned in Marcus Maddison's parried shot.
The Railwaymen are one point above the relegation zone with three games left.
However, Leyton Orient and Notts County, who are a point behind Crewe, both have a game in hand.
