Kerry Katona's husband denies assault charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The husband of reality TV star and ex-Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona has pleaded not guilty to assaulting her at their home in East Sussex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Kay, 36, of Hollybank Moore, Warrington, Cheshire, was arrested following an alleged row at the property in Crowborough last September.
He was charged with assault by beating and unlawful possession of a stun gun disguised as a torch.
Mr Kay denied both charges at Hove Crown Court. He faces a trial in April.
He has been freed on bail on condition that he does not contact Ms Katona except via an agreed third party, and does not enter Crowborough.
Asking whether he could go to Crowborough to get his hair cut, Judge David Rennie replied: "No, that's slightly daft. You can get your hair cut somewhere else."
Ms Katona, 35, married the ex-rugby league player in 2014.
