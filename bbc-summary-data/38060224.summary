[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 1-0 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Raggett was sent off as 10-man Lincoln battled to the top of the National League with victory over visitors Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Imps missed a good early chance when Matt Rhead, having been fouled by Kai Edwards inside the area, saw his penalty saved by a diving Luke Coddington, low to his right.
Elliott Whitehouse, however, put the hosts ahead from a Nathan Arnold corner. The ball dropped to the midfielder, whose shot was deflected in by Hamza Bencherif.
However, they suffered a setback when Raggett was shown a straight red card for a foul on Rob Evans after just 27 minutes, forcing Imps boss Danny Cowley into an early change.
It handed Wrexham the initiative, but Lincoln kept their defensive shape for a full hour to prevent an equaliser and go top.
