The 31-year-old from Devon has previously won bronze and silver medals on both the Intercontinental Cup and Europa Cup circuits.
But his success in Switzerland was his first in more than 80 senior races.
"It's taken a long time, but it's such a nice feeling hearing your national anthem blaring out," said Swift.
"I had fairly high expectations, but there's a big difference between performing well in training and racing. That's something I've struggled with historically."
Swift has slid on both the World Cup and Intercontinental Cup circuits so far this season and will hope to be in the GB World Championship team when it is announced in early February.
