Southampton have concluded there is "no evidence" to support allegations of wrongdoing made by a newspaper against its assistant manager Eric Black.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Daily Telegraph claimed Black had advised undercover reporters how to bribe officials at other clubs.
During an internal investigation, Southampton requested the Telegraph provide them with evidence.
In a statement, it said: "There is no evidence of any wrongdoing, as such the club now considers the matter closed."
The statement added: "Despite numerous requests to provide the club with any evidence relating to the allegation against Mr Black, none has been forthcoming. "
Black, 54, joined the Premier League club in June as assistant to manager Claude Puel.
The former Aston Villa caretaker manager and Aberdeen striker denied the allegations.
