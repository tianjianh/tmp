Disabled man 'could have been saved'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who died suddenly at a supported living home could possibly have been saved if there were more checks while he slept, a coroner has ruled.

Nico Reed, who had cerebral palsy and severe learning disabilities, was found dead at Barrantynes supported living home in Chalgrove in August 2012.
An inquest at Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard that the 23-year-old died after inhaling his own vomit.
Southern Health, which now runs the home, said Nico's needs were met.
The inquest heard on the night Nico died there was one member of staff caring for four profoundly disabled residents and it was likely there had been 45 minutes to an hour between the time Nico was last seen and found not breathing.
Guidelines suggested checks every 20 minutes.
Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter, recording a narrative verdict, said there was no risk assessment in place regarding Nico's vomiting and that that would have been preferable.
"Nico had complex health and social care needs which we are confident were assessed and met in the most effective way possible," said Phil Aubrey-Harris, divisional director for social care.
"We have reviewed our processes and conducted an internal investigation since the incident, and though we do not believe we could have changed the outcome that day, we are committed to learning from any incident such as this, and from the coroner's comments."
He said Nico was a popular resident and was "fondly remembered" by the staff who cared for him.
Nico's parents Rosi and Ian Reed, from Bloxham, are calling for an independent review into their son's death.
"There was a real possibility that had he been found within the specified guideline times, he could have been saved. You can imagine how we feel about that," said Mrs Reed.
"Perhaps this goes as a warning shot out now, to not just supported living services like Barrantynes, which unfortunately seem to fall through the net quite often, but all care homes.
"It is time to sharpen up your act folks, it is time to get it right.
"Because if you don't get it right, the consequences won't be good for you."
Southern Health took over the running of the home from the now defunct Ridgeway Partnership after Nico's death in 2012.
