Orkney and Shetland are best places to raise children, says survey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Orkney and Shetland have been named the best two places to raise children in Britain for the second year running, according to an annual survey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Western Isles again came third in the 2016 Bank of Scotland Children's Quality of Life Survey.
Orkney's winning formula included a high average school spend per pupil, low class sizes and little traffic.
Across Scotland, Highland ranked fourth, with Perth and Kinross coming fifth.
The full Scottish top 10 is:
The average school spend was Â£9,281 per pupil for Orkney.
This was more than double the British average.
Orkney had one of the lowest population densities in Britain, with 22 people per square km.
This was against the national average of 276.
Shetland was said to have the highest employment rate in Scotland with 89.1%.
Other leading indicators:
Bank of Scotland economist Nitesh Patel said: "The north of Scotland has always done well when we've done this research.
"So it's no surprise that Orkney, the Shetland Islands and Western Isles remain the top three in the 2016 Bank of Scotland Children's Quality of Life Index, across both Scotland and Great Britain.
"Children in these areas benefit from low primary school class sizes, low pupil-to-teacher ratios in secondary schools, excellent exam results and some of the highest school spend per pupil."
