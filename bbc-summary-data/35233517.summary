The story started trending on Twitter, so we asked big-boned felines on the social network to not only show off their claw-some body shapes but also to give their views on the pay disparity.
This is, of course, just a tongue-in-cheek look at the serious issue of pay discrepancy - but if you feel you have any pictures that would help us encapsulate stories making the news, then do get in touch and tweet @BBC_HaveYourSay.
