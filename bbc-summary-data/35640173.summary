Islamist militias in Libya have lost two major areas in the eastern city of Benghazi, military sources and residents have told the BBC.

"People are celebrating on the streets," a resident said.
Fighters loyal to anti-Islamist Gen Khalifa Haftar are reported to have taken over the port, a hospital and have cut off a key weapons supply line.
Thousands have fled more than a year of fighting in Benghazi, the birthplace of the 2011 uprising.
Once in the Libyan army, Gen Haftar fought with revolutionaries to overthrow long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi.
Libya has since fragmented and has rival parliaments backed by various militias and brigades spawned by the uprising.
The chaos has allowed Islamic State fighters to gain a foothold in the country, and some are believed to be fighting with other Islamist militias in Benghazi.
In January, the UN brokered a deal between rival lawmakers to form a unity government, but this has not yet happened.

The controversial Gen Haftar's gains give him a stronger hand in Libya's volatile political landscape, and puts military actors in eastern and western Libya on a near equal-footing in terms of territorial control.
The general and his political backers will now be emboldened to demand a greater say in who leads the army under the proposed unity government.
But the already faltering peace process could go back to square one as politicians and militiamen in the west, who are vehemently opposed to the general, harden their attitude.
One MP in the west, who played a key role in getting the big Misrata brigades to support the peace process, has already launched a scathing attack on Gen Haftar, calling him a "dictatorial coup leader".
Last year, Gen Haftar was appointed as the head of armed forces for the parliament based in the eastern port city of Tobruk.
Some of the  Islamist militias he has been battling in his hometown of Benghazi are backed by political factions in the west, where the Tripoli administration is based.
