Two goals from Sarah Crilly and a first City goal for young midfielder Sam Kerr ensured the champions remained five points clear of Hibernian Ladies.
Hibs maintained their challenge with a 3-0 win over Celtic.
Elsewhere, Rangers Ladies won 6-0 at Aberdeen, while Stirling University prevailed 3-0 at Spartans.
Goals from Lizzie Arnot, Abigail Harrison and Rachel McLauchlan against Celtic ensured Hibernian kept their slim title hopes alive.
But with only two games left, they must beat Glasgow City at the Excelsior Stadium in a fortnight if they are to have any chance of stopping Scott Booth's side from retaining their title.
The head coach fielded a much changed team to the one which started Thursday's 1-0 Champions League defeat at Swedish side Eskilstuna United, with one eye on this week's return leg.
A number of young City youngsters got their opportunity and they didn't disappoint as City went 2-0 up inside 13 minutes as Crilly converted a Clare Shine cross and Sam Kerr finished brilliantly after a flowing move.
Booth made further changes but City's dominance continued as Crilly scored her second goal 12 minutes in to the second half after being set up by Carla Boyce.
"We are happy with the three points today," Booth said. "The girls were really professional throughout. Our younger players who took part - Hannah Coakley, Sam Kerr, Carla Boyce, Kodie Hay and Brogan Hay - all deserve a special mention for coming in and delivering."
