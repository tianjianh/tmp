In total 14 tents were targeted, with cash, mobile phones, electrical items and credit cards stolen.
The incidents took place in the Green Camping Area of the Dundrennan site in the early hours of Sunday.
Police are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area at the time.
However, they praised the public in general for their good behaviour during the event.
Police said said there were "only a few matters of minor disorder" reported and no cases of serious disorder or violence.
There were 46 cases of drug possession and two cases relating to drug supply detected.
Insp Stuart Davidson said:  "We want to thank those who attended the festival for their generally good behaviour, and co-operation with the police and other agencies involved in the security and wellbeing of all those on site over the weekend.
"We have developed good working relationships with the organisers over the years and this experience helped towards a professionally-run event.
"I would also acknowledge the excellent standard of the security and stewards who assisted us over the weekend."
