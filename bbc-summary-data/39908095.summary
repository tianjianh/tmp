Nick Crosswell, Darran Harris and Geraint Rhys Jones have also departed.
"I'd like to thank our departing players for their hard work and commitment during their time with the region," head coach Kingsley Jones said.
"We wish them all the very best of luck in their future endeavors, both in rugby and beyond."
Flanker Crosswell made 56 appearances for the Dragons since joining from New Zealand province the Manawatu Turbos in February 2015.
Prydie became the youngest Welsh international when he made his Test debut aged 18 and 25 days when he won his first cap against Italy in March 2010.
Scarlets confirmed in April they had held talks with the 25-year-old, who joined Dragons from Ospreys in 2012.
Mitchell, capped 15 times by Wales, joined from Cardiff Blues at the start of the 2016-17 season and made 11 appearances for the Dragons.
Hooker Harris joined at the start of the season from Rotherham Titans while versatile back Jones had been with the regions since signing in 2013 from Scarlets.
