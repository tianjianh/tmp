[SN]TITLE[SN]
Legal challenge against Wrexham's Groves School listed status plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A legal challenge is to be launched against the Welsh Government's decision to give a former Wrexham school listed building status.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham council voted to demolish and redevelop Groves School, but protestors claimed the building near the town centre should be preserved.
The Welsh Government agreed to list it in August.
Save our Heritage said it was disappointed with the council's move to challenge the government's decision.
The school closed in 2003 following a shake-up of secondary school education and has since fallen into disrepair.
