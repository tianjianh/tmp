Akpom - who had four goals in his career before the game - opened his account from 15 yards after Ian Lawlor had saved from David Meyler.
The 20-year-old scored his second from the penalty spot after Sone Aluko was fouled.
Akpom completed his treble with a superb run and finish before Craig Jones hit a consolation late on.
Hull - who reached the final in 2014 and were 2-0 up against Arsenal before losing in extra time - were worthy winners but Bury were left to rue a decisive minute with the scores at 1-0.
Shakers sub Ryan Lowe had a goal ruled out for offside and moments later Hull doubled their lead when Aluko was brought down for a disputed penalty.
Meyler stepped up and placed the ball on the spot but captain Michael Dawson intervened and gave the ball to the on-loan Arsenal striker.
Hull manager Steve Bruce:
"The first half was ridiculous. We had sunshine, snow, hail and wind all on a difficult pitch. That is when shocks usually happen but we did what we had to do and the penalty was a key part in the game.

"I made 11 changes but it wasn't a load of youngsters out there. We have a strong squad.
"Chuba Akpom gets frustrated at times but you can see that he has all the ability in the world. He needs to keep his head down and work hard.
"We had a great time a couple of years ago in the FA Cup and I have to keep my squad happy. They all need to play and they will continue to do so."
Bury boss David Flitcroft:
"My team won't give up. They go to the death.

"We had a crazy two minutes of decisions. Ryan Lowe's goal was not offside, they go straight up the pitch and it's not a penalty. Aluko went over very easily. We're really disappointed in the officiating.
"Hull were true professionals with a great attitude. But the scoreline does not reflect what happened here today."
