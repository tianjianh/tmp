Epsom Derby winner Wings Of Eagles has been retired after suffering an injury in the Irish Derby on Saturday.

The colt was going for a dual Derby win at the Curragh but finished third in what has proved the horse's final race.
A statement issued by the Coolmore racing operation on Sunday said he "was found to be lame this morning".
It added that a veterinary surgeon had "diagnosed a fracture of his left front sesamoid" and that "sadly this is a career-ending injury".
Wings Of Eagles, ridden by jockey Padraig Beggy, was a 40-1 outsider but came from deep to win the Epsom Derby in early June.
Beggy was replaced by Ryan Moore for the Irish Derby.
The a son of a Derby winner in Pour Moi, Aidan O'Brien's colt won two of his seven starts and earned more than Â£1m in win and place prize money.

Even by the standards of the often-fleeting careers of flat-racing stars, this has all been brief. It's less than a year since Wings Of Eagles made his debut, down the field in a race at Galway.
Being such an outsider when propelling both himself and his jockey from obscurity in the Derby will always have some saying it was a fluke.
He ran too well on his finale to say that with certainty, but he will probably be more remembered for the shock result at Epsom than for anything else - unless he proves a big hit at stud.
