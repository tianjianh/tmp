The Grammy award winner will receive her prize during a ceremony in June.
The organisation's chairman, Jimmy Webb, said Midler "captivated the world" with her "stylish presentation and unmistakable voice".
Previous recipients of the award include Dick Clark, Neil Diamond and Tony Bennett.
Midler launched her music career in 1972 when Barry Manilow produced her first album, The Divine Miss M, a title chosen in honour of her stage name.
The record won Midler her first Grammy for best newcomer.
In 1981 she won the Grammy for best female pop vocal performance for The Rose, and in 1990 her track Wind Beneath My Wings was named record of the year.
She has also had a successful film career, appearing in hit movies such as Beaches, Ruthless People and For the Boys
Last month it was announced record producer Jim Steinman, famed for writing songs for Meatloaf and Bonnie Tyler, will also be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in June.
