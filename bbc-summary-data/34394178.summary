Walkers along the Cardigan coastline are being warned about the dangers of approaching seal pups.

The young seals may look abandoned but the Wildlife Trust's Living Seas said they are often left on the beach as their mother swims for food.
Sarah Perry, Living Seas' science officer for south and west Wales, has urged people not to touch them as this could cause them to be abandoned.
Dogs should also be kept on a lead "well away", she added.
Ten baby seals were found on Monday alone after the charity checked the shoreline between New Quay and Llangrannog.
