The 30-year-old spent last season on loan with Nottingham Forest, making 21 appearances and scoring two goals.
O'Grady also had a month-long spell with Sheffield United under current Brewers boss Nigel Clough from mid-November 2014.
"I want to contribute to the challenge. It's an exciting one," O'Grady said.
"I was with Nigel a year ago at Sheffield United and I loved it, but it was cut short as after a month I got called back."
