[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Avon and Somerset's police chief has been temporarily moved away from his job following a misconduct hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earlier this month Nick Gargan, 48, was found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but cleared of gross misconduct by an independent panel.
Details can not yet be made public about what the panel ruled Mr Gargan had done, according to the police and crime commissioner's (PCC) office.
He is returning to work but not yet in Avon and Somerset, the PCC said.
Sue Mounstevens added he would be "carrying out some work with the National Police Chief's Council [NPCC]", although no further details were given.
Mr Gargan, who joined the force in March 2013 will, officially remain employed as chief constable.
According to its website, the NPCC develops best practice for different areas of police work in areas such as criminal justice, cyber-crime and drugs.
Mr Gargan was initially investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission which found there was no case to answer for any criminal charges being brought against him.
The commission then recommended his case be referred to an independent misconduct proceedings panel.
Dorian Lovell-Pank QC chaired the panel, which included Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, Wendy Williams, and independent member John Rickard.
A private hearing, separate from Avon and Somerset Police, was held to discuss the matter and the findings of the panel are yet to be published.
In the meantime, Mr Gargan and Avon and Somerset PCC Sue Mountstevens said they were not allowed to speak publicly about the case.
Mr Gargan has told the BBC he wanted the details of his offences made public immediately, and could not see any reason why they should not be.
However Ms Mountstevens said: "The misconduct process is not yet complete. I'm waiting for the misconduct panel's report. When I receive that I will hold a further hearing with the chief constable to determine his sanction."
