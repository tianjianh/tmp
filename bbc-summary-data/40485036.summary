But his latest tweet, directed at American news network CNN, has caused even more disagreement than normal.
The video shows genuine footage from a few years ago when Trump was just a famous businessman.
He is at a wrestling match and temporarily joins in the fight, but in this new video the man he is fighting has the CNN logo over his face.
President Trump has been in a long argument with CNN, who he says report false stories about him. CNN deny this.
Some people have said this isn't the kind of thing a world leader should be sharing, but a lot of President Trump's supporters say it's just a joke and they like the way he acts as President.
