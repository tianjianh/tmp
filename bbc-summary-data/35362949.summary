The 25-year-old defender captained the Dutch team at the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada, where they reached the last 16 stage of the competition.
"Once I heard of Liverpool Ladies' interest there was only one place I wanted to move to," she said.
"It is a massive club with real ambitions for the 2016 season and I cannot wait to get started."
Van den Berg is Liverpool's third signing in as many days following the arrivals of Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir and Sweden international Emma Lundh.
"I am delighted to have signed Mandy who I believe will be a key player for us this season," manager Scott Rogers said.
"Mandy has proven for Netherlands what a top class defender she is and I am looking forward to working alongside her," he added.
