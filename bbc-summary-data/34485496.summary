[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A book about Adolf Hitler by a University of Aberdeen historian is to be turned into a major television series.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prof Thomas Weber's book Hitler's First War, which was released in 2010, claimed his image as a brave soldier was a myth.
The producers of the Oscar-nominated film Downfall - also about the Nazi leader - will make the show after a French TV network purchased the series.
The show will be called Hitler.
Production of the 10-hour series begins next year.
Prof Weber said: "It is a privilege to see my book and the research behind it dramatised in this way for a large TV audience.
"Over the years a great deal has been written about Hitler but so little of this focused on his life in the years of the First World War.
"Hitler's First War uncovered many myths in regard to his service and motivations following the conflict. More importantly it demonstrated how Hitler's lies about his war years became political tools in his hands for the rest of his life.
"The series is a great opportunity to demask Hitler."
