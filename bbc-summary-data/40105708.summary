The 27-year-old made 101 appearances for the U's over two seasons after joining from Exeter City.
However, he was left out for Oxford's final five matches of the season for unspecified "disciplinary reasons", according to manager Michael Appleton.
He had been out of contract, but Appleton said the club would trigger a clause in his deal to ensure a fee.
"I wanted the transfer to take place before I took my holiday so that I can relax before coming back to a lot of hard work in pre-season," Sercombe told Rovers' club website.
"As soon as I knew of Rovers' interest, there was only one place I wanted to go. People who know me will also know how much I wanted to come here. I'm very happy and can't wait to get started."
