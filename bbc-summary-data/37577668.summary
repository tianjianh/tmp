The boy, called Ahmed, sent a text message on a phone given to him in Calais by Devon charity worker Liz Clegg, saying he was running out of "oksijan" - meaning oxygen.
Ms Clegg was being filmed as part of a documentary.
She alerted police and Ahmed and 14 adults were found in a container at services on the M1 after arriving from the Calais migrant camp, commonly known as the Jungle.
Ahmed is now living in the UK and has been reunited with Ms Clegg.
Inside Out South West is on BBC One on Monday 3 October at 19:30 BST and on the iPlayer for 30 days thereafter.
