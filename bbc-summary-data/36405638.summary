Rebii Simon took silver, her first individual senior medal, in the K1W 1000 A final.
Liam Heath and Jonathan Schofield won bronze in the K2 200, in which they claimed bronze at London 2012.
"It feels like we are going in the right direction but we're not going to get complacent," said Schofield, paired with Heath in the K2 for Rio 2016.
Simon, 19, was one of the K4 quartet who secured GB's quota place at Rio and was delighted with the performance that put her on the podium in Racice.
"I'm pretty happy with my race and I really couldn't have done any more. I've got lots of silver medals but all from junior level, so it's pretty special," she said.
