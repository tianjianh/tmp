Every race, practice and qualifier will be live on BBC Radio 5 live or sports extra and the BBC Sport website.
An extensive digital offering will even let audiences decide how they watch.
"Our top-class team will get audiences as close as possible to the starting grid, paddock, pit-lane and track," said Ben Gallop, the BBC's head of F1.
Reigning champion Lewis Hamilton will again write an exclusive column for the BBC Sport website.
He will preview every grand prix weekend and share his thoughts on his ongoing performance throughout the season.
Hamilton told BBC Sport: "I hope it gives some insight into my life, which is pretty different to most people's, and shows just how much work I put into being the best F1 driver I can be."
The Malaysian Grand Prix on 29 March is the first of the 10 live races on BBC television this year, including the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on 5 July.
The climax of the 2015 season in Abu Dhabi, which last year saw 6.5m people tuning in on BBC1 to watch Hamilton beat Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to the drivers' championship, will also be live on BBC television.
Coverage of qualifying and races from the grands prix not live on television will be shown in the popular extended highlights programmes.
Presenter Suzi Perry will again lead the television team alongside chief analyst Eddie Jordan and co-commentator and expert pundit David Coulthard.
Lead commentator Ben Edwards will take fans around the track, with reporters Lee McKenzie and Tom Clarkson bringing all the news from the pit lane and ex-driver Allan McNish providing additional analysis.
New for 2015, Perry will also present Formula 1 Rewind, which will be repeated on the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer.
Formula 1 commentary legend Murray Walker will delve into the BBC archive to recount the classic grands prix of the past.

Correspondent and commentator James Allen will lead the radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra with McNish as co-commentator and Jennie Gow as pit-lane reporter.
The F1 homepage of the BBC Sport website last year attracted an average of 3.3m UK visitors each week, an increase of more than 50% on 2013, and this year's digital offering is even stronger.
Live television races, Radio 5 live audio from every session, text coverage, expert analysis and opinion and the best of social media will come together at the BBC live commentary page.
On live race weekends fans will control how they watch the action with five different video options to choose from in addition to the network TV coverage.
There is the pit-lane camera, a driver tracker, a stream of on-board cameras and TV images accompanied by Radio 5 live commentary. A highlights package will also be available to watch after every race.
You can keep in touch on the move through the BBC Sport app, where you can now sign up for alerts on the result of every track session through the season.
Audiences can access the BBC's coverage by visiting BBC Sport's digital platforms on any device, and via the BBC Sport app.
