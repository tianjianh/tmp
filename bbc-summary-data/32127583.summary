A 12ft-high (3.6m) statue of a gorilla made from 40,000 spoons has taken up residence at a Shropshire hospital ahead of a UK tour.

The sculpture is expected to stay in the car park at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for two months.
Clive Knowles, of the British Ironworks Centre where the artwork was made, said he hoped the work would be "inspiring" for children being treated there.
The sculpture will be taken on tour to raise money for hospital charities.
It was built in Oswestry, following a challenge by Uri Geller, from spoons donated by people from across the world, including children in India and China.
Mr Knowles said: "It's starting the UK tour of hospitals and hospices from Shrewsbury." The next stop for the spoon gorilla is expected to be Telford's Princess Royal Hospital.
People taking photos of themselves with the sculpture are being encouraged to donate money to the local hospital - in this case the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust Charity.
