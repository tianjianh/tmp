At 20:30, places such as Edinburgh Castle, the Forth Rail Bridge and the Kelpies were plunged into darkness.
As well as hundreds of Scottish landmarks, thousands of homes are thought to have participated in the event.
Earth Hour is a global annual event that aims to inspire collective action on climate change.
One hundred and seventy-two countries and territories and over 7,000 cities took part in the event. Earth Hour takes place across 24 time-zones, with the "switch-offs" starting in Samoa and finishing in Tahiti.
WWF said that Earth Hour 2015 was the biggest one to date.
Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland said: "Every year I'm amazed and delighted at how the people of Scotland get behind Earth Hour. From schools and businesses to politicians, celebrities and iconic landmarks, we've received an amazing level of support and we've enjoyed hearing all the different ways people planned to celebrate the hour.
"Lights around the world went out for one hour this weekend, but the need to take action extends throughout the year.
"Earth Hour brings temporary darkness to many of our most recognisable  landmarks and is a moment for us all to reflect on  ways we can go beyond the hour to help tackle climate change and protect our brilliant planet."
