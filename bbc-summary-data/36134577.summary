The Welsh team were beaten 4-0 at Leicester on Sunday, following a 3-0 loss at Newcastle the previous week.
Swansea are 15th with three matches to play, nine points above 18th-placed Norwich who have a game in hand.
"You're not safe until you're mathematically safe, so I can't say we are," said Taylor.
"We score as a team and we defend as a team.
"The shape at the moment is not right and we are not doing well enough defensively to stop them getting up that end of the pitch in the first place, let alone scoring the goals.
"It's something we're going to need to work on because obviously we don't want the season to just peter out."
Norwich travel to Arsenal on Saturday followed by home games against Manchester United and Watford, before a trip to Everton on the final day of the season.
Sunderland, who are 17th, are nine points behind Francesco Guidolin's side and also have four games still to play.
Swansea, who host Liverpool on Sunday, reached the 40-point mark with a 1-0 win over Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium on 9 April.
But they suffered their worst defeat of the season at the hands of title-chasing Leicester at the King Power Stadium.
"If you look at how we played first half, we didn't look like a team that was on the beach, we looked like a team that came here to try and get something," Taylor said after Sunday's defeat.
"We conceded two unfortunate goals but we were probably the better team first half.
"Second half the game got away from us and the last 10, 15 minutes were a bit of a non-event because of where the result was at.
"Then it starts to look like maybe you're on the beach when your mentality is definitely not like this.
"The last thing we want to do is finish the league like this and go into next season on such a low."
Swansea end the season with a visit to West Ham on Saturday, 7 May and a home game against Manchester City on Sunday, 15 May.
