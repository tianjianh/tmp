It is hoped 5,700 pupils aged 14 and over will spend up to four hours a week on the subject in a new five-year trial.
Classroom and online teaching, "real-world challenges" and work experience will be made available from September.
Hacking, by criminals or foreign powers, into important computer systems is seen as one of the top threats to the UK's security.
Russia, in particular, is suspected of attacking on Western targets.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is providing Â£20 million for the new lessons, which will be designed to fit around pupils' current courses and exams.
Digital and Culture Minister Matt Hancock said: "This forward-thinking programme will see thousands of the best and brightest young minds given the opportunity to learn cutting-edge cyber security skills alongside their secondary school studies.
"We are determined to prepare Britain for the challenges it faces now and in the future and these extra-curricular clubs will help identify and inspire future talent."
