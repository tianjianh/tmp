The 26-year-old joined from Fleetwood Town last summer, but has agreed a 12-month extension to that deal.
The Welshman made Lilywhites debut in September and has played 29 games so far this season.
"He has been a big part of the team since he earned his place," boss Simon Grayson told the club website.
