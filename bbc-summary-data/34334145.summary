The body responsible for art funding in Wales announced on Wednesday which companies would receive annual funding from 2016.
It said it was reducing the number of organisations it supports to 67 from next year.
Four organisations, including a street dance group called Jukebox Collective, have been added to its portfolio.
Announcing the outcome of the review, Arts Council of Wales chairman, Dai Smith said: "These are challenging times, but we have identified an exciting portfolio of organisations from the international to the very local - organisations which celebrate the best of Wales on the world stage and those that work with local communities."
A total of 94 companies applied for more than Â£32m from ACW's revenue-funded pot from 2016.
The successful applicants include orchestras, theatres and galleries, arts centres and community arts organisations from across Wales, ACW said.
The last investment review took place in 2010.
