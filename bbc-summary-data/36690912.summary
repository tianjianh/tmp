Iurii Cheban of Ukraine retained his men's 200m canoe sprint title in Rio and set a new Olympic record.

A mix-up in qualification rules meant London 2012 champion Cheban initially missed out on a place in Thursday's final before being reinstated in place of Czech paddler Martin Fuksa.
The 30-year-old went on to claim gold, finishing in 39.279 seconds.
Valentin Demyanenko of Azerbaijan won the silver with Brazil's Isaquias Queiroz dos Santos securing bronze.
Dos Santos, 22, became his country's first canoe sprint world champion in 2013 and has a remarkable back story.
At the age of three, he suffered significant burns to his body after a pot of boiling water fell on him.
Two years later, he was kidnapped and offered for adoption before his mother managed to get him back, and at the age 10 he fell out of a tree after trying to catch a snake and lost a kidney.
