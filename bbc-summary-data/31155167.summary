Frozen Fever is a seven minute follow up to the hugely successful first film.
It follows Elsa and Kristoff's attempt to throw a birthday party for Anna.
However, Elsa's icy powers put more than just the party at risk, according to Disney.
These are the first pictures to be released from the short film.
It will be shown in cinemas before the new live action feature film version of Cinderella and features a new song, written by the same people who wrote "Let it Go".
