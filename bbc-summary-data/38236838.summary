It beat off stiff competition from Linwood, Gourock and Auchterarder to scoop the title at the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum awards ceremony in Glasgow on Tuesday.
Hazel Cross, from Fife Council, who helped make changes, accepted the award on behalf of the town.
Brian Schultz from Lochgelly Community Council said he was "overwhelmed".
Mr Schultz said: "I'm absolutely delighted that Lochgelly, and the hard work of all of the organisations and volunteers in Lochgelly, is finally getting the recognition it deserves as Lochgelly is a fantastic town that is always improving."
Ms Cross said: "Lochgelly has been on a journey of people and place and the collaborative working over a number of years has helped change the face of Lochgelly by improving the towns assets, creating new housing, leisure and business opportunities.
"The Lochgelly community is strong and determined and have delivered a range of community led projects throughout the town over the years and I know Lochgelly will continue to be successful."
