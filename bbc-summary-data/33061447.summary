Oklahoma City school uncovers blackboard lessons from 1917

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The traces of classroom lessons from nearly a century ago have been found on blackboards at a school in Oklahoma City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boards, preserved since 1917, were uncovered beneath another set of boards removed during renovation work at the Emerson High School. Chalk marks on the boards provide an insight into American schooling as it used to be.
Several drawings appear to come from a history lesson about the Pilgrims, who were among the early European settlers in America. The writing is in a flowing, cursive script - increasingly rare in modern schools.
