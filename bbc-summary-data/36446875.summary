The foot was discovered by a walker on Tal y Foel, near Dwyranh, on 6 April.
North Wales Police said DNA testing has confirmed it is that of Richard Thomas, who was reported missing from his Bangor home on 31 December 2013.
Mr Thomas, who was then 47, was last seen in the Bangor area on seven days earlier.
Police carried out inquiries, searches and media appeals at the time but he was not found.
Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney said: "Mr Thomas's death is not being treated as suspicious and HM Coroner for north west Wales Mr Dewi Pritchard-Jones has been notified.
"Mr Thomas's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time."
