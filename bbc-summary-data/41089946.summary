GBBO: How viewers reacted to the first Channel 4 episode

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Great British Bake Off's first episode on Channel 4 has gone down well with viewers - although some took time to adjust to the new line-up and advert breaks.

The new series - which is the first since the show left the BBC - sees Paul Hollywood joined by fellow judge Prue Leith, with Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig on presenting duties.
An average of 5.8 million viewers watched the show - rising to 6.5 million when those watching on +1 are included.
The first episode of the series broadly won over the critics, but it's the viewers Channel 4 needed to convince.
"I feel like I'm breaking some kind of law by watching this without Mel, Sue and Mary," tweeted Kelly as the episode started.
But with other viewers declaring the show "the best thing about being British," most stuck with it and had been won over by the time it ended.
Toksvig was popular on Twitter, with Mary writing: "Sandi is a natural to give this show coherence and polish."
Michelle said Sandi's co-host Noel was "pretty adorable" while Rob said he was "totally on board" with the Mighty Boosh star as a presenter.
Greg wrote that Fielding was going to "single-handedly save this series".
But Stephanie said: "It's like Top Gear all over again ðŸ™ˆ"
(We don't think that's a compliment given how Chris Evans's season went down.)

Chloe said Sandi and Noel were "no Mel and Sue", while Hannah tweeted: "The word bake just doesn't sound the same coming from them."
But former contestant Rav Bansal spoke for many when he said: "Although Mel and Sue will always have my heart, Sandi and Noel are doing brilliantly."
Very diplomatic.
Not everybody was a fan of the commercial breaks, and many viewers were quick to tweet their thoughts when the ads started rolling.
"Adverts in GBBO is just wrong," was one of the more printable reactions to the first break.
By the third, Julie said she was getting "fed up" with the interruptions and Gemma tweeted they were the "only thing I hate about the new GBBO".
Former winner Nadiya Hussain even said she was holding off on watching the show until she could skip the adverts:

But Pauline pointed out: "Don't mind the adverts - allows me to make tea!"
Similarly, Katie felt the ads "built the tension" while Vicky said they "give you a chance to debrief in between segments".
Line-up changes and ad breaks aside, many viewers said the show felt reassuringly familiar.
Sue tweeted: "Hats off to Channel 4 - well done for keeping GBBO the same great format.
"Yes the ads aren't great but they weren't too badly placed! ðŸ‘
