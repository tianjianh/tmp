Georgina Callander was the first victim to be named following the explosion on Monday night.
The teenager, who was pictured with Grande in 2015, sent a Twitter message to the star before the event, which read: "SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU TOMORROW".
Miss Callander, thought to be 18 and from Chorley, Lancashire, was described as "beautiful" by friends.
They said on social media she was one of the first people taken to hospital after the attack.
Miss Callander had already met Grande and previously posted a photograph of herself with the 23-year-old singer, taken in 2015, on her Instagram account.
She was in the second year of a health and social care course at Runshaw College in Leyland.
In a statement, the school said: "Our deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to all of Georgina's family, friends, and all of those affected by this loss.
"We are offering all available support possible at this tragic time, including counselling with our dedicated student support team."
A fundraising page has been set up to help her family with funeral and memorial costs.
Bolton Wanderers Football Club paid tribute to the former Bishop Rawstorne Church of England Academy pupil, who had played for their under-11 girls' team in 2010.
Club chaplain Phil Mason said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with her friends and family during this awful time of loss."
He added that there will also be a minute's silence before the first team ladies' friendly against Wigan Athletic on Wednesday evening at Macron Stadium, where the team will wear black armbands.
