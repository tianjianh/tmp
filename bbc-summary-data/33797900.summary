Hatton Garden raid: Two more people charged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and woman have been charged in connection with the Hatton Garden safety deposit box raid at Easter, the Metropolitan Police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair are accused of offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
Brenn Walters and Terri Robinson, both from Enfield, are due to appear before Westminster magistrates later this month.
Nine people already charged in connection with the heist have appeared in court.
Police said a further three individuals, a man and two women, have also been interviewed under caution.
Mr Walters, 43, also known as Ben Perkins, of Manor Court, and Ms Robinson, 35, of Sterling Road, are due to appear in court on 27 August.
Items believed to be worth more than Â£10m were taken in the raid at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London's jewellery quarter over the Easter weekend.
Thieves broke into the vault and ransacked 73 safety deposit boxes.
Arrests followed in May and June after police raided addresses across London and Kent.
