Stirlingshire-based Graham's The Family Dairy said sales rose slightly in 2015 to Â£86.5m, having shot up by 25% in the previous year.
Pre-tax profits, however, climbed by 21% this year to Â£1.6m.
The company said it aimed to boost margins in 2016 by increasing sales of its added value range of products.
It added that the move would help fund an increase in marketing activity "to boost awareness" of its brand.
Graham's said its spreadable butter was the "fastest growing brand in Scotland" but 96% of the spreadable butter market was currently non-Scottish.
It aims to grow market share by highlighting the provenance of its products.
The firm has invested Â£5m in the business, including at its dairy in Bridge of Allan, in order to increase its production capabilities for spreadable butter.
There has also been investment in its Nairn dairy, where it now produce a new range of yogurts.
The company is also expanding into cottage cheese, quark and sour cream, after recently acquiring the Glenfield Dairy in Fife from First Milk.
Graham's managing director Robert Graham said: "It's been an excellent year but we're not complacent and there's much we still need to do.
"For example, to us it's crazy that so much dairy produce bought within the UK isn't actually made here.
"Those sales don't benefit our local farmers and the extra mileage is no good for the environment either.
"It makes much more sense to back Scottish businesses and so that message will form a critical part of our plans next year."
He added: "We are proud of what we've achieved and the numbers are strong, but we want our margins to be stronger next year and in the years beyond, which is why we've invested so heavily in the business throughout 2015 - improving efficiencies and encouraging future growth."
