Police probe £500,000 Touchline Tickets fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 500 people have become victims of a £500,000 fake ticket scam.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight people have been arrested by police over the alleged fraud after sports fans paid for tickets but never received them or a refund.
An inquiry, launched last summer but only just publicised, into firm Touchline Tickets has led to another three people being interviewed.
Allegations of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering are being probed by Essex Police.
Websites touchlinetickets.com, touchlinetickets.net, getsporting.com, greenpitchtickets.com and tickets4summergames.com are currently being looked at.
Six men, aged between 25 and 45, and two women, both aged 25, all from Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and London have been arrested and bailed until dates in April and May.
Three London men, aged between 22 and 48, were interviewed voluntarily.
Essex Police would not reveal which sporting events victims tried to attend, but called on fans wanting to go to the Rio Olympic Games and UEFA Euro 2016 to use "recognised companies" for tickets.
An investigation was launched after the force was contacted by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.
