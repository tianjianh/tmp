Gilbey scored five goals in 37 League One games for Colchester last term, but could not prevent them being relegated.
The 21-year-old was described as "destined for the Premier League" by former U's boss Kevin Keen in January.
"Alex was one of the outstanding young talents in League One last season," Latics manager Gary Caldwell said.
"He's exactly the sort of player and person who suits this club and we're delighted to add him to the group for pre-season."
