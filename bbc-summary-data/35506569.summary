A supporters' group wants fans to leave their seats in the 77th minute of Saturday's home game against Sunderland in protest at the £77 top-priced ticket in the new main stand next term.
Ayre highlighted that 64% of season ticket prices will decrease or freeze.
"No-one is being priced out of the stadium," he said.
"There is a seat for everyone at the right price."
Plans for the new three-tier main stand at Anfield, increasing the stadium's capacity from 45,500 to almost 59,000, were announced in 2014.
Work began on the £100m project in December 2014 and is expected to be completed in time for the start of next season.
Ticket prices for 2016-17 were announced this week, with fans' group Spirit of Shankly critical of the "extremely disappointing" outcome.
Liverpool's announcement focused on the fact 45% of matchday tickets will be available at a lower price and that local fans will be given priority access to more than 20,000 tickets over the league season, with prices starting at £9.
John Pugh, MP for Southport, urged the club to think again.
He said: "As a lifelong Liverpool fan, I am appalled at the extortionate price of tickets.
"I completely agree with the fans that the club should be for supporters, not customers. It can only hurt the Liverpool FC family.
"If the club start putting their tickets at sky-high prices, many fans won't have the chance to enjoy a game."
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said earlier he believes extra television revenue for Premier League clubs will be used to buy players rather than cut ticket prices.
In excess of £8bn will come into the league from new broadcast deals.
Wenger said: "What will happen is the prices of the players will go up and you will need this supplement of money coming in to buy new players.
"I believe the pressure on spending the money will become bigger and you cannot necessarily distribute the money to other people."
