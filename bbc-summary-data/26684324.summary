[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A troubled sheepskin coat factory, which clothed Del Boy in television's Only Fools & Horses, has closed after 168 years because of falling trade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nursey of Bungay, in Suffolk, opened in 1846 but closed on Wednesday after failing to secure a buyer.
The firm had 85 staff in the mid-1980s, but only employed seven people recently and had not made a profit in six years.
Owner Tim Nursey said he was "sad to see it go".
Mr Nursey, 64, was the fifth generation of his family to work at the company and started his training when he was 18.
He said the firm, which made coats, hats, slippers and gilets, had suffered another bad winter, with a lot of shops it used to sell to closing.
An online shop also failed to produce dividends.
A number of buyers had recently expressed interest in the firm, which also lists BBC football commentator John Motson and guitarist Eric Clapton as customers, but Mr Nursey said the deals "didn't work out".
The company's employees have been handed redundancy payments.
"The stress I have gone through in the past month has been unbelievable," said Mr Nursey.
"I was taking five-mile runs before work just to combat the stress.
"We had the chance to sell the brand and the stock, but for various reasons I also said 'No' to that.
"We'll keep the shop open for another week and will then reopen again in mid-October for a while to clear the stock.
"I'd like to say thank you to our customers and the people of Suffolk and Norfolk who have been very loyal to us over the years."
