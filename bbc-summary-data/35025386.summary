Heavy rain over the weekend left thousands of homes in Cumbria without power and some schools and hospital services closed.

As Storm Desmond swept across parts of the UK, people have been sharing their experience with BBC News:
Sarah Whitby sent in this photo from the River Rothay in the Lake District on Saturday.
Robin Newton, from Keswick, spoke to the BBC on Sunday. He said he had had no supply of water all day.
"I live near to the River Greta. We have been flooded, but the majority of Keswick is out of water. The local fire station has been handing out bottles of water, but they have now run out. I walked a quarter of a mile away into town this morning - the devastation has been unbelievable. The river was a raging torrent, and it had breached all the new flood defences. At the back of my house, I can hear the roar of the river."
Ravi Uppoor lives close to the River Eden in Carlisle. He described how the river flowed over the flood defences on Sunday.
"About 15 houses near to my house are flooded. One of my neighbours, who is in her 90s, said she had never seen anything like this in the last 40 or 50 years. There is no power supply, no fire alarm or heating, so we have had to make alternative arrangements for our children. The rain was unprecedented. I grew up in India with a lot of flooding, but I have never seen anything like this."
John Chadwick was evacuated from his home in Carlisle on Saturday, as the River Caldew burst over the flood barriers.
"The waters were 2in [5cm] deep, and I got out by dinghy. I live alone and have severe mobility problems including osteoarthritis and mild epilepsy - I just had time to grab some medication. I have nowhere suitable to stay as I need ground-floor accommodation with disabled access. My friend drove near where I live, but he couldn't get through. I have nothing insured."
Ben Freke, a student at Lancaster University, said the power had gone out at 23:00 GMT on Saturday on campus. The next day, everyone was given two hours to evacuate the building.
"As a lot of students are unable to go home - some are international students - the only place to go was to the Great Hall on campus. When my dad arrived to pick me up today, it was pandemonium - people tried to get on coaches to Preston, and some had to wait for hours."
