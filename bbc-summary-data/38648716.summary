Only a small group of people were lucky enough to see the huge beast - called Humpback - in Lakeland, Florida.
Wildlife experts have estimated the alligator weighs about than 360kg and is up to 15 feet long - that's as long as a family estate car!
In the video it is seen tootling across the walking path - before slipping back into the swamp at the US nature reserve.
