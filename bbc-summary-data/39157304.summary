The 22-year-old has made six appearances in all competitions for the League One side this term.
Long, who made his first-team debut in April 2013, is a graduate of the U's academy.
"He can play in a few positions and is improving all the time," Oxford head coach Michael Appleton said.
"He has had to be a bit patient but he will get his chance at some stage and we know he will take it with both hands when that happens."
