Police accountability: Why body cam footage is not always released

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In North Carolina, a black man is shot by police. According to his daughter, he was unarmed and reading a book. The police say he was armed and refused to drop his gun. Police released bodycam and dashcam footage days after the incident following calls from activists and politicians.

As of August this year, 42 of 68 "major city" police departments in the US have body-worn camera programmes with policies in place, according to the activist group Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
Following the police killing of black teenager Michael Brown and the ensuing riots in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, the US justice department pledged $20m (Â£15.4m) of funding in grants for police forces to buy as many as 50,000 cameras across the nation.
The Leadership Conference points out accountability does not automatically follow: "Whether these cameras make police more accountable - or simply intensify police surveillance of communities - depends on how the cameras and footage are used."
No. At the moment there is no standardised national approach to dealing with the increased volume of police footage.
There is a patchwork of practices across the country, with many police departments failing to have clearly-formulated policies.
For example, not all police forces have a set of rules about when officers must record, whether they need to provide justification for failure to record, and whether individuals filing police misconduct complaints have full access to all footage.
The Leadership Conference have produced a "rate card" showing how well each department using body cams is doing in a number of civil rights areas, with some coming out better than others.
The police department of Charlotte-Mecklenburg does have a public policy, but does not perform well in all areas on the rate card.
No.
Although Brentley Vinson, the officer who shot Keith Lamont Scott, was in plain clothes and had no camera on him, three other officers did have theirs on.
Police department policies, where they exist, tend to specify all footage from the body cams are the property of the police department in question, and may not be released without the specific authorisation of the superintendent.
Some states have even passed laws making body cam footage exempt from freedom of information requests.
North Carolina, for example, has a new law restricting release of such footage without a court order, but the law does not come into effect until 1 October.
It might stop protests and riots.
In some cases, the police are keen to make the footage public if it shows the officer made the correct decision.
When Sylville K Smith was shot dead by police in Milwaukee on 13 August, the police chief, mayor and state representative called for publication of the police footage.
But the case is under the jurisdiction of the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which said it will not release the footage until after the investigation.
The killing was followed by two nights of protests and rioting.
Police departments can learn, too.
The Chicago police department now has rules which dictate that police must release video footage of a fatal police shooting within 60 days.
It released more than 300 videos of police-related incidents, in an attempt to restore trust between officers and black communities.
It also released nine body cam videos of the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Paul O'Neal in August,  just days after the incident.
