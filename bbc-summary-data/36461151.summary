'Torrential downpour' warning issued

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met Office has issued a weather warning of potential "torrential downpours" across many parts of Scotland on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The yellow "be aware" alert covers a band up the middle of the country from the Borders to the Highlands.
Heavy, thundery showers are possible and the public has been warned of the possibility of surface water flooding.
The warning - valid from 14:00 to 21:00 - said the showers would be slow moving but many places would "miss the worst".
