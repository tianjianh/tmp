Russell Slade: We are finally winning over the fans at Cardiff

Cardiff City manager Russell Slade believes he and his side have won the club's fans over as they bid for the Championship play-offs.

Slade has endured a tumultuous relationship with Cardiff supporters since his appointment in October 2014.
But as Saturday's victory against Ipswich made it three wins from four, the Bluebirds are only one point behind the play-off places.
"I'm delighted if the fans are behind me - it's fantastic," said Slade.
"Since I've been here, it's been a question of trying to win fans over and just work hard. We've done that.
"We've got a unity in the dressing room. The fans have responded to that, and I do appreciate that.
"I know how keen they are to be in the top six and in the shake-up to get back to the Premier League again.
"It's been a test of character and our desire in what has, at times, been a difficult season. We've nine games left and we have an opportunity still."
Slade and his players were given a warm ovation after the win against Ipswich, as was the case even when they were beaten 2-0 at home by Leeds on Tuesday.
Although a victory for sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday at Nottingham Forest kept Cardiff seventh in the table, the Bluebirds' win against Ipswich at least opened up a three-point gap between Slade's men and the Tractor Boys in eighth.
Cardiff's next fixture is away at Reading on Saturday, before they host fifth-placed Derby and visit leaders Burnley in their following two games.
"When you are playing those around you like this - and we've still got Sheffield Wednesday, Derby and Birmingham to play - they are going to be big, big games," said Slade.
"But we can only control what we are doing, that's the important thing. We can't control what else is going on around the country.
"But if we've had a positive result and another side has not, that gives us a lift and gives us some momentum.
"It was just important to get the result [against Ipswich] - it's never easy against a resilient side.
"It was not the complete performance from us, we had to defend, and I think the fans saw that and were fully behind us. It was great to see that again."
