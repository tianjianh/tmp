Lyndon Dykes, who had earlier missed two golden chances, eventually beat Roy Carroll, who had been outstanding in the Belfast team's goal, with a tap-in.
Stephen Dobbie, the best outfield player on the park, was next with a sensational free kick.
But the Scottish Championship side thoroughly deserved the victory.
Pre-match, there was a minute's silence followed by applause in the 39th minute in tribute to Ryan Baird, the fan killed in the recent Rangers supporters' bus crash.
It is the first season when Northern Irish and Welsh clubs have entered the new-look Challenge Cup, joining at the last-16 stage.
And Linfield arrived with plenty of Scottish connections, including manager David Healy, the former Rangers striker who scored 36 goals in 95 appearances for Northern Ireland.
Carroll and Matthew Clarke were also at Rangers, Chris Casement at Hamilton Accies and Dundee and Sammy Clingan at Kilmarnock.
Dobbie was outstanding for Queens and, in the first half, could have had a couple of goals - one from a clever hitch-kick and a second effort that brought a save from Carroll, who saved again after Steven Rigg pounced on the rebound.
The best chance of the half for the side from Northern Ireland fell to Andy Waterworth, but he totally miscued.
Yet, despite the goals drought, it was smashing entertainment for the crowd of 2,358, of which 1,027 were Linfield fans.
Queens were much the better team but just could not get the ball in the net, even when Dykes was clean through with time to beat the goalkeeper but allowed him to make a save - on four occasions - to force the game into extra-time.
Eleven minutes into the extra half-hour, Dykes eventually got it right and rounded Carroll to score.
Dobbie put the final polish on the win with a fabulous free-kick that curled in at Carroll's right post.
Queen of the South striker Stephen Dobbie: "It was a great game. They came over from Ireland and put in a fantastic performance.
"Roy Carroll is a man of steel in goal there and we finally wore them down I think.
"It's great for the competition to have a couple of Irish and Welsh teams. It gives it something different from the league and Scottish Cup all the time.
"Whatever trophy you are in, you want to win it and this Irn-Bru Cup is no exception and look at all those fans from Ireland - it is a big attraction to Scottish football.
"I love the club and the club loves me and it shows in my football."
Linfield goalkeeper Roy Carroll: "Coming here, you're going to have to make saves.
"You are playing a full-time team here and they are top of the Championship.
"But the players worked hard and had a few chances in the first half, but at the end of it, Queen of the South's fitness showed.
"It was a great free-kick for the second one, but credit to Linfield - the support here was unbelievable and the work-rate was unavailable.
"It is great for players to come over from the Irish League and see how far they can go."
