Burger King expands menu with hot dogs

Burger King has announced that hot dogs will be the newest addition to its menus in the US.

The fast food giant's North American president said adding hot dogs was "the most obvious product launch ever."
Burger King plans to launch the hot dogs in 7,100 stores in the US, amid growing competition from other fast food chains.
This is not the first time the burger chain has turned to new product offerings to boost sales.
In March 2015, the company reintroduced "chicken fries" - deep fried chicken strips - first launched in 2005.
Burger King credited them with helping to drive better-than-expected sales in the second quarter of 2015.
The new hot dogs, called "grill dogs", will come in two varieties - classic, topped with ketchup, mustard, chopped onions and relish; and chilli cheese.
The company has suggested franchisees sell the classic for $1.99 (Â£1.37) and the chilli cheese version for $2.39.
Burger King hopes the new "grill dogs" are the perfect product as its restaurants can use the same grilling equipment used for burgers, and many of the same toppings.
Burger King is not the only US fast food chain looking to new products to boost sales.
McDonald's has begun offering its breakfast foods all day long, while Wendy's restaurants have begun offering a four for $4 menu - allowing customers to pay $4 for four items on an abbreviated menu.
More expensive chains like Shake Shack have put forward new products to attract customers, such as its "Chick'n Shack" chicken burger in January.
Not all new products are a success though. In 2013, Burger King launched "Satisfries" - a low calorie alternative to chips - that failed to attract customers.
Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International will announce its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week.
Restaurant Brands was created last year, when Burger King's majority shareholder, 3G Capital, bought Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons for $11bn.
3G also owns the Heinz ketchup brand.
