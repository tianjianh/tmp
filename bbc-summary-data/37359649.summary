[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thunder, lightning and downpours strike England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parts of England saw a dramatic end to the summer with hammering rain, sky-splitting lightning and ear-rending thunder.

Storms swept across the north of England, the Midlands and the south coast on Tuesday night.
Some Birmingham and Manchester-bound flights were diverted and power cuts left swathes of people in the dark.
The weather was so extreme, Manchester City's Champions League game against Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach was postponed after the pitch became more suitable for water polo than football.
Prestbury in Cheshire had 32.4mm of rain in an hour, while thunderstorms caused a power failure and transport problems in Cornwall. The level crossing at Camborne was flooded with fast-flowing rainwater.
Flash floods in Cornwall also affected Falmouth, Helston and Redruth and one person needed medical attention after a terrace of four houses was struck by lightning.
Others were "trapped in their homes" by floodwater, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said.
Lightning is a huge electrical discharge that flows between clouds, from a cloud to air, or from a cloud to the ground.
Thunder is caused by lightning - it's the sound produced by the rapid heating of air by a lightning strike.
It wasn't just the players affected - their WAGs didn't get away scot-free either, as the cosmetics department of Manchester's Harvey Nichols store sprang a leak.
Flash flooding happens when rain falls so fast the underlying ground cannot drain it away fast enough.
It is different to when a river floods, as most rivers flow fairly gently as they slope slowly towards the sea. When a river floods it tends to do so quite gradually as it takes time for the rain to percolate through the ground and into the rivers and out to sea âˆ’ allowing time for some warning.
With flash flooding there is often very little time between the rain falling and flash flooding occurring.
Flash flooding commonly happens more where rivers are narrow and steep, so they flow more quickly.
It can also occur away from small rivers in built-up urban areas where hard surfaces such as roads and concrete don't let the water drain away into the ground.
This leads to surface overflow and can often overwhelm local drainage systems leading to flash flooding.

Have we seen the end of the thunderstorms?
BBC Weather believes so. We're due "another very warm or hot day, particularly in central and south-eastern England, with prolonged sunny spells".
The north of England could see some light rain, but nothing on the scale we've just experienced, giving affected areas enough time to dry off before autumn kicks in for good.
