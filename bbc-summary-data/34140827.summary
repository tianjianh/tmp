Bexhill historic charter revives Wyrtlesham place name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Historians have looked back to an 8th Century charter to come up with a name for land currently known as North East Bexhill - or BX2 in local plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The area has been known as Wersham and Worseham and buildings for upper and lower Worsham Farm still stand there.
County archaeologist Casper Johnson put forward the earliest form of the East Sussex place name - Wyrtlesham.
Councillors have been advised to approve the new name for the land, which is being privately developed.
The idea was to make a link with to the Bexhill King Offa Charter of 772 AD, which refers to Wyrtlesham and which probably meant Wyrtle's farmstead, Bexhill Museum curator Julian Porters said.
"Communities need roots and we need to look back to our deeper history," he said.
Interest in Bexhill's history grew as archaeologists investigated the area during work to build the Hastings to Bexhill link road and traced its past back to the end of the last ice age, he added.
Rother Council said there were currently two applications for the land.
One, already approved, is for Barratt Southern Counties Ltd to build 108 dwellings.
The other, which is still to be decided, is for Bovis to build up to 1,050 homes and business space, and demolish existing farm buildings.
Cabinet members will consider the name on Monday.
