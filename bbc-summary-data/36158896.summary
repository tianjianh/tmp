The event, which is part of a four-night celebration, will be hosted by Ant and Dec on 15 in May on the private grounds of Windsor Castle.
Previously announced performers include Kylie Minogue, Andrea Bocelli, Katherine Jenkins and Jess Glynne.
Ant and Dec said they were "honoured to be hosting the special celebration".
"This spectacular evening will bring together some of the best known names in the entertainment world who will perform with 900 horses and 1,500 participants to mark this very special birthday", they said.
Dame Shirley, 79, has sung before the monarch on several occasions including for the Royal Variety Performance and during The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012.
Take That star Barlow, 45, was chosen to compose the Queen's official Diamond Jubilee single, Sing, with Andrew Lloyd Webber.
He performed the song with the Military Wives at The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert.
The celebration will tell the story of the Queen's life, from her birth in 1926 to her coronation in 1953, and the whole of her reign.
The event will be broadcast by ITV on 15 May.
