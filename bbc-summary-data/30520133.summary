[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stamford matron 'determined to solve Christmas card mystery'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital matron has said she is "determined to solve the mystery" of who has been sending a Christmas card to staff every year for 54 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The card, addressed to Stamford & Rutland Hospital, purports to be from a patient who was treated on the male-only Exeter Ward in 1960.
Hospital matron Sue Brooks said she wanted to find out who the sender is while he is still alive.
She said it would be great to meet the mystery gentleman.
"It's such a long time ago, and for someone to remember us and continue to do so every year makes it very special.
"What we don't want to do is get to the year when the card doesn't arrive - that would be desperately sad," she said.
Mrs Brooks said the hospital received hundreds of cards every year, but this one always caught her eye.
She said although she had only worked there for six years, she had heard many stories about the annual card.
She added the only clue as to where it might have come from is a postmark showing the South East Anglia mail centre, which is in Chelmsford, Essex.
Anyone with information about the sender of the card is being urged to contact the hospital.
