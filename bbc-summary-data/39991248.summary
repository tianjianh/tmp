Election 2017: Scottish Labour to set out pro-UK manifesto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour will never support independence, the party is set to confirm in its manifesto.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The document, to be revealed in Edinburgh, stated the Labour movement "offers the hope and the contemporary solutions to society's problems".
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP government at Holyrood of prioritising independence over day-to-day governance.
She called on the SNP to respect the verdict of the 2014 referendum.
In her manifesto foreword, Ms Dugdale wrote: "Labour is the only party which knows it is the power of the whole UK working in partnership which benefits the many, not the few - that is at the root of our belief that together we're stronger.
"That is why Labour opposes independence and a second divisive independence referendum. Independence is not the answer to dealing with Scotland's flagging economy or our pressured public services."
The manifesto states that another vote on independence is "unwanted and unnecessary", and with Labour pledging to "campaign tirelessly to ensure that Scotland remains part of the UK".
"The SNP needs to respect the verdict of the majority of Scots in 2014 and abandon its divisive plan to re-run the referendum," it says.
Scottish Labour's focus on its opposition to independence comes as both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have sought to define the election as a two-horse race between their parties.
The Tories, who have squeezed Ms Dugdale's party into third place, have repeatedly led their campaigning on a hardline message of opposing another referendum.
Scottish Labour's manifesto will also include a series of pledges aimed at delivering "transformative change" in Scotland.
These include commitments to bring forward Member's Bills on banning MSPs from holding paid second jobs, extending breakfast clubs into every primary school, banning onshore fracking, improving access to sanitary products to tackle "period poverty" and scrapping the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.
Scottish Labour won one Scottish seat in the 2015 General Election.
Labour's UK manifesto also confirmed it opposed an independence referendum.
UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously said it would be wrong for Westminster to block a second referendum if the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of one.
Writing in the manifesto foreword, Mr Corbyn said: "In Scotland, child poverty is increasing, the number of those working but still classified as poor is at its highest level since devolution, and health inequalities stubbornly persist. Rather than tackle poverty, the SNP obsesses over another reckless referendum that threatens people's futures.
"Labour is opposed to independence because it would inflict turbo-charged austerity on the Scottish people. We will stand firm in our opposition to a second referendum because we know that together we're stronger and unity is still our strength.
"Historically, it has been the solidarity and common endeavour of our Labour and trade union movement that has transformed the lives of the many, not the few, in our great country.
"Just as it has always been the case, only our movement offers the hope and the contemporary solutions to society's problems. Nationalism, in whatever form, does not."
The Scottish Conservatives, who launched their manifesto last week, will be campaigning in the south of Scotland to promote the new Borderlands Growth Deal.
The SNP will launch its manifesto on Tuesday.
