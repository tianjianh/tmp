[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A five-month-old girl died after a seizure caused by a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain, an inquest has heard.

Sunaria Hamid-Howells, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, was taken to the doctors four days before her death after falling from a rocker chair.
But a neonatal expert told the hearing in Cardiff that the incident was unlikely to have caused the fatal injuries in December 2012.
The inquest will last three days.
Cardiff and Vale assistant coroner Christopher Woolley outlined evidence from the child's parents and how the infant had become "floppy" while being fed by her father, Dilshad Hamid.
Sunaria's mother Katherine Howells called on a neighbour for help and a paramedic told the hearing the baby was having seizure episodes while receiving emergency treatment.
She was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, but died on New Year's Eve.
GP David Harris said he had examined the child on 27 December after being told she had fallen from a rocker chair.
"I felt a swelling on her upper skull but there wasn't any severe or significant change compared to the other side of her head," he said.
"Mum seemed fine with Sunaria and there was nothing unusual."
The doctor said he decided to monitor the swelling and wanted an ultrasound scan to be carried out if it did not subside.
Evidence from Dr Iyad Al-Muzaffar, neonatal consultant at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, was read out by Mr Woolley.
He said a scan had shown Sunaria had suffered a haemorrhage as a result of skull fracture and bleeding to the brain.
Dr Al-Muzaffar added: "The severity of the head injury suggests an acute event.
"In my opinion the history given of Sunaria and the rocker does not explain her acute presentation on December 30."
The inquest continues.
