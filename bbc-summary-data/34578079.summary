[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Canada elects one of its youngest ever prime ministers, Justin Trudeau, what are the hopes and dreams of young voters for this new era?

To find out what this new generation cares about most, BBC Pop Up partnered with the smartphone app Yik Yak, whose audience is 98% millennial.
Before the election we asked: "How will Canada's election affect you?" Below is a selection of the most "upvoted" responses.
We also posted a poll: "What's the number one issue that will decide your vote?"
Thousands of "Yakkers" responded and the result - shown here - was the economy, followed by energy and the environment.
Finally, on election day, we asked:  "Who would be the best leader for young people?
Outgoing Conservative leader Stephen Harper was the least-preferred candidate.
The NDP's Tom Mulcair was 1.07 times more popular, and the new PM Justin Trudeau won 2.7 times more "upvotes". But he was not the winner of this poll.
So just who was the favourite choice of millennial voters? "None of the above".
