[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wantage Road Bridge will close for demolition works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new bridge on a major road over a railway is closing for four days so its predecessor can be demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A338 Wantage Road Bridge in Grove will be closed from 22:00 GMT on Friday until 06:00 GMT on Monday.
It opened in July because a higher bridge was required to allow new electric trains to run underneath.
Network Rail said the four-day closure needed to remove the old bridge was the "shortest time possible".
The bridge forms part of a main route between Wantage and Oxford.
Graeme Tandy, Network Rail's project director for the Thames Valley area, said: "The improvements we are carrying out are essential in order to bring our railway into the 21st century and improve passengers' experiences.
"I'd like to thank residents and motorists in advance for their patience and understanding while we carry out this work, which will pave the way for electrification and the benefits this will bring."
