[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was involved in a mistaken identity shooting in which the victim was blasted with a shotgun through his front door has been found guilty of attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Willis, 33, and his accomplices travelled to a flat in Brighton, where a single shot was fired.
The 40-year-old victim, who police said was not the intended target, suffered serious injuries as a result.
Willis was convicted following a four-week trial at Hove Crown Court.
He was also found guilty of conspiracy to murder a 25-year old man.
Jurors heard the group of organised criminals went to the wrong flat, in Elmore Road, on 27 January.
They fired after trying to force their way in.
Sussex Police said an innocent man was subjected to a "shocking and frightening" unprovoked attack.
Willis was remanded in custody for sentencing on 6 January.
Hayden Pendleton, 29, of Damwood Road, Liverpool, was found not guilty of attempted murder and conspiracy to murder.
The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third man, Spencer Bowen, 24, of Heathfield Avenue, Dover, Kent.
Mr Bowen, who was charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to murder and grievous bodily harm, was remanded in custody to face a retrial next year.
Charges against Lewis Carney, 27, of London Road, Dover, were dropped at the start of the trial.
He had been accused of conspiracy to murder.
