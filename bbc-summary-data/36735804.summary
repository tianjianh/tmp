[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Freshwater, 49, was found stabbed to death at a property in Westridge Road on 29 April.
A 28-year-old man is being held on suspicion of assisting an offender, conspiracy to supply class A drugs and money laundering.
At least 13 people have so far been arrested as part of the investigation.
A 25-year-old man from Southampton has become the latest to face charges.
He is being held on remand, accused of conspiracy to supply class A drugs, and is due before Southampton Crown Court on 5 August.
Last month, Mr Freshwater's partner, Jenny Downey, made an emotional appeal for help in tracking down his killers.
Hampshire Constabulary said it is believed there was a dispute at the property before Mr Freshwater's body was discovered.
