Led by overwhelming all-around favourite Simone Biles, the USA scored 184.897 to retain their crown and win a fifth successive global title.
Russia claimed silver with 176.688, ahead of bronze medallists China (176.003) and Japan (174.371).
Great Britain, seeking a first medal in the event since 1928, scored 174.362.
The British team - Claudia Fragapane, Becky Downie, Ellie Downie, Ruby Harrold and Amy Tinkler - had high hopes of finishing on the podium after winning bronze at last year's World Championships in Glasgow.
But, after finishing fourth in qualifying on Monday, they had to settle for a place lower in Rio's Olympic Arena.
The US were the hot favourites in Rio after winning the past three world crowns - in 2011, 2014 and 2015 - in addition to their success in London four years ago.
And the quintet of 19-year-old Biles, Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian and Laurie Hernandez showed why by producing a dominant display from the very start.
Biles, who has dominated the sport since making her senior debut in 2013, is trying to become the first gymnast to win five medals at a single Olympic Games.
So it was fitting that the 4ft 9in gymnast sealed her nation's victory with an almost flawless floor performance to close the event.
The US are the first women's team to win back-to-back Olympic golds since Romania in 2000 and 2004.
Britain made an encouraging start on the uneven bars, ending the first rotation in third place, but slipped to fifth at the halfway stage after Ellie Downie fell off the beam.
They were unable to improve on that position after the floor exercise, despite producing a performance only bettered by the Americans.
Downie impressed in the vault - the final rotation - but it was not enough to lift GB into contention.
Christine Still, BBC Sport gymnastics expert and veteran coach:
"The British have performed fantastically well. There have been a few ups and downs in the championships but they have not let it affect them.
"They have carried on fighting right through and gave a great performance today.
"What a fantastic final, some great gymnastics going on. This has been truly great.
"USA did not disappoint and there will be talk if this is the greatest team ever."
Becky Downie: "This is one of the strongest teams we have ever put out, we could not have done more and nobody should be disappointed."
Ellie Downie: "We put everything we could into this competition. We went out there and enjoyed it, but we did not get the scores we wanted on some of the apparatus. We wanted that team medal but we did all we can so we're really proud."
Claudia Fragapane: "I am happy to have gone out there and enjoyed the competition. These girls made it fun and we gave it our all."
