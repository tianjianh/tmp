Braehead Clan have revealed that long-serving Belfast Giants player Craig Peacock will be joining the Glasgow based franchise for next season.

The forward has decided to move on after the Giants were unable to make promises of increased ice time for Peacock in the new Elite League season.
Peacock lies second in all time goals and points scored for the Giants.
He helped Belfast win the play-off title in 2010 and league titles in the 2011-12 and 2013-14 seasons.
