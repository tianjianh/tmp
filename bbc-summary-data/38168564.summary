Dumfries DG One repair works on schedule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Multi-million pound repairs at a flagship leisure centre in Dumfries are said to be proceeding on schedule.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The DG One centre shut in October 2014 but a legal wrangle between the council and the original builders meant works could not start for nearly two years.
They finally got under way in September this year with a timeframe of about 18 months for completion.
A report to councillors said the works remained "on programme" to be completed by 2018.
The Â£17m centre opened in 2008 but suffered a string of problems which led to its complete closure in 2014.
The total cost of repairing the issues uncovered is just short of Â£10m and contractors McLaughlin and Harvey started site works on 5 September this year.
Temporary gym and swimming pool facilities have been put in place in the town during the centre's closure.
A report to councillors said the repair works would be "regularly monitored" to check on their progress.
It also outlined the works already completed, nearing completion or still ongoing which include:
A number of changes to the configuration of the building are also being proposed during the repair works.
They would see a new children's play area, removal of the permanent bar area, relocation of saunas and changes to the catering provision.
Progress meetings are being held every two weeks to "review and assess progress" and to check on costs.
