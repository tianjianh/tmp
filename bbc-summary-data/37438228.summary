Nottingham Crown Court heard Allen attacked Mr Bloxham, 39, with a kitchen knife when he went to the flat they shared in Spruce Grove.
Allen, who had a previous conviction for assaulting police, was given a minimum term of 14 years in prison.
Speaking after sentencing on Wednesday, Det Insp Andy Bateman, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "I feel enormously sorry for the parents of Karl Bloxham and for his sister and friends.
"I'm also conscious that he had children from a previous relationship and I'm very sorry they have been deprived of him."
