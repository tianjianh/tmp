A stowaway kitten nicknamed Sinbad has survived an "epic" 2,000-mile voyage inside an Egyptian shipping container.

The eight-month-old ginger tabby climbed into a box of luxury linens bound for the UK from Alexandria.
When the container arrived at Felixstowe, Sinbad was loaded onto a lorry and was eventually delivered to a business in Herefordshire.
The RSPCA said it was a "miracle" he had survived the 16-day journey to Moreton-on-Lugg without food or water.
Pippa Boyd from the charity said: "It is just amazing he survived this trip at such a fragile young age, it really is something of a miracle.
"He was all curled up in the linens and had made quite a bed for himself.
"The poor thing was extremely hungry and thirsty after such a long journey without any nourishment so we have been feeding him carefully ever since as he cannot cope with a full feed at the moment."
Sinbad is now in quarantine, where he "seems healthy and bright," Ms Boyd said.
The RSPCA has started a fundraising appeal to cover the cost of his care, which will come to around Â£2,000 for a four-month stay.
