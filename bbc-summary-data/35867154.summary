The Magpies have lost to leaders Leicester and drawn with local rivals, and fellow strugglers, Sunderland since the Spaniard took over two weeks ago.
"You're always being watched - you feel like you're on trial if you like," Shelvey told BBC Newcastle.
"Everyone's looking to impress and being a lot busier than normal."
The 24-year-old continued: "But that's part and parcel of football, you need to show what you're about.
"When a new manager comes in, it's like going to school again."
Following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Sunderland, the Magpies remain next to bottom, one place below the Black Cats, and three points adrift of safety - although both teams have a game in hand over 17th-placed Norwich City.
The Tynesiders have four points fewer than at the same stage of the 2008-09 season, when they were last relegated from the top flight.
However, Shelvey is confident Benitez can make a big difference during the two-week international break.
"People are listening to what he says. His record speaks for itself," he said.
"[The break] will be a good chance to really knuckle down. We've not had much time since he's come in because everything has been a bit rushed."
Newcastle are next in action against Norwich at Carrow Road on 2 April.
The former Swansea midfielder added: "Rafa will come up with a game plan because that's what he does.
"I'm sure we'll go to Norwich and give a very good account of ourselves."
