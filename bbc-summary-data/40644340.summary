[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe after record Test run-chase in Colombo

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sri Lanka successfully chased down a record target of 388 to beat Zimbabwe in the one-off Test in Colombo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kusal Mendis, Niroshan Dickwella and Asela Gunaratne all hit half-centuries to complete the highest ever chase in Asia and the fifth best of all time.
Victory had looked beyond Sri Lanka when Sikandar Raza (127) rescued Zimbabwe from 59-5 in their second innings and took them to 377 all out.
But Gunaratne batted for almost four hours on the final day to seal the win.
