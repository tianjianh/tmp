A composer who plans to create a work of music scored beneath the limits of human hearing has won the Dare Arts Prize.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Hertz will spend a year working to create the piece of electro-acoustic chamber music.
The new annual competition, which has a Â£15,000 prize, is aimed at getting artists and scientists to work together creatively.
It is organised by Opera North and the University of Leeds.
Mr Hertz was chosen from a shortlist of five artists who proposed works which included whale choir, the exploration of cosmic bubbles and a slime study.
The composer, who is based in Berlin and San Francisco, will work with researchers from the University of Leeds and staff at Opera North on the piece.
The piece will be "felt rather than heard" and will examine how that will effect an audience's mood and feelings.
He said: "I expect this year will be enlightening and productive both for my practice, and the practices of my collaborators in our joint expedition into the drama of the unheard realm of infrasound."
The results of the year-long collaboration between artist and scientists will be revealed in March 2018.
