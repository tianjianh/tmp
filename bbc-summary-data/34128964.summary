Ivan Rakitic helps Barcelona to victory at BATE Borisov

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ivan Rakitic scored his first two goals of the season as Champions League holders Barcelona beat BATE Borisov to go top of Group E by three points.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A dominant Barca had 74% possession and 21 shots in Belarus, where Luis Suarez and Neymar forced early saves.
Rakitic, who replaced the injured Sergi Roberto after 18 minutes, found the top corner from 20 yards after half-time.
Neymar made the opener and created Rakitic's coolly taken second with a slick pass.
Luis Enrique's side host BATE - crowned champions of Belarus for a 10th straight season at the weekend - in their next game on 4 November.
Any upset looks unlikely on this showing and the Catalan club's progress could be all but guaranteed by victory if Roma and Bayer Leverkusen draw on the same night.
Even without the injured Lionel Messi, Luis Enrique's side created a host of chances but goalkeeper Sergey Chernik kept them at bay until Rakitic scored his first club goal since last season's Champions League final.
Neymar, influential throughout, could not add to his tally of five goals in his past two games as he was denied by a series of blocks and Chernik's saves.
Barcelona coach Luis Enrique: "This can be a turning point.
"We have been on a run where it has been difficult for us to score and we have suffered at the back with the little that we have been threatened.
"You always need to improve. It was not as though we were so bad but we needed to change.
"We have created a lot of chances to score but we continued with the same run we have had all season where we have not finished them off."
