You can find out more about UKIP's UK pledges here - this guide looks at the focus of the Welsh manifesto.
The manifesto is entitled "Wales Into The World".
"Make no mistake: this is a Brexit election," a preface to the manifesto says, claiming Theresa May wants to "pull the wool over the eyes of the British people" and is "pretending" to be a Brexiteer.
"Wales needs to safeguard the interests of future generations. We need an outwardly looking Wales ready to make the most of the opportunities that a global economy creates," the preface, written by UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton, said.
"Wales has been totally abandoned by mainstream politics," says the UKIP Wales manifesto.
"For many life can be tough."
It says that, outside Cardiff, the idea of a "metropolitan utopia that offers highly-paid professional careers is an alien concept to most".
The manifesto says Wales needs to move away from a public sector and subsidy-based economy.
As well as UK-level pledges to raise the personal allowance to Â£13,500 and raise the threshold for paying 40% income tax to Â£55,000, Welsh pledges include:

On energy, the manifesto says relying on wind-power is "not sensible". It pledges:
Wales does not need to accept free movement of people, the manifesto says.
UKIP argues that Wales should have the freedom to control its own borders and deliver an immigration policy in-line with what the party says are the wishes of the Welsh electorate.
"Wales exported more to the EU than it imported in 2015," the manifesto said. "Wales does not need EU membership to trade with it."
Wales and the UK do not need a trade agreement with the EU, but UKIP claimed a "bespoke agreement on our terms" is likely.
The manifesto says the party would ensure Brexit negotiations give control over VAT, allowing the party to remove VAT from hot-takeaway food, sanitary products and energy bills.
