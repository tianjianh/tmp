Two hundred mayors and lord mayors in full regalia paraded through Halifax which was chosen as the main focus for this year's celebration.
Elsewhere, a Yorkshire pudding tossing competition was held in York.
Yorkshire Day was first celebrated on 1 August 1975. One of the key features of the day is the reading of the Yorkshire Declaration of Integrity.
Geraldine Carter, deputy mayor of Calderdale, said: "It's fabulous, look at all the people who have turned out, it's a wonderful occasion.
"It's really good for the town and Calderdale after the floods, it's important Halifax gets on the map."
Calderdale Council said it would be flying the Yorkshire flag at Halifax Town Hall from sunrise to sunset.
Among the dozens of other Yorkshire Day events, York Maze hosted an annual Yorkshire pudding tossing competition.
Organisers said the winning throw at 2015's event was a distance of 34m (112ft).
