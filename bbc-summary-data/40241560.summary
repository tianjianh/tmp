Fabio Capello: Chinese Super League side Jiangsu name Italian as coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England manager Fabio Capello is the latest high-profile coach to move to the Chinese Super League, signing a contract with Jiangsu Suning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 70-year-old, who led England for four years before resigning in 2012, joins former Premier League managers Luis Felipe Scolari, Andre Villas-Boas, Gus Poyet and Felix Magath in China.
Former Chelsea manager Scolari coaches current champions Guangzhou Evergrande.
Capello's fellow Italian Marcello Lippi is in charge of China's national team.
A Jiangsu statement confirmed: "We have signed a working contract with Mr Fabio Capello. He will be the head coach. Welcome Fabio!"
Capello made his name at AC Milan in the 1990s, winning four Serie A titles and the Champions League. He went on to win two La Liga titles in separate spells with Real Madrid and another Italian league crown with Roma.
He also won Serie A twice with Juventus but both were revoked and they were demoted to the second division for their involvement in Italy's match-fixing scandal.
England reached the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup under Capello, losing to Germany, and he resigned two years later after a disagreement over the stripping of the captaincy from John Terry.
He went on to spend three years as Russia coach before being sacked.
