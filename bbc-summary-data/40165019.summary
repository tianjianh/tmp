[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three members of a County Antrim family have admitted charges over a road crash that killed two men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash took place on 6 April 2015 on the Cushendall Road in Ballycastle.
The two men who died were Johnny Black, 19 and Robin Wilson, 26. Seven other people were injured.
Shane Kinney, 22, of Drones Road in Armoy, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and two counts of causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving.
His father Kevin Kinney, 52, admitted perverting the course of justice by removing their son's car and obtaining parts to have damage to it repaired.
His mother Sharon Kinney, 50, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by removing the car after it was involved in the fatal Easter Monday crash.
The admissions were made at Antrim Crown Court as their trial was due to start.
A previous court hearing was told that two vehicles were found at the scene of the crash, one in which Mr Wilson had been travelling, and the other containing Mr Black.
However, investigations led police to believe a third vehicle was involved, a blue Volkswagen Golf, identified as belonging to Mr Kinney.
No damage was found to his car when he presented himself to police two days after the crash.
But officers believed car parts were stolen in a scrap yard in Armoy and were fitted to the vehicle and forensic evidence matched the parts to a car in the yard.
Witnesses also placed Mr Kinney at the scene of the crash with damage to his car.
On Monday, a judge said it was not Shane Kinney's intention to cause the two deaths, but it was his intention to engage in "some sort of race".
All three Kinneys were released on bail, with Shane Kinney being disqualified from driving as part of his bail conditions.
Pre-sentence reports were ordered, and the Kinneys will be sentenced in September.
