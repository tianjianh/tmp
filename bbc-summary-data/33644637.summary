Northern Ireland hospitals: Total waiting longer than 12 hours in A&E 'almost halved'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Department of Health has said the number of people waiting longer than 12 hours in Northern Ireland emergency departments almost halved, from 456 to 236, during April to June of this year.

The monthly attendances at all emergency care departments increased by 2,426 (4%), from 60,772 to 63,198.
There was a slight increase in the proportion of patients attending type one emergency care who were seen within four hours.
This figure rose from 70.1% to 74.4%.
The Department of Health said the number of patients waiting longer than 12 hours was still disappointing and that "although this represents less than 1% of the total number of people who attend emergency departments, we expect the HSC Board and trusts to do all they can to work to eliminate all avoidable 12-hour waits".
"The minister continues to pay tribute to the exceptional work of staff in continuing to meet the challenges of providing unscheduled care services," a spokesperson added.
"It is important that the whole system works together to support patient care, this includes GPs, ambulance service, community care teams as well as those staff who work in acute hospitals.
"The minister continues to encourage everyone to use urgent and emergency care services appropriately to avoid adding pressure on to an already busy system."
