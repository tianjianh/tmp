Crowdfunding and Â£750,000 of National Lottery cash has supported the building of a new pavilion at the Herne Hill Velodrome.
The Velodrome was where Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins began his cycling career.
The 450m cycle track was recently granted a 99-year lease.
Hillary Peachey, Chairman of the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust, said she was "immensely proud" of the project.
Ms Peachey said "it has been a long journey" but that the "community came together" to help re-furbish the facilities dilapidated pavilion.
The new stand, which was built using materials from the old structure, includes changing rooms, first aid room and club room overlooking the site.
Before the 2012 Olympics a deal was reached between British Cycling and the owner of the site, Dulwich Estate.
A new games area, junior cycling track and lighting system were added to the south London site.
It is now hoped the improvements will see more people using the venue throughout the year.
Charles Johnston, Director of Property at Sport England, said: "The new pavilion will help position the velodrome as a first-class venue ideal for everyone in the local community and beyond."
