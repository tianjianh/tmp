Former bank manager accused of aiding £112,400 fraud scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former bank manager is to stand trial accused of aiding an alleged £112,400 customer account fraud.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christiane Stoner, 43, is accused of facilitating frauds to be carried out on customer accounts that resulted in a six-figure loss to Barclays Bank.
Prosecutors allege she printed customer information and took images of their signatures from a bank system at a Barclays branch in Stirling.
She is accused of supplying the data and images "to persons unknown".
The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2013.
Ms Stoner is accused of entering into or becoming concerned in an arrangement which she "knew or suspected" facilitated the acquisition, retention, use or control, by or on behalf of another, of criminal property within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
She is charged with possessing, or having under her control, articles for use in committing fraud, namely images of the signatures of six Barclays Bank customers taken from the bank's system.
Ms Stoner, of Carnbroe, North Lanarkshire, pleaded not guilty to all seven charges at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Robert Dickson continued the case for trial in January.
