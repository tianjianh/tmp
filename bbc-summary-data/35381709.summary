Carlisle United's return to Brunton Park after a month away through flood damage is testament to the hard work of club staff, says manager Keith Curle.

Extensive damage to the playing surface, dressing rooms and offices was caused by December's Storm Desmond.
Carlisle played home games away from Brunton Park while it was restored, in time for Saturday's visit of York.
"There's a massive thank you from me as the head of football for the work they do," Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"The people behind the scenes that don't get the mentions are working in adverse conditions, completely out of their comfort zone.
"The workload they're taking on board is without question phenomenal and there's an opportunity for them to enjoy the limelight they don't usually get."
One positive to come out of the devastation left by the floods was the coming together of the community to help - and that included Carlisle's coaching staff and players.
The squad contributed to clean-up efforts in the city with local residents, while home games were taken away from Cumbria to Blackburn Rovers, Blackpool and Preston.
"There's a real togetherness this season and the boys are buzzing to get back here in front of what I'm sure will be one of the biggest crowds of the season," said captain Danny Grainger.
