Paul and Sandra Dunham, from Collingtree, Northants, were extradited accused of business expenses fraud and money laundering at the US company they used to work for.
The couple expected their trial to begin in Maryland this week but told BBC Radio Northampton they have been told the presiding judge is unwell.
The pair deny the charges.
Mr and Mrs Dunham have been on bail and are currently staying with friends in North Carolina who offered their house as collateral.
The bail conditions end on Monday and the Dunhams could be returned to the Chesapeake Detention Facility, where they will be jailed and kept apart until their trial.
Mr Dunham, 59, said the trial may not take place until the spring.
"Hopefully it will be heard sooner rather than later but the court does have a full schedule and also both our lawyers and the prosecutor have other commitments," he said.
"It's a combination of everybody trying to see where something could be scheduled to work.
"We are struggling with the pressure of it all still.... it's a very difficult time."
