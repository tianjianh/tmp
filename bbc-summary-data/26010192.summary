Nobody was inside the VW Lupo when the ground on Main Road in Walter's Ash gave way.
The vehicle is still at the bottom covered in rubble.
Firefighters said the hole was about 15ft (4.5m) diameter but left the scene after discovering no-one was inside. Wycombe District Council will now have to decide what steps to take next.
A Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: "Firefighters were called to a sinkhole which swallowed a parked car in the driveway of a house in Main Road, Walter's Ash.
"Firefighters placed a cordon around it and gave safety advice.
"The incident was handed over to building control at Wycombe District Council. Firefighters were at the scene for about an hour."
