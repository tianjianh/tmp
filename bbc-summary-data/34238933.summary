The Take That star shocked Natalie Purkis by turning up to her wedding reception at Aston Rowant on Saturday.
In January, Barlow initially promised to sing at the weddings of three fans - but has gone on to sing at more.
He tweeted: "I'll look back fondly at 2015 as the year of the wedding crasher!"
The couple, from Andover in Hampshire, were celebrating their wedding at the Lambert Arms hotel in the Oxfordshire village when Barlow arrived and serenaded Mrs Purkis with the Take That hit Rule the World.
Mrs Purkis's husband Martin had contacted him via social media to persuade him to come to their wedding, after his announcement at the start of the year that he would surprise selected fans on their special day.
She said: "The DJ started playing Rule the World, I heard screaming, turned round and Gary Barlow was on his knees singing to me. I asked him 'are you real?'!"
She later tweeted: "I can not thank @GaryBarlow enough for finishing off mine and @mjpurkis wedding day perfectly. No words can ever be enough to thank you x".
Barlow has "gatecrashed" other weddings including that of Berkshire bride Danielle Jones and Anita Morrissey-Booth from Liverpool.
He posted on his Twitter feed: "Well that completes my wedding appearances for 2015! Thank you to everyone who invited me to their special day!
"What started out as just a bit of fun turned into something much more meaningful and amazing."
