But an unbroken 48-run last-wicket stand between Steve Patterson and Ryan Sidebottom earned the hosts a second batting bonus point, handing the hosts an important psychological advantage.
Travis Head hit 54 on his first-class Tykes debut aided by Jack Leaning (42).
Patterson (35 not out) and Sidebottom (11 not out) reached stumps on 252-9.
Sidebottom was back in the side after recovering from the serious ankle injury which he sustained in late April.
Fellow seamer Jack Brooks was also fit again for Yorkshire following an abdominal strain, while spinner Adil Rashid was also included having been released by England.
Yorkshire were in some trouble before a 60-run stand between Leaning and Tim Bresnan (28) helped them to recover to 190-5.
Four wickets then went down for 14 runs, two of them to Barker, before Patterson and former England left-armer Sidebottom formed Yorkshire's final gritty rearguard action of the day.
Reigning county champions Yorkshire went into the game in sixth in Division One, but with a game in hand of all those above them, apart from Durham.
Warwickshire, also in with a good chance of claiming the crown, held third spot, 14 points behind leaders Middlesex.
Yorkshire batsman Travis Head told BBC Radio Leeds:
"It was a bit of a challenge having not faced the red ball since the end of our season back home and it was tough in the morning. But it was nice to get a half-century on my first appearance in the Championship.
"I was disappointed not to get a big score. Unfortunately, I let it slip and hit one straight to a fielder but I am happy with the way I am batting at the moment.
"There was swing for the bowlers all day and the odd ball nipped around but it seems a good wicket which the lads say is drier than usual and should take spin in the last innings and give Adil Rashid a chance.
"We could have been bowled out for around 220 and chasing the game but we battled hard at the end and our bowlers will come out fresh, particularly as there are one or two new men coming back into the side."
