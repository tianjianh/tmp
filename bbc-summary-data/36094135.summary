The film, inspired by Sir Compton Mackenzie's 1947 novel, is based on the true story of a shipwreck off the coast of Eriskay during World War Two.
The ship was sailing to the US with a cargo of export-only alcohol.
In the film, the islanders are determined to take advantage of the unexpected windfall, despite opposition from the local Home Guard captain.
The original was made in 1949.
The remake has been written by screenwriter Peter McDougall and has a cast of well-known Scottish actors, including Gregor Fisher, Hames Cosmo, Kevin Guthrie and Sean Biggerstaff.
It also stars Eddie Izzard as the uptight Home Guard, Captain Waggett. The film was shot entirely on location in Scotland.
Director Gillies Mackinnon said: "I am delighted that Whisky Galore! will close the Edinburgh International Film Festival.
"This feels like the perfect and most appropriate world premiere for a film which is the remake of a Scottish film classic."
The premiere of the film will be on 26 June.
