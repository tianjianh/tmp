Former Port Vale goalkeeper Anyon, 30, and Gibraltar defender Wiseman, 31, have both signed two-year deals with Gary Caldwell's League Two-bound side.
Anyon played in Scunthorpe's third-tier play-off semi-final loss to Millwall.
"They're both good ages and the type of characters you want to lift a dressing room," director of recruitment Guy Branston told Chesterfield's website.
Anyon, who has previously played for Lincoln and Shrewsbury, told BBC Radio Sheffield: "When I spoke to the manager, he sold it to me. He wants to take the team back to League One and rebuild.
"It is a club that has all the right elements, the ground, the training ground. I think we'll get back there. Going forward, this is a good fit for me."
