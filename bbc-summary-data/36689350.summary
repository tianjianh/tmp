Kenny, champion at London 2012, came out on top in the first two races to win the best-of-three final.
Russian Denis Dmitriev beat Australia's Matthew Glaetzer to take bronze.
"It is special, really special," said Kenny, who has now won as many Olympic golds as rower Sir Steve Redgrave and fellow cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins.
Only Sir Chris Hoy, also a cyclist, has won more but Kenny, 28, can equal his mark when he races in the keirin on Tuesday.
"I'm really grateful," he told BBC Sport. "When we win, it feels like the team is winning and we have everyone behind us, pushing us."
"A Great Britain one-two is amazing," said BBC pundit Hoy. "Jason had so much in the tank. He had phenomenal power."
Victory takes Kenny's gold tally in Rio to two after he and Scottish rider Skinner were part of the British team that won the men's team sprint on Thursday.
As well as winning the individual sprint title in 2012, Kenny also claimed a team sprint gold in London.
He also won the team sprint at the 2008 Games, with his solitary silver coming in the individual sprint in Beijing, when he was beaten in the final by Hoy.
The Bolton cyclist's success also continued Britain's track cycling dominance in Rio. They have won four of the six events entered.
Kenny is engaged to Laura Trott, who became the first British woman to win three Olympic golds after helping win the team pursuit title on Saturday.
Trott, 24, won gold in the team pursuit and omnium at London 2012.
She will add a fourth if she defends her title in the latter event, which starts on Monday and concludes on Tuesday.
By the time the Rio Games are over next weekend, the pair could have amassed 10 Olympic golds between them.
After Kenny's win, Trott tweeted: "Ohhhhh myy!!!!! Jason Kenny you are my superhero!! Two down one to go. Can he do the triple?"
British badminton player Chris Adcock: "Fifth Olympic GOLD medal. Unbelievable!!! Absolute Monster. And huge congrats to @CallumSkinner on an amazing Silver!"
British BMX cyclist Liam Phillips: "If only you could see the state of @JasonKenny107 & @CallumSkinner's room... Deffo not Olympic standard!!! #Bombsite."
British cyclist Dame Sarah Storey: "Great job by Jason Kenny & Callum Skinner. That was brilliant."
Former Bolton striker Kevin Davies: "Well done to Bolton's finest Jason Kenny, another gold to add to his collection!!"
