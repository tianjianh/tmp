[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home for people with learning disabilities under council investigation has banned the local authority's officials from the site.

Bowden Derra Park in Launceston blamed Cornwall Council's "persistent intrusive and disruptive behaviour".
Last month the council suspended placements to look into "a number of allegations" about care.
It could not make an immediate comment on the ban at the home, which cares for 74 people.

The home's directors David and Judith Cash said in a statement that the council investigators were "impacting on service users' care" and they had "suspended Cornwall Council from accessing its care provision."
They continued: "We have patiently endured weeks of unfounded, unfocused, irrelevant, and increasingly aggressive investigation by Cornwall Council, who have chosen to ignore the evidence we submitted more than two weeks ago.
"It has now become increasingly clear that we must take steps to protect the safety and well-being of the people we support from these spurious allegations, which do not relate to direct care whatsoever."
A Care Quality Commision (CQC) inspection report, published March 2016, gave the service a "good" rating.
The CQC said it inspected the facility again last month and that its findings would be published in due course.
