[SN]TITLE[SN]
Appeal launched over 1993 Stockport double murder shooting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man convicted of murdering two civil servants in Stockport 22 years ago has begun an appeal against his convictions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Bourke was convicted of shooting dead two Department of Transport inspectors, Alan Singleton and Simon Bruno, in November 1993.
He has always maintained his innocence.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) confirmed it is "currently reviewing" Mr Bourke's murder and blackmail conviction,
The appeal is based on evidence from a new witness, who suggests the killer does not match the description of Mr Bourke, the BBC understands.
In a statement the CCRC said: "He applied to us in relation to the murder convictions in late February 2015 and applied in relation to the blackmail conviction in mid-December 2015. We are now reviewing all those convictions together."
His solicitor, Jane Hickman, said: "I think it is a case where there has been a failure at every level of the criminal justice system.
"What it's resulted in is quite a complex picture of a man who's so far done 22 years in prison for a crime which he says he did not commit."
