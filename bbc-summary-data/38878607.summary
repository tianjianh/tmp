The 23-year-old from Hamilton was competing in her first tournament since knee surgery after the Rio Olympics.
"I'm really glad that 17 weeks after my operation and here I am flying around the court as usual," she said in Perth.
Gilmour defeated Edinburgh's Julie MacPherson 21-11 21-7 on Sunday to make it six singles titles on the trot.
And, with Kinross's Patrick MacHugh, she went on to win the mixed doubles, defeating MacPherson and Martin Campbell 23-21 21-16.
In doing so, Gilmour became the first player since Rita Yuan Gao 15 years ago to hold Scottish titles in three different events, her tally standing at six singles, four women's doubles and one mixed.
"It's not just a starter tournament for me," said Gilmour on her return to competitive action, watched by new Badminton Scotland head coach Tat Meng Wong.
"It's one I want to go out and win and keep on winning. It was really important for me to be fit for this one."
MacPherson was runner-up in three finals last year but she finally broke her title duck when she and Eleanor O'Donnell won the women's doubles with a 21-19 19-21 21-16 victory over top seeds Rebekka Findlay and Caitlin Pringle in a 62-minute match.
Glasgow's Kieran Merrilees made it five men's singles titles when he defeated defending champion Matthew Carder 21-8 21-13 in another clash of the top two seeds.
Glasgow's Grimley twins had been hoping for an early birthday present by reaching the men's doubles final. But Christopher and Matthew, who are 17 on Monday, fell in a close semi-final, beaten by top seeds Adam Hall and Alex Dunn 21-11 23-21.
But Hall could not repeat last year's victory with Robert Blair as 2015 champions and 2016 runners-up Campbell and local favourite MacHugh reclaimed the crown 21-17 21-17.
