The midfielder, 31, has been out of action since fracturing a bone in his leg and suffering ankle ligament damage in the League One fixture against Sheffield United on 6 August, 2016.
Pratley returned to training but had to undergo another operation on Tuesday.
"It's a real shame for both Darren and ourselves," manager Phil Parkinson told the club website.
"We'll move on though and wish him all the best in his recovery."
