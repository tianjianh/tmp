[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff City 4-1 Brighton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff dented Brighton's automatic promotion hopes in the Championship while boosting their own play-off aspirations with a decisive win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three goals in the opening 30 minutes from Peter Whittingham, Anthony Pilkington and Lex Immers put the Bluebirds in control.
Dale Stephens pulled one back for Brighton but Whittingham's penalty settled matters.
Brighton stay third in the table, while Cardiff are up to seventh.
Relive Cardiff's victory over Brighton
For Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, perhaps there will be a feeling of vindication, having told the Bluebirds "to shoot more", they heeded his words in a first half where they were rampant.
Whittingham opened the scoring on 16 minutes after Matthew Connolly's run and pass, poking home superbly under David Stockdale.
Stockdale was culpable for the second three minutes later, conceding possession with a loose kick and then being deceived by the flight of the ball as Pilkington returned it with interest from just inside the penalty area.
Scott Malone's pass then deflected off Conor Goldson straight to Immers, who made it three with a smart finish.
Goldson also conceded the penalty smashed in off the underside of the bar by Whittingham on 66 minutes that settled matters.

Bobby Zamora missed Brighton's best chance in the first period while, for Cardiff, Wales Euro 2016 hopeful Tom Lawrence tested Stockdale either side of the interval and will have impressed the watching Osian Roberts, Wales' assistant manager.
Cardiff had not beaten Brighton in the league in 11 years, but the Seagulls conceded four goals for the first time this term despite Dale Stephens' consolation header on 55 minutes that briefly gave them hope.
Cardiff boss Russell Slade:
"That is a big boost for us and I have told the players I still feel there is plenty of improvement to come.
"I say that because we have new partnerships out there. Stuart O'Keefe and Joe Ralls have not played together that often in midfield, Anthony Pilkington has been up front and we have added new faces to the equation in Tom Lawrence and Lex Immers.
"It is a new team, a young team in certain areas and we are maturing. It was a real mature performance. We committed forward when we had to and we were resilient when we had to be.
"We were tactically disciplined against a side who are king of the counter-attack. If you leave yourself open they can hurt you, the balance was key to this game and we had that."
Brighton boss Chris Hughton:
"It is very simple, if you concede three goals in that manner it is very difficult to win any football match, particularly at this level and away from home against a side as good as Cardiff.
"We never allowed ourselves to get into the game. At 3-1 we had two good chances but I cannot say we deserved anything.
"The damage was self-inflicted, the penalty can happen at any stage but the damage was already done.
"We conceded three poor goals in that crucial period and that is nothing to do with form, formations or tactics. It is about defending well and we did not. It was a good opportunity for us and we did not take it."
