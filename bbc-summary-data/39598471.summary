Morgan was eight under under par - and four under for the round - with two holes remaining in Hawaii when organisers called a halt for the day.
South Korea's Kim In-kyung and Jang Su-yeon were tied for the lead on nine under with Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn.
England's Bronte Law is three shots off the lead after a three-under-par 69.
Morgan was one of 15 players still on the course when play was suspended, and the 42-year-old from Abergavenny will complete her second round on Friday.
American Stacy Lewis, Canada's Alena Sharp and Lee Mi-hyang of South Korea were all in the clubhouse on eight under par, with Morgan on course to match them thanks to four birdies in her 16 holes played.
Kim made nine birdies in a stunning eight-under-par 64, with Jutanugarn posting a 66 to join her on nine under.
"I had a great putting day," said Kim, 28. "Yesterday I hit the ball pretty well but just didn't make as many putts.
"Today, the putts were dropping. I had some good shots but I kind of scrambled very well."
