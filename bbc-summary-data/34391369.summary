Fiji have made six changes to their team to face Wales in Pool A of the World Cup on Thursday.

Bath scrum-half Niko Matawalu will miss Fiji's World Cup match with Wales on Thursday because of injury.
Fiji were already without giant wing Nemani Nadolo, after he was suspended for one week for a dangerous tackle.
Nadolo has scored 16 of Fiji's 24 points in the competition so far as they have lost 35-11 to England and 28-13 against Australia.
Newly called-up wing Timoci Nagusa, the top scorer in the 2015-2016 Top 14 competition in France with four tries in four matches, comes straight in at right-wing in place of the injured Waisea Nayacalevu.
Captain Akapusi Qera will be the third player to win 50 caps for Fiji, following Nicky Little (71) and Seremaia Bai (50).
"We have a number of bruised bodies so we were always going to make some changes for this game," coach John McKee told BBC Wales Sport.
"The team we picked are all 100 per cent fit, we've got good depth in our squad and it's a very strong team which we believe will be specially suited to play against Wales.
"Nikola [Matawalu] isn't 100% and at this level we need players who are 100 percent fit.
"Nikola is a player who can have a strong influence on a game but we've got other good half-backs."
McKee believes Fiji need to target third place in the group to gain automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup, even if they do not reach the last eight this time - but warns they need to turn in an 80-minute performance.
"We've come through two games with nothing to show in terms of points in the competition, at times in each game we've played quite well but we haven't been consistent across 80 minutes.
"Against these top teams - and Wales is certainly one of those - we need to be consistent across the 80 minutes."
Fiji: Talebula; Nagusa, Goneva, Botia, Tikoirotuma; Volavola, Kenatale; Ma'afu, Koto, Saulo, Cavubati, Nakarawa, Waqaniburoto, Qera, Talei.
Replacements: Veikoso, Peni Ravia, Atalifo, Soqeta, Ravulo, Seniloli, Matavesi, Murimurivalu
