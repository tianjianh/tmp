The Edinburgh veteran insists last year's 45-10 group win at the World Cup was not nearly as comfortable as the score suggests.
"We know they are coming after revenge from the World Cup, so it will be a tough one," he said.
"Their front five are all big, strong men and so, for us, it is another battle we have to win."
The Scots kick-off a two-Test tour in Toyota City, with their hosts ranked one place below them at 10th in the world.
September's win at Kingsholm came after Scotland ran in five second-half tries against tiring opponents, who had stunned South Africa in their opening match.
"They had been outstanding against South Africa and were backing up that performance four days later," recalled 32-year-old Dickinson.
"I found it very hard, especially up front. They are very strong men, well drilled and enjoy their scrummaging. I expect it to be equally hard at the weekend.
"We need to start well, which we did not do particularly well in that game. We need to tidy up a few of our fundamentals and need to come out of the box firing.
"Japan take their chances. They are very skilful players and we have seen what happens when they capitalise on errors with a lot of broken field play. Minimise errors and start better."
Scotland have never lost to Japan, who will be without World Cup captain Michael Leitch and full-back Ayumu Goromaru, their main goal kicker.
The scrum is often seen as an area of weakness for Japan, but Dickinson is warning that Scotland will need to be switched on.
"All the games I have watched Japan play over many years, their set piece has been excellent," he said.
"We saw in the World Cup the tight areas were a huge challenge for us. Japan will have progressed, as have we - it is an area they are targeting,
"The Japanese scrum is probably the lowest in the world. It is probably how they are built, big men who can get really low and we have to manage the combat.
"They are a tough scrummaging team who will be coming for us. It will he a good challenge."
