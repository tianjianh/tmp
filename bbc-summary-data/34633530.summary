Pakistan v England: Tourists question Wahab Riaz boot incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England coach Trevor Bayliss is thought to have spoken to the match referee over Pakistan's Wahab Riaz using his foot rather than his hand to field the ball on day four of the second Test.

TV footage is not thought to reveal any contact by the fast bowler's spikes which might alter the ball's condition.
However, England batsman Joe Root appeared to exchange words with Riaz.
England assistant coach Paul Farbrace said: "The umpires dealt with it at the time and that is the end of it."
The tourists face a fight to avoid defeat after closing the fourth day 130-3 in pursuit of a notional 491.
Root is unbeaten on 59 and when asked about his altercation with Riaz, Farbrace said:  "In the heat of battle you are going to see the odd exchange between players.
"Riaz certainly won't be signing for Chelsea in the Premier League with his footballing skills."
