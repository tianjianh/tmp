Broomhill House: Closure fears for mental health unit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 2,000 people have signed a petition against the closure of a mental health unit in Nottinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust is proposing to close Broomhill House in Gedling and another unit at Heather Close in Mansfield.
The trust said patient feedback showed most preferred to be cared for at home.
However, Isabel Wodrow, whose 44-year-old son is treated for a psychotic illness at Broomhill House, said he will be badly affected by the closure.
Ms Wodrow said her son would quickly "disengage" from community outreach services.
"It will be a slippery slope down to the kind of situation that we were in for 18 years of him disappearing...disengaging from services, from family, and it's not something I intend to happen," she said.
"I will fight this to the end."
Simon Smith, of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, said community teams already support hundreds of people in their own homes.
"That works really successfully and we would expect that will work for the vast majority of people that we support," he said.
A public meeting will be held to discuss the closure of the unit at All Hallows Corner, in Gedling, on 17 August.
