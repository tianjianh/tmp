Depay, a Â£25m signing from PSV in 2015, has played just 20 minutes for United in the Premier League this season.
But the 22-year-old came off the bench in Luxembourg to score with a header and free-kick to secure victory.
Arjen Robben had given the Dutch the lead only for Maxime Chanot to level with a penalty before the break.
Joshua Brenet was deemed to have clipped Daniel da Mota, which gave the defender an opportunity to score from the spot, but it was not enough for a Luxembourg side who have now gone nine matches without a win.
The introduction of Depay after the break swung the match in the visitors' favour, moving the Netherlands on to seven points, three behind leaders France, and above third-placed Sweden on goal difference.
