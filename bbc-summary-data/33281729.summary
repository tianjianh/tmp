A flood alleviation scheme to help protect a Berkshire village has been completed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Villagers in Eastbury on the River Lambourn, which flooded last year and in 2007, raised more than Â£60,000 towards the cost of the scheme.
An earth embankment and a flood storage area were built to restrict water flow, holding it back from the village.
Resident Liz Goodman said the work, carried out by the Environment Agency was "beyond our expectations".
Residents raised the cash over three years through donations and fundraising activities.
The Greenham Common Trust also donated money to the project which cost a total of Â£400,000.
Ms Goodman said: "It's been a fantastic effort. It's going to go a long way in dealing with flood situations."
