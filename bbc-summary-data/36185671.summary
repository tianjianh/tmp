Kositany broke clear in the closing stages to finish a minute and four seconds ahead of compatriot Eric Koech.
Dan Tanui completed an all-Kenyan podium as he finished third in 2:18.46.
Kilkeel athlete Laura Graham was a stunning second behind Ethiopian Berhan Gebremichael in the women's race eight days after running the London Marathon.
Last year's winner Gebremichael took victory in 2:48.26, with Graham 29 seconds behind the Ethiopian and Czech athlete Radka Churanova third in 2:51.37.
Mother-of-four Graham, who only started running in 2014, clocked 2:48.03 in London last weekend which cut over eight minutes off her previous personal best.
Graham, 30, competes for the Newcastle-based Mourne Runners club.
Kositany's winning time in the men's race was almost two minutes faster than his previous Belfast best but he was just under four minutes outside the course record.
Ethiopian Negewo Ararisa ran the fastest ever Belfast time when he took victory in 2012 in 2:13.41.
Kositany, whose victory on Monday was the 14th straight African men's win in Belfast, clocked 2:19.28 when he won in 2013 and his winning time 12 months ago was 2:19.36.
The Kenyan, who set his personal best of 2:09.50 in Israel four years ago, also finished second in 2014 behind compatriot Freddy Sittuk.
