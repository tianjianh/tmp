At least four cats have been killed in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, since February. Some were shot, kicked and two had body parts cut off.
Peta has warned that an animal abuser is a serious threat to the community and their behaviour could escalate.
Police investigating the attacks have described them as "twisted and evil".
Five cats have been attacked in the town between 12 February and 11 March.
In what officers believe may be an initiation test for a local gang, animals have either been shot with an air gun or attacked "with a sharp weapon".
Kirsty Henderson, from Peta, said: "We need to do everything we can to bring these people to justice."
Ms Henderson, said the acts were not only "very violent" but criminal.
"Animal abuse is not just a result of a minor personality flaw but is a symptom of deep mental disturbance and the person who did this could require some serious psychological help," she said.
"Research shows us that people who commit acts of cruelty towards animals often don't stop there and a great many do move on to violence against humans."
