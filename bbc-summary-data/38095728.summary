[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol University student deaths investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The deaths of three students in a single term at the University of Bristol are being investigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All three of the students, believed to be first years, are reported to have died in "unrelated" incidents.
Police are not treating the deaths of Miranda Williams, Daniel Green, or Kim Long as suspicious.
The university, which has about 22,000 students, offered condolences to their families. Inquests are due to be held at a later date.
Deputy registrar Lynn Robinson said: "These events are always extremely upsetting and our thoughts are with the students' families and friends."
Ms Robinson added: "Our student welfare services are offering support to anyone affected.
"It goes without saying that we take student health and wellbeing very seriously and would urge any students who are feeling anxious, depressed or lonely to seek support."
She said the student counselling service was well-placed to help and mental health first aid training had been provided to "many staff".
