[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bank of England wants an artist for £20 note

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The image of a visual artist will appear on the next version of the £20 note - and the Bank of England wants the public to make nominations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The banknote, which will enter circulation in the next three to five years, currently features the economist Adam Smith.
The Bank is asking the public for suggestions of artists ranging from painters to furniture makers.
But the Bank will want to avoid a repeat of previous equality complaints.
It faced criticism after the planned replacement of campaigner Elizabeth Fry on the £5 note with Winston Churchill, which left it facing the prospect of no women being used on banknote images.
This was solved when author Jane Austen was announced as the image on the next £10 note.
The public will be asked to nominate an artist to be considered for the banknote.
They can include painters, fashion designers, sculptors, ceramicists, furniture makers, photographers and film-makers.
This will then be considered by a committee which, taking into account worthiness, equality and diversity, will whittle down the list to between three and five.
The final decision will then be made by the governor of the Bank, Mark Carney.
