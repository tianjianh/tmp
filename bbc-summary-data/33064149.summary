[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old George Weah junior has been named in Liberia's squad for Sunday's match in Togo.
He was born in Liberia but grew up in the USA, where he played some friendly games for the national under-20 team.
Weah junior was also on the books of two of his father's old clubs.
He was in the junior teams at AC Milan, where his father made his name, from the age of 14 but was let go before he turned 20.
Since then his career has been restricted to the lower leagues in Switzerland and briefly in Greece.
He last played professional football at another of his father's old clubs with two substitute appearances for Paris St Germain's amateur team last year.
Liberia's new coach, James Debbah, was also a PSG player and is a relative of Weah's.
Weah junior's father, now 48, was World Footballer of the Year in 1995 and led Liberia to the Nations Cup finals in 1996 and 2002.
Another of his son's, Timothy, is in the U.S. under-15 team and also in PSG's youth programme.
