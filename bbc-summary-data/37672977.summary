Notts County: Ray Trew makes approach to Alan Hardy over potential takeover

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County chairman Ray Trew has approached local businessman Alan Hardy over a potential takeover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trew put the League Two club up for sale in February after his family were subjected to "foul and mindless abuse".
Hardy, chief executive of the Paragon group and owner of the Nottinghamshire Golf and Country Club, has previously made two offers to buy the Magpies.
Trew, who also met potential buyers from the United States and China in March, has not yet concluded a deal.
He bought Notts County from Peter Trembling in 2010, taking on debts of more than Â£1.5m, which were built up during five months under the ownership of Middle Eastern consortium Munto Finance.
The club are 12th in League Two, one point outside the play-off places.
BBC Radio Nottingham's Notts County correspondent Colin Slater:
"The approach to Alan Hardy in the last few days was made by one of Ray Trew's advisors and came out of the blue.
"After Trew put Notts up for sale in February, Hardy unsuccessfully made two written cash offers to become the Magpies' owner and it was assumed, wrongly as it turns out, that any possible deal between them was not going to happen.
"Hardy has yet to respond to Trew's latest overtures but I understand he will first be seeking opportunities to establish Notts' latest financial position.
"Hardy was at Meadow Lane on Saturday to see Notts draw with Crewe while Trew was away on other business."
