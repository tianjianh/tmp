An impressive 8% gain for Japanese stocks earlier in the day on the back of hopes of corporate tax cuts helped to set the tone.
The Dow Jones was 126.94 or 0.77% higher at 16,619.62.
The S&P 500 was up 13.32 at 1,982.73 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 27.4 at 4,839.73 points.
Yahoo shares were 0.5% down against the trend after the US tax authority said it would not pre-approve the company's scheme to minimise its tax bill related to the planned sale of its stake in Alibaba.
Alibaba shares were up 4% on hopes the Chinese would give more to boost the weakening economy.
Goldman Sachs were one of the chief leaders, rising 3% on a broker upgrade.
