Paul Heckingbottom and Tommy Wright are currently sharing managerial duties after Johnson joined Bristol City.
Heckingbottom has been with the Tykes since 2015, while Wright was Johnson's assistant at Oldham and Barnsley.
"There's two people at the club who are very competent and we're not in any rush to appoint a new manager," Mansford told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"In Paul, we have someone who is Barnsley through and through. His focus is to do what's best for Barnsley as a club.
"He's supported by Tommy, who is committed, and we're very confident they will continue to succeed."
Barnsley have won seven consecutive league matches to move them up to 10th place in League One.
Recently sacked Rotherham manager Neil Redfearn, who made 292 appearances for Barnsley as a player, has been linked with a return to Oakwell.
"If Paul and Tommy can continue this run they give themselves every opportunity to knock on our doors and see if they can secure it permanently," Mansford added.
"The players showed on Sunday they won't let Lee's departure adversely affect them. We've stayed strong as a team and that's the most exciting thing."
