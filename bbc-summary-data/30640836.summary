Magna Carta event prompts new park and ride plan

A new park and ride service for Lincoln could operate for up to three years, Lincolnshire County Council has said.

The authority has submitted plans for a 300-space car park at Whisby Garden Centre off the A46 bypass.
It is intended to be open by April, in time for celebrations marking the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.
Officials said it would be reviewed after one year and it would give "some indication" about the viability of a possible permanent facility.
The idea for a park and ride has been discussed for years but recent plans have been undermined by government cuts.
A new Â£22m centre at Lincoln castle, the centrepiece of events around the Magna Carta, has prompted the latest scheme.
Nick Worth, the council's portfolio holder for culture and heritage, said they were anticipating 100,000 visitors to the event.
"This is the simplest and easiest way to get that sort of number of people into the city to look around," he said.
"We have applied for permission for three years as we have a world class facility and not everyone will be able to see it this summer.
"And one of the big issues over a park and ride is where is the best place to put it and how many people will use it, so this will give us some indication of that."
The Highways Agency has already objected to the plan based on a lack of information.
