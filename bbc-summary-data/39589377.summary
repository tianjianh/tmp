Leeds Rhinos legend Kevin Sinfield says he sees himself returning to the club in some capacity in the future.

Sinfield, 36, is the all-time record points scorer for the Rhinos and left after helping them to a domestic treble in the 2015 season.
In August he was appointed rugby director by the Rugby Football League.
"At some stage, I'd like to think I'd go back. I've been associated with the club since I was 13 years old," he told BBC Sport.
"The club means a great deal to me and I've probably got to sit on the fence a bit more with the job I have at the RFL, but it's still my club and to try and dispute that or play it down is not something I'd want to do.
"I'd love to be back there at some stage, I'm not sure when that would be. I don't have any concrete plans going forward, we'll see what opportunities arise over the coming years."
The former Rhinos and England captain rejected the chance to join Brian McDermott's coaching staff at Headingley last season after he retired from playing with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie and said in September he did not see himself going into coaching.
