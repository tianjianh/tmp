Longannet power station taskforce to meet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The taskforce set up to deal with the closure of Longannet power station next March is to meet later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The meeting will be chaired by Energy Minister Fergus Ewing and Fife Council leader David Ross.
The taskforce will provide support for workers, businesses and communities which rely on the plant.
Longannet, which opened in 1972, is one of Europe's biggest coal-fired power stations and directly employs just over 230 people.
The Scottish government and Fife Council will play a key role in the support group as it meets this week.
Its membership also includes representatives of neighbouring local authorities, the coal industry, trade unions and Scottish Power.
Scottish Power has said the high cost of connecting to the grid was to blame for its closure plans.
The company has also announced it is abandoning plans to build a new gas-fired power station at Cockenzie in East Lothian.
