The pilot was not affected by Saturday's incident which was filmed by the helicopter's on-board camera.
The crew were returning to their base in Dafen, Llanelli, after a call-out in Cardiff when the incident happened.
"This could have been catastrophic," said chief executive Angela Hughes.
"It is beyond belief how anyone thinks it is clever to do this."
The camera footage has been given to South Wales Police.
