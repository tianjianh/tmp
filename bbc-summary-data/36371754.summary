Middleweight Savannah Marshall became the 10th British boxer to book a place in Brazil by outpointing Chinese third seed Li Qian in her quarter-final bout.

The Bray boxer beat Agnes Alexiusson of Sweden and Argentina's Dayana Sanchez in Astana before prevailing against Torres over four rounds.
Taylor was surprisingly beaten in the Olympic qualifier in Turkey last month.
Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna handed Taylor her first defeat in five years at the European Olympic qualifiers to leave the five-time world champion still seeking Rio qualification.
