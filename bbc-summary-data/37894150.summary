Chinnor Santa specials face eviction threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Annual Santa-themed train services could be in jeopardy after a volunteer railway was served an eviction notice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway (C&PRR) said it has been given 10 working days to move seven carriages and wagons from a section of track on land owned by cement firm Cemex.
Prof Karol Sikora, a volunteer on the railway, said the track was "vital" to running the Christmas trains.
Cemex said it wants the carriages moved so it can use the land in the future.
A spokeswoman said various uses were being considered for the land and she hoped a resolution could be achieved.
Chairman of C&PRR, Danny Woodward, said the volunteer-run railway had been using the track for more than 25 years.
He added the timescale given by Cemex solicitors "has the potential to jeopardise the running of some, or possibly all, of our Santa Special trains".
Prof Sikora, a cancer specialist, said: "People come from far and wide and it gives me such pleasure to see the children laughing and enjoying themselves."
Cemex said the seven wagons were on "a relatively small piece of land" and it wished to see them removed.
Santa's Steam Specials are train journeys that run during December for children aged up to 15.
