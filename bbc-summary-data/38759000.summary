She attended regular check-ups at the Burrell & Stokes dental practice in Grimsby over a six-year period, but the condition was not detected.
Insurers for the dentists involved agreed to pay damages after a case of poor care and neglect was brought.
The BBC has approached the practice for a comment.

Hudgell Solicitors, who brought the action, said the woman was seen at the practice by dentists Timothy Stokes, Ian Burrell and Ivan Delgado between February 2009 and June 2015.
Solicitor Michelle Tebbutt said the woman had been "devastated" when the condition was finally identified.
She said: "Independent experts indicated that this lady was in such a bad situation that she was likely to lose almost all her teeth over the next five years as the gums and bones were so weak and badly diseased."
A second patient was awarded a share of the damages after a case of negligent treatment was brought against dentist Carlos Noguera Mutillo.
The dentist had allegedly drilled through two healthy teeth to fit a replacement bridge.
The woman, who has not been identified, said the work had left her "in constant pain" and unable to eat on one side of her mouth.
Ms Tebbutt said there had been "numerous areas of concern" in the treatment received by both patients.
She said: "We are glad that both cases have resulted in damages settlements being offered."
A member of staff at the practice said Mr Delgado and Mr Mutillo no longer work at the surgery but would not comment further.
