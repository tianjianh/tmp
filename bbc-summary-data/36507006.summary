[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George North has been ruled out of Wales' tour to New Zealand after suffering a hamstring injury in the 39-21 loss to the All Blacks on Saturday.

The British and Irish Lions wing, 24, suffered the injury tackling Waisake Naholo late on at Eden Park, where Wales led with 18 minutes remaining.
Wales have already called up 18-year-old Ospreys wing Keelen Giles as cover.
North joins Dan Lydiate, Paul James, Lloyd Williams, Leigh Halfpenny and Alex Cuthbert on Wales' injury list.
The Northampton wing received treatment on the pitch before being allowed to carry on, then broke down again as he attempted to stop Nathan Harris scoring the world champions' fifth try of the game.
Wales coach Warren Gatland described North's performance in Auckland on Saturday as "absolutely outstanding".
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen joked after Saturday's game: "We might not have to worry about trying to tackle him next week."
North, who has scored 27 international tries in 62 Wales appearances - he also has three caps for the Lions - has been released from the Wales squad and is expected to return to the UK for further treatment.
Utility back Gareth Anscombe suffered a knock to a hip in Saturday's bruising defeat but Gatland believes he may "take a day or two" to recover.
The Wales coach has added tight-head Aaron Jarvis, flanker Ellis Jenkins, scrum-half Aled Davies, fly-half Rhys Patchell and Wales Under-20 wing Giles to his original touring squad as injury cover.
Prop James and scrum-half Williams are returning to the UK because of injury, while flanker Lydiate was forced out of the tour after injuring his shoulder against England at the end of May.
Wales have now lost 27 consecutive games against the All Blacks, with their last win coming in 1953.
The Welsh, who play Super Rugby's Chiefs on Tuesday, face the All Blacks in Wellington on Saturday and again in Dunedin on 25 June as they seek a first ever win in New Zealand.
