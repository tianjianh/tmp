[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nelson Cheung killing: Randalstown man admits murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim man has become the second person to admit the murder of a Chinese restaurant owner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wing Fu Cheung - also known as Nelson Cheung - was stabbed to death after his car was forced off the road outside Randalstown in January 2015.
His wife Kam-Fung Cheung was also injured and robbed in the incident.
Appearing at Belfast Crown Court on Monday was 35-year-old Virgilio Augusto Fernando Correia.
Correia's barrister asked the clerk of the court to re-arraign his client on three charges arising from last January's incident.
They were: The murder of Mr Cheung; wounding his wife with intent to do her grievous bodily harm and robbing Mrs Cheung of a handbag containing an iPad, an iPhone and a purse containing Â£200 in cash plus two bank cards.
All three offences span a period between 6 and 9 January, 2015.
When each of the charges were put to Correia, he replied "guilty".
Correia, who at the time of his arrest was living at Grant Avenue in Randalstown, is the second man to admit murdering Mr Cheung.
Christopher David Menaul, 25, from Barra Street in Antrim, also pleaded guilty to the same three charges after appearing in court last month.
Two co-accused will be standing trial in the new year on other charges arising from the murder.
Following the plea, a judge ordered pre-sentence reports be compiled on Correia, who was remanded back into custody.
He will be sentenced at a later date.
