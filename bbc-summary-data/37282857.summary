[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 0-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull Moors goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan produced an inspired display to deny National League leaders Lincoln a sixth-straight win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vaughan's saves earned Moors a goalless draw at Sincil Bank, ending a run of four straight losses, despite playing with 10 men for 40 minutes.
The early action was end-to-end without producing early clear-cut chances. Midway through the first half Adam Marriott's goal-bound drive called Vaughan into action, with Lincoln's Nathan Arnold unable to get on to the parry.
Five minutes after half-time, Jean-Yves Koue Niate was sent off for an off-the-ball incident that left Matt Rhead grounded.
The Imps then dominated with Rhead having a goalward shot blocked and Vaughan denying Arnold from point-blank range. Late on Vaughan saved brilliantly from Lincoln debutant Tom Champion.
