[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City 2-0 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City moved up to second in the Championship with a routine win over Cardiff City at the KC Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abel Hernandez put the home side in the lead from the penalty spot after Harry Maguire was fouled by Lee Peltier.
Sam Clucas did well to convert Mohamed Diame's cross on the volley for Hull's second in the second half.
Both Hernandez and Clucas had further chances, but the win takes Hull past Derby into second, five points behind Middlesbrough.
The defeat will put more pressure on Cardiff manager Russell Slade, who was reportedly close to the sack after the weekend's FA Cup exit by League One strugglers Shrewsbury.
The result rarely looked in doubt, especially after Anthony Pilkington clipped over Cardiff's best chance midway through the first half.
Five minutes before half-time, Peltier wrestled man of the match Maguire to the ground from a corner, and Hernandez blasted the penalty beyond David Marshall's reach.
But manager Steve Bruce was not impressed with his player's reaction.
He said: "I think 10 people had come over from Uruguay. Abel jumped into the crowd, and picked a yellow card, which was a bit silly, to say the least."
Clucas added Hull's second, doing well to control a low volley from Diame's cross.
Marshall was kept busy, twice denying Clucas a chance to get his second, as Hull secured their 10th home win of the season.

"It was comfortable. On another night, it could have been three or four.
"We've been fantastic at home, with one defeat in the last 18. We've got another home game at the weekend - can we put more pressure at the top of the table?
"We're not that clinical, though, which is disappointing. It's our Achilles heel. We can't keep creating five, six or seven opportunities and only take one or two."
Cardiff manager Russell Slade:
"We know what we've got to do. It's time to roll our sleeves up and get it done. Of course I am [confident of getting into the play-offs]. I believe in what I'm doing.
"I've done 750 games with a win ratio of around 39% so it doesn't mean I'm a mug. It means I'm capable and I still feel I'm capable of getting this team in the top six."
On reports he may get the sack: "I don't know where all that kind of information comes from or what sources that is. As far as I'm concerned, the dialogue with the chairman and chief executive is very good and we're all wanting the same thing."
