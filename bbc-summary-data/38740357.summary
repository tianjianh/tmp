Newcastle are expected to bring back first-team regulars after making nine changes for the FA Cup loss at Oxford.

But the Championship's top scorer, Dwight Gayle, is expected to miss out because of a hamstring problem.
QPR will include new signings Sean Goss and Luke Freeman, who joined from Manchester United and Bristol City.
Another new arrival, Matt Smith, is ineligible, while defenders Steven Caulker (hip) and Jack Robinson (hamstring) are sidelined.
