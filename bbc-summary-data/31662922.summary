[SN]TITLE[SN]
.wales and .cymru domain names available for all

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The internet domain names .cymru and .wales will be made available to the public from St David's Day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From Sunday, people will be able to buy a web or email address ending in either name.
Those adopting them include Wales rugby player Sam Warburton, broadcaster S4C and the Welsh government.
The domain names have been on limited availability since September but will now be available on a first come, first served basis.
First Minster Carwyn Jones has said they would "enhance the global presence of brand Wales".
