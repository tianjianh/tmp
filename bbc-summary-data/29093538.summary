Nicholas Salvador, of Gilda Avenue, Enfield, is accused of killing Palmira Silva, 82, who was found in a garden in Edmonton, north London, on Thursday.
The 25-year-old is also charged with assaulting a police officer.
A post-mortem examination on Saturday found Ms Silva died from stab wounds to the heart and aorta. She was found decapitated, it is understood.
Mr Salvador was remanded in custody during a hearing at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.
The defendant was taken to the dock in the magistrates' court by four police officers, the BBC's Sophie Long said.
She said one officer had to confirm Mr Salvador's name to the court as he would not answer.
Police found Ms Silva's body behind a property, in Nightingale Road, after being called to the area following reports an animal had been attacked.
Officers evacuated nearby homes before the suspect was Tasered.
Neighbours described Ms Silva as a "lovely lady" and said she was an Italian widow who ran a cafe in Church Street, near Edmonton Green station.
