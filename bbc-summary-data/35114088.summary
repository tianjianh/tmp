A budget deal has been reached between US Congress leaders and the White House, US House Speaker Paul Ryan has said.

The $1.1 trillion (Â£730billion) spending bill includes both Republican-backed initiatives and Democratic priorities.
It funds the government through the 2016 budget year, raising defence spending and extending tax credits.
If the spending bill passes, it will prevent a government shutdown.
"In negotiations like this you win some, you lose some," said Mr Ryan. "Democrats won some, they lost some. We won some, we lost some."
Both the spending bill and a tax bill, also included in the budget package, are expected to be voted on by the end of the week.
Members of the so-called Freedom Caucus told Reuters they are likely to not support the bill because, among other things, it does not deny funding to family planning clinic Planned Parenthood or tighten US screening of Syrian refugees.
The spending bill does include changes to the "visa waiver" programme that allows for travel without a visa to the US for 38 countries.
That includes France and Belgium, where some of the perpetrators of the deadly Paris attacks were from.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said she is concerned about the tax bill because of "special interest tax breaks".
"Republicans' tax extender bill provides hundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks that are permanent and unpaid for," she said.
The spending bill includes a lifting of a 40-year-old crude oil export ban, which President Barack Obama had earlier threatened to veto.
"I'm confident that there will be things that will be included in the omnibus bill that we don't support," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
The bill also delays or completely suspends taxes that are meant to pay for Mr Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Mr Ryan said the process around nailing down the spending bill was a "crap sandwich".
