An Australian TV presenter has said he wore the same blue suit on-screen for 12 months and nobody noticed.

Karl Stefanovic wore the outfit to make a point about the sexism he said his female colleagues faced.
"No-one has noticed," he said. "But women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them."
Stefanovic is a presenter on Today, the breakfast show on Channel Nine.
The 40-year-old, who has been a presenter and reporter for nearly two decades, has also participated in a variety of celebrity gameshows in Australia, including their versions of Dancing on Ice and Hole in the Wall.
He told The Age newspaper that his co-host, Lisa Wilkinson gets regular messages from viewers and comments in the press about her fashion choices.
"Women are judged much more harshly and keenly for what they do, what they say and what they wear," said Stefanovic.
"I've worn the same suit on air for a year - except for a couple of times because of circumstance - to make a point.
"I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour - on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is."
He started his experiment by wearing the suit two days in a row, without a comment. He then carried on for days and then months when he realised no-one was noticing.
"Only Lisa and [Today team member Sylvia Jeffreys] know about the suit. They often remark that it's getting a bit stinky," said Stefanovic.
"I'm hoping to get it into the dry cleaners at the end of the year."
