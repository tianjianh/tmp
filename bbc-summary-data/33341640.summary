The pair, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, were pulled from the water at Birnbeck Pier near Weston-super-Mare on Tuesday afternoon.
The RNLI said the "very rapidly" flowing water could have put them in "serious danger".
Helmsman Terry Wells advised the public not to swim in the channel.
He said: "The crew warned the couple not to move in case they lost their footing when they would be carried away by the tide.
"Although it is very hot we do not advise swimming in the Bristol Channel unless you keep well in to the beach or you know the waters very well."
