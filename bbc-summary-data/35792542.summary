[SN]TITLE[SN]
FC Halifax Town 0-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-threatened Halifax and play-off chasing Eastleigh played out a goalless draw in their National League game at The Shay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eastleigh goalkeeper Ross Flitney was in fine form, denying Jordan Burrow and then Shaquille McDonald.
Flitney also tipped James Bolton's header wide of the post, before preventing Richard Peniket from breaking the deadlock.
And Eastleigh's Matt Tubbs could only strike wide late in the game.
The result leaves Halifax in the National League relegation zone on goal difference only and Eastleigh sit one place outside the play-offs in sixth, also on goal difference, with two games remaining.
