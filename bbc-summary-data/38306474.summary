The Football Association has signed a new England kit deal with Nike worth more than £400m which will run from August 2018 until 2030.

The deal will encompass 24 England teams across the men's and women's game and could rise if performance-related targets are achieved.
FA chief Martin Glenn said the deal would allow the non-profit organisation "to invest even more in the game".
The government has threatened to cut FA funding if it does not reform.
And on Monday it said it could bring in legislation to force change.
A group of former FA executives have written a letter to parliament, urging reform for a body they claim is outdated and held back "by elderly white men".
The FA says it is working on governance reforms to adhere to Sport England and UK Sport's Governance Code for Sport, which was released in October.
The FA has also started a review into claims of sex abuse in football.
Nike have supplied England for the last three years but the new deal is worth less than the £42.5m a year that world champions Germany receive.
"With the FA striving to be a world-class organisation, it's vital for us to partner with innovative global leaders such as Nike and look to the future together," said FA group commercial and marketing director Mark Bullingham.
The deal struck has reportedly not grown substantially partly because of England's disappointing Euro 2016 campaign where they lost to Iceland at the last-16 stage.
It was the second tournament at which the country had worn Nike, following on from England's exit at the group stage of the 2014 World Cup.
In its 2015 financial accounts, the FA made £56m of its its £318m revenue from sponsorship and licensing. But the organisation made a £9m annual loss overall.
In the same year, its accounts state £117m was invested back into the game.
