The 62-year-old, who was dismissed by Forfar Athletic in December, will once more be joined by twin Ian as assistant at Gayfield Park.
Arbroath said in a statement: "Dick is a vastly experienced and successful Scottish football manager."
Campbell was appointed ahead of Tuesday's League Two trip to face Berwick Rangers.
John Young completes the backroom team as assistant coach, Steven Hislop having left as assistant manager with Lumsden.
Lumsden was dismissed after Saturday's defeat by Stirling Albion left Arbroath third bottom of the table and without a win in six games.
Campbell, who had previously managed Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline Athletic, Brechin City, Partick Thistle and Ross County, spent seven years with Forfar.
However, he was dismissed with his side third bottom of League One.
