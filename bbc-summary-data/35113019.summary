[SN]TITLE[SN]
Moulton College student dies from Weil's disease

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student, who helped out at an animal charity, died of Weil's disease, Public Health England has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court order has been granted which restricts public access to Northamptonshire Animals in Need of Nurturing and Adoption (Nanna) at Irthlingborough.
The infection is caught from contact with urine from infected animals.
A Public Health England investigation has been launched into how the Moulton College student contracted the disease.
No details have been released about the identity of the student who contracted the disease or when the fatality occurred.
Weil's disease is a bacterial infection also known as Leptospirosis.
Dr Samia Latif, consultant in public health at the agency, said the infected animals are "mainly rodents, cattle and pigs", whose urine is carried in water or soil.
She added the bacteria can enter the body through "abrasions or cuts in the skin and through the lining of the nose, mouth and eyes".
East Northamptonshire Council and Northamptonshire County Council were assisting Public Health England with its investigation.
Early symptoms of Leptospirosis are described as flu-like, with vomiting, high temperature, headache and muscle pains.
The infection can be treated with antibiotics and "most people make a full recovery", according to Dr Latif.
Anna Naylor, a solicitor acting on behalf or Nanna, said: "His death has come as a shock to all of his friends here at Nanna and we have been offering our assistance.
"It is understood this investigation is looking at a number of potential theories as to how he may have become ill.
"Our thoughts are with his family at this sad time."
