A multi-million pound conservation project has been launched to restore Newport's 17th century Tredegar House.

Rainwater has leaked into a number of attic rooms, with repairs now needed to replace 35 tonnes of Welsh slate covering the house's north west wing.
This year alone, National Trust staff have removed more than 52 gallons of water.
The attraction, one of the UK's foremost Restoration houses, is also home to a priceless art collection.
Contractors arrive on site on 19 September, with scaffolding going up shortly after - but the attraction will remain open throughout the work.
The project will make the roof watertight and rooms worst hit by the leaks will be redecorated. Other plans include the development of the house's laundry building.
Property manager Linda Wigley said: "So much work has already been done behind the scenes to get us to this point and we are delighted to be able to finally share our plans with the public.
"We have drawn on more than 120 years of conservation expertise in the National Trust to transform Tredegar House and its surrounding parkland into the exceptional visitor attraction we know it has the potential to be."
Newport council leader Councillor Debbie Wilcox called the house one the city's "great treasures".
She added: "This work is crucial to protect the many features of this beautiful building."
Tredegar House was previously managed by Newport council, and has been run by the National Trust since 2012.
