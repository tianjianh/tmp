The figures are an increase of 13,577 (4.6%) on 2014 visitors.
Since the yacht was decommissioned in 1997 it has been berthed in Edinburgh. Almost five million people have visited it since it opened to the public.
Celebrations are being planned for Britannia to mark the Queen's 90th birthday later this year.
Although it is now based in Leith, Edinburgh, Britannia travelled 1,087,623 nautical miles - calling at more than 600 ports in 135 countries - in its 44 year career.
Britannia's chief executive, Bob Downie, said: "The true test of any great organisation is the consistency of their performance, as seen through the eyes of their customers."
