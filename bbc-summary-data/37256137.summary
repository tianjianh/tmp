Kyle Williams, 24, attacked the woman as she walked to work at about 04:45 GMT on 21 December 2015 in Manchester Road, Bury.
He threatened her with a knife before dragging her across the ground, saying he would stab her as she pleaded to be left alone.
He fled when he was startled by the sirens of a passing emergency vehicle.
Williams of Pembroke Drive, Bury, admitted kidnap and robbery at Bolton Crown Court on Thursday.
