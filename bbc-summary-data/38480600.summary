[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton striker Elvis Manu has joined top-tier Dutch side Go Ahead Eagles on loan until the end of the season.

The former Netherlands Under-21 international joined the Championship club from Feyenoord on a three-year contract in August 2015.
He has not started a league game for Brighton and spent two months of the 2015-16 season on loan at Huddersfield.
"The form of our other strikers has made it hard for Elvis to get game-time," said manager Chris Hughton.
