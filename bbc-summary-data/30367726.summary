[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The southbound carriageway between junctions 4 and 3 near Coventry will be shut from 22:00 and 06:00 GMT.
There will also be a 50mph speed limit on a half-a-mile section of the northbound carriageway around the Meridien Road bridge
Diversions will be in place while the resurfacing work is done and drivers are urged to allow extra journey time.
Purnima Kaul, from the Highways Agency said:  "We need to resurface a number of sections of the carriageway.
"As all lanes and the hard shoulder will be affected the only way to do this safely is under a full closure.
"Road users should therefore allow extra time for their journey and familiarise themselves with the diversion before setting off."
