Ryan Christie shot the visitors into a 19th-minute lead, with Tam Scobbie then diverting a Jonny Hayes cross into his own net before the interval.
Danny Swanson replied from the penalty spot after a trip on Steven MacLean.
Saints pressed hard for an equaliser but the team in fourth can no longer overhaul second-placed Aberdeen, who stay nine points ahead of Rangers.
With both previous league meetings between these sides this season ending goalless, fans could have been forgiven for taking their seats in hope more than any real expectation.
But there was nothing cagey about the impressive start from the visitors.
Aberdeen were keen to exorcise the ghost of last weekend's 3-0 home defeat to Rangers and, from the first whistle, their spirit was unquestionable.
On-loan Christie started in place of Niall McGinn, who is nursing a groin problem that leaves him a doubt for the Scottish Cup semi-final with Hibs next Saturday, and it took the midfielder just 15 minutes to make his mark.
Christie jinked delicately past two defenders and after powering into the box he lashed a shot past Alan Mannus. It was just reward for early Aberdeen dominance.
Hayes was providing the width for Aberdeen as usual, and the Irishman was the creator of his side's second. He whipped in a tantalising cross from the left and when Scobbie tried to clear it, he turned it into his own net from two yards.
Other sides may have crumbled but Tommy Wright's teams have never lacked belief and they came out after the break like men possessed.
Shortly before the break, Blair Alston made way for Danny Swanson, who was back in the squad following his two-week suspension for his now infamous altercation with team-mate Richard Foster, who started.
It was a substitution that changed the dynamic of the game completely and before long the home side had pulled one back. Anthony O'Connor pulled down MacLean and Swanson converted from the spot.
As the net bulged, nerves set in for Aberdeen, who now knew they were in a fight.
It was played like a cup tie after that with the home side sensing things were swinging their way. They found a vigour that was missing in the first 45 minutes and rocked Aberdeen back on their heels.
Derek McInnes's side remained focused though and showed good game management to hold out in the face of intense pressure.
In the race for second it could be a big three points the Dons and rarely have they battled harder for victory.
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "We didn't start at all and I thought we gave Aberdeen far too much respect. They were poor goals to lose from our point of view.
"Realistically we can't compete with a club like Aberdeen in terms of budget, but we gave them too much respect and that's what's disappointing.
"We go into the split with our tails up though. We have a four point lead over Hearts and all our focus is now on finishing in fourth spot."
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "The players deserve so much credit. We deservedly went ahead and dominated the first 30 minutes.
"We are just annoyed how we started the second half and then when they get the penalty a lot of people will have been asking how will they react but I thought we stood up to it well. We never controlled the second half but I thought we deserved all three points.
"It's another game chalked off with five to go. We just wanted to concentrate on ourselves and make sure we got back to winning ways.
"For too long Aberdeen haven't been playing any meaningful games near the end of the season but having the challenge in the cup and teams challenging us in the league has been good for us."
