[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Mirren 1-2 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Baird's brace was enough to get Falkirk back to winning ways against bottom side St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stocky striker latched on to Miles Hippolyte's long throw to slot home the first into the far corner.
His second came after the break when he was on hand to drive in Lee Miller's low cross from the right.
Rory Loy's left-footed strike from just inside the box gave the Buddies hope of a point, but that was the most the Paisley side could muster.
There had been an air of expectancy around the home crowd before the game, as Saints fans anticipated a new dawn after an encouraging Scottish Cup win at Dundee and a raft of new signings.
One of them - on loan Aberdeen forward Cammy Smith - looked bright early on, but that early enthusiasm was punctured when Baird struck his first.
St Mirren were unhappy that Hippolyte took his throw-in about 10 yards further up the pitch from where the ball went out, yet the home defence was still guilty of not being on their toes.
Baird took the ball towards goal from the left-hand side of the box and stroked it low beyond Billy O'Brien from a fairly tight angle.
Fourth-top Falkirk watched Craig Sibbald's 20-yard effort cannon back off the crossbar before half-time but did get their second after 63 minutes.
Baird's predatory instincts paid off when Fraser Aird and Miller linked to provide the forward with a low centre that he despatched with ease.
Loy's first goal for St Mirren was out of nothing, receiving the ball with back to goal from Lewis Morgan's pass and skipping by a couple of challenges before sending it low into the far corner beyond Danny Rogers.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "It was a good win for us and I thought it should have been more comfortable than it was.
"John Baird's probably not scored enough league goals this season, but he works hard and we're delighted for him."
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "There was a decision made in the lead-up to the first goal that we concede that's wrong.
"However, we don't defend it properly after that, so I wouldn't use it as an excuse for conceding the goal or losing the match.
"But I would like sometimes for officials to take responsibility and say they made a mistake.
"Our players made a mistake and it led to the goal, but the assistant referee made a mistake."
