Midfielder Danny Williams will hope to recover from rolling his ankle against Leeds United on Saturday.
Blackburn remain without striker Danny Graham following groin surgery last month while defender Gordon Greer (calf) is still doubtful.
Full-back Adam Henley (hamstring) is yet to regain match fitness.
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"It will be a difficult game against Blackburn as they need the points as well.
"It's going to be a hard job to beat them, but hopefully they will play a bit more open than Leeds United did on Saturday.
"Hopefully we can use the space in behind as well."
Blackburn Rovers boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"The players have deserved a lot more than we've managed to get in the last four or five games. But that's football.
"Reading are a different type of team to most teams in this league. They are very ball-retention-orientated.
"You have to be super organised against Reading, otherwise they can rip you to shreds."
BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor:
Three days after beating Leeds, Reading have another game at the Madejski Stadium. This time they face Blackburn - who are currently in the relegation zone.
Reading know a win will propel them up to third spot, at least for 24 hours, until Huddersfield play Norwich.
Reading's success this season has been built on their home form. With only the three teams currently in the relegation zone still to play at the Madejski Stadium, they have already won 44 points at home.
Jaap Stam does have a growing injury list to contend with. Two of his central defensive options - Paul McShane and Joey van den Berg, are both out with hamstring injuries.
Danny Williams limped off, supported by two team-mates after the Leeds win. Callum Harriott, Stephen Quinn, Tiago Ilori and Denis Rakells are all longer-term absentees.
