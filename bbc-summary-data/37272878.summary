The main runway at Gatwick Airport has been closed following an inspection.

Flights circled the skies above for 10 minutes after it was forced to open its alternative runway at around 19.40 BST.
The closure was a "precautionary measure" after something was discovered on the runway during regular maintenance checks, an airport spokeswoman said.
Eight aircraft were diverted and several flights were delayed as a result of the closure.
The runway is expected to be closed until Monday morning, but there should not be any delays as a result, the spokeswoman said. Some flights have been rescheduled.
She said: "We would like to apologise to any passengers impacted by this but the safety of our passengers is our number one priority.
"We are working hard to resume usual operations and get our passengers on their way."
Gatwick is a single-runway airport, but has a second runway on site, which is only used when the main runway is unavailable.
