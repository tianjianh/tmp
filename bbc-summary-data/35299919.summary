Tim Peake, the British astronaut based on the International Space Station, spoke to Stargazing Live last night about how water floats in zero gravity.
He explained that the tiny particles which water is made of form a sphere, like a bubble, making it easy to catch in your mouth.
Tim showed off his skills as he floated 240 miles above Planet Earth.
