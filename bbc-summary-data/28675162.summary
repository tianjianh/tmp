Kathryn Burge, 41, died when she was in collision with a car on Main Road, in Kirk Michael, on Monday evening.
Police said a dark blue Range Rover was involved in the crash.
A spokeswoman from Noble's hospital, where Ms Burge worked as a physiotherapist, said she was "a valued and much loved member of staff", whose loss was "a shock".
She added: "We are so sad today- all of our thoughts are with Kate's family, friends and close colleagues at this difficult time".
Richie Stevenson, chairman of Manx Fell Runners, where Ms Burge was a member, said: "[She was] a very pleasant and likeable person and a talented athlete who could perform to a very high standard on fells, road and cross country.
"Manx Fell Runners would like to pass on their condolences to all Kate`s family and friends," he said.
