Ex-Southern Health worker 'warned bosses of safety failings'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An under-fire NHS trust that failed to investigate hundreds of deaths knew about health and safety failings four years ago, the BBC can reveal.

Mike Holder, who was employed by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, said record keeping was "haphazard".
He said senior staff at the mental health trust were told safety failings could be breaking the law.
Chief executive of the trust Katrina Percy said: "We are constantly striving to find ways to do things better."
Mr Holder, a chartered health and safety practitioner, was employed as the interim head of health and safety at the trust in November 2011.
He told the BBC: "It was under-resourced, they didn't see how health and safety would apply to caring for the people in their care.
"I think their record keeping in general was very, very haphazard."
"I think there are missed opportunities and as a result of those missed opportunities, someone has lost their life.
"It's very, very disappointing, I feel for the families and it is something that should just not have happened."
An independent report in December found the trust had failed to properly investigate hundreds of deaths of patients with mental health problems and learning disabilities over a four-year period.
Connor Sparrowhawk, an 18-year-old with learning difficulties, drowned in a bath at a Southern Health building in Oxford in 2013 and the inquest into his death prompted NHS England to commission the report.
In a 13-page document seen by the BBC, Mr Holder outlined health and safety failings he had found for trust bosses.
Earlier in 2011 Ms Percy received an anonymous letter which said: "The trust is extremely under-resourced to deal with health and safety issues considering the size and complexity of the trust."
In a response to the BBC Ms Percy said: "We are constantly striving to find ways to do things better and challenging ourselves to improve services across the whole organisation, as in any NHS Trust.
"All of the issues raised in the memorandum sent more than four years ago were looked into and addressed.
"Those issues in no way relate to the independent review of deaths of people with learning disabilities and mental health needs in contact with Southern Health at least once in the previous year."
Southern Health is one of the country's largest mental health trusts, covering Hampshire, Dorset, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and providing services to about 45,000 people.
