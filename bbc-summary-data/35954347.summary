The 2009 champions beat Bangladesh, but suffered defeats by New Zealand, Australia and hosts India.
Coach Waqar Younis blamed their form on the 36-year-old's "poor captaincy".
Afridi, the world's leading wicket-taker in T20 internationals with 97, planned to retire from international duty at the end of the tournament but has now said he wishes to play on.
"Today I wish to inform my fans in Pakistan and all over the world that I am relinquishing the captaincy of the T20 Pakistani team of my own volition," the all-rounder said in a statement.
"I intend to continue to play the game for my country and league cricket."
A hard-hitting right-handed batsman and leg-spinner, he retired from Test cricket in 2010 and from one-day internationals in 2015.
Afridi has scored more sixes than any other player in the history of one-day international cricket, with 351, and is Pakistan's fourth highest run-scorer in Twenty20s with 1,405.
