[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Academy Selsey suffered extensive damage and much of its contents was destroyed in the blaze on 21 August.
The school's 453 pupils are currently being taught at four locations in the Selsey area.
As well as classrooms, the temporary buildings will house science labs, workshops and food technology areas, the school said.
The buildings, some of which have already been placed on the site by two large cranes, had previously been used to house staff and students from Bohunt School in Worthing while building work was carried out.
Tom Garfield, head teacher of the academy, said: "We are absolutely delighted to see the first temporary school buildings arrive on site. It's a great milestone for us, the staff and students alike."
He said once the remaining structures had arrived over the next few days the school would begin preparing the rooms for teaching.
