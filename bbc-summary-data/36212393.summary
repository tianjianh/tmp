BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is two-time world darts champion Adrian 'Jackpot' Lewis.
Lewis, who won the PDC title in 2011 and 2012, will be taking part in the new Champions League of Darts competition, which will be shown on BBC Sport in September.
He is a Stoke City fan, and went to his first game at the age of six at the Potters' former home, the Victoria Ground.
"My granddad took me and he told me we were going conker picking," Lewis said. "I just remember walking there and seeing everyone wearing the same shirt.
"My favourite Stoke player when I was growing up was Paul Peschisolido - I named my goldfish 'Peschi' after him. Now we've got the likes of Bojan Krkic and Xherdan Shaqiri, which shows how far we have come as a club.
"If you asked me about how this season has gone for us a month ago, I would have said 'brilliant' but the last four games have not gone to plan. Hopefully we can do a bit better this week."
You can hear more of Lewis' tales of following the Potters on Football Focus at 12:10 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got seven correct results, including three perfect scores from 10 Premier League matches, to give him a total of 160 points - his joint-highest of the season.
He still only drew with comedian Nathan Caton, who also got seven results correct, with three perfect scores.
