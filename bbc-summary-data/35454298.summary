Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Jumanne Maghembe told AFP news agency that those detained were co-operating.
"Soon more people making up the poaching gang will be netted and brought to justice," he said.
Roger Gower had been flying near the body of an elephant killed by poachers when his helicopter came under fire.
The incident happened in Maswa Game Reserve, which borders the Serengeti National Park in northern Tanzania.
Mr Gower managed to land his helicopter, but died before he could be rescued, a Tanzanian MP and former minister for natural resources and tourism, Lazaro Nyalandu, said in a tweet.
A spokesman for Tanzania's national parks, Pascal Shelutete, said three elephant carcasses had been found in the area, indicating "that whoever shot the chopper down was on a serious illegal hunting spree".
He said such poachers can be "heavily armed with sophisticated military weaponry".
The Friedkin Conservation Fund, for which Mr Gower had been working, said the organisation had lost "a dear friend".
The charity's founder, Dan Friedkin, said: "We believe that Roger can best be honoured by redoubling our commitment to protect elephants and our priceless wildlife heritage.
"This tragic event again highlights the appalling risk and cost of protecting Tanzania's wildlife."
The Friedkin Fund says elephant poaching is "especially prevalent" in Maswa, with rangers encountering ivory poachers "on a fairly regular basis".
