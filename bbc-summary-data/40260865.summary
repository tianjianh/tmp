South Africa's record goal-scorer with 32 goals signed a three-year deal to replace Eric Tinkler who joined SuperSport United last week.
"It's my first job and Cape Town City is gambling on me," the 39-year-old said at his unveiling on Tuesday.
"I know what I have to do to achieve and succeed and hopefully I'll prove that my appointment is a good one.
" I've set targets for myself and the club. Cape Town City finishing third in the league last season was incredible but I hope that the players want to go a step better.
"In my role as a coach, I have stolen a little bit from all coaches I've worked with.
One day my ambition is to be coach of Manchester United, the club I supported as boy
"But, in the end, I still want to be myself - I want to take what I've learnt and incorporate it into my own style of coaching."
McCarthy played for Portuguese side Porto when they won the Uefa Champions League in 2004 under the guidance of Jose Mourinho.
He also played for Dutch giants Ajax Amsterdam, Celta Vigo of Spain, as well as English clubs Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United.
McCarthy holds a Uefa coaching license and has previously worked as an assistant at Belgian top-flight club St. Truiden.
"It's very exciting but it's also daunting," McCarthy admitted of the job.
"One day my ambition is to be coach of Manchester United, the club I supported as boy.
"I learnt from great coaches that I worked with and I'd like to pit my wits one day against some of my mentors; people like Jose Mourinho, Mark Hughes and Sam Allardyce."
McCarthy will start his job later in the month when the club return for pre-season training.
The new South African season begins in August.
Cape Town City finished third in the domestic league which ended last month and qualified for next year's Confederation Cup.
