The Orlando Magic must "make a stand" in Thursday night's NBA game against the Toronto Raptors at London's O2 Arena if they want to enhance their hopes of reaching the post-season, says centre Nikola Vucevic.

The Magic have lost five of their last six games to leave them in the Eastern Conference's final play-off spot.
"We have to wake up," said Vucevic. "If we don't it's going to be tough to make the play-offs."
Toronto lead the Atlantic Division.
The Raptors lost to Orlando in Florida in November but have won seven of their last 10 games.
This will be the sixth regular-season NBA game to be played in London and tickets have sold out.
