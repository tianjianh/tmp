The robber called at the victim's home in Lytham Road, Preston, at about 13:30 GMT on Saturday, and claimed he was owed money for work on the house.
He forced his way inside, where he assaulted the pensioner and made off with a "four-figure" cash sum, Lancashire police said.
The victim suffered serious arm injuries, the force said.
Once inside the house, the man had tried to get rid of the attacker by giving him some cash, but was followed to his bedroom as he went to retrieve money.
He was then set upon, and left with an injured right arm and swelling to his hand, police said.
His attacker was described as a stocky white man in his 40s, wearing a blue coat.
Det Con Will Hogan, of Preston Police, said: "This was an absolutely shocking robbery where a 92-year-old man was targeted and we need to find the person responsible immediately.
"This crime has left officers disgusted and it is crucial we locate the attacker."
The force has appealed for information.
