[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-0 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil and Portsmouth ended the year by playing out a goalless draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But the game will be remembered more for the atrocious fog that engulfed Huish Park and rendered most of the pitch invisible throughout.
Yeovil had an early chance when Ben Whitfield tried his luck from 30 yards, but the ball sailed harmlessly wide.
As the fog worsened, Portsmouth climbed into the ascendancy.
Kal Naismith had a speculative effort well saved by Artur Krysiak, before Michael Smith headed wide from six yards out.
Pompey continued to threaten as Noel Hunt forced Krysiak to save another shot from distance.
Yeovil grew back into the game towards the end of the first half, with Otis Khan and Tahvon Campbell both creating chances.
Portsmouth began to resort to long shots in the second half as Danny Rose and Carl Baker both missed from distance.
Noel Hunt then had a half-volley from the edge of the box which Krysiak was equal to.
Otis Khan had a golden chance to win it for Yeovil at the end but his shot cannoned off the crossbar with David Forde well beaten.
