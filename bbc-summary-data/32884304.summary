Marc Roberts: Barnsley sign FC Halifax defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnsley have signed FC Halifax Town centre-back and captain Marc Roberts on a three-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Barnsley-born 24-year-old made 46 appearances for the Shaymen this season, scoring four goals.
He told the club website: "The gaffer here is great and I'm looking forward to working for him.
"I'm an old-fashioned defender. I'm strong in the air and won't lose many headers. I'm not bad on the floor but I'm looking to improve."
