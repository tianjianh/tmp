Scottish hockey: Men's team comfortable in World League round one

Scotland forward Alan Forsyth says the men's national team's defence must be applauded as much as the attack after a blistering start to their World League campaign.

The Blue Sticks beat Switzerland 5-0 then thrashed Slovakia 11-0.
"We've scored a lot of goals, but defensively it's great credit to the boys at the back that we're holding out," Forsyth told BBC Scotland.
"It's a great start but we need to keep going on Saturday and Sunday."
It is 14:15 BST kick-offs for Scotland against Portugal and Wales this weekend to complete their round one section of the World League in Glasgow.
"For us to host the tournament is great because we get to play in front of friends and family," added Forsyth, who won his 100th cap versus Switzerland.
"It gives us a good vibe and it's easier for the squad; rather than travelling all the time. The squad have deserved the results we've had."
Qualification for round two goes to the top two teams from those four, with Scotland virtually assured progression after picking up six points from six.
Surbiton's Alan Forsyth was named Players' Player of the Year in England last season and topped the England Hockey League goal-scoring charts, but still missed out on selection for the Team GB men's squad who failed to reach the quarter-finals at the Rio Olympics.
His brother David Forsyth plays for Qui Vive in the Netherlands and is desperate for Scotland's men to reach their first ever World Cup in India in 2018.
The chance of qualifying for that comes if the national team gets beyond World League round two in March 2017.
"It's absolutely massive," he told BBC Scotland.
"For Scotland alone the World Cup is the biggest competition and it would be a massive achievement to get there.
"Of course, the Olympics is big but that's Team GB and it's well known we don't have any Scots in that team.
"Even if we get to World League round three we'll be really, really happy. We've got a really good, young, energetic team that's putting 100% into the programme."
