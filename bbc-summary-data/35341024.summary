China's markets cheered the country's latest GDP numbers on Tuesday, which were in line with expectations.

The world's second-biggest economy grew by 6.9% in 2015, compared with 7.3% a year earlier.
The numbers mark its slowest growth in a quarter of a century, but that did little to rock investor sentiment.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 2% at 19,635.81 points, while the mainland's Shanghai Composite wrapped the day 3.22% higher at 3,007.74.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses to close up 0.55% at 17,048.37.
On Monday, Japanese shares hit a one-year low as oil prices dropped below $28 a barrel for the first time since 2003.
In Australia, while investors had traded cautiously earlier in the day, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.91% at 4,903.10.
Some energy-related shares made gains on Tuesday, having fallen a day earlier on oil price worries.
BHP Billiton shares were up 0.7%, while Santos shares moved out of negative territory during the day to gain 1.9%.
In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index also reversed earlier losses to close up 0.6% at 1,889.64.
Official numbers released on Tuesday showed producer prices in the country fell in December for the 17th month in a row. On a brighter note, however, the pace at which prices have been falling slowed.
