[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kerry Foods confirmed the redundancies, which were initially announced in February.
The company said a consultation process "had failed to secure a strategy which would ensure the sustainability of production at the site".
The firm said it was retaining the factory on the town's Europarc industrial estate and was looking at "future possibilities for the site".
Kerry Foods said employees were given confirmation of the plant's closure on Wednesday following a 90-day consultation period.
A company spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to assist employees in securing new employment."
