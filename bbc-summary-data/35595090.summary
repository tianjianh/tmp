GP practices should be given more money in return for prompt appointments, the Welsh Liberal Democrats have said.

The party said its planned Â£10m Access to GPs scheme would also fund extended opening hours, with the most innovative bids for cash being rewarded.
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said it would "guarantee the best treatment at the right time".
Meanwhile the Welsh Conservatives said they would crack down on big pay-offs for NHS bosses if they won power.
The Tories said it followed the news that the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board was still paying its former chief executive Trevor Purt his Â£200,000-a-year salary after he took up a job in England.
Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said it was time to put an end to a system which appeared to "reward failure".
