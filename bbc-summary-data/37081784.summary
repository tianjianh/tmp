Gary Watson was the frontman of The Lapelles who recently performed at T in the Park and the Belladrum festival.
A post on the band's Facebook page said Mr Watson died "as a result of injuries sustained in a tragic accident" on Saturday night.
Police said the death was not suspicious.
Emergency services were called to the River Clyde near Glasgow Bridge at about 22:00 on Saturday.
Mr Watson was rescued from the water and taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary but later died.
The Lapelles statement read: "It's with shock, heavy hearts and sadness that we have to let you know the news that Gary sadly passed away this morning as a result of injuries sustained in a tragic accident last night.
"Today was his 22nd birthday. We are lost for words and struggling to process such a tragedy.
"Gary was a creative force, a man who without his vision this band wouldn't exist. We have lost a friend, a brother, a hero. At the moment it doesn't seem real.
"We send our deepest condolences to Gary's family and would appreciate your respect in allowing them & us some peace whilst we grieve. Forever in our hearts, with peace you go. X."
The band were due to head off on a UK tour in October.
Tributes were paid to Mr Watson on social media by fans and fellow bands.
Franz Ferdinand posted on Twitter: "We're so sad to hear of the tragic passing of @TheLapelles Gary Watson, a lovely, talented man. Thoughts are with his family, friends & band."
