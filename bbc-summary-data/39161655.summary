Castleford Tigers rugby club chief executive Steve Gill was "viciously" assaulted during a town-centre attack, the club has said.

The Betfred Super League leaders said the attack happened in Bridge Street, Castleford, early on Friday.
A statement from the club thanked emergency services, who it said were called to the scene and responded quickly.
A 58-year old man has been arrested and remains in police custody.
The Tigers wished Mr Gill, who is now recovering at home, a speedy recovery.
His association with his home-town club began when he operated the scoreboard.
He held the role of assistant coach before becoming head of youth in 2008 and four years ago took over from Steve Ferres as chief executive.
He has overseen a rise in fortunes of the Tigers, who gained a 66-10 win over Leeds on Thursday to maintain their unbeaten start to the season.
West Yorkshire Police said: "A 58-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident and remains in custody at this time.
"The victim, a 57-year-old man, suffered an injury to his back which is not believed to be serious."
