£200m Flintshire road improvement plans on display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for £200m road improvements in Deeside will go on display over the next four days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two routes are being assessed with one focusing on the A55/A494 from the River Dee bridge to Northop.
The second looks at highway and transport improvements using the existing A458 Flintshire Bridge.
It is hoped the improvements will boost the economy by improving access to Deeside Enterprise Zone and north Wales, say officials.
Neither of the two routes involves widening the A494, the scheme that was abandoned after opposition by residents on Aston Hill.
Homes were demolished to make way for a controversial seven-lane highway before ministers threw those plans out.
Exhibitions are at Coleg Cambria, Connah's Quay, on Tuesday and Wednesday and Deeside Leisure Centre, Queensferry, on Thursday and Friday.
