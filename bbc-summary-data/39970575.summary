Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says Harry Kane is "one of the best strikers in the world", and insists the club can keep their best players this summer.

Kane, 23, scored four in Thursday's 6-1 win at Leicester to move to the top the golden boot standings, ahead of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez.
Pochettino said: "Harry Kane's a special player, he loves Tottenham.
"The players we want to keep will be here next season. If any players leave, it's Tottenham's decision."

Kane, the Premier League's top scorer last season with 25, moved to 26 for this campaign with two late goals in the victory at the King Power Stadium.
Kane, midfielder Dele Alli and defender Kyle Walker continue to be linked with transfers, but Pochettino says the club are in control of the England internationals' futures.
"I think we are so, so, so calm about our big players and they are so happy here," said the Argentine.
"We are building a very exciting project. The players must feel they are part of us and want to share in our success.
"Harry Kane means a lot for the team. I tell you always that he's one of the best strikers in the world. His performances show that we are right."
Kane has missed eight league games with injury this season but looks set to finish as top scorer, unless Everton striker Lukaku or Arsenal forward Sanchez have a remarkable final day of the season.
The latter two players will be on opposing sides at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, while Kane and Spurs go to Hull. All 10 Premier League matches on Sunday kick off at 15:00 BST.
Kane averages a goal every 94 minutes in the league this season, and unsurprisingly described the campaign as his best yet.
"It probably could have been more," he said.
"It is the first time in my professional career that I've scored four, there has been a bit of build-up in the race for the golden boot and I wanted at least one or two to put the pressure on - but to get four is amazing.
"This is my best season. I missed 11 weeks and worked hard during my injury to ensure I came back in better shape than I started."
Kane's top-flight goals this term have earned Spurs 13 points, which is second only behind Chelsea striker Diego Costa's 20 goals, earning the Blues 15 points.
Former Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Townsend:
Harry Kane always hits the target, he is always looking to work goalkeepers.
He has 51 goals in two seasons and that is great numbers. Those who work with him and know him will say he deserves it.
He works incredibly hard at his game. He is determined. He has taken a few knocks along the way but he is showing everything he has got right now.
He is a combination of [former England strike partners] Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer.
