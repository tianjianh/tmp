The Australian author, who was born in South Africa, previously won in 1983 and 1999 and could become the first author to win the prize three times.
He faces competition from 12 authors, including 2012 nominee Deborah Levy and A L Kennedy, who was a judge in 2012.
Chair of judges Amanda Foreman said the listed books challenged "expectations of what a novel is and can be".
The Man Booker shortlist will be announced on 13 September, with the winner being declared at a ceremony at London's Guildhall on 25 October.
Alongside Coetzee, who previously won with Life & Times of Michael K and Disgrace, the longlist includes six UK-based authors, five from the US and one from Canada.
Notable omissions from the list include the latest novels by previous winners Ian McEwan and Julian Barnes and Pulitzer Prize winner Don DeLillo.
Ms Foreman said the range of books was "broad and the quality extremely high".
"Each novel provoked intense discussion and, at times, passionate debate, challenging our expectations of what a novel is and can be," she said.
"The writing is uniformly fresh, energetic and important - it is a longlist to be relished."
The prize, which was won in 2015 by Marlon James for his third novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, was first awarded in 1969.
Its sister prize, the Man Booker International Prize, was won in May by South Korean author Han Kang's The Vegetarian.
