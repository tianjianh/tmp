Sir Cliff Richard sex abuse allegations to be reviewed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decision not to prosecute Sir Cliff Richard over claims of historical sex offences is being reviewed following a challenge by one of his accusers.

An application was made under the victims' right to review scheme, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
The singer, 75, was never arrested or charged over the assault allegations made by four men dating between 1958 and 1983 - which he strongly denies.
The case was dropped in June on the grounds of insufficient evidence.
The right to review process allows an alleged victim to ask the CPS to look again at a case file, providing their application is lodged within three months of a decision not to charge or to end proceedings.
A spokesman for the CPS confirmed they had received an application earlier this month and the review was "ongoing".
Sir Cliff was the subject of a long-running South Yorkshire Police investigation which began in 2014.
Two years later the CPS said he would face no further action saying there was "insufficient evidence to prosecute".
Sir Cliff said he felt "tarnished" by the allegations. "Insufficient suggests that maybe there's something there and I know there wasn't," he said.
He said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been "hung out like live bait".
