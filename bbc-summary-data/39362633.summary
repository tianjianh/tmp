Scotland's papers: 'Terror grips Westminster'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Westminster terror attack in which four people died and 40 were injured dominates every front page in Scotland.

Many of them carry an image of several police officers crowded round a body lying on a cobbled street next to the Houses of Parliament.
The National's front page shows a heavily-armed officer clearly pointing his gun at the man while his colleagues appear to be tending to him.
The same picture features on the front of The Courier - with red circles around two knives lying on the cobbles.
The Herald also highlights a blade seen underneath an armed officer's foot.
Inside, the paper's UK political editor Michael Settle gives an eyewitness account of the attack.
"As usual on a Wednesday afternoon I was busy at my computer, writing about the drama of Prime Minister's Questions," he said. "Little did I know that another drama was about to unfold right outside my window."
The Scotsman's man at Westminster, Paris Gourtsoyannis, also gave his take on events. "Noisy protests are a fact of life for journalists at Westminster whose office face out on to Parliament Square," he said. "But the loud bang yesterday afternoon immediately sounded out of place."
And in the Daily Record, its Westminster editor Torquil Crichton paid tribute to PC Keith Palmer who "gave his life defending democracy".
"This was another futile assault on our way of life but you can't kill a city or the symbol of a country's democracy," he added.
An image of the man suspected of carrying out the terror attack features on the front page of the Scottish Daily Mail. The close-up photograph shows the bearded man, lying on a trolley and surrounded by paramedics.
The paper said the "savage assault on democracy" was the UK's worst atrocity since the London attacks of 2005.
The Scottish Sun carries the same photograph of the terror suspect. Inside, its reporter Harry Cole told how he watched "in admiration" as Tory MP Tobias Ellwood fought to save the life of the policeman who was repeatedly stabbed in the attack.
Mr Ellwood, a foreign office minister who lost his brother in the Bali terrorist bombings in 2002, also features on the front page of the i newspaper. An earlier edition of the paper - featuring an image of the bloodied leg of a victim on Westminster - led to some criticism on social media. Editor Oliver Duff explained why it was changed, saying it was poor judgement and the controversial image risked diverting attention from the story itself.
