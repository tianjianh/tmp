Ian Sharps: Walsall bring in Chester assistant manager as new first team coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Sharps has left National League side Chester to become first-team coach under Jon Whitney at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old former Tranmere Rovers, Rotherham United, Shrewsbury Town, Burton Albion, AFC Telford United and Chester centre-half only finished playing at the end of last season.
But, although still registered as a player, he has been assistant manager since April to Jon McCarthy at Chester.
Sharps replaces Dean Holden, who left to join Bristol City last week.
Warrington-born Sharps spent time last season on the Walsall staff in a part-time coaching capacity.
He will help form a new Saddlers backroom team along with manager Whitney and goalkeeping coach Neil Cutler.
Walsall, play-off semi finalists last season, currently stand 14th in League One.
He leaves a Chester side lying 12th in the National League following Saturday's 2-2 comeback draw at Sharps' old club Tranmere.
