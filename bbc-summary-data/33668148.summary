Up to 300 brown and sea trout have died after a fish kill at the River Enler in County Down.

The fish were found dead in the water at the weekend. It is thought that there have been two separate kills in the river.
In 2013, almost 5,000 fish were found dead after the river was polluted in a farm incident.
Ian Kittle, secretary of the Inler Angling Club, said it was devastating news.
"We are devastated, especially after the last fish kill in 2013," he said.
"The river was starting to recover and we had been busy restocking it. This incident is not as bad.
"But at the same time, we have lost juvenile fish and more. Our resident brown trout are dead and we also found a large sea trout that had been coming up from the lough to spawn."
Mr Kittle said he was first made aware of the fish kill on Friday evening.
There appeared to have been two separate kills, he said. One is upstream parallel to the Belfast Road, Comber. A lot of the dead fish are at the lower end of the river, under the new Comber bypass bridge.
A government department is investigating.
