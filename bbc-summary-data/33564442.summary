[SN]TITLE[SN]
MPs win surveillance powers legal challenge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two MPs have won a High Court battle over laws which they say allow the police and security services to "spy on citizens" without proper safeguards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Davis and Tom Watson challenged the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act earlier this year, arguing it was incompatible with human rights.
It was fast-tracked through Parliament last July, allowing security agencies to gather phone and internet data.
Two judges have now found that the law is "inconsistent with EU laws".
The ruling effectively nullifies aspects of the legislation, although that order has been suspended until next March and the home secretary has been granted the right to appeal.
Mr Davis, a former Conservative minister and Mr Watson, a civil liberties campaigner who is standing to be Labour's deputy leader, brought the case in conjunction with campaign group Liberty.
The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act permits Britain's security agencies and some other public bodies to gather information about who suspects contact by telephone or email.
This does not include content but does include the fact that calls and emails are made, by whom, to whom and how often.
The BBC's legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman said the MPs argued the act was incompatible with the right to a private and family life, and data protection, under both the Human Rights Act and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The High Court, he added, has now ruled that aspects of the bill are unlawful because they are in breach of Article 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and should be "disapplied".
It was, he added, highly unusual for MPs to challenge primary legislation in the courts.
