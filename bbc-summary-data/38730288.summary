The 38-year-old left the Shakers in the summer and has scored nine goals in 28 appearances so far this season.
BBC Radio Manchester reported in December that Bury had approached the League Two club about Lowe and a deal has now been completed.
He will assist head coach Chris Brass, who replaced sacked boss David Flitcroft at Gigg Lane.
"I have a long association with Bury and the coaching staff understood that it was an opportunity that I really couldn't turn down," Lowe told Crewe's club website.
"Coaching is something I want to get involved in and everyone knows that Bury holds a special place in my heart.
"I was out of contract in the summer, and at my age, I had to look towards the future."
