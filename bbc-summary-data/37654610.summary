Winger Rhys Williams eased Welsh nerves with two tries in the first quarter, while Regan Grace and Ollie Olds made it 20-0 at half-time.
Grace and Olds added a second apiece while Courtney Davies, Andrew Gay, and Gil Dudson also went over for second-half scores in the rain.
Lloyd White and Davies combined to kick the extras in a one-sided game.
Wales' leading try-scorer, London Broncos' Williams, took his international tally to 18 with his two smart finishes, while teenage winger Grace and scrum-half Olds bagged their first scores for Wales.
Serbia rarely threatened despite the core of Australian-based players in their squad while Grace's second was the pick of the tries on the hour as he raced in from 60 metres.
Wales play Jamaica in a friendly at Wakefield on Friday 21 October before they face Italy in Monza in their other Group A qualifier on Saturday, 29 October.
The group winners qualify for the 2017 World Cup while the runners-up face a play-off against the second placed side in the Ireland, Russia and Spain group, at Leigh on November 4.
Man-of-the-match Elliot Kear told BBC Wales Sport:
"We were pretty confident going into the game, we wanted to respect the opposition because we didn't have much video on them, but we knew we had a strong pack and we thought if we stuck to the tactics we should come over the top of them.
"Rhys Williams and Regan Grace are pretty skilful and given the conditions we're happy with the result. The biggest thing in the second half was not to let them score, we thought keep ticking over and the tries will look after themselves.
"I really look forward [to Wales duties] at the end of the season, new faces, new coach, there's no egos in our team and everyone enjoys each other's company."
