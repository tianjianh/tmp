From Friday 10 April, the veteran US performer will host a weekly show which airs from 1900 to 2100 BST.
Iggy Pop said: "Having sat in for Jarvis Cocker last year on BBC Radio 6 Music, I found myself realising how good it was for me. I hope it was good for somebody else too."
Tom Ravenscroft's 6 Music show is also moving to 21:00-00:00 BST.
It had previously run from 19:00 to 22:00. The changes to the schedule mean the station will no longer be broadcasting 6 Mix, a weekly show featuring a range of resident and guest DJs delivering a two-hour set.
Ravenscroft said: "It's great to have the creative freedom to explore music even more deeply in my new regular slot on 6 Music."
Iggy Pop first presented two shows on the network in December 2013 and returned last year to front a weekly Sunday afternoon show, taking over Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service slot.
He also delivered the fourth John Peel Lecture with a speech on the subject of Free Music in a Capitalist Society.
He said the new show will be "what we call in the USA the 'happy hour'.
"It's kind of an edgy point right at the end of the designated work week, and I'll try to play quite a bit of music that's new and stimulating mixed with very old classics from the blues and jazz masters of the 1920s through 50s that are a little more moody. I'm gonna think of myself as a kind of atmospheric bartender. I'll try to do my very best."
BBC 6 Music's head of programmes Paul Rodgers said that in the latest round of official radio listening figures, "Iggy had driven his Sunday afternoon show to a slot record of over 300k listeners".
He added: "To welcome him back in a permanent slot on the network is a dream come true for me and our listeners, and we all look forward to hearing his eclectic musical selections each Friday evening."
