Irish PM Enda Kenny meets Pope Francis in Vatican

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny has met Pope Francis in the Vatican.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kenny was personally welcoming the Pope's decision to hold the World Meeting of Families in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland in August 2018.
It comes ahead of speculation that the Pope will visit Ireland at that time.
Mr Kenny and Pope Francis were also expected to discuss a number of issues of mutual and global interest during the meeting, that lasted 23 minutes.
Following their discussions, Mr Kenny presented the Pope with a print by artist Harry Clarke, while Pope Francis presented the taoiseach with an etching of St Peter's Basilica.
Ahead of the visit, RTÃ‰ Europe editor Tony Connolly said: "It won't be a state visit per se but will be a pastoral visit.
"Symbolically, it's a very important meeting. Kenny met him in April 2014, but this is the first full audience he's had with the Pope.
"It'll only be about 30 minutes. It does mark the full restoration of relations between the Irish government and the Vatican after Mr Kenny criticised church over sex abuse.
"This was really a low point in relations and shortly after that the Irish government closed their embassy."
Mr Connolly said he thought Mr Kenny would "encourage" any discussions or plans for Pope Francis to travel to Northern Ireland.
"He said to reporters after he had invited Pope Francis to Ireland and said he would like that to include Northern Ireland if the Pope decided to come one day."
