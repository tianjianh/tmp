The 23-year-old, who also played under McDonald at Redditch, has scored 10 goals for Hednesford this season.
Carline could make his National League debut in Saturday's match against North Ferriby United.
"He offers something the Moors need. I believe he's ready to step up to this level," McDonald told the club website.
"George is a big, strong, box-to-box midfielder who scores goals as has been proven by the fact that he's already in double figures this season."
