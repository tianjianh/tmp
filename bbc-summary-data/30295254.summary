London Southend Airport project promises 7,380 new jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to create more than 7,000 jobs on a business park next to London Southend Airport has been approved by a government inspector.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council and Rochford District Council will now formulate detailed plans.
Regeneration, environmental improvements and transport proposals are included in the Joint Area Action Plan (JAAP).
The aim is to start construction in 2016 after detailed plans are adopted.
The JAAP presented to the inspector provided evidence for the creation of 4,200 additional jobs excluding direct airport-related employment up to 2021 and up to 2,000 additional jobs later.
The aim is for an additional 1,180 jobs within the airport boundary.
Borough council leader Ron Woodley said: "This is a golden opportunity for Southend-on-Sea and we will also be working to ensure that our policies reflect the skills required and give our young people every opportunity to fill these new jobs that will be created."
