[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 2-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two second-half goals from Billy Sharp gave high-flying Sheffield United victory over struggling Oldham Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a first half of few chances, Oldham's Ryan Flynn had a 20-yard shot turned over the bar by Simon Moore while the home side's best effort came from Mark Duffy whose free-kick was saved by Connor Ripley.
Sharp saw his header deflected wide and Kieron Freeman had a shot blocked.
Soon after the restart, Duffy also had an effort blocked while Sharp tried a first-time shot from inside the area which went over.
Josh Law floated a free-kick just over for the Latics before the hosts took control of the game.
Sharp produced an emphatic finish on 72 minutes after receiving the ball from Duffy on the right-hand side of the area.
Away substitute Freddie Ladapo went close to equalising when his 25-yard volley forced Moore to tip the ball wide.
But Sharp added a second two minutes from time to wrap up the points for the Blades, sweeping home the loose ball after Leon Clarke put Ripley under pressure from Duffy's cross.
