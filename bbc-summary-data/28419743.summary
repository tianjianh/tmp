Operation Pallial: 275 people make abuse allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating child sexual abuse at care homes in North Wales say 275 people have now come forward to make allegations - according to a briefing note seen by the BBC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As of the beginning of June, Operation Pallial, which is being led by the National Crime Agency, is investigating 49 people as potential suspects.
NCA investigators have been given 120 names or partial names of people said to have been involved in abuse, and work continues to fully identify them.
Investigators currently believe there are potentially 61 repeat offenders; 21 have been arrested and 10 men charged. Sixteen are believed to have died and efforts are being made to locate others in the UK and abroad.
In total the inquiry is examining alleged abuse at 28 care homes in North  Wales.
Offences are believed to have been committed between 1953 and 1995.
The alleged victims include boys, girls and young adults aged between 6 and 19.
The National Crime Agency says it expects more arrests and charges in the months to come.
Thirty officers based in Warrington are working on the case.
Police say they've had a positive response from those who have reported abuse allegations and promise to update all victims on what has come of the information they have given, whether it leads to an arrest or not.
The investigation is expected to continue into 2016.
The first suspect, John Allen, goes on trial in October.
He faces a large number of allegations.
A police investigation in 1991 by North Wales police resulted in the convictions of seven former care workers.
This was followed by the Waterhouse inquiry which received statements naming more than 80 abusers.
The Waterhouse report found no evidence of a paedophile ring beyond the care system but in April 2013 further allegations were made of wider child abuse.
As a result, Operation Pallial was set up initially to examine potential evidence.  It has now become a full-blown criminal investigation.
Lady Justice Macur was also asked to carry out a review of the Waterhouse Inquiry itself to see if it failed to investigate specific allegations.
It has been suggested this review is now complete but has not published its findings because Operation Pallial continues.
Though the police investigation has 'primacy' this briefing note states says the Macur Review is continuing and police have not asked it to be delayed.
