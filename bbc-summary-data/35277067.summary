Glasgow Warriors form not worrying - Ali Price

Nobody at Glasgow Warriors are worrying about their present form and the players will rediscover their "winning team" mentality according to scrum-half Ali Price.

Warriors lost a third match in a row on Saturday in a 34-10 European Champions Cup loss to Racing 92 that leaves them on the brink of elimination.
But the 22-year-old believes Glasgow have the quality to turn things around.
"I wouldn't say it's worrying," Price told BBC Scotland.
"We know how to win games, we've proved that in the past. It's just putting an 80 minute performance together.
"It's just little system errors and lack of accuracy that's costing us at the moment. I wouldn't say we are in a rut. We are a winning team."
The defeat in Paris was Warriors' seventh of the season in all competitions. Gregor Townsend's men have already lost five times in the league, the same number as they did in the whole of last season's victorious campaign.
However, scrum-half Price feels the problem has been identified.
"I think we're just forcing things a little bit," he said. "We're putting in so much effort."
When asked if the players need to relax on the pitch, Price agreed.
"Yeah, we just have to play our style and keep switched on."
Despite being outgunned by four tries to one by the French Top 14 leaders, Price dismisses talk of a gulf in class between his side and Racing, and feels the scoreline is not a fair reflection of the match.
"They played well," he said. "But we showed a hell of a lot of effort so in that respect so no, I don't think it does (show a gulf).
"The scoreline doesn't reflect what happened on the pitch. We just lost a bit of accuracy at times and that's what cost us ultimately."
Warriors now need to win their remaining two matches to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals for the first time.
They travel to face Northampton Saints next weekend before welcoming Racing to Scotstoun the following week.
