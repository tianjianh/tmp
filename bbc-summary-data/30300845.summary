[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A member of the public found the girl, who was pronounced dead shortly after being found, at Whitcliffe Grange in Richmond, at about 14:40 GMT on Monday.
The child's mother has not been found and police have expressed concerns for her welfare.
Officers conducted a finger-tip search of refuse in the area as part of efforts to trace the mother.
The infant has been taken to the mortuary at Darlington Memorial Hospital.
The head of midwifery at the hospital repeated the police call's urging the child's mother to contact police.
Ann Holt said: "Our message is for mum to come forward for the serious medical complications that might occur following this kind of delivery, like bleeding and infection, but also from the point of view that we have a baby here without her mum.
"We would like to reunite the mum with her baby in our hospital."
