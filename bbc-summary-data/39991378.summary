[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim was struck on the head with a blunt instrument before being robbed of money and other personal items.
The attack took place in an open field area in Bourtreehill, Irvine, at about 20:00 on Friday.
The injured man was taken to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock where he was treated for a head injury before being released.
The three suspects are described as being around 30 years old and were wearing grey-coloured clothing.
Det Sgt John Deans, of Saltcoats CID, said: "This was a very cowardly attack on a frail, defenceless man who suffers from various health problems and I appeal to members of the public who have any information that could assist our inquiries to contact police immediately.
"There were many youths in the area at the time this incident took place and we believe that they may have seen the three suspects hanging around. If so, please get in touch with police before they cause misery and harm to someone else."
