A Liverpool supporters' group is planning a boycott of the club's match against Hull City in protest over what it claims are high ticket prices.

The Spirit of Shankly group said Hull City was "monetising the fans' loyalty" by charging £50 for the match at the KC Stadium on Tuesday.
Group chair James McKenna compared the price with the £16 charged to Stoke City and Burnley fans.
Hull City was unwilling to comment when contacted by the BBC.
Mr McKenna said that last season Liverpool supporters were charged £35 and fans at the rival Merseyside club, Everton, paid £35 for a fixture against Hull City on New Year's Day.
"It sticks in the throat a bit for supporters that we should be expected to cough up more to see them just because we are Liverpool," he said.
The Spirit of Shankly organisation is campaigning for clubs to cap away ticket prices.
Liverpool supporters held up a banner protesting against the cost of football when Hull City played at Anfield in October.
Mr McKenna said the group had been contacted by a number of supporters from across the UK who have pledged to take part in the boycott.
"I think we are looking at around 400 to 500 supporters already... who are saying they'll take part in this," he said.
"For us it's not whether the entire end is empty but it's just to demonstrate to Hull - and I think to football clubs around the country - that supporters are so angry."
