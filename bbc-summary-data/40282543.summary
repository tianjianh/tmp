Labour appoint Lesley Laird as shadow Scottish Secretary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour have appointed one of their newly-elected MPs to be the party's shadow Scottish Secretary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lesley Laird was elected last week to represent Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.
Ms Laird was born in Greenock and is a former deputy leader of Fife Council. She worked in human resources before being elected as a councillor in 2012.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said she would help the party present a "positive vision" for Scotland's future.
Mr Corbyn said: "I am delighted to appoint Lesley as Shadow Scottish Secretary.
"She brings a wealth of knowledge and practical real life experience to the Commons, and will play a major role going forward as we hold the Tory Government to account.
"She will work closely with me and Kez Dugdale as we present a positive Labour vision for Scotland's future."
Ms Laird added: "My priorities are the things that people told me are important to them in the General Election campaign: that's jobs, housing and public services.
"I look forward to working closely with Jeremy and Kez as Labour unites to take on the Tories, and I will be holding David Mundell to account for the actions of his government which is causing misery right across Scotland."
