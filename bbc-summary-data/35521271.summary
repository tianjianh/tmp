Wedding on Raigmore Hospital ward for dying patient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nursing staff in the Highlands arranged a wedding on a hospital ward for a dying cancer patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The patient at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and their partner decided to get married after the patient's health deteriorated.
Senior charge nurse Rhoda Patterson and her team turned a room on their oncology ward GC into a wedding venue for the afternoon.
The staff provided decorations, a cake, flowers and confetti.
One of the nurse's phones was used to take pictures of the ceremony. The patient later died.
The effort has earned the team praise from NHS Highland and a Highland Quality Award, an accolade that recognises workers for exceeding their normal duties.
Garry Coutts, the health board's chairman, said: "What Rhoda and her team did for this patient was above and beyond the already excellent care they deliver to vulnerable patients every day."
