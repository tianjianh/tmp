He is one of a number of elite riders confirmed to be taking part in the event next month.
The opening stage of the Tour of Britain runs through Scotland on 4 September this year.
Cavendish will be joined by sprinter AndrÃ© Greipel and former World Hour Record holder Rohan Dennis.
The Isle of Man rider, who has 30 stage victories in the Tour de France, won his first Olympic medal on Tuesday taking silver in the Omnium track event.
The Tour of Britain will be his first race after the Olympics.
Race director Mick Bennett said: "In Mark Cavendish and AndrÃ© Greipel we have two of the world's top sprinters, who are both already multiple Tour of Britain stage winners.
"We are delighted that BMC Racing Team will be bringing two outstanding time trialists in Rohan Dennis and Taylor Phinney to the race.
"This is the first of several exciting rider announcements that fans can look forward to and will build excitement for what will be another world-class edition of the Tour of Britain."
