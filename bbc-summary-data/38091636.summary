Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said officers followed a Honda Civic driving over the speed limit on Birdhall Lane, Cheadle at about 00:45 GMT.
It crashed shortly after and a 21-year-old man was taken to hospital in a "life threatening condition".
A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
A GMP spokeswoman said the car had "failed to stop when requested by officer and a short pursuit took place".
She added that the car's driver had "made off from the scene and was gone before police caught up with the Honda Civic".
