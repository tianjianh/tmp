[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 5-0 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City ended a run of five successive Championship defeats with a comprehensive win over Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Canaries started well and Jacob Murphy soon scrambled them in front.
After Murphy was fouled in the box by Harlee Dean, Graham Dorrans tapped in the second on the rebound after his penalty was saved by Daniel Bentley.
Robbie Brady slotted in from Alex Pritchard's pass, Nelson Oliveira smashed home and Pritchard stabbed in to seal victory.
Norwich's win, which temporarily took them back into the top six before Leeds beat Aston Villa, eases the pressure on manager Alex Neil after they slipped from top to eighth, prompting chairman Ed Balls to publicly back his manager.
Brentford, however, have won only one of their past nine games and are now 18th after a fourth straight defeat.
The Canaries, who had not won since beating Rotherham 3-1 at Carrow Road on 18 October, led when Murphy was credited with the opener, although Bees defender Josh Egan may have got the final touch.
Brentford came into the game after Dorrans tucked in the second, with Scott Hogan twice heading off target and Egan volleying at Norwich keeper John Ruddy.
But their hopes of a comeback were thwarted as Brady, Oliveira and Pritchard struck in the second half to complete an emphatic Norwich win.
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"Today was in complete contrast to our recent performances - we played really well. It was our best performance of the season - every player responded.
"It's only one win, though, and we need to build on it. November was a really tough month for us. Hopefully that is us seeing the back of that and we can push on.
"The players knew the importance of the game for everyone connected with the club - myself, the fans, the staff - and they responded in the perfect manner."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"I've told the players it's the worst performance I've had as a manager.
"The players have to look in the mirror. I'll look in the mirror as well. I'll look at the selection; did I get that right?
"But after the third goal I thought a few of us gave up. We have to make sure it doesn't happen again."
