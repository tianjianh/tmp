[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stoke Road shut due to struck bridge work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road will be shut for more than five weeks due to work to protect a railway bridge that has been hit by vehicles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge in Stoke Road in Stoke-on-Trent "has a history of incidents where drivers have failed to observe the height restriction", Network Rail said.
Beams will be installed to provide additional protection, reducing the risk of structural damage and potential disruption to rail services, it added.
Stoke Road will be closed to traffic until 16:30 GMT on 11 March.
Work will take place between 07:00 and 17:00 GMT Monday to Friday and overnight from 22:00 to 06:00 GMT on two weekends - 21, 22, 28 and 29 February.
Network Rail apologised for any inconvenience caused.
