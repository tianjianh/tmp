[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The designs for S4C's new Carmarthenshire headquarters have gone on show at the Eisteddfod in Abergavenny on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The University of Wales Trinity Saint David has submitted a planning application to Carmarthenshire council.
The headquarters, Yr Egin, will be built at the university in Carmarthen.
It should house about 25 companies who are expected to contribute more than Â£11m a year to the local economy and create 98 jobs.
Seventy five jobs will be relocated including 55 S4C jobs from Cardiff.
People can find out more and view a 3D model of the building, which is due to open in 2018, at the university's stand at the Eisteddfod.
