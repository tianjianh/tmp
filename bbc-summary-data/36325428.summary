James Thompson took his own life last year shortly after Leicester's Bradgate Unit said it was full, although he was offered inpatient treatment elsewhere.
An inquest returned a conclusion of suicide and that the care he received was good.
His family said they were satisfied with the verdict but added that they had concerns over funding.
The 44-year-old chef, who lived in Leicester, had a history of mental health problems including anxiety and depression.
His family have previously said he "begged" to be sectioned but the inquest heard that while he had seen health professionals he often did not engage in treatment.
He was offered inpatient treatment but there were no beds available in Leicester and he did not want to go elsewhere.
Bill Timson, Mr Thompson's stepfather, said: "I am concerned about the level of mental health funding.
"There wasn't a bed for James when the time was absolutely necessary as far as we're concerned. He was offered a bed... but it was going to be out of the area."
Assistant coroner for Leicester Dianne Hocking concluded Mr Thompson died as a result of suicide and the care he received from Leicestershire mental health services was good.
In a statement, Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, which is responsible for mental health services in the county, said: "We were deeply saddened by the death of Mr Thompson.
"We want to extend our sincere sympathies to Mr Thompson's family on their tragic loss and would welcome the opportunity to meet with them, if they wish."
