The hosts needed to win by three goals to reach Sunday's third-place play-off, but were 2-0 down inside six minutes.
Sophie Bray pulled one back before Australia struck twice more after the break to leave GB finish bottom of the Pool.
"Today was unacceptable," head coach Danny Kerry told BBC Sport.
"Other than today we have played OK, but we were soft, deserved to be beaten the way we did and I'm bitterly angry, which the girls know."
With most of the British line-up having featured for England during their historic EuroHockey Championship victory at the same venue last year, GB were hoping for a moral boosting tournament before this summer's Rio Olympics.
GB began their Champions Trophy campaign with an encouraging 2-2 draw against World League gold medallists Argentina.
However, they then lost 2-0 to the Netherlands, were beaten 1-0 by New Zealand and suffered a 2-0 defeat by the USA, all without scoring a goal.
"We have under-performed this week," said Susanna Townsend, who secured her 100th international cap against Australia.
"That said, it's not the worst time for it to happen because we have played well this year and it's Rio where we want to peak."

Britain will face New Zealand, who earlier drew 1-1 with USA, in the fifth/sixth-place play-off on Sunday.
"It's important they show some character tomorrow," added Kerry. "It's important that they front up and show some grit and determination."
Scorer Bray said: "We'll do everything possible to go out there and show what we can do tomorrow for the crowd, who have been fantastic."
Defending Olympic champions the Netherlands will face Argentina for the second time in 24 hours in the gold medal match.
They head into that fixture with the psychological advantage having beaten their opponents 2-0 on Saturday.
Australia's defeat of Great Britain secured them a match against the USA for bronze.
