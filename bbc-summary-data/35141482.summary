[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Isle of Wight ferry company has announced it has gone bust after suddenly cancelling all its sailings.

Scoot Ferries earlier posted a message on its website saying it had received "some very unfestive news" and all services had been cancelled.
It has issued a statement saying it had to "suspend operations with immediate effect" after buyout talks failed.
Chief executive ZoÃ« Ombler said she was "devastated" by the news but was still hopeful the company could recover.
The statement said that David Meany of Ashtons Recovery LLP has been appointed as official receiver and will be applying for a Company Voluntary Arrangement with immediate effect.
Ms Ombler added: "I very much hope that this is not the end for Scoot and believe there is an immediate opportunity to find the necessary investment to allow us to continue to operate."
Earlier in the day customers posting on social media asked the company for more information and complained they had booked journeys and were left waiting.
The firm started running services between Yarmouth and Lymington, as well as Portsmouth and Cowes, earlier this year.
Matt Green posted on Facebook: "Stuck waiting in Portsmouth with absolutely no info until a kind member of the public directed me to this update.
"Why no info at the waiting area for all the stranded passengers? Unacceptable really. How do we get refunds for the cancelled trips?"
Anna Pocock said: "We only booked a ticket at 10.45 this morning and there was no warning on the website. Turned up at Cowes jetty to find no boat and no news."
Ollie Phillips posted on Twitter: "My wife's birthday surprise is ruined this evening. Please refund my money immediately."
Others offered their support to the company, including Richard Walters who said on Facebook: "I hope that you are able to sort things out."
Ferry services to and from the island are also run by Hovertravel, Red Funnel and Wightlink.
