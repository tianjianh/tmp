[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough chair of governors jailed for indecent images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former school governor who had hundreds of indecent images of children, some as young as three, has been jailed for two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Brown, 61, of Montague Road, Peterborough, had claimed a burglar planted the material on his computer.
Brown, who was chair of governors at Peterborough's King's School before his arrest in 2015, was found guilty of six charges relating to images of children.
He was jailed at Peterborough Crown Court earlier.
Brown was caught after reporting the theft of various devices and phones from his home in October 2015.

He told officers had received a blackmail letter from the thief saying there were indecent images on the items, and demanding Â£8,000 for his silence.
Brown denied any knowledge of them, saying the burglar must have placed the images on his devices in order to blackmail him.
However, when police recovered his phones and memory sticks, forensic analysis uncovered more than 700 indecent images, 170 of which were graded category A - the most severe - which pre-dated the break-in.
Brown was charged with a number of offences and was found guilty of three counts of possessing indecent images of a child, two counts of making indecent images of a child and one count of possessing prohibited images of a child.
Det Sgt James Weston, of Cambridgeshire Police, described the case as "complicated" because of Brown's "position of trust... and his denial throughout the investigation regarding the possession of indecent images of children".
He was jailed for two years, placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years and made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years.
