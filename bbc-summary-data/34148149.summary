[SN]TITLE[SN]
Talks due on devolution funding deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's finance secretary is to meet a key Westminster counterpart to try to reach an agreement on a new funding deal for Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fresh settlement is needed as additional powers over tax and welfare are being devolved.
Greg Hands, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has travelled to Edinburgh for the meeting with Finance Secretary John Swinney.
Both sides have said they are hoping for a positive outcome from the talks.
They need to agree a fiscal framework for the devolution of new tax and welfare powers contained in the Scotland Bill.
The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she would only back the bill if the funding deal is fair.
With new tax powers, there is a risk Scotland could find itself worse off, with the Treasury cutting the block grant by more than is raised.
The Treasury has said this will be the biggest transfer of powers to date and they are determined to deliver a fair and lasting settlement for the people of Scotland.
