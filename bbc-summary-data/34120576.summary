The 2015 summer transfer window was as dramatic as any.
BBC Sport takes a look at some of the stories of the summer - and retells them in road signs.
Follow the escape lane previously used by Otamendi, Pedro, Ramos and pick another club. Manchester United is not your summer destination. The Reds were unsuccessful in a number of transfer bids this summer.
Fans of New York FC must be hoping the club's decision to sign Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo does not backfire. The former joined from Chelsea, aged 37, while Pirlo, 36, was signed from Juventus.
'Get out of the way Manchester United, Chelsea are coming through. The Reds may rue allowing Chelsea to overtake them in the pursuit of Barcelona forward Pedro.
Aston Villa fans probably weren't best pleased by Fabian Delph's U-turn over his decision to turn down Manchester City and stay at Villa Park. The England midfielder declared his loyalty to the Midlands club before changing his mind and moving to the Etihad.
Watford have made 15 summer signings and Notts County have made 19, so there may be a queue to get in the first team.
Several clubs - including West Brom, Southampton and Everton - held firm to fend off significant interest in players.
Beware falling out with your club, it could come back to haunt you. Saido Berahino has suggested he might not play for West Brom again under chairman Jeremy Peace, after the Baggies turned down a fourth bid for him from Tottenham. Could be a boring few months for Saido then...
Everton fans will be breathing a sigh of relief now the transfer window has closed as the Toffees held their nerve to keep Chelsea away from England defender John Stones. (Submitted by Tom Arnold)
