Stuart Cullen, 52, from the Lowestoft area, is believed to have died instantly during Friday's attack on a beach near Sousse, by a gunman with links to Islamic State extremists.
Mr Cullen was with his wife, who was injured but has now returned home, Suffolk Police said.
The couple have one grown-up daughter, police said.
Lowestoft mayor Stephen Ardley, who was holidaying in Sousse last week, said his thoughts were with Mr Cullen's family.
"My heartfelt sympathy goes out to not only the Cullen family, but to all the families and friends that have been affected by this devastating act of cruelty.
"I was walking along that very same beach eight days earlier. The wife and I used to go for a walk on it every morning, so it really brings it home," he said.
A total of 38 people were killed in the attack and at least 36 people were injured.
One of those who remains in hospital in Tunisia is Allison Heathcote, from Felixstowe.
She was critically injured in the shooting and is currently in an induced coma in a Sousse hospital, her brother Simon Boon.
His sister was shot twice and had undergone six hours of surgery to have her shoulder rebuilt, Mr Boon said.
He told the BBC the family had "received very little information from the Foreign Office" and had had to "source information" themselves.
Mrs Heathcote's husband is still unaccounted for.
About 3,500 British tourists have flown home from Tunisia since the attack.
