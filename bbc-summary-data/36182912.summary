The race started at Belfast City Hall and finished at Ormeau Park. The route took in streets in the north, south, east and west of the city.
Kenyan Joel Kipsang Kositany earned his third Belfast Marathon victory as he won the men's race.
Other events included a team relay race, a marathon walk, a wheelchair marathon and a fun-run.
Kositany broke clear in the closing stages to finish ahead of compatriot Eric Koech, with a time of two hours, 17 minutes and 39 seconds.
Dan Tanui completed an all-Kenyan podium as he finished third.
Kilkeel athlete Laura Graham was second behind Ethiopian Berhan Gebremichael in the women's race, eight days after running the London Marathon.

Louise James, who lost five family members in a drowning tragedy in Buncrana, County Donegal, in March was among those taking part in the marathon.
Davitt Walsh, who rescued her baby daughter Rionaghac-Ann in the incident, also participated.
Ms James expressed her pride that more than 100 people had run in memory of her eight-year-old son Evan.
"I want to thank every single person who took part to remember Evan, whether you ran the race or have put your hand in your pocket to donate," she said.
"You did something remarkable in his name and to celebrate his life. I know he would be proud.
"It means so much that people who knew Evan and my family, and many who didn't, have come together like this."
About 2,700 people entered for the full marathon, alongside 1,800 relay teams with five runners in each team.
