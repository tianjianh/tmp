Adventurer breaks the record for occupying Rockall

A Scots adventurer has broken the record for occupying the remote Atlantic rock Rockall.

Adventurer Nick Hancock has survived on the rock for 43 days, beating the previous record held by three Greenpeace campaigners who lived there for 42 days.
He has already beaten the previous solo record of 40 days set by veteran Tom McClean in 1985.
Above the sea, the tiny rock is only 100ft (30m) wide and 70ft (21m) high.
He celebrated achieving the solo record by popping a small bottle of champagne while also sending a tweet with a message to veteran adventurer Tom McClean, of Morar in the west Highlands.
Tom held the solo record for 29 years and Nick's message was simply: "Sorry Tom."
Mr McClean's wife, Jill, responded to the message saying: "Tom is busy at present planning his ventures and has asked me to say 'well done' to Nick and to tell him to keep up the good work!"
Cruise boat operator Kilda Cruises says expected favourable weather conditions at the weekend mean it now plans to take Mr Hancock off the rock on Saturday.
Last year, the adventurer was forced to abandon an attempt to break the record as heavy seas with swells as high as 26ft (8m) prevented him from landing on Rockhall.
After abandoning the bid, he made the long boat trip back to Leverburgh on Harris.
Rockall, an eroded volcano, lies 260 miles (418km) west of the Western Isles.
