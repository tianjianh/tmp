[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 40 Texel hogs with either a red or orange shoulder and white faces were taken from the land at Awhirk near Stranraer.
The sheep - estimated to be worth Â£3,000 - are thought to have been taken between 30 September and 25 October.
PC Elinor Sneddon asked for anyone with information about the incident to contact police.
"We want to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area around the B7042 road between Portpatrick and Sandhead over this period, or indeed any other rural location in the Stranraer area," she said.
"A vehicle must have been used and we are keen to hear about any suspicious vehicle movements over this time."
