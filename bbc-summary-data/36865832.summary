[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny McCallum and James Docherty kicked and beat John Hutchinson during the assault on Christmas Eve 2014.
The pair, from Larkhall, South Lanarkshire, denied attempted murder but were jailed for seven years each.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge John Morris told them: "You have been convicted of an extremely serious offence."
McCallum, 22, and Docherty, 21, had been found guilty at a trial at the High Court in Paisley earlier this month.
The trial heard the pair chased Mr Hutchinson in two cars before trapping him under one in Strathaven, South Lanarkshire.
Together with others, they then kicked and beat him with a wheel brace, leaving him with a head injury.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Geoffrey Forbes, defending McCallum, said he was a qualified mechanic who worked for his family business.
He said there was "genuine regret and remorse" on the part of his client.
Owen Mullan, representing Docherty, told the court: "He appreciates he is where he is and has to deal with matters".
