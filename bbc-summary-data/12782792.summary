Court rules Ian Bailey to be extradited over death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British man faces extradition to France for questioning over the murder of a film-maker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former journalist, Ian Bailey, 53, is wanted by authorities in Paris over the killing of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, 39, who was beaten to death in west Cork in 1996.
On Friday a judge in Dublin's High Court ruled he would make an order for Mr Bailey's surrender to authorities in France.
He denies any involvement in her death.
Mr Bailey was arrested twice by gardai in connection with the murder investigation but he was never charged.
Ms Toscan du Plantier was found dead outside her holiday home at Toormore, near Schull, two days before Christmas 1996.
Under French law, authorities can investigate the suspicious death of a citizen abroad but cannot compel witnesses to go to Paris for questioning.
Investigating magistrate Patrick Gachon was appointed by officials in Paris to conduct an inquiry into Ms Toscan du Plantier's violent death after the Director of Public Prosecutions in Ireland announced nobody would be charged.
A European arrest warrant was issued for Mr Bailey.
During a two-day hearing in December 2010 barrister Martin Giblin, senior counsel for Mr Bailey, argued there has been no new evidence against him to support an extradition.
He also maintained the application was an insult to the Irish state and the DPP, who has repeatedly directed that no prosecution be taken.
Manchester-born Mr Bailey, a recent law graduate, lives in Schull with his partner.
He worked as a journalist in Gloucester and Cheltenham before moving to Ireland in 1991.
