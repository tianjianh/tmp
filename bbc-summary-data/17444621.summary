A part-time nursery place for a child under two in Jersey costs parents £2.13 more per hour than in the UK, according to the latest figures.

The average cost of a 25-hours-a-week UK nursery place for a child under two years old is £5,103.
A survey by the Jersey Childcare Trust found the same care in the island costs £7,816.
Last year the States doubled child care tax relief for parents with children aged under three.
At the time, Treasury Minister Senator Philip Ozouf told BBC News: "We are conscious many families have been feeling the pinch."
He added: "This is the biggest targeted improvement in taxation for families with young children the island has ever had."
But Fiona Vacher, the chief executive of the Jersey Childcare Trust, said despite the help from tax relief some parents say nursery costs are like paying for a second mortgage.
She said staff moving to Jersey should get more information about the cost of living in Jersey before they arrive.
She said: "We do see cases, particularly of social workers and nurses, who have come to the island with expectations of how much things will cost, probably basing this on their experience in the UK.
"They see the salary they will be earning here and are really not seeking out the information before they actually come.
"When the reality hits it's not a very good picture."
