County Championship: Rain washes out day four between Hampshire and Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset had to settle for their seventh draw in eight Championship games this season after the final day against Hampshire was washed out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With persistent rain falling, umpires Stephen Gale and Peter Hartley decided to abandon play at 15:10 BST.
Hampshire were 173-4 overnight, requiring 82 to avoid an innings loss.
They remain bottom of Division One, 14 points behind Surrey with a game in hand, while Somerset stay sixth - but only three points off second.
