Ysgol Brynhyfryd parents take legal action as free taxis cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents are taking legal action against a council following its decision to cut free school transport in a rural area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A judicial review has been launched after free taxis for pupils living 12 miles (19km) from Ysgol Brynhyfryd, Denbighshire, were stopped.
Parents claim their children's route to the bus stop is too dangerous to walk.
But a Denbighshire council spokeswoman said the policy was agreed after "extensive consultation" and through a "democratic process".
Glenda Coleman, who lives in Bryneglwys, said: "We've relied heavily on the free taxi because our children cannot walk to the bus pick up point as it is extremely dangerous.
"The council made a decision to cut this service without providing any alternatives or considering the repercussions of removing it."
Ms Coleman said it was "impossible" to drive down a nearby hill when it has snowed or there is ice on the road, meaning parents would not be able to transport their children to the bus stop, two-and-a-half-miles away.
She added: "We feel we are being punished by the council for living in a rural area as we have been provided with no alternative options for transport and it is unacceptable."
A spokeswoman for the council said: "Denbighshire's school transport policy has recently changed.
"We are aware that a small number of parents have raised concerns regarding these changes and their perceived impact.
"The policy was agreed after extensive consultation and it has gone through a democratic process.
"We have investigated complaints thoroughly and it is the right of individuals to consider taking the matter to judicial review, for which we would respond accordingly."
