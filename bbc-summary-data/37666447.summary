[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leganes 2-3 Sevilla

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri scored his second goal in four games as Sevilla briefly moved top of La Liga after winning at Leganes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nasri, on a season-long loan from Pep Guardiola's side, struck from close range to double Sevilla's lead after Franco Vazquez opened the scoring.
Two goals in three minutes from David Timor and Alexander Szymanowski brought the hosts level.
However,  Pablo Sarabia curled in a stunning late winner for Sevilla.
The win was Sevilla's first away from home in La Liga in 23 games and took them to the top of the table before Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid both won later in the day to reclaim the top two places.
