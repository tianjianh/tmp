The Port Tunnel in Dublin has re-opened following a morning rush hour truck fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dublin Fire Brigade said a truck heading north caught fire shortly after 07:00 local time, closing the tunnel in both directions.
AA Roadwatch said the closure of the tunnel had resulted in serious traffic disruption in the capital.
Irish police lifted the traffic cordon in the city centre for a time to allow HGVs through the city centre.
