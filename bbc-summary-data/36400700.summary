British javelin record holder Goldie Sayers admitted she had considered not competing because of doping allegations facing Russian athletes.
But Murdoch said: "Nobody's going to stop me going to these games."
Renwick added: "I have faith in Anti-Doping that they will catch these guys and sooner rather than later."
Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition after the allegations of state-organised doping, but the country's sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, wants it lifted.
Renwick has featured in every major Olympic or world championship since 2007 and is hopeful of a medal after winning relay gold at last year's world championships and this year's European finals.
"I think everyone in sport, and the general public, is aware of what's going on in Russia and countries that have a more relaxed view of doping than they should," said the 27-year-old, one of 24 Scots already confirmed for the GB Olympic and Paralympic teams.
"I think it is absolutely terrible. I like to think that every athlete that's competing in the games is there because they are a clean athlete and they want to give the best of their ability.
"Until I'm proven wrong then that's what I'm going to assume.
"I don't think that having a cynical point of view is going to benefit me. It is only going to make me bitter going into the Games."
Murdoch, who will compete for GB in the individual 100m breaststroke in Brazil, said he was not about to miss an event he has "worked so hard since I was eight years old" to be part of.
"Doping is absolutely rife in all sports and we, as clean athletes, can only get in the pool and train harder," said the 22-year-old.
"At the minute, that's none of my business. You're clean and you're innocent until proven guilty.
"All I can do is turn up every day and make sure that I am 100% every day so that, when it comes down to it, it doesn't matter what they take."
Murdoch missed out on selection for his preferred 200m distance after finishing third at the British trials but went on to claim gold at the European championships.
"It is only two entries per nation and they already have two," he added.
"I am a little bit disappointed because I feel like it is my better event, but at the minute I can only focus on what I'm doing."
