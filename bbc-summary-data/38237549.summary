The 28-year-old joined Ulster in 2014 from Super Rugby franchise The Sharks and he has made 42 appearances.
"My wife and I are settled in Belfast and our son was born here, so it is a special place for us," said Herbst.
"I'm looking forward to competing with the guys for the starting number 3 jersey over the next few years."
The South African added: "I truly believe that the squad is really starting to develop, with improving depth across most positions."
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss believes Herbst will continue to be a key player for the Pro12 team.
"Wiehahn is a great bloke and I'm delighted that he's agreed to stay on with us for another couple of years," he said.
"He is still relatively young for a prop and we fully expect that his best years are still ahead of him. I have no doubt that he will continue to be an important player for us.
"He is very powerful in the set piece and this has been a huge weapon for us since his arrival. His work ethic is first class and he is committed to developing his game, while also ensuring that others are too."
