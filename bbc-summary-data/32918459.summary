Michael Davies, 71, had been staying at a hotel with his wife Pat at the holiday resort when he disappeared in the early hours of Wednesday.
The couple, from Blaina, Blaenau Gwent, travelled to Sandown on the island by coach, Hampshire Constabulary said.
Police confirmed the search is continuing across the island.
A spokesman said: "A police helicopter was used last night and the search is continuing today right across the island."
Mr Davies, who suffers from high blood pressure, has not been seen since about 01:00 BST on Wednesday.
The force said Mr Davies wandered off after dinner at the Hotel Maria in Sandown at 21:30 and CCTV images later show him less than half a mile inland from the seaside hotel.
Neighbours of the former miner say he is well-known and well-liked.
Gwyneth Knight said: "Everyone here is very upset and worried about what has happened. He's a very kind and friendly man, he'll do anything for you. It's such as shame."
Police said the pensioner's family were worried because Mr Davies relies on medication to control his blood pressure, which he would not have access to.
He is described as white with cropped white hair and was wearing a blue T-shirt, a blue Reebok jumper, jeans and a baseball cap.
