The incident happened in the Aldi store on Gilmerton Road at about 17:30 on Sunday 5 March 2017.
Two members of staff were threatened, pushed and racially abused.
The first man is in his mid-20s, about 5ft 4in, of chubby build, with brown hair and bright blue eyes and was wearing a dark blue Adidas sweatshirt.
The second man is in his mid-20s, about 5ft 9in, of slim build, with black hair and a black beard, and he was wearing a black hoodie and black trousers.
The third man is in his mid-20s, about 5ft 5in, of slim build and with black hair. He was wearing a black Nike hoodie with white stripes on the sleeves and dark trousers.
Police Constable Heather Storer, of police Scotland, said: "This was a distressing and offensive incident for the employees of the store who were simply doing their job.
"We believe the males in the images may be able to help with our investigation and we would urge them or anyone who recognises them to come forward as soon as possible."
