Stephen Longfellow, from Leeds, was last seen on Sunday when he spoke with walkers in Llanfihangel y Pennant, Gwynedd.
Police found his car close to the Tryfan mountain and are concentrating their search there.
The hunt will cover areas with crevices, dips and gullies for as long as there is light on Friday.
Mr Longfellow's family have travelled to Snowdonia and are being supported by officers.
North Wales Police said he had indicated he intended to go walking at Tryfan or the Snowdon Horseshoe route.
His family alerted police when Mr Longfellow failed to return home on Thursday.
Sgt Andy Davies said: "We are increasingly concerned for his welfare."
