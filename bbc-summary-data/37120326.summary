Sunday's event at Rio's Maracana stadium will see Britain's sports stars celebrate their largest ever haul of overseas medals.
Lancashire-based clothing manufacturer Simon Jersey has designed the athletes' red, white and blue outfits.
The quirky costumes are matched with shoes encrusted with flashing bulbs.
The Accrington-based designers said the USB-charged shoes were inspired by the carnival spirit of Rio de Janeiro.

The jacket will feature a "thank you" to Brazil, written in Portuguese, and a "hello" to Tokyo, the host nation of the next Olympic Games in 2020.
Liz Murphy, of Simon Jersey, said the theme of the costume was inspired by the "spirit of the Rio carnival".
She added: "This is a fantastic contract for us to win. We're the first uniform supplier to actually get this contract, it would normally go to a big high street retailer.
"A billion people are going to see this costume on Sunday night and that's really fantastic."
Brazil has planned an elaborate celebration for the closing ceremony, featuring a traditional street party carnival known as the CordÃ£o da Bola Preta.
And, just as Rio de Janeiro put in a guest appearance at the closing ceremony of London 2012, Tokyo will make a special eight-minute presentation.
