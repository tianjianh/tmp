[SN]TITLE[SN]
PCSO Peter Bunyan found guilty of misconduct charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A married police community support officer (PCSO) accused of using the criminal intelligence system "as a dating agency" while on duty has been found guilty of misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Bunyan, an officer with Devon and Cornwall Police, was found guilty of one count.
Jurors at Taunton Crown Court will resume their deliberations on 11 further charges on Monday.
Bunyan of Carharrack, near Camborne denies all allegations of misconduct.
Bunyan is alleged to have accessed highly sensitive police data to perform background checks on women and their former partners after so-called "welfare" visits to victims of crime.
The court was told he neglected his duties by turning his police radio down on shifts while having sex with women, including at a police neighbourhood office, as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to send "soft porn" pictures of herself on email to a police station.
Bunyan denies all counts of misconduct in a public office, taking place over a five-year period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west Cornwall.
He admits having sex with four women but said it was while he was off duty. He denies sex with a fifth woman.
The officer has been suspended from the force since his arrest in 2011.
