The Mexican, 24, joins Franco-Swiss Romain Grosjean in the team, which is based in Kannapolis, North Carolina and will make their debut in 2016.
Gutierrez was named at a Haas event in Mexico City on Friday evening.
The announcement, considered F1's worst-kept secret, was streamed on the websites of Gutierrez's long-term sponsors.
Talking about the sort of driver Haas were after, team principal Gunther Steiner said earlier this month: "Someone who has driven an F1 car, of the current generation, money is always important, because it costs a lot of money, and North America is a nice place for a driver to come from."
Gutierrez has been Ferrari reserve driver since losing his seat at the Swiss Sauber team at the end of last season.
Haas have strong links with Ferrari. They are using Ferrari engines, will buy as many parts for their car from the Italian team as possible and their 2016 challenger has been designed in Ferrari's windtunnel.
Gutierrez raced for Sauber for two seasons in 2013 and 2014, scoring a best result of seventh place.
He comes with significant financial backing from Mexico.
