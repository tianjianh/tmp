Firefighters took almost five hours to pull the animal from the 7ft (2m) ditch in Heydon, Cambridgeshire, at about 18:30 BST on Monday.
The donkey's head was just above the water and crews had to pump it out and call in a digger to help clear the area before winching the animal out.
The "exhausted" and slightly bruised donkey, called Noah, was returned safely to its owner.
Two crews from Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service used specialist large animal rescue gear to lift the donkey to safety and leave it in the hands of a vet.
"The donkey was rescued uninjured but exhausted after nearly five hours. Thanks to everyone who came to help our crews," crew commander Jeff Whitlam said.
"We'd like to thank everyone who came to help, particularly the machine driver and veterinary staff for all their great work and support."
It was a "long and difficult rescue and a great team effort... with a happy ending", he added.
Noah's owner has since contacted the fire service to say the donkey has been seen again by a vet who "confirmed he was just knocked and sore but nothing was broken or badly damaged".
It is not known how Noah ended up in the drain.
