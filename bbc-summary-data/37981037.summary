Bill Dempsey resigns as Jersey director of professional rugby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bill Dempsey has resigned from his position as director of professional rugby at Championship club Jersey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dempsey only took up the role in May after eight years as chairman, during which time he led Jersey from amateur rugby union to the professional game.
The news comes just days after the Reds admitted financial problems.
Chairman Mark Morgan said: "To lose someone of Bill's great experience is a disappointing development for the club, but I respect his decision."
On Wednesday, Jersey announced that they were selling assets - such as the clubhouse and pitches - for Â£1.5m to survive.
Morgan added: "I would like to thank him for the major contribution he's made.
"I hope that he will still be a familiar and regular face at St Peter on matchdays and at other club events."
Jersey are eighth in the Championship table having lost five of this season's eight games.
