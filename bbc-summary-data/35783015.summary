Sony Music Entertainment UK will now put out future releases from the pair - whose full names are Joe Woolford and Jake Shakeshaft.
The duo's single You're Not Alone won the public vote on the BBC's Eurovision: You Decide show last month.
They will now perform the single at the grand final of the contest in Sweden in May.
Sony Music Commercial Group managing director Phil Savill said: "Joe and Jake are a fantastically talented pair of artists and You're Not Alone is an outstanding song.
"We are delighted to be working with the guys on making this year's UK Eurovision entry a huge international hit and launching the careers of this amazing act"
Joe And Jake said: "We are so excited to be signed by Sony. This whole experience has been a dream come true and we cannot wait to hit the stage at Eurovision.
The singers met after auditioning separately for BBC One's The Voice UK, both passing the blind auditions stage and being mentored by Rita Ora and Will.i.am.
Shakeshaft reached the battle rounds while Woolford made it to the live shows, the final stage of the contest.
"We were good friends on The Voice but once it was over we spent more time together and started working together a lot more," Shakeshaft told BBC Newsbeat last month.
The pair started recording music as a duo and recorded You're Not Alone, which went on to beat five other songs in a public vote to become the UK's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016.
