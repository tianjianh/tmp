The 25-year-old, who began his career at West Ham before spells at Oxford, Aldershot Town and Woking, has signed a two-year deal with the Reds.
"Josh is a combative, energetic midfielder," head coach Dermot Drummy told the club website.
"I know how keen he is to embrace a new challenge back in the Football League here at Crawley."
Payne is the League Two club's fourth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Jason Banton, Enzio Boldewijn and Glenn Morris.
