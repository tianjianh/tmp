Police received reports of young people setting pallets and rubbish on fire in the Lecky Road and Westland Street areas on Tuesday night.
Petrol bombs and missiles were thrown at police in the area.
Four teenage boys, one aged 14 and three aged 16, were arrested on suspicion of riotous behaviour.
They were later released on police bail pending further enquiries.
A 16-year-old boy was also arrested in the Collon Lane area on suspicion of disorderly behaviour.
He has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
Ch Insp Andy Lemon said: "The prompt actions of our officers prevented a reoccurrence of the disorder we saw the previous night.
"It is concerning to see teenagers, some as young as 14, getting caught up in this violence and I appeal to parents to make it their business to know where their children are and what they are doing.
"Young people need to listen to our message. You run the very real risk of being arrested and getting a criminal record which could affect your life for a very long time."
