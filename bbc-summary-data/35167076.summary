The Beverley Gate was where King Charles I was refused entry to Hull in 1642, sparking the English Civil War.
Of the 3,889 who took part, 90% voted to replace existing rails with a glass enclosure, the council said.
The authority wanted to cover up the site for its City of Culture 2017 plans but ruled it out after a petition and a public campaign against the idea.
More than 480 people had voted for the authority's second option to cover the entire site and create a public space, while only 27 had shown no preference, the council said.
Councillor Steven Bayes said the consultation had "not only sparked interest in the future of Beverley Gate but has raised awareness of its historical significance, which I believe is something that has been missing in recent years".
A planning application is expected to be submitted in the new year.
