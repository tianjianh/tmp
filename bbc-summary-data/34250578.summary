Ambulances will be diverted away from a failing Kent hospital's A&E after inspectors found it was putting patients at risk.

NHS England said ambulances heading to Medway Maritime Hospital will be diverted to others in Kent on Wednesday and Thursday morning.
This is to allow "breathing space" for the department and extra training.
An NHS spokesman said: "Ensuring the delivery of safe care to patients... is our absolute priority."
Between 07:00 and 12:00 BST ambulances will be sent to either Maidstone Hospital, Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, or the Kent and Canterbury Hospital.
However, some will continue to be sent to the Medway Maritime, in Gillingham, if the problem is either paediatric, cardiac or maternity related.
The decision was made after the latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection found the hospital could not cope with the number of patients during its busiest periods.
It was already in special measures after being rated inadequate in July 2013.
In a weekly message to staff, chief executive of Medway NHS Foundation Trust Lesley Dwyer said "simple and basic things" were not happening.
She also said: "The final CQC report will not be available for some weeks and this should not be a reason to 'wait' or 'stand still' - there is a lot to be done."
An NHS spokesman said: "Following a recent inspection of Medway Foundation Trust by the CQC the trust has asked for support from across the local healthcare system to help them in making the improvements needed."
