World number 15 Maguire went 9-5 down against Crucible debutant and fellow Scot McGill before levelling at 9-9.
However, world number 32 McGill hit 122 in the deciding frame to win 10-9.
Meanwhile, four-time world champion John Higgins beat Englishman and world number 17 Robert Milkins 10-5.
"I'm delighted to win on my debut at the Crucible," said McGill after victory over Maguire.
"I felt like I wasn't at the Crucible but like I was at home having a game at the club."
Higgins was 6-3 ahead overnight and looked poised to quickly secure victory after winning the first two frames in style.
Milkins hit back to narrow the gap to just three frames at 8-5, but world number 13 Higgins claimed the win with breaks of 69 and 106.
"I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good," said the Scot, who last won the tournament in 2011.
"That was the best I have felt for the last three years coming here. I know what it takes to win it, but I am not among the favourites."
Earlier in the day Higgins's fellow Scot Graeme Dott reached the second round with a 10-8 success over England's Ricky Walden.
Dott, who beat Peter Ebdon to win the 2006 final, looked in determined mood against the world number seven after coming through three tough qualifying rounds.
Walden, a three-time ranking event winner and 2013 Crucible semi-finalist, trailed 5-4 overnight but won three of the first four frames to lead 7-6.
Dott, the world number 19, showed all his battling qualities to go 9-7 up and edged through.
Meanwhile, world number four Neil Robertson was in imperious form as he established a 7-2 lead over Welsh qualifier Jamie Jones after their opening session.
Robertson, the 2010 winner, hit two centuries - including a brilliant 143 - on his way to a 6-0 lead.
A nervous Jones finally settled into the match to take the next two frames, but the Australian took the final frame of the session - an enthralling 36-minute tactical battle.
There was also a first-round win for Hong Kong's Marco Fu, who beat Englishman Jimmy Robertson 10-6, while 2013 runner-up Barry Hawkins hit six half-centuries and won five frames in a row to take a 7-2 lead over English compatriot Matthew Selt.
