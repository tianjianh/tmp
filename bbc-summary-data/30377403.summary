BBC London's Gareth Furby reports the best butlers - who provide special shopping services and specialise in "making things happen" as well as serving meals - can be paid more than Â£100,000-a-year.
"I think I'm pretty super, yeah," admits butler Mark Soar.
Andrew Coy of the British Butler Academy, trainee butlers Conor and Eric also appear in this report.
