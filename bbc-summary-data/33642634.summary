A private benefactor has contacted the BBC and offered to pay for the surgery of a man who described how he had been waiting in pain to see a consultant.

John O'Hagan, 75, had been told he would have to wait 18 months for an appointment at Musgrave Park Hospital.
On Wednesday he said he feared he might die before his appointment next year.
The benefactor said, after watching him talk about his pain and being unable to walk or play with his grandchildren, they wanted to reach out and help.
They added: "We have heard John's story on the BBC. Sadly, this is becoming an increasingly common and very regrettable situation for many people in Northern Ireland.
"We can't help everyone, but having heard John talk so touchingly about his difficulties, we are arranging to meet with him and will do our very best to offer him a more satisfactory resolution."
The pensioner and his family have expressed their gratitude to the benefactor but also expressed concern for other families in a similar position.
Mr O'Hagan told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that the offer of help was "totally unexpected" and would be "life-changing".
However, the pensioner, who reluctantly went to the media this week because he felt he had become a "burden" to his wife and family, said he was also embarrassed by his situation.
"I'm just very embarrassed by it all. There are a lot of other people out there who need help," Mr O'Hagan said.
His daughter, Lucy, said: "We're all a bit shocked and just incredibly appreciative, it's not what we expected or we hoped for. My father worked his whole life, six days a week.  When I was growing up I didn't see him, he was at work.
"He paid into the system that he thought would be there when he was older and that we'd get something back, and the system has failed him.
"We're all really thankful for everybody who has written in and we're still all a bit in shock and we don't know what to say," she added.
