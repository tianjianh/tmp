England head coach Mark Robinson says Sarah Taylor has had an "incredible year" after naming her in his squad for the World Cup, which starts in June.

Taylor took an indefinite break from cricket in May 2016 to help deal with anxiety problems.
The 28-year-old returned to England action for a one-day international against Ireland in Dubai in April.
"She'll have learned a lot about herself and faced up to a lot of battles," Robinson told BBC Sussex.
"She feels confident enough to put herself forward for selection. We've got a bit of time to go yet for her to keep doing what we call a graduated return and that's what she's done.
"She's managed to conquer most of her battles at the moment, so the medical team are confident enough, she's confident enough and she's ready to go."
Taylor has played in 101 one-day internationals for England, averaging 39.76 with the bat.
"Sarah's mental wellbeing and mental health is the most important thing, and that's the same for any cricketer," Robinson continued.
"What I do know with Sarah, and with you with me or with any of us, is if you're physically fit and mentally fit you can do a lot in our jobs and in our lives so we have to protect that side of Sarah.
"If she keeps ticking the right boxes and doing the right things to keep her mental health going and her physical fitness going, she's got every chance of having a really successful World Cup."
