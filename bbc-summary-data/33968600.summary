Andrew Considine: Drag video 'won't faze' Aberdeen defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen defender Andrew Considine has been backed to shrug off the publicity over a cross-dressing music video that has made the Scot an internet hit.

Recorded during the 28-year-old's stag party, he and his friends sing 70s disco hit "Yes Sir, I Can Boogie".
Former team-mate Jamie Langfield said: "It was meant for his wedding only for the people who went there.
"And it has come out and he'll be a bit sheepish about it. But he's the type who'll just take it on the chin."
Langfield admits he was shocked when he first viewed Considine in drag for the rendition of the Baccara song.
"Andrew's a very quiet lad in the changing-room," the goalkeeper who moved from the Dons to St Mirren this summer told BBC Scotland.
"He's very reserved and, when I first seen it, I thought 'that's a bit naughty, a bit risque' and a lot of people have said that as well.
"Probably manager Derek McInnes might have had a wee word with him today, but he will need to take it on the chin and will need to take the banter from the boys as well."
Langfield was famously transfer-listed by Aberdeen in 2007 after his own stag party took place while then manager Jimmy Calderwood was also in Majorca.
"Let's just say I'm not one who is going to complain about people doing stupid things on their stag do," said the 35-year-old.
"I went away with some friends and obviously the one person you don't want to bump into three days into a three-day bender is your manager.
"I didn't realise what had happened and I got back home and I was sitting in the house and I got a phone call from him."
Langfield, who stressed that there had been "no fighting" between himself and the manager, had been entering the final year of his contract.
"I was offered a new deal and I was going to sign it as soon as I came home from Magaluf," he recalled.
"And he just said to me that my behaviour wasn't becoming of an Aberdeen player and that the contract had been withdrawn and I was put on the transfer list.
"Me and Jimmy still get on really well. I accepted what he said to me. I have apologised for it profusely, but he said to me the only thing I could do is work hard and that's what I did.
"It was one of those stupid moments. I've had a few in my life, but that was probably the most stupid and I paid the price for it.
"I dug deep and he was true to his word and he gave me a chance again and I got back in five games into the league campaign."
Langfield revealed that Calderwood had called him back 20 minutes after he was transfer listed with better news from the Scotland manager ahead of an international match in the Faroe Islands.
"He said: 'just to let you know, you are going away with Scotland. Alex McLeish is just off the phone'," said the goalkeeper, who never went on to earn an international cap.
"I actually thought it was a wind-up."
