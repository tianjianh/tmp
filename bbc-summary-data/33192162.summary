Cheshire East Council scraps Macclesfield revamp plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Major proposals to redevelop Macclesfield town centre have been scrapped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire East Council said its agreement with Wilson Bowden Developments for the Silk Street scheme had been terminated "by mutual consent".
Anchor tenant Debenhams pulled out of the scheme in March.
The council is now planning to develop a site just a third of the size of the original scheme.
The authority will offer two alternative areas for sale on Duke Street and Churchill Way, with the aim of developing only one of them. Both areas were part of the original Silk Street scheme.
It is hoped a planning application for a leisure-led scheme will be submitted this year with construction beginning in 2016.
Officials have suggested a cinema, theatre or bowling alley may feature, as well as housing, restaurants and shops.
Leader of Cheshire East Council, Michael Jones, said: "This is a watershed moment for the realisation of a leisure regeneration scheme for Macclesfield town centre and signals a new era."
The original Â£90m Silk Street proposals were announced in 2005 and gained planning consent in 2013. They included a multiplex cinema, restaurants and shops, and were expected to deliver 1,300 jobs.
Mr Jones said the authority was "a year too late" with the old scheme, because of economic conditions.
The development agreement was terminated at no cost to the council but the authority could not tell the BBC how much money had been spent on the Silk Street plans.
Mr Jones said the council had "been very careful" and had exited the agreement "without damaging the reputation of Macclesfield".
Macclesfield-based chartered surveyor Nick Hynes, who has led a local "stakeholder panel" charged with advising the council, said the proposals were "extremely good for the town centre".
Beverley Moore, of campaign group Wake Up Macclesfield, which opposed the original plans said: "I am very happy that the ill-conceived plans are not coming to fruition and that we've now got a chance to get something that's right for the town."
