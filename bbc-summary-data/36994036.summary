[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brentford 2-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford summer signing John Egan struck twice inside eight second-half minutes to help his side claim their first three points of the season at home to Ipswich Town.

On his home debut, the ex-Gillingham defender powerfully headed in Lewis MacLeod's cross to break the deadlock.
He then fired home left-footed after goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski could only parry a low Nico Yennaris shot.
That secured Brentford's first home win against Ipswich since November 1955.
Against a side beaten at Huddersfield on the opening day, Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were made to rue the squandering of a hatful of first-half chances.
Last week's hat-trick debutant Grant Ward forced Bees keeper Daniel Bentley into a smart save with just two minutes gone before Conor Grant's superb curling free-kick flew narrowly past the upright.
Everton loanee Grant went close again on 21 minutes when he raced down the left and cut in from the byline to force Bentley to tip onto his post with a low drive.
But, after the interval, it was a different story as the unmarked Egan headed in at the far post before then slotting his second into the empty net.
Brentford manager Dean Smith is looking to ease an injury list that is not helped by Denmark striker Lasse Vibe being away at the Olympic Games.
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"Maybe 1-0 would have been a fairer reflection of the game but I'm not complaining. Ipswich are a good footballing outfit and we knew we had to compete, which we did.
"The goal gave us a lot of confidence and then after that we saw glimpses of what we can do. Scott Hogan worked tirelessly up front and the midfield chased everything.
"It will be good to strengthen the squad, by having Lasse Vibe back. Then I can take the Brazil and Nigerian flags off all my social media posts."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"I didn't see that being the scoreline at half-time. We gave the first goal away from a set piece and seemed to unravel after that. It didn't knock the stuffing out of us but it gave them a lift.
"And we looked like conceding another one which is unlike us. I don't like conceding goals from set pieces but I'm not sure what we do about it.
"People have jobs to do and, if they do them correctly, the ball doesn't end up in the back of the net. We mark man-for-man. There's no right or wrong way. Their first goal was far too simple."
