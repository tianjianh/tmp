Fishguard and District Round Table members are travelling to the broadcaster's birth place in Limerick in Ireland on Tuesday, before cycling home to Pembrokeshire.
Sir Terry died in January, aged 77.
He was life president of the charity and had hosted the annual telethon every year from its first appearance in 1980 to 2015.
A round table spokesman said of the fundraiser: "We felt this would be a great tribute to a man who has given so much to the Children in Need charity."
The group will cycle the 125 miles from Limerick to Rosslare Harbour over two days, before boarding the ferry back to Fishguard.
On the ferry they will use an exercise bike to cover the 55 miles (88 km) at sea.
