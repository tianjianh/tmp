The 21-year-old former Portugal Under-19 international was most recently playing in non-league with Northern Premier League side Tadcaster Albion.
He spent one season at Barnsley but did not feature and also played in the Slovenian top flight for NK Celje.
"He's done well while he's been with us. He's lively and gives us something different," said boss John Coleman.
