The 32-year-old joined Hull in 2012 and played 22 times last season as they were relegated to the Championship.
He faces competition for a starting spot at Leicester from first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, 30.
"I'm going to fight and I'm here to push. A healthy competition is always good and that's only a positive thing," Jakupovic told LCFC TV.
The Bosnia-born keeper has flown out to Hong Kong to join the Foxes squad for the Premier League Asia Trophy.
