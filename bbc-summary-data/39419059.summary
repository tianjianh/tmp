[SN]TITLE[SN]
Child 'flung by wrist' at Bright Sparks nursery, Taibach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student on a work placement at a Port Talbot nursery said she saw a child get "flung" by the wrist by a member of staff, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea Crown Court heard Bright Sparks in Taibach closed last year after concerns were raised.
Former owner Katie Davies, 32, employee Shelbie Forgan, 22, and assistant manager Christina Pinchess, 31, deny causing cruelty to a person under 16.
Sarochka Khadiri said she was upset by what she saw.
Ms Khadiri told the jury she had been on a work placement at Bright Sparks for about five months in 2015 as part of a health and social care course.
She said Ms Pinchess forced food into one child's mouth who was "crying and really distraught".
The court also heard Ms Pinches "flung" another child after picking them up by the wrist for not listening. The defence claim the child threw themselves on the floor in a tantrum.
Ms Khadiri said this behaviour happened "every time" during her placement, but she did not make a complaint to the nursery or her lecturers because she felt "scared" to speak out.
Bright Sparks opened in 2014 and catered for babies as well as children up to the age of eight.
The alleged offences are said to have taken place over a four-month period starting in late 2015.
Ms Davies, of Port Talbot, is accused of one count of causing cruelty to a person under the age of 16.
Pinchess, of Cwmavon, faces six charges of the same offence and Forgan, of Port Talbot, is accused of three counts of the charge.
The trial continues.
