Schools concerned over a rise in self-harming students

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh schools are struggling to deal with the number of students self-harming, two major teaching unions say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More students than ever are deliberately hurting themselves according to the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL).
In Wales, 1,542 10 to 19-year-olds were admitted to hospital after self-harming in 2013/14.
The Welsh government has been asked to comment.
The number of hospital admissions for 10 to 19-year-olds rose by 36% from 1,134 in 2012/13.
Caroline Kolek, a secondary school teacher and spokeswoman for the ATL said there was a lack of support in schools due to funding cuts: "My experience in schools and talking to colleagues is that we are seeing a rise in self harm, predominantly among girls but also among boys as well.
Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said the figures were "very worrying".
