[SN]TITLE[SN]
Firm of Bronington workman killed by car pleads guilty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trial centred on a workman who died after being hit by a car has halted after the company changed its plea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Ledward, 62, of Whitchurch, Shropshire, was killed in November 2011 while working for Arkenfield Stable Hire Ltd.
On Tuesday, the company, of Bronington, Wrexham county, pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules.
General manager Phillip Sutton, who denied a similar charge, has been found not guilty.
The court had heard Mr Ledward, a heavy goods vehicle mechanic, was one of three workmen helping an articulated truck to reverse into the company's yard at Boundary Garage on the A495.
Two colleagues were in the road trying to stop traffic and Mr Ledward was stood talking to the lorry driver when he was hit by an oncoming car. He died at the scene.
The court was told it was an "accident waiting to happen".
On the second day of the trial, the company admitted failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of employees by failing to ensure a safe system of work with vehicles.
Mr Sutton faced a similar charge which alleged he consented or connived with the company, or that the offence was attributable to his neglect.
But the prosecution, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), offered no evidence against him and he was found not guilty.
Judge Niclas Parry indicated he would sentence the company on Wednesday.
