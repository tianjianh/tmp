Swindon, 35 places above their hosts, were close to a first-half goal when home keeper Ryan Clarke clawed out Luke Norris' close-range header.
The small Hampshire club delighted 4,000 fans when Mikael Mandron deftly nodded in Jake Howells' free-kick.
But Clarke conceded a penalty, which Michael Doughty converted to equalise.
The National League side almost snatched a dramatic winner in injury-time when Ayo Obileye's shot was cleared off the line by Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill.
Ambitious Eastleigh had the honour of hosting the first televised FA Cup tie of the season, hoping to knock out Football League opposition in front of a BBC television audience, as Warrington and Salford had done in the previous two seasons.
So there was a party atmosphere as the home fans cheered a club who were playing in the ninth-tier Wessex League just 14 years ago.
The Silverlake Stadium went wild when France-born striker Mandron, who signed from Premier League side Sunderland in the summer, put them ahead after 64 minutes.

But then 34-year-old keeper Clarke brought down Doughty, who picked himself up to coolly drill in the bottom corner.
"The first goal should have been enough to win the game," said Eastleigh manager Ronnie Moore. "Then Clarkey had a rush of blood and it was a penalty.
"But we live to fight another day."
Clarke, who played for Oxford and AFC Wimbledon before becoming Ronnie Moore's first signing at Eastleigh, has only just returned to the side following the death of his father.
"Playing for 90 minutes is a release for me. He was a massive influence on my career," he said.
"It is tough but he would have wanted me to crack on and play with a smile on my face."
And Clarke produced the match's moment of outstanding quality with a save likened to England keeper Gordon Banks's acrobatic stop from Brazil legend Pele at the 1970 World Cup.
"That is a top save. I am thinking Gordon Banks," said BBC pundit Martin Keown. "How did Clarke get to that? Outstanding."
Clarke said he was "claiming it" as a save but there was a debate whether Norris' instinctive header had crossed the line or not.
Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville reckoned there was daylight between the ball and the goal. His colleagues Trevor Sinclair and Martin Keown disagreed.
So without the aid of goal-line technology - which is not used in the FA Cup - referee Oliver Langford and his assistants cannot be blamed for being uncertain the whole of the ball had crossed the line.
Judge for yourself....
