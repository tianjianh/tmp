Ross Monaghan, 35, was shot after dropping his child off at St George's Primary, Penilee, on Monday.
Police Scotland are also analysing photos and a video clip of the alleged attacker, taken by a member of the public minutes before the incident.
The images have been published by the Scottish Sun newspaper.
The man, who can be seen pushing a buggy near the school, was wearing a blue padded jacket, blue jeans, a dark woollen bobble hat and a woollen scarf pulled up around his face.
Police had said Mr Monaghan was shot in the back and he was treated in hospital for a shoulder injury, but later discharged.
The stray bullet was found lodged in a tree close to the school gates.
A force spokeswoman said: "Following further forensic searches carried out yesterday, a bullet has been recovered from a tree.
"Further ballistic and forensic examination will take place."
Mr Monaghan was acquitted of a gangland murder in 2012. He was cleared of killing Kevin "Gerbil" Carroll after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict him.
The alleged attacker is thought to have been in the area with the buggy three days before the attack.
Earlier detectives said they were trying to trace the buggy, described as a new collapsible model with four wheels and had a rain hood attached.
It is thought the gun was concealed in the buggy.
After the shooting, the gunman made off with the buggy down Hollybush Road and round the corner to where police said there may have been a car waiting for him.
Police said they would continue extra patrols in the Penilee area.
