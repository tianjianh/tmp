PC George Cooper, who worked for an armed unit which protects Parliament and politicians and PC Stephen Newbury were caught during an investigation into the 2012 "Plebgate" row.
The pair had more than 30 messages which were "racist and discriminatory in tone and content", the Met said.
The men were sacked following a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday.
The Met said it expected "the highest possible standards of behaviour".
The men were investigated by the force's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS).
PC Cooper, who worked for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Unit (SO6), was found to have 24 improper text messages, while PC Newbury, who was based in Lewisham, had eight.
PC Newbury was also found to have asked another officer to conduct a police computer check on his car for personal reasons, Scotland Yard said.
Deputy assistant commissioner Fiona Taylor, from the DPS, said: "The content of the text messages being exchanged between these officers was not only highly inappropriate and discriminatory but in direct contradiction of the values of the MPS.
"There is no place for officers who hold racist views in London's police service."
The force said both officers breached its standards in relation to authority, respect, courtesy, equality and confidentiality.
Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell resigned in 2012 after a row with police officers who would not let him cycle through the gates of No 10 Downing Street.
The Conservative MP admitted swearing during the incident but denied swearing at officers or calling them "plebs".
The incident also resulted in a police officer being convicted of misconduct in public office and the dismissal of a number of other officers.
