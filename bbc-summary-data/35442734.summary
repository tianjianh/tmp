[SN]TITLE[SN]
Patrick Murphy 'killed father after phone row'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man killed his father and wounded his brother in a row over a mobile phone charger, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Murphy, 30, admits he stabbed his father Joseph Murphy, 54, at their home in Hectorage Road, Tonbridge, in May, but denies murder.
Maidstone Crown Court jurors heard Mr Murphy had drunk three cans of super-strength lager before the incident.
They were also played a recording of the argument, recorded by a neighbour on her mobile phone.
In the recording Mr Murphy's mother, Sandra, first shouts ,"It's not stopping the blood, it's pouring out of the arteries", and then she shouts, "Patrick, put the knives down".
The court heard the recording was made by neighbour Clare Hurcombe who said she had had years of problems with the Murphy family.
Giving evidence, Ms Hurcombe told the court while Patrick had always been polite and friendly, his parents had not - and often shouted at Patrick "in a bullying and intimidating way".
She also told the court the Murphy family were "neighbours from hell" and on one occasion Mrs Murphy had threatened to have her beaten.
Prosecution lawyers told jurors Mr Murphy stormed out of the house after the row, exchanged the phone for cash, and then went to an off licence where he bought and drank several cans of strong lager, after which he bought three knives at a supermarket.
It is claimed Mr Murphy then returned home where there was another row when his father suffered a knife wound to the artery in his arm, and died an hour later.
Mr Murphy is also accused of wounding his brother, but denies causing GBH with intent.
The case continues.
