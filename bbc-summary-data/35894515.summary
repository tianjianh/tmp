[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumped deer heads prompt cheap venison warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decomposed heads of 19 deer have been found dumped in a field.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were discovered off Brampton Lane near to the A508 in Chapel Brampton, near Northampton.
Police said the heads, possibly from fallow deer, were found in various stages of decomposition suggesting they had been dumped over the past two months.
They have warned restaurants and pubs not to purchase cheap venison that could have been illegally gained by poachers.
Owners have been told they should always be able to provide a paper trail to show where their venison was sourced, if they are offering it on menus.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area, or who has recently been offered cheap venison, to contact them.
