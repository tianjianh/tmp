The Detained in Dubai group said the woman was arrested after she claimed she was raped by two British men.
It said she has been released on bail but her passport has been confiscated.
The Foreign Office said: "We are supporting a British woman in relation to this case and will remain in  contact with her family."
The woman, who is in her 20s, was reportedly attacked by two men from Birmingham while she was on holiday.
According to Detained in Dubai, the alleged attackers have had no charges filed against them.
However, according to newspaper reports, the two men have also had their passports confiscated.
It is understood that the Foreign Office is supporting the two men and is in contact with their families.
Detained in Dubai said the woman may face trial for the charges - for which possible punishments include imprisonment, deportation, flogging and even stoning to death.
Radha Stirling, founder and director of Detained in Dubai, said the UAE had a long history of penalising rape victims.
"We have been involved with several cases in the past where this has happened, and we work with the lawyers and families and have campaigned to change attitudes in the police and judiciary.
"Recent cases... show that it is still not safe for victims to report these crimes to the police without the risk of suffering a double punishment".
