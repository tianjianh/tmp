[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Adeyemi's second-half strike brought an end to relegated Rotherham's 17-game winless run as they beat mid-table Ipswich at the New York Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny Ward missed from the penalty spot early on, Rotherham's first of the season, as his attempt was turned away by Dean Gerken.
Rotherham took the lead with 11 minutes to go when Adeyemi volleyed home.
The result means they claimed a first victory since 14 January, when they beat Ipswich's bitter rivals Norwich.
The hosts became the last team in the EFL to be awarded a penalty this season when Jon Taylor was brought down in the box by Josh Emmanuel after just seven minutes, but Gerken did well to push away Ward's attempt from the spot.
Semi Ajayi and Richard Wood both went close for the hosts before Dominic Samuel hit the woodwork at the other end after Richard O'Donnell had palmed away a Danny Rowe effort.
Mick McCarthy's side dominated the second half with Brett Pitman's lob saved by O'Donnell and Rowe curling a 20-yard effort just wide.
But Adeyemi then volleyed the hosts in front from a corner and, having cleared Darnell Fisher's header off the line at the death, the Millers held on to claim a first win in 18 matches.
Rotherham boss Paul Warne: "It's a monkey off the back, I am in charge of this team, I am the one who took us down, so I want to finish the season on a high. To get to 21 points is a relief, I am happy about the win as I am the clean sheet. For us to get over the line, I am happy.
"It is nice to win a football match, it is nice to keep a clean sheet. We didn't have as much quality as the last few games so that just shows what football is about.
"I am really proud of how they kept a clean sheet and got over the finish line. They have got to believe in themselves more because they have more to give. As good as they were, and they have to be proud, but I am excited by the fact they have more to give."
Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy on his nine team changes: "I wasn't being disrespectful to Rotherham, I was being respectful to my team.
"And for the most part, it was even. I am annoyed we lost. The second half we were better and we have missed the chances. It shouldn't have got to that. I am a bit miffed.
"We didn't take our chances and they kept doing us on the break. We have managed to give a goal away."
