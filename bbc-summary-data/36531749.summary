The 28-year-old joined the Tykes for a third spell in November and scored nine goals in 34 competitions.
The former Liverpool trainee scored at Wembley as the Oakwell side won both the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and the League One play-off final.
"I'm absolutely delighted. I've listened to my heart," Hammill told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"The affinity that the fans have for me was one of the main reasons for staying.
"Taking that team spirit that we have here forward I am sure we will have a really impressive season."
The new deal will keep him at Oakwell until the summer of 2018.
