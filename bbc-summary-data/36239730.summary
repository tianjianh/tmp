[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Amir Khan says he has no regrets after his bid for the world middleweight title was ended with a sixth-round knockout by Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas.

Khan, a natural welterweight fighting beyond 147lbs for the first time, started well but was floored by a huge right hand from the defending champion.
The defeat was the 29-year-old's fourth of his 35-fight career.
"This challenge came and it was very hard to turn down," Khan said.
"I want to be the best, I want to fight the best and that's why I took this fight.
"I showed my bravery by getting in the ring with Canelo, but this is boxing. I wanted to go out there as a champion."
Khan jumped two weight divisions to challenge Mexican Alvarez and was bidding to become only the third former light-welterweight world champion to win a middleweight world title.
"I was unfortunate that I didn't make it to the end," he added. "I tried my best and I want to say thank you for the support, but I will probably go down to 147 now."
Alvarez, who has won 33 of his 47 career victories by a knockout, said patience was key to his victory.
"He was a very fast fighter and I knew things would be complicated at the beginning," he said. "But I knew the time would come in my favour.
"Many people talk about my power but I've got many more qualities in the ring. People see that and that's what happened in the ring.
"Someone who comes in to box obviously gives you more trouble.
"But someone who comes in to press and attack you gives you the opportunity for a nice fight."
