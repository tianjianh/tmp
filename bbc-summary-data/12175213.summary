The World War II devices were discovered when the vessel, the Sand Heron, discharged her load of sand at a Jarrow cement yard on Wednesday.
Police ordered an exclusion zone and the river between the Tyne Car Terminal and Howdon was closed to boats.
A controlled explosion has now been carried out and the river reopened, Northumbria Police confirmed.
