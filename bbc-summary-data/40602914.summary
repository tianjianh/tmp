Play was suspended for two hours because of lightning at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey and then eventually stopped for bad light.
That left 39 players having to complete their first round on Friday morning.
Korea's Amy Yang is five under, a shot ahead of Lydia Ko, with Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Georgia Hall at one under.
Former champion Michelle Wie has withdrawn from the event with a neck injury.
The American withdrew on the 11th hole, her second hole of the day, in a rainy start to the second round.
"Based on the short turnaround from last night's round to this morning, I haven't been able to recover enough to play to my full potential today, " Wie tweeted on Friday.
"I am confident with continued treatment, I will be at 100% by the Scottish and British Open."
Scotland's Catriona Matthew and England's Charley Hull are at level par, while Bronte Law is three over and Carly Booth six over.
Further storms are forecast for Friday.
