[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City Women maintained their unbeaten record in Women's Super League One and moved seven points clear at the top with victory at winless Reading.

Izzy Christiansen headed City into a first-half lead before England teammate Toni Duggan's superb 18-yard strike made it two with 10 minutes remaining.
Reading rallied and Lauren Bruton pulled one back from the spot after Nikita Parris brought down Emma Follis.
But it was too late to deny City a ninth win in 11 WSL 1 games this year.
Nick Cushing's side had 25 shots to Reading's seven and could have won by a bigger margin but Georgia Stanway hit the post after half-time and Scotland's Jane Ross dragged a shot wide.
Reading - who are still looking for their first win since promotion to the top flight but remain six points above the relegation zone - went closest early on when England's Demi Stokes blocked a shot from the Royals' Rachel Rowe.
City have played a game more than defending champions Chelsea, who lie second, but hold a nine-point advantage over third-placed Arsenal, with just five matches remaining.
Manchester City Women's Izzy Christiansen: "It's a very tough place to come with a great atmosphere, we are pleased to be coming away with the three points.
"A goal on my 50th appearance is a little landmark, but most importantly we won.
"We're feeling good. We've got a big squad with loads of fresh legs. Most importantly we're all fit, and everyone's in good shape."
Reading Women's Lauren Bruton: "We did exceptionally well. We kept them at bay for a good while. We stopped them playing through us, which was our game plan, and we frustrated them.
"When we did get the ball we broke on the counter and we did have chances, especially in the first half.
"They've got the quality to break us down, so when they have so many chances they're going to score at some point."
