[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Simon Salway, 39, of Hertfordshire Police, was convicted of six charges of misconduct at Luton Crown Court in January and jailed for three years.
After the dismissal hearing, Assistant Chief Constable Bill Jepshon said "corrupt" Salway abused his position.
He said the force was looking at seizing Salway's pension and trying to support his victims.
Salway was jailed following an investigation by the Hertfordshire Constabulary's professional standards unit.
Mr Jepshon said: "At a hearing at Bedfordshire Police HQ before Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, Simon Salway was officially dismissed from Hertfordshire Constabulary.
"His dismissal is a symbolic step in ridding the force of a corrupt officer who callously took advantage of the position of trust placed in him without any concern for the consequences of his conduct.
"As an organisation we will continue to support his victims in any way we can."
Salway, from North Hertfordshire, joined the force in 2003 and was based at Hatfield Police Station.
After winning the trust of the women, he flirted with them before sending them sexual messages, the court heard in January.
Judge Richard Foster told him: "Over a period of some seven years, you used females with whom you came into contact in such circumstances as an opportunity to pursue a sexual relationship.
"Domestic violence is one of the greatest unreported crimes and misconduct such as that in this case can hardly encourage victims to come forward to the police."
