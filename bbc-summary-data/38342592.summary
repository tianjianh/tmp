A report into the killing of Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne will be published next week, BBC Scotland understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy.
The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide.
A review in October found his death was "potentially avoidable". The full report was kept private. A heavily-redacted document is expected to be released.
Aberdeen City Council said the report was being finalised and would be published as soon as possible.
The full report was kept private because of legal and data protection issues.
The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations.
A strategy aimed at preventing knives and weapons getting into Aberdeen schools was approved last month.
Staff will be provided with clarity on the recording of incidents in schools, pupil searches and when and how to confiscate weapons, including knives.
Other actions approved by the council include providing professional learning opportunities to teachers in order that they can deliver anti-weapon and knife crime lessons.
