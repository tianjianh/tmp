Election 2015: Scottish party leaders continue campaigning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
General election campaigning is continuing during a week which is being dominated by manifesto launches.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson endorsed her party's UK manifesto.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were "talking up" the SNP's prospects.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld.
Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances.
She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax.
Ms Davidson added: "We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives.
"The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years."
However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were "putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price".
He added: "The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.
"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.
"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland."

Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Ms Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.
She said: "People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.
"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see."
The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.
In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.
In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.
Mr Murphy said: "The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a Â£7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.
"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.
"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need."
Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.
Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: "Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment."
Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.
Polling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons.
