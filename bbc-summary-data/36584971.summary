Glenmuckloch coal mine wind farm seeks approval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a wind farm next to a former opencast coal mine in Dumfries and Galloway are seeking approval.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project - which is part of wider proposals for an energy park - would see eight turbines erected at Glenmuckloch north of Kirkconnel.
Dumfries and Galloway Council has received 135 letters of support for the scheme and just two in opposition.
However, planning officials have said the development would have an adverse impact and have recommended refusal.
