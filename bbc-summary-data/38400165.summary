Rotherham United 1-2 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two quick first-half goals helped Burton edge past bottom side Rotherham and move five points clear of the Championship relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon McLaughlin made several smart stops before Chris O'Grady tapped in against his old club to put the Brewers ahead.
The Millers had been on top but fell further behind when John Brayford crossed for Jackson Irvine to head in.
Tom Adeyemi reacted fastest to a save to pull one back, but Rotherham lacked the quality to find an equaliser.
Relive Burton's victory at Rotherham as is happened
Defeat leaves the Yorkshire side, led by caretaker-boss Paul Warne, 10 points from safety, while Burton move up two places to 19th.
It was a first away triumph of the season for Nigel Clough's side while O'Grady's goal was his first in 389 days, as he was on hand to score after Lewis Price spilled a shot.
Burton full-back Brayford spent several minutes being treated after a head injury, but came back on to assist Irvine before being replaced at the interval.
Rotherham were chasing back-to-back Championship wins for the first time this season, but they have now conceded 52 league goals.
Darnell Fisher volleyed wide and Izzy Brown could not find the target from inside the area as the hosts pressed, in vain, for a point.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "We didn't play anywhere near as well as we did at Aston Villa on Boxing Day but we battled away for three points.
"It was tough coming here, we knew that they would have their tails up. We knew they would come out and cause us problems and they did.
"The only disappointment was that we conceded just before half-time and that gave them a chance, they put us under a lot of pressure in the second half.
"The timing in the year we didn't want to go into the new year without an away win. It is important psychologically to not be in the bottom three going into the new year."
Rotherham's caretaker boss Paul Warne: "We played really well. We were the better team and, with respect to Burton, I thought they came for a point.
"I love my lads but with the greatest of respect to them, they aren't used to playing against and having to break down two banks of four.
"Did they underachieve in the scoreline? Yes. But did they underachieve in the performance? No, I don't think they did.
"They are devastated, it will be tough to pick them up. But I don't believe we are relegated, I still think we have got a chance.
"If I didn't then I would tell the chairman to get a different caretaker in."
