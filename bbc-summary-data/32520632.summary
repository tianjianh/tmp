[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman set for trial over Falkirk 'toddler assault'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman is to stand trial accused of assaulting a toddler at a retail park in Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jodie Mitchell is accused of dragging the two-year-old girl along the ground at the Central Retail Park on 6 February, as well as seizing her by the head, lifting her from the ground and shaking her by the body.
The 26-year-old, of Selkirk, failed to appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
Her solicitor said she was "unwell", and entered a not guilty plea.
She also denies an alternative charge, which claims she behaved in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear and alarm by dragging the youngster along the ground, shouting and swearing at her and behaving in an aggressive manner.
Sheriff Christopher Shead continued the case for trial on 29 May.
