Mr Hickey complained of heart problems as he was arrested on Wednesday over the alleged illegal sale of tickets.
He has temporarily stepped down from his position as the Olympic Council of Ireland's president, although he denies the allegations.
Mr Hickey was dramatically arrested at his Rio hotel on Wednesday morning.
He was escorted off the premises wearing his dressing gown to face questions about his alleged role in a scheme to sell Olympic tickets for higher than their face value.
The Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) said on Thursday night that Mr Hickey had been "discharged from hospital" and "accompanied to a police station to complete a deposition".
The Republic of Ireland's sports minister has suggested there will be an independent inquiry into the scandal.
Speaking after arriving at Dublin Airport from Brazil on Thursday, Shane Ross said a decision will be taken on Friday regarding the nature of the inquiry, after he has discussed the issue with the Irish attorney general.
Mr Ross said that the situation had moved a long way since his meeting with Mr Hickey on Monday.
He said that then he was "absolutely shattered" by Mr Hickey's attitude.
He said they had felt all along that an independent inquiry was the most important thing to give it credibility.
Asked if the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) would accept that, the minister said that the OCI will not have any option, adding that were going to have an independent inquiry anyway.
But Mr Ross added that his department needed to be very sensitive and they will do nothing to prejudice what is happening in Rio de Janeiro.
William O'Brien, who has temporarily taken over from Mr Hickey as OCI president, visited his former boss in hospital.
Speaking to reporters outside Samaritano Hospital in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday night, Mr O'Brien said OCI officials had been granted "restricted access" during their visit.
He added that Mr Hickey did not discuss the allegations against him. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTE last week, Mr Hickey denied any wrongdoing in relation to ticket sales.
"He has made no comment because, as you can understand, he is having all sorts of tests inside," said Mr O'Brien.
The interim OCI president said he also could not comment on the ticket sales allegations "while the legal case is going on".
However, he did say the OCI would "defend ourselves to the hilt".
Asked if that included defending Mr Hickey too, Mr O'Brien replied: "Exactly, yes."
Mr Hickey was a senior member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as the top Olympic official in Ireland.
The 71-year-old temporarily stood down from all his roles following his arrest, but is now facing a call to resign.
Irish parliamentarian Noel Rock told the BBC that, before his arrest, Mr Hickey had "stonewalled" when he was questioned about the tickets scandal.
"He refused to answer straightforward, basic questions which were perfectly reasonable for the minister, who after all is responsible for the funding of the Olympic Council [of Ireland]," Mr Rock said.
