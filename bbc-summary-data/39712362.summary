The Movistar rider looked set to challenge the time of five minutes 57 seconds set by Trek-Segafredo's Italian rider Fabio Felline.
But the 28-year-old overshot the final corner and finished two seconds behind in second place.
Chris Froome played it safe in wet conditions on the 4.8km circuit around Aigle, finishing 29secs behind in 78th.
The Team Sky rider was in good company, with a number of other general classification contenders opting not to take risks.
Briton Simon Yates of Orica-Scott finished in a time of six minutes 15 seconds to take 25th place, one second and one place behind Irishman Nicolas Roche of BMC.
