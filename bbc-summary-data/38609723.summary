Gale force winds have brought down a number of trees on the Isle of Man and caused major disruption on the island's roads.

The Department of Infrastructure said its staff had been dealing with fallen trees at numerous locations, including one that fell on live power lines.
Winds of up to 53mph (85km/h) forced the cancellation of some flights as well as the overnight ferry to Heysham.
The Manx Met Office issued an amber weather warning for the whole island.
A spokesman said wintry showers remained possible in the strong to gale force winds.
The Isle of Man Fire and Rescue Service said it has dealt with two weather related incidents.
At 07:36 GMT, fire crews from Peel attended a collision at Ballacraine after high winds had caused a tree to fall on to a moving van.
Neither of the two occupants were seriously injured.
The fallen tree damaged overhead power cables, however, leading to loss of power to nearby houses.
Earlier crews from Douglas attended a car which had left the road and rolled 20m down a steep hill near Ballasalla.
