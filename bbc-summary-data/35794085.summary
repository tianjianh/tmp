[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old was confronted by specialist firearms officers on Bankfaulds Avenue in Kilbirnie.
Armed officers were called after locals reported smashed windows and a man waving a machete. Police Scotland said a crossbow was fired at them.
The injured man is being treated in hospital for injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening.
It is believed to be the first time officers have used their guns since the formation of Police Scotland.
Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: "A 24-year-old man has been shot by police following the alleged discharge of a crossbow at officers around 12:15.
"The man had earlier - around 05:30 - barricaded himself within a property in Bankfaulds Avenue, Kilbirnie, Ayrshire.
"He has been taken by ambulance to Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, for treatment. At this time it is not considered that his injuries are serious nor life threatening."
Mr Graham said the incident would be referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC).
He added: "No other people were injured in the incident which concluded at 12:20.
"Police are not seeking anyone else in connection with this incident. Inquiries are continuing."
