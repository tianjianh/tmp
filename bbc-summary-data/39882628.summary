When Hollywood heart-throb Chris Evans read a bedtime story on CBeebies, the mums seemed to enjoy it more than the toddlers it was aimed it.

The Captain America star read Even Superheroes Have Bad Days by Shelley Becker.
"Watching CBeebies even though the wee one is in bed...wonder why?!" tweeted Fiona Moore-McGrath.
And Lisa Prosser wrote: "Of course only watching this for my daughter... #HubbaHubba."
The actor appeared on the BBC children's TV channel on Wednesday - six weeks after an appearance by fellow actor Tom Hardy.
Many other mums - as well as those without children - took to Twitter to give their approval.
