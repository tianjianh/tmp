Wales women's back-rower Sioned Harries has challenged her side to repeat their friendly win against Ireland when they meet again in the Six Nations.

Wales beat reigning champions Ireland 15-5 at Ystrad Mynach on Sunday as preparation for this year's competition.
The two sides meet in their tournament opener at Donnybrook on Saturday, 6 January.
"We've got to go and re-do that out in Ireland," Harries told BBC Wales Sport.
"Going out to Ireland is just as tough as going anywhere away - it's one of the toughest places I've played."
Wales finished fifth in the 2015 Six Nations, fading badly after winning their opening two fixtures against world champions England and Scotland.
Ireland, by contrast, won four of their five games to clinch a second title in two years.
Harries hopes a repeat of Wales' friendly victory against Ireland could transform their fortunes.
She added: "If we go away and get the win, then I'm sure our mindset can change and the Six Nations will be up for grabs."
