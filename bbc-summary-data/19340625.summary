He posted two messages on the microblogging site saying he would not be sending any more updates.
The 19-year-old said: "The reason i don't tweet as much as i use to, is because I'm sick of all the useless opinions and hate that I get daily goodbye twitter.
"Fans that have something to say can tweet me on the one direction account."
Zayn Malik, from Bradford in West Yorkshire, is not the first celebrity to leave Twitter.
Nicki Minaj left the site in April after a row with a fan who posted snippets of her album online.
She returned to the microblogging site just over a week later.
Blue Peter host Helen Skelton deleted her Twitter account earlier this month saying she could not cope with the negative comments.
Miley Cyrus also deleted her Twitter account in 2009 before returning and actress Demi Lovato has not tweeted since 2009.
Users have 30 days to reactivate their accounts.
Zayn Malik had more than five million followers before he deleted his profile.
The rest of One Direction - Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson - all still have Twitter accounts.
The group finished third in the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010.
