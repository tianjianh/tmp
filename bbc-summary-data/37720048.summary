Barkley, 22, was left out of the Everton team for the first time under Dutchman Koeman as the Toffees drew 1-1 at Manchester City on Saturday.
Koeman said the decision was "tactical" as he wanted to field a side "with more pressing than normal".
But he added that he hoped Barkley's omission was "a good wake-up call".
"He is already playing four years in the first team. You are not any more a talent, that means you need to show you have improved," Koeman said.
"I still believe in his qualities, but if I am not totally happy or it is a tactical question, he does not start. His reaction was positive. He was very disappointed, which you need to be."
Barkley has made 119 Everton appearances since making his debut in August 2011, when he was 17.
But former Toffees team-mate Leon Osman has questioned his consistency this season and although he was in England's squad for Euro 2016 he has not been called up since.
Koeman said he expected his side to have "more possession than normal" in Saturday's 15:00 BST kick-off at Burnley, and suggested Barkley would return to the starting XI.
"[Against City] we played a little bit different than normal so I did not start with him, but that might change in the weekend," he said.
"You like to have the best team for the each game, and the weekend is a different game."
