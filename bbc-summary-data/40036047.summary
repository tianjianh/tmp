Crotone 3-1 Lazio

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crotone completed one of the greatest escapes Serie A has seen by beating Lazio on the final day to stay up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The minnows - in their first season in the top flight - picked up just two points from their opening 10 games and were eight points adrift of safety at the start of April.
But a run of six wins and two draws in their final nine games kept them up.
They would have gone down had Empoli won, but they lost 2-1 to Palermo to suffer relegation.
Crotone's chances before kick-off did not look good as they faced fifth-placed Lazio, but they were deserved winners.
Andrea Nalini and Diego Falcinelli - their only player to score more than four goals this season - gave them a 2-0 lead before Ciro Immobile pulled one back from a penalty.
But Bastos was sent off for Lazio and Nalini scored a second as Crotone celebrated one of the most famous days in their history.
