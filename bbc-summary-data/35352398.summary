Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profits, boosted by lower legal costs.

Bank of America said profits rose 10% compared with 2014, helped by a fall in expenses, including legal costs.
The bank, the second-biggest in the US by assets, said net income jumped to $3.01bn (Â£2.1bn), up from $2.74bn.
Morgan Stanley reported a $908m profit for the period, compared to a $1.6bn loss a year ago.
The bank cut costs to help offset weak performances in its fixed income, commodities and currencies division
Compensation at Morgan Stanley fell 27% in the fourth quarter to $3.7bn and the bank said it would continue to focus on managing expenses in 2016.
"A strong overall performance in the first half of the year was impacted by difficult market conditions in the second half that dampened trading activity," said Morgan Stanley chairman and chief executive James Gorman.
"In the fourth quarter, we took action to meaningfully restructure our fixed-income business on a capital and expense basis."
Similarly, Bank of America has cut costs in its commercial lending, investment banking and wealth management businesses to try and offset sluggish revenue growth.
"We increased net interest income [and] managed expenses tightly," Bank of American boss Brian Moynihan said in a statement.
Both banks' figures were in line with those reported last week by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase, where profits also rose helped by lower legal costs.
US banks in general have had a tough start to the year, with volatile global stocks, falling oil prices and slowing growth in China, leading to weak credit markets and putting pressure on revenues.
