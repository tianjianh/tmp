The fossil was discovered after it fell from a cliff face onto a beach near Whitby.
Scientists at the University of Manchester said it is probably about 176 million years old.
The fossil will go on display at the Yorkshire Museum from 8 June.
Sauropods were some of the largest plant-eating dinosaurs to have walked on Earth.
They had long necks and tails, small heads, a large body and walked on all fours.
Some species, such as the Argentinosaurus, grew up to 115ft long and possibly weighed as much as 80 tonnes.
