[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A beloved cat who became a familiar face at a train station after making himself at home there for 10 years is to have a permanent memorial.

Alfie, who lived at Rushden Transport Museum and Railway in Northamptonshire, died last month.
A crowdfunding page was set up to pay vet bills and money from other events will now be used to pay for a memorial.
A headstone and a bench with a plaque are planned to remember Alfie, the Northamptonshire Telegraph reported.

Alfie mysteriously turned up at volunteer-run Rushden Station about 10 years ago shortly after the previous station cat had died.
He made the station his home for a decade but when he contracted a virus in June, fans of the ginger tom rallied round to donate to a JustGiving page, raising more than Â£900.
After his death, fundraising events raised more money from "the best friends a cat could have", and volunteers have now confirmed they are arranging for a headstone to be made for Alfie.
They are also planning to install a bench and memorial plaque in a prominent position at the station.
