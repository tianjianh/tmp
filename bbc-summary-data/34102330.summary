[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes's proposed transfer to Turkish side Besiktas has collapsed.

A source close to Valdes said Besiktas attempted to change the terms of an agreed deal and the 33-year-old has now backed out of the move.
The Spain international has no future at Old Trafford after falling out with manager Louis van Gaal.
The transfer window in England and Scotland closes on Tuesday, but it is Monday in most European countries.
Ex-Barcelona player Valdes signed an 18-month deal with the Premier League side in January, but was not given a squad number for this season after Van Gaal claimed he refused to play in an Under-21 game.
Meanwhile, there has still been no bid from Spanish giants Real Madrid for David De Gea.
The La Liga club have been heavily linked with a move for the 24-year-old Spain international this summer, but are reluctant to meet United's demand of a world-record fee for a keeper.
Van Gaal says he will not pick the 24-year-old until the transfer window has closed.
The most ever paid for a goalkeeper is the Â£32.6m Juventus spent to sign Gianluigi Buffon from Parma in 2001.
