"Free debt advice is available now and will help support you in getting your finances back on track before your money worries become a bigger issue," said Sheila Wheeler, director of debt advice at the MAS.

While personal debt has been falling over the last few years, borrowing has been increasing.
Incomes are also being squeezed. Since April inflation has been higher than the growth in wages.
