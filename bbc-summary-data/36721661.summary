Rio 2016: Greg Rutherford may 'never fully recover' from inner ear problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greg Rutherford says he may never fully recover from an inner ear problem, but the attraction of winning medals means he will not miss the Olympics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Britain's Olympic long jump champion suffered whiplash at a Diamond League meeting in Birmingham last month.
Rutherford, 29, says there is a "one in four chance" he will not recover from his condition, called cochlear hydrops.
"I hope it won't affect my jumping," said the Englishman, who will compete at this week's European Championships.
He added: "If it wasn't Olympic year, I would quite possibly be taking some time out to get it sorted. But I like winning medals."
The Rio Olympics begin on 5 August.
