[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bosses at an A&E unit "overwhelmed" with patients on New Year's Eve have warned people only to attend with "life-threatening" conditions.

A spokeswoman for Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport said: "The situation is almost intolerable and that is still the case today."
The unit was full by 18:30 GMT on Saturday.
The hospital had seen 173 people by that time, more than they would usually expect on New Year's Eve.
The spokeswoman added: "As we were getting towards midnight the cases were still very high, they all needed to be admitted."
An earlier statement said the hospital had been "completely overwhelmed" and asked people only to attend in an "absolute emergency".
