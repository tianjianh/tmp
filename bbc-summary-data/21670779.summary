Among the assets seized were companies and holiday villages, the police say.
The raids were prompted by investigations begun in 2008 and centre on the 'Ndrangheta crime network and its activities in tourism.
Italian media reports say that Spaniards were among those arrested. The raids were made early on Tuesday morning.
Arrests were made on suspicion of offences including mafia activity and re-investment of illicit assets.
The police say their investigations revealed "an extensive and complex network of Italian and foreign companies" which enabled crime gangs to become involved in the ownership and development of "dozens" of real estate ventures and tourist resorts.
Some of the resorts were located in the coastal areas of the Calabria region - renowned for their beauty.
The businesses had forged links between the families of the 'Ndrangheta and "important Spanish entrepreneurs", the police say.
