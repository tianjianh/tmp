[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mendip stroke care pilot is rolled out across Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stroke care pilot scheme that has been running in Mendip for two years is to be rolled out across Somerset.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Early Supported Discharge allows stroke patients to recover at home with specialist therapists and nursing support on hand to help.
Head of the Mendip project, nurse Tracey Evans, said: "We have seen patients recovering more quickly and gaining independence much faster."
The project is open to willing patients who meet medical criteria.
The Stroke Association has welcomed the project which begins in September.
Sarah Miller, of the charity, said: "Nobody really wants to be in hospital so if people can get back to their own surroundings and start getting back to using the things they're familiar with they're going to make a better recovery.
"If somebody isn't safe to be left at home because their mobility isn't very good or they're not able to communicate very clearly, then it isn't for everybody, and some people do need to remain in hospital until they are ready to go home."
Stroke patient Patsy Angell has been recovering at home.
She said: "I've got loads of friends and family, and my family have been amazing for me.
"The nurses loved it so much because it was good for me because I wanted to be at home."
As a result of this pilot, Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group [CCG] saw the service reduce demand on inpatient stroke beds.
Once the project is rolled out, South Petherton's specialist stroke unit will focus on supporting those with complex stroke needs.
Overall, the number of community beds is being cut, earlier in the year 40 beds were permanently closed as the overall focus is on providing medical and social care in the home grows.
Seventeen beds are being kept in reserve to meet any spike in demand.
