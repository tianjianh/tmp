The family of a woman who was tortured to death by two teenage girls has called for a new law to protect vulnerable people.

Angela Wrightson was subjected to a brutal assault in her Hartlepool home by the girls,  then aged 13 and 14.
Speaking to ITV Tyne Tees, her niece Rachel Tresidder said the family wanted to bring in "Angie's Law".
The law would give more power to police and social services to intervene if a vulnerable person was being exploited.
Ms Wrightson, who was an alcoholic, sometimes invited young people into her home to drink and smoke.
Neighbours reported her sometimes becoming distressed if she felt they were trying to take advantage of her.
Angie's Law would work in a similar way to non-molestation orders currently issued in domestic violence cases to prevent contact between abusers and victims, Ms Wrighton's family said.
They have called for police and social services to be able to issue them on the spot when they see a vulnerable adult being harassed in their own home.
Ms Wrightson's two attackers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, subjected her to a brutal and degrading attack over a period of hours.
They were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 15 years.
Ms Tresidder described her aunt as "lovely" and "funny" and said the family had difficulty coming to terms with the nature of her death.
In a separate interview, the mother of one of the girls told with ITV Tyne Tees on Thursday that she had "begged for help" with her daughter.
