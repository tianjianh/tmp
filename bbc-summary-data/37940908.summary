Ferrari have asked the FIA to review its decision to penalise Sebastian Vettel in the Mexican Grand Prix.

Four-time world champion Vettel, 29, was given a 10-second penalty that dropped him from third to fifth.
Formula 1's governing body had said the German moved under braking as he tried to hold off a passing move from Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.
A Ferrari statement said "a number of new elements have come to light after the decision was rendered".
While Ferrari accepted that the result of the race on 30 October would not be altered, they want the decision to be "reconsidered" to determine what is classed as dangerous driving and "to provide clarity" over the rules.
Speaking at a news conference before this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo, Vettel said: "Obviously I don't agree with the decision that was made.
"I moved over to defend my position, I gave Daniel enough room on the inside and kept the car straight for more than the majority of the braking.
"Daniel locked up so bad because there was no grip on the inside. It looks worse than it was, I don't think it was dangerous, but I have to deal with the decision."
Vettel crossed the finish line fourth in Mexico but was promoted to third after Max Verstappen was giving a five-second penalty for cutting a corner of the track.
Vettel featured in the podium ceremony, before his penalty - received later that night - lifted Ricciardo to third and Verstappen to fourth.
"You don't want to wait so long after a race to have an outcome," said Australian Ricciardo, who described the penalty as the "right decision".
"When you're down the straight, if someone defends and moves one way you can move the other, but when you've committed to it, it's hard to pull out of the move."
Vettel is fourth in the drivers' championship on 187 points, 55 behind Ricciardo and 162 behind leader Nico Rosberg.
