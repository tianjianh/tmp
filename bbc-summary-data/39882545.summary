"Inseparable" five-week-old spring lamb Bella and one-year-old Border Collie Blake disappeared from a garden in Perlethorpe, Nottinghamshire, on Monday.
On Wednesday, tracker dogs picked up a scent in nearby woodland, as well as droppings believed to be Bella's.
The search is due to resume later.
It is thought Bella and Blake either escaped from the garden or were stolen.

Owner Natalie Haywood said their disappearance was a "massive shock" and is desperate for their safe return.
She has been "overwhelmed" by offers of help in her search for the pair.
She said the search dogs will be taken out again later to "pick up where they left off".
The family live near Clumber Park, which the pair might have entered after leaving the garden.
The disappearance of the two animals, which Ms Haywood said were "inseparable", led to a £1,000 reward being offered by ITV presenter Philip Schofield.
Hundreds of people have joined a Facebook group set up to find the pets and many have also joined the searches.
Ms Haywood said she was "in shock" at the level of support.
Five-week-old Bella, who was being bottle fed, was given to the family by a farmer neighbour more than a week ago and was paired with Blake after the loss of her mother.
Ms Haywood, who said she has lost sleep over the missing animals, fears there is a chance they might have been stolen.
"Bring them home, they're family pets, they're happy here."
Newark and Sherwood District Council, which has been looking into the disappearance, believe the pair might have escaped.
Anyone with any information has been asked to contact the authority's dog warden service.
