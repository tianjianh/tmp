Appeal fund for Cardiff WW1 memorial window restoration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been launched to raise money to refurbish one of the largest stained-glass windows in Wales honouring casualties from World War One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 1920s window at St Paul's Church in Grangetown, Cardiff, depicts air, sea and land battles alongside religious images and trench scenes.
The church says the masonry around the window must be replaced.
Repairs could cost tens of thousands of pounds.
