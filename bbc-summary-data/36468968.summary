Brownlee, 28, has been selected along with younger brother Jonathan, 26, and fellow Leeds triathlete Gordon Benson.
Alistair beat Spain's Javier Gomez and Jonathan to win gold at London 2012.
"I don't think we've all performed to the best of our abilities and if that happens in Rio the podium will be the same," he said.
Vicky Holland will look to build on her first World Series titles in Cape Town and Edmonton last year as she takes part in her second Olympics.
Leeds-based Holland, 30, is joined in the GB women's team by former world champions Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins.
"My move to Leeds has been the catalyst for things in my career and in Rio I've got far loftier ambitions than 26th place this time round," said Holland.
There is live BBC Two and online coverage of the latest World Series Triathlon event Leeds on Sunday, 12 June from 12:45 BST (16:00-18:00 in Northern Ireland).
