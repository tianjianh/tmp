If you're scared of heights then this definitely isn't the swimming pool for you.

This is the glass-bottomed pool at Market Square Tower, sitting 500 ft (152m) above the busy street in Houston, in the US.
Swimmers can step out onto the glass platform and soak up the exciting (or stomach-churning) view below.
Nervy visitors to the pool will be glad to hear there's eight inch (20cm) thick glass between your feet and the empty space to the ground below.
