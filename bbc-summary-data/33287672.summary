[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberpergwm Colliery, near Glynneath, which is owned by American company Walter Energy, opened a consultation on closure plans earlier in June.
Wayne Morgan, National Union of Mineworkers boss, said: "Over 60 people will lose their job".
About 300 workers lost their jobs in 2012 when the mine started what it called a shut down process.
Neath AM Gwenda Thomas said: "I am aware that the 30 day consultation period for the mine is soon coming to an end, and that there is a distinct possibility of job losses.
"I will continue to work with the unions and the Welsh government to help as much as I can with regards to the mine and its workforce."
