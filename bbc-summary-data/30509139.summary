The former Spice Girl missed Saturday's show due to ill-health.
But some viewers became concerned when she returned for Sunday's Wembley final without her wedding ring.
Others claimed bruising was visible on her face as well as scratches on her body.
Speaking to Newsbeat about the judge's absence, Ben Haenow said the acts were told that Mel B wouldn't be there earlier in the day.
"They said she was not well enough to come down and we know for sure that Mel would definitely want to be there if she could. So our hearts went out to her then."
When she returned for the live finals on Sunday, he says she seemed better.
"She looked fine. She looked good. She looked in good spirits. She looked OK.... I think she's definitely recovering."
When asked if he had noticed any bruising on the judge during Sunday's show, the 29-year-old said he didn't see anything unusual:  "No not from me. No I didn't see anything of that kind. I mean she looked fine when she was there."
There is still no comment from Mel B but her husband Stephen Belafonte has taken to Twitter to deny online accusations that he had hit her.
The couple married in secret in June 2007 in Las Vegas.
