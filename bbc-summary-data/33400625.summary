People who took to Twitter to mock a distressed woman who was being talked down from a bridge have been condemned by Surrey Police.

The force said the incident forced the closure of the M3 at Sunbury for two hours on Saturday.
Officers said they were contacted by people stuck in traffic asking them to "tell her to get on with it" and to "rubber bullet the jumper".
Insp Julie Hillman said the comments were "completely unacceptable".
Eventually the woman was talked down from the bridge and detained under the Mental Health Act.
Before that, one user wrote to Surrey Police: "Tell her to get on with it. Bloody ruining everyone's weekend. Sat in this for an hour and a half now."
Another tweeted: "Surrey police, can't you rubber bullet the jumper on M3/A316 and get the traffic moving? Or get net ready & charge her? Ridiculous."
Both accounts from which the comments were made have been deleted following a backlash by Twitter users.
Insp Hillman said: "Having members of the public taunt somebody who is clearly in a distressed state as we did earlier today is completely unacceptable.
"I hope the public understand why it was necessary for us to close the road as doing so helped save the woman's life."
