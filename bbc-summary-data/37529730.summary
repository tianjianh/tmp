[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal Ladies kept their Champions League qualification hopes alive with a big win at Women's Super League 1's bottom side Doncaster Rovers Belles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danielle Carter hooked in to give them an early lead, but it was not until midway through the second half that substitute Natalia Pablos made it 2-0.
Pablos added another, England striker Carter netted a fourth, before Kelly Smith's 25-yard lob completed the rout.
Arsenal are five points behind second-placed Chelsea with two games left.
Pedro Losa's Gunners side now host the Belles on 30 October, before travelling to Liverpool Ladies for their final league game on 6 November - the team finishing second joining champions Manchester City in Europe next season.
The visitors completely outclassed the Belles at the Keepmoat Stadium, with both of Spain forward Pablos' goals coming after flowing team moves.
Rhiannon Roberts came closest to scoring for Doncaster but her strike clipped the post.
The Yorkshire side have now lost all 12 of their league games and look certain to make an immediate return to WSL 2.
