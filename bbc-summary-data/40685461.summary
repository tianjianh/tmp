[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Gard's parents reacted angrily in court when medical information was revealed about their son which they had not previously been told about.

The High Court was told a scan of the baby's brain made for "sad reading". His mother responded: "We have not even read it" and her husband walked out.
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) wants to remove Charlie's life support.
Earlier, the judge urged protestors supporting the family not to target the hospital.
The 11-month-old suffers from a rare genetic disorder and underwent a brain scan at the weekend to help settle a medical dispute about whether his treatment should be continued or whether he should be allowed to die with dignity.
On hearing the hospital lawyer's assessment of the scan, Charlie's mother Connie Yates broke down in tears and his father Chris Gard shouted "evil" at the lawyer before walking out of court earlier.
Charlie's parents are fighting for the right to remove their child from GOSH's care. They want instead to take him to the US for experimental treatment, which a neurologist from New York said might give him a 10% chance of improving his health.
The case has attracted a lot of attention around the world and campaigners who want the judge to "let Charlie live" have lined the High Court entrance for the hearings.
Previously, the judge has condemned people who had abused and threatened GOSH medics on social media as a result of Charlie's case.
Mr Justice Francis, who is presiding, warned earlier there were "lots and lots" of other sick children being treated by the hospital whose families might not want to be confronted by campaigners.
GOSH has confirmed it received complaints from family members of other children being treated at the hospital, but would not provide further details.
Mr Justice Francis will analyse the latest expert evidence at a High Court hearing on Monday and Tuesday.
At a preliminary hearing on Friday, he said he would need to know whether there was "new material" which could make a "difference".
Lawyers representing GOSH said they had "yet to see" any new evidence.
A US doctor who has offered to treat Charlie has attended a meeting with his GOSH care team to decide whether he should travel to America for therapy.
Dr Michio Hirano met doctors earlier this week to examine Charlie and discuss his condition.
