[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City stormed back from a goal down to clinch a superb win over champions Dundalk in Monday's League of Ireland Premier Division match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dane Massey headed Stephen Kenny's visitors ahead in the 16th minute.
Nathan Boyle equalised just before half-time with a low shot after finding space in the penalty box.
Barry McNamee dinked the ball over keeper Gabriel Sava to give Derry the lead and skipper Ryan McBride headed the third five minutes from time.
It means three wins out of three for Derry and moves them up to second in the table.
Kenny Shiels' side are three points behind Cork City, the only other team with maximum points, and Derry have a game in hand.
Dundalk had gone into the game on the back of three straight wins, and they looked on course to make it four when Massey met John Mountrey's corner to glance the ball past Ger Doherty in the Derry goal.
But the hosts, completing their first home fixture at their temporary base of Maginn Park in Donegal, got level through Boyle's third goal of the season.
The young forward's trickery gained him some space in the box and his shot beat keeper Sava who will be disappointed he was unable to save.
Derry went ahead in the 69th minute when Sava failed to hold on to Aaron McEneff's effort and McNamee pounced to lift the ball over the keeper.
McBride made sure of a brilliant night for the Candystripes with an 85th-minute headed goal.
