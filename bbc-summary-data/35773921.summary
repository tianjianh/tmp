[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Land Rover Defenders are "being stolen to order" with reported thefts rising in both rural and urban parts of Avon and Somerset, police have said.

The region's rural crime team said the end of production of Defenders in January could be one of the reasons why thieves are targeting them.
It said 25 Defenders were stolen "force-wide" last year with a "definite increase" in the past two months.
Farming insurance firm NFU Mutual said it had seen a recent rise in claims.
PC Katie Drabble, from Avon and Somerset police, said: "Since the production [of Defenders] finished in January, we've definitely seen an increase in theft.
"Not just for the parts but for the actual vehicle, because they're stolen to order and then exported out of the country.
"Don't leave the keys in. It sounds ridiculous but people do, especially on farms because different people are using the vehicle - use a key safe."
She added it was "important to highlight" that it was not just farms being targeted, with thefts also happening in the centres of Bath and Bristol.
Tim Price, from NFU Mutual, said the company had "certainly" seen an increase in claims for Defenders.
He said: "NFU Mutual insures three quarters of the farmers in Somerset and many other country people, so we probably cover the majority of the Land Rover Defenders that are on Somerset's roads.
"Like the police, we're working hard to get the message out to people to increase security measures.
"We work very closely with the police and we do feel that, unless people take more precautions, it is going to be a growing crime.
"We want to do everything to keep Somerset's Land Rovers safe."
