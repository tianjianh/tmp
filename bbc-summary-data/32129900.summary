Oil and gas services company Wood Group has been awarded a multi-million dollar North Sea contract by French oil giant Total.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the deal, Wood Group PSN (WGPSN) will provide engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services to four offshore assets and two onshore facilities.
The five-year contract includes an option for two one-year extensions.
It is the second major oil sector deal Wood Group has picked up this month.
In mid-March, the Aberdeen-based company won a contract from Statoil worth more than Â£40m to expand and upgrade a Norwegian gas processing plant.
Under the Total deal, WGPSN will continue to provide services for Total's Alywn, Dunbar, Elgin and Franklin platforms and the St Fergus Gas Terminal.
It will also support the Shetland Gas Plant, the onshore receiving facility for Laggan/Tormore, which will start production later this year.
WGPSN UK managing director Dave Stewart said: "Our knowledge and in-depth understanding of this key client's needs, and our strong commitment to working safely, collaboratively, innovatively and efficiently to maximise productivity of these assets, helped us to secure this contract."
