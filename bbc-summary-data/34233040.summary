Hundreds protest over Caernarfon bridge closure threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have lined a swing bridge threatened with closure as a north Wales council tries to plug a £33m funding gap.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwynedd council's cabinet says £54,000 could be saved by shutting the Pont yr Aber footbridge crossing the estuary in Caernarfon.
Residents would face a diversion of almost 2 miles (2.7km).
The council said closure is just one option and transferring swing bridge operations is also under discussion.
The bridge links the historic castle side of the Seiont estuary and harbour with the Aber foreshore and St Helen's park and leisure facilities.
It also provides a link to nearby caravan parks, with tourists attracted by the neighbouring castle.
The council said it will be consulting on its planned cuts in the coming months before any decision is taken in 2016.
An earlier proposal to close the Barmouth bridge over the Mawddach estuary to walkers has attracted a petition signed by over 20,000 people.
