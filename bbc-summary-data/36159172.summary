The 28-year-old former Manchester City defender joined the club, initially on loan, from Brentford in January 2014.
And he has been a regular in Derek McInnes's side over the past two-and-a-half seasons.
"I was always confident we could try and get there and get a deal done," McInnes told the Aberdeen website. "It is absolutely brilliant news."
