Bournemouth are celebrating promotion to the Premier League with an open-top bus parade in front of thousands of supporters.

The Cherries' 3-0 win over Bolton last Monday effectively sealed promotion, with the title clinched on Saturday.
It will be the first time the club has taken a place in English football's top flight.
The seafront parade will take the team from Boscombe Pier to Bournemouth Pier through streets lined with fans.
Bournemouth won the Championship title with a 3-0 victory at Charlton Athletic, as Watford slipped up late on against Sheffield Wednesday.
Eddie Howe's squad will start the celebrations at Boscombe Pier, and the tour ends just east of Bournemouth Pier.
"We are expecting unprecedented numbers of supporters to turn out and it promises to be as memorable as any matchday this season," said chairman Jeff Mostyn.
The club said parades in recent years to celebrate promotions from Leagues One and Two had seen thousands of fans take to the streets.
Just seven years ago AFC Bournemouth was five minutes from liquidation, and a year later the squad was one game away from going out of the Football League.
In January 1997, the club was so penniless a bucket collection was arranged at the Winter Gardens in Bournemouth town centre.
The Cherries began their campaign with a 4-0 victory at Huddersfield.
Their 8-0 win over Birmingham in October was the first time they had scored eight in a league game, barring a 10-0 win in 1939 which was expunged after World War Two broke out the next day.
