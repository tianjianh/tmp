Also in Group A, Namibia beat the United States by seven wickets while Hong Kong's match against Papua New Guinea at Bready was abandoned.
Nepal made 18 from the first two overs, but began to lose regular wickets once Anil Mandal was the first man to go, having picked out O'Brien off Alex Cusack's bowling.
Only Sagar Pun and captain Paras Khadka, with 20 and 10 respectively, reached double figures for Nepal, who lost their final five wickets for only three runs as O'Brien and Thompson swept through the tail.
The former, who was on a hat-trick at one point, took 3-8 from his four overs while Thompson's trio of victims cost just 10 runs.
After a rain-delayed resumption for their own innings, Ireland lost Niall O'Brien chopping on for three in the second over before Stirling and Porterfield briskly moved towards their target of 54.
Like Niall O'Brien, Stirling was bowled by Sompal Kami with the scores level, but new batsman Kevin O'Brien struck the winning run to seal a comprehensive victory.
