Huddlestone has made 123 appearances for Hull since signing from Tottenham for a fee of about Â£5m in August 2013.
The 29-year-old Derby academy-graduate played in 47 games last term to help the Tigers earn promotion through the Championship play-offs.
"It's been a rollercoaster three years, but I've enjoyed my time here and I'm settled," he told BBC Radio Humberside.

"It's going to be a big season first and foremost, and then hopefully we're in the Premier League next season as well.
"It's a massive two years, but I'm excited for it and I'm feeling good going into it."
Meanwhile, Hull have signed Wimbledon goalkeeper Will Mannion, 18, on a three-year deal, with a compensation fee set to be decided by a tribunal.
Mannion has yet to make a senior appearance, and will play for Hull's under-21 side next season.
