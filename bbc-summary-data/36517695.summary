Stephanie, who is from Daviot, near Inverness, and lives in Dunfermline, fell off a motorbike on 10 May.
Doctors in Vietnam initially gave her a 1% chance of survival.
She is now in the intensive care unit at the Western General Hospital where she is undergoing tests and scans.
While in Thailand she was woken from an induced coma but was sedated for the journey back to Scotland.
At the weekend it was revealed Stephanie had smiled for the first time since waking from the coma, during a physio session.
A post on the Save Steph Facebook page said: "She is in so much discomfort and fighting against all the odds to improve herself when the medical team asked her if she could hold up two fingers, Stephanie did, and then she smiled a small but amazing smile.
"The doctor was so surprised he started to bow and laugh, because not only did it show that Stephanie understood this instruction it also showed after all that's happened to her she still had the humour and friendly personality that everyone respects and loves."
Stephanie was being treated at a hospital in Bangkok, having been flown there from Vietnam.
She was transferred to Scotland by a UK air ambulance.
The Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games silver medallist had been in Vietnam for about four months, teaching underprivileged children, when she suffered serious head injuries in the motorcycle accident.
Her skirt is believed to have become unravelled and caught in the wheel.
Friends set up a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her medical costs after it emerged her travel insurance was not valid because she had been in the country more than 31 days.
More than 7,000 people have contributed, raising more than Â£300,000.
