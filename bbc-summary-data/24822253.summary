[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of the man accused of killing Guernsey woman Sarah Groves has heard evidence from her boyfriend's uncle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case against 43-year-old Richard De Wit, from the Netherlands, resumed earlier in Kashmir after a succession of adjournments.
He is accused of the multiple stabbing of Ms Groves on a houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar in April.
At the latest hearing, the prosecution presented Abil Shoda, a Kashmiri who gave evidence through an interpreter.
He said Ms Groves was not just a guest in the houseboat, but a part of the family.
She had said goodnight to family members on the night of her killing before retiring to her room, he said.
No witness heard during the trial has yet reported having seen the killing take place.
Many of the adjournments have been caused by the judge's dissatisfaction with the police handling of the alleged murder weapon - a knife with a broken blade.
The next trial date has been set for 25 November.
