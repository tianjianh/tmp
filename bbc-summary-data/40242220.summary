[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brokenshire reappointed as NI Secretary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Brokenshire has been reappointed as the government's Northern Ireland Secretary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes as the Prime Minister completes a cabinet reshuffle.
He first took the role in July 2016, replacing Theresa Villiers who quit the government after turning down a non-cabinet role.
In a statement Mr Brokenshire said his "immediate priority is reaching agreement on restoring an inclusive power-sharing executive."
Shortly after his reappointment Mr Brokenshire wrote on Twitter that he felt "privileged" to be asked to remain in the role.
Mr Brokenshire is due to meet with party leaders and the Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan in Belfast on Monday.
In a statement he said: "The statutory deadline to restore a functioning Executive to Northern Ireland is 29 June. Time is short but there was real progress in the last round of political discussion.
"Agreement between the parties can be reached if there is goodwill on all sides.
"Like the overwhelming majority across the community in Northern Ireland, I believe a devolved government in Belfast is the best way to address the key decisions which affect people's day to day lives - whether these relate to the economy, security, public services or issues of policing and justice, as well as addressing the legacy of the past."
He added: "Northern Ireland's political leaders now have this chance to take control and restore effective power sharing government under the current assembly mandate.
"If they do not, the power to make decisions passes to others. Their choice in the next three weeks will shape Northern Ireland's future."
