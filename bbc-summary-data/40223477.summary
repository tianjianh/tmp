Leeds-born Cox said the medals had been taken from her car that was parked outside of her house in Prestwich, Bury.
The 26-year-old took gold in the T37 women's 100m and T35-38 4x100m relay at the 2015 World Championships in Doha.
She tweeted: "I'm just gutted. My first worlds medals for both sports, worth more than any amount of money."

In the plea posted on social media earlier she wrote: "Got home yest 2 find some1 had got into my car n cause I'd been filming just before my worlds medals were in there! Pls help me find them."
She spent the evening in London on Thursday and only discovered their loss when she got home.
Cox, who had a stroke aged 23, and was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, became the first Briton since 1988 to win a medal in two sports at the same Paralympics.
She also took athletics silver in the 4x100m relay and bronze in the 100m, and was picked to be Britain's flagbearer at the Rio closing ceremony.
