Bristol flanker Olly Robinson has signed a new contract to stay with the Premiership club until the end of the 2017-18 season.

Robinson, the son of former Bristol coach Andy, arrived from Championship side Moseley in April 2014.
The 25-year-old has scored 31 tries in 51 appearances for the club, playing in 10 Premiership games this season.
Meanwhile, England under-20 prop Ollie Dawe, 19, has agreed a similar contract extension with Bristol.
"We're pleased that these guys have committed their futures to Bristol Rugby," head coach Mark Tainton told the club website.
"Olly [Robinson] has proven himself as a top flight performer, while Ollie [Dawe] is showing great progress with the academy."
