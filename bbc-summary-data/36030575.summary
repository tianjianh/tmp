[SN]TITLE[SN]
Families of WW2 pilots lost in bombing raids sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The families of six World War Two pilots who did not return from bombing raids over Germany are being sought.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it was trying to trace relatives so they would be able to attend their burial service in Berlin on 27 April.
Three were on Lancaster JB640, which took off on 2 January 1944.
The other three men were part of a seven-man crew on Halifax LK709, which failed to return from a bombing raid on Berlin on 28 January 1944.
The Lancaster crew set off for the German capital on the night of 2 January, but was never heard from again. All were listed as missing, presumed dead.
The squadron had intended to fly 18 Pathfinder Lancasters but only 14 took off and one of those had to turn back due to engine failure.
The three men on Halifax LK709 were recorded as having no known grave and their names placed on the Runnymede memorial.
Eyewitnesses in Germany remembered seeing a Halifax Bomber crashing into a lake on 29 January 1944 and four bodies were subsequently recovered.
