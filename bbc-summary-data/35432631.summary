Mr Lightman has led the heads' union since 2010, through the era of the coalition government and into the present administration.
His deputy, Malcolm Trobe, will replace him as an interim general secretary.
Mr Trobe paid tribute to his predecessor's "unwavering commitment" to supporting head teachers.
A statement from the ASCL head teachers' union said he was leaving "with immediate effect to pursue other professional interests".
Mr Lightman has been an influential figure in debates about education, representing head teachers in the major changes to the school and qualifications system in recent years.
Mr Trobe said Mr Lightman had "worked tirelessly with ministers, top civil servants and other key influencers to shape and influence the education policy of successive governments".
"Brian has shown unwavering commitment to championing and supporting the work done by ASCL members in ensuring that the job of school and college leadership continues to be fulfilling and worthwhile," said Mr Trobe.
