A family of six on an Easter camping trip have been rescued in Perthshire after becoming trapped on a small island by rising water levels.

Emergency services were called after two adults and four children got into difficulties on Saturday.
The incident occurred on an island in the River Almond at the Sma' Glen near Crieff.
Rescuers used an inflatable sled and ropes to bring them safely to the river bank.
Paramedics treated the family for the effects of the cold and wet conditions, but they did not require hospital treatment.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said water levels had risen as a result of sustained heavy rainfall overnight in the area.
SFRS station manager Brian Robertson urged members of the public to consider the potential dangers of attempting to enter local rivers and lochs.
He said: "Whilst we do not wish to discourage people from enjoying the countryside, we would urge the public to be aware of the potential hazards of rapidly rising water levels.
"Changeable weather conditions of an unpredictable nature should not allow the opportunity for complacency or familiarity to affect your judgement, even when the river state can initially appear relatively tranquil.
"Although the family were well prepared in terms of their camping trip, this serves as a reminder to ensure all safety precautions are followed, especially when camping at or near water."
Water levels are expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend, with two flood warnings currently in place for parts of Perthshire.
