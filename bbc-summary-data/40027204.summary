[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen FC stadium plans delayed by four months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The planning application for Aberdeen FC's proposed move to a new Â£50m stadium will now not be considered until autumn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The club said the plans for the project would not be put before councillors in June as originally hoped.
The decision follows requests from the council and consultees for further information.
Aberdeen FC said if planning permission was granted in October, it could still have the stadium completed in 2020.
Objectors say concerns include traffic and parking issues.
The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future.
