Niall Horan misses shot and falls down on golf course caddying for Rory McIlroy

For a golf fan like Niall Horan, getting the chance to go to the Masters - and hit a shot at Augusta National - is a dream come true.

It's a shame then that his time on the course caddying for Rory McIlroy wasn't entirely successful.
His shot, on the ninth and last hole at the par 3 competition, ended up in the water.
"My right arm got stuck on my chest and I pulled it across and it wound up in the drink on the very left," he said.
"Any other day I would have found the green but there's a lot of pressure out there."
And this wasn't the only disaster.
He also managed to fall down and photographers were on hand to capture his stumble.
He did describe being able to caddy for McIlroy as an "honour" and seemed pleased to be there.
There weren't that many of his younger fans on the course but plenty of older spectators wanted selfies and autographs.
"It's very different," the 21-year-old said. "I do perform to a lot of people but I'm performing to their parents today. It's a very different crowd."
Rory McIlroy, who has been tipped as a favourite at this year's Masters, said the crowds at One Direction gigs were "younger" than the golf fans he attracts.
He's been friends with Niall for a while and says the singer is a 12-handicap player.
He asked the singer to join him as caddy when McIlroy found out he was coming to watch the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, for the first time.
"I caught up with him in Australia at the end of last year and he was really excited and I said, 'If you're available Wednesday afternoon and you want to carry the bag for nine holes, you're more than welcome,'" said McIlroy.
"He's really excited to be here."
Newsbeat has made a playlist especially for the golfer, who has said in the past that he likes rap and hip-hop.
Unfortunately though, we seem to have missed one band off the list - One Direction.
"I'm a big fan," the golfer said of the group. "They have been hitting it for years."
