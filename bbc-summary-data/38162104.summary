He takes over from Sam Allardyce who left in September after just 67 days in charge of the team.
When Allardyce left, Southgate stepped up from his role as the England Under-21s boss to look after the senior team for four games.
He oversaw two wins and two draws and has now signed a contract, reportedly for four years.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the players over these past four games and I think there is huge potential," said Southgate.
During his career playing football Gareth Southgate made 57 appearances for England.
