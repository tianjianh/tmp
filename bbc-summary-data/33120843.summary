After almost three months of strikes, public school teachers in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have voted to return to work.

Thousands of protesters from one of the largest teachers' unions in the Americas met in the centre of Sao Paulo to cast their vote.
It began after the state government failed to offer a salary increase.
A union leader said the strike had lost force when strike payments had had to be reduced.
The strikers of the Union of Official Teachers for the State of Sao Paulo (Apeoesp), had been calling for a 75% pay rise.
The union represents about 180,000 teachers.
Last year, in the lead up to the World Cup in Brazil, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil to demonstrate against the spiralling costs linked to the building of the football stadiums, and corruption.
Many protesters complained money was being cut from basic public services.
