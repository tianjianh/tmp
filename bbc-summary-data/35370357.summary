More than half of the employees in the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) received a pay rise in 2014-15.

That includes workers who made a progression up a pay scale. Overall, 55% of NICS staff received an increase.
At senior civil service grades, 81% got an increase, compared to 40% at administrative assistant level.
The details are contained in a report from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.
The figures also show that the typical basic salary of NICS staff is Â£24,728, which remains unchanged from 2014.
The report stated that lower-grade staff are better paid than their counterparts in the rest of the UK, although the reverse is true for those among the upper ranks.
Twenty-one staff - likely to include permanent secretaries of Stormont departments - earned more than Â£100,000 in 2015.
