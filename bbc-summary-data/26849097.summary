Chris Evans also failed to make the cut for the best breakfast show prize. But the Radio 2 DJ did get nominated for the music radio personality honour.
Graham Norton is shortlisted in the same category for his own Radio 2 show.
Other nominees include Blur star Alex James, up for a pair of prizes at the 12 May event for his Magical Mystery Show programme on Classic FM.
The cheese-making musician is one of several performers-cum-broadcasters in contention this year, with jazz star Jamie Cullum, Elbow's Guy Garvey and XFM's Scroobius Pip also recognised.
The awards, described by organisers as the industry's most prestigious, were known as the Sony Radio Academy Awards before it lost its sponsor last year.
Evans will again host the event, to be held at its regular home at Grosvenor House Hotel in central London.
"These awards continue to set the gold standard for the UK radio industry," said Paul Robinson, the Radio Academy's CEO
The prizes, he went on, "uniquely embrace everyone, from big established personalities and stations to fresh new talent and local radio stations."
One fresh talent recognised this year is Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, whose weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in show Call Clegg is up for best speech programme and best news and current affairs programme.
The highly coveted award for national station of the year - landed by BBC Radio 5 live in 2013 - will be fought between Radio 2, Radio 4 and talkSport.
In Grimshaw's absence, the BBC is represented in the best breakfast show category by 5 live's Nicky Campbell and Rachel Burden and BBC London's Penny Smith and Paul Ross.
Breakfast shows on Capital, Kiss and LBC are also in contention for the prize, awarded to shows with audiences of 10 million and over.
A full list of this year's nominations is available on the Radio Academy website.
