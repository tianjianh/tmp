Environmental watchdog Sepa received a large number of complaints after a fault at the site caused high-pressure steam venting on Tuesday.
Ineos said the fault happened during the recommissioning of one of its turbines.
One resident said the noise was "like an aircraft landing or taking off".
In a statement, Ineos Grangemouth said: "We apologise to our neighbours for the noise last night, caused by the venting of steam from our power station during the recommissioning of one of our turbines. "
"This was safely managed but led to considerable disturbance of those living close to our site."
Sepa said about 30 people called its pollution hotline to complain about the noise, which continued for a number of hours during Tuesday evening.
The fault was fixed at about 23:00.
Sepa said its inspectors would be following up the incident with Ineos.
Scott Cumming, 42, who lives in Linlithgow, about seven miles away from the site, said: "It was a bit like the noise from an aircraft landing or taking off."
