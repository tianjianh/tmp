Fit-again Hilal Soudani is recalled to Algeria squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Algeria have included fit-again Dinamo Zagreb striker Hilal Soudani in a 23-man squad for their 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away to Seychelles on 2 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Soudani, who scored twice against Seychelles and Lesotho in their first two Group J games, has been out of the international fold since November due to injury.
His return coincides with the absence of Sporting Lisbon's Islam Slimani who is suspended after an accumulation of yellow cards.
Slimani is the joint top scorer in this campaign with four goals.
The PFA's Player of the Year and Leicester City's player of year award winner Riyad Mahrez, captain Carl Medjani and former BBC African Footballer of the year Yacine Brahimi are all included.
But Watford's Adlene Guedioura, Mehdi Abeid and Ramy Bensebaini are all notable absentees in the squad announced by the Algerian Football Federation.
Nabil Neghiz - Algeria's assistant coach - takes interim charge of the Desert Foxes as the 1990 African Champions begin life without Frenchman Christian Gourcuff who stood down as coach last month.
After three wins and a draw, Algeria are top of their qualifying group for the 2017 tournament in Gabon.
They need just one win from their remaining games, at Seychelles and at home to Lesotho on 2 September, to seal automatic qualification.
Algeria are also into the final group stage of 2018 World Cup qualifying. The draw takes place in Cairo on 24 June 2016, with the final round starting in October.

Goalkeepers: Rais Mbolhi (Antalyaspor, Turkey), Azzeddine Doukha (JS Kabylie), Malik Asselah (CR Belouizdad)
