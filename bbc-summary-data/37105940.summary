Garner, 28, did not feature in Preston's squad for Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat by Derby County.
Earlier in the week, Grayson said the player was free to join the Ibrox club after a bid had been made.
"I expect him to have a medical in the next 24 hours or so," said Grayson after North End's Championship loss to Derby.
"I've said all along that we didn't have to sell him or want to but when the bid came in it's only fair to ask a player.
"Joe stressed all along that he wanted to pursue the option of going to Rangers. It's disappointing but it's Joe's decision."
Grayson has two years left on his contract at Preston.
Meanwhile, Rangers are also in talks with Aston Villa defender Joleon Lescott, 34, over a possible move to Ibrox while ex-Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos is training with Mark Warburton's side this week.
