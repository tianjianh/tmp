Kilmarnock: Souleymane Coulibaly happy to bide his time at Rugby Park

Kilmarnock's top scorer Souleymane Coulibaly says he's committed to the Rugby Park side - for the moment.

The Ivorian forward has netted 10 goals this season, with boss Lee Clark saying it would take an "over-the-top" January bid to force Killie's hand.
"I'm playing first-team football after waiting a long time, I'm enjoying the moment and still thankful to Kilmarnock," Coulibaly said.
"If some club come, and the club and staff agree to let me go, I will go."
Coulibaly, 22, signed a three-year contract with Killie in the summer after being released by Peterborough United.
He says he's eager to repay the faith invested him by manager Clark.
"At the moment I want to work for Kilmarnock and do what they want me to do," Coulibaly added. "The future, I don't know yet, but I'm ready to do everything for the team.
"Some staff believe in you and give you confidence you repay them by scoring and doing well.
"Football sometimes is about ambition - if the club where you are is fighting for top six or Europa League next season, that's good and I don't want to go somewhere to play for no reason."
Coulibaly was once dubbed "the new Drogba", after his hero and compatriot Didier Drogba, the former Chelsea striker. But he admits that comparison was excessive.
"That was too much," he said. "But when I was playing in the lower divisions, those managers did not give me passion like Lee Clark did.
"When you didn't score in one or two games, they took you off. For any striker, your manager needs to be patient because the goals will come. Now, I've got the chance and I'm trying to do everything to keep scoring."
The striker added Tuesday night's 5-1 Premiership mauling by Aberdeen left him struggling to switch off, and desperate to make amends come Saturday's clash with Motherwell.
"I didn't sleep well," he said. "Losing 5-1 is hard to accept. I'm really furious now, I want to do something on Saturday and make sure we take the points.
"It's a good opportunity because they lost last week as well. We can try to do something there but the most important thing is to score early - that's what I learned from the Aberdeen game. We started well, but when we conceded the early goal, it killed us."
