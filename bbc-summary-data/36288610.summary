[SN]TITLE[SN]
Louis Norman strips naked to make weight for Andrew Selby fight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andrew Selby and Louis Norman will fight for the vacant British flyweight in Cardiff after Norman beat the clock and the scales to secure the contest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair will clash on the undercard of Lee Haskins' IBF world bantamweight title defence against Ivan Morales.
Norman originally weighed in 0.9lbs over the eight stone limit, but made the weight with seconds to spare after stripping completely naked.
Selby is bidding to set a record by claiming his first professional title.
No Welsh fighter in history has claimed a Lonsdale belt in less time in terms of bouts fought and days since turning pro.
The 27-year old from Barry can win the British title in just his fifth professional fight and is tipped to become a world champion within 12 months.
