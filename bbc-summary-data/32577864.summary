West Indies v England: Windies tie series after thrilling Barbados win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England fell to a five-wicket defeat in an absorbing final Test as West Indies tied the three-match series at 1-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England resumed in Barbados 107 ahead at 39-5 but, despite an unbeaten 35 from Jos Buttler, were all out for 123.
It left the hosts with a target of 192 and they were 80-4 before Darren Bravo and Jermaine Blackwood shared 108.
Left-hander Bravo struck three sixes in a magnificent 82 and Blackwood was 47 not out as the hosts beat England for only the second time in 29 Tests.
The match had fluctuated for much of the three days but the Windies were able to regain a share of the Wisden Trophy with relative ease as the England side tired.
A key moment proved to be a fumbled stumping by Buttler with 105 needed, the wicketkeeper unable to gather a sharply turning ball down the leg-side when Blackwood was way out of his ground having danced down the pitch to Joe Root.
After a wretched World Cup campaign, when failed to progress beyond the initial group stages, defeat at the Kensington Oval is likely to leave the England coaching staff with some difficult questions to answer from the hierarchy at the England and Wales Cricket Board.
Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said before the start of the series that there would be "some enquiries" if they failed to win in the Caribbean, and he takes up his post on 15 May.
Yet having scrambled for runs in frantic style at the end of a remarkable second day on which 18 wickets fell, England calmly added 23 on the third morning.
The introduction of slow left-armer Veerasammy Permaul soon saw Gary Ballance caught at slip, but Ben Stokes played in positive fashion, unleashing some effective reverse sweeps to add 33 with Buttler, who got off the mark in fine style with a six off Permaul.
However, Stokes skewed the spinner to cover and tall seamer Jason Holder struck with successive balls.
The destructive Buttler blazed four fours and a six from the next seven balls he faced but the number eight was again left not out at the other end when last man James Anderson was lbw after a review.
The home team's reply began one over before lunch and the afternoon soon appeared ominous for England when, for once, Anderson was unable to trouble the batsmen.
Debutant Shai Hope was dropped by Root at third slip off Stuart Broad, with star catcher Chris Jordan inexplicably positioned in the outfield, and both reviews were wasted within the opening 11 overs.
But Jordan trapped Hope lbw with a full delivery angling in, upheld after a review, and then produced another astonishing reflex catch at slip in the next over to snaffle Kraigg Brathwaite off the spin of Moeen Ali.
The Windies added 35 and appeared to be in command again, but England restricted the scoring and Broad nipped one back to rattle through the defence of Marlon Samuels.
Things changed once again after tea, as Bravo launched the first ball of the session from Root for six.
But in the next over the veteran Shivnarine Chanderpaul chopped Anderson on to his stumps, ending a disappointing series for the 40-year-old, who averaged only 15 from his six innings.
With all results still possible, a fourth day seemed likely but Bravo and Blackwood mixed defence and attack with great assurance.
Bravo edged Anderson through a vacant second slip area and, though he was well caught by Broad at mid-off with only four needed, the acceleration had been decisive and the Windies, who had lost their previous two series in England, soon completed a famous victory under the floodlights.
