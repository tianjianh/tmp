[SN]TITLE[SN]
Richard Murray: Charlton Athletic non-executive chairman steps down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richard Murray has stepped down from his position of non-executive chairman of League One side Charlton Athletic because of illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murray, who has been involved at boardroom level for more than 25 years, has several malignant tumours in his stomach which require surgery.
He became non-executive chairman when Belgian Roland Duchatelet took over the club in 2014.
Murray previously spent time as owner and chairman of the Addicks.
"Richard has done so much for the club and I know it was difficult for him to step down after being so intrinsically involved over the last 25 years," Duchatelet said in a statement on the club website.
"He is positive about his long-term prognosis though and all of us at Charlton look forward to seeing him back at The Valley very soon."
