Work on the 5,000-seat Derby Arena - one of only five such venues in the UK - began in April 2013.
It boasts a 250m cycle track, 12-court sports hall, a gym, group exercise space and a cafe.
The arena was due to open in December but Derby City Council put the delays on the "complex project" down to "getting things right".
The city council said it was still in negotiations with potential sponsors over a new name for the velodrome.
Councillor Alison Martin said the talks were "progressing quite well" but no details were available yet.
As well as cycling, the Â£31m venue will host sports including basketball and double as a concert venue.
It was opened by Dame Sarah Storey, Britain's most decorated female paralympian, and Derby MP Margaret Beckett, on Thursday night.
Team Sky Boss Sir Dave Brailsford, who lives in Derbyshire, called it a "superb facility".
"What's exciting about a velodrome and a multi-use arena like Derby is it attracts all ages and all sizes of people.
"It's open to everyone," he said.
He said with other velodromes in London, Newport, Manchester and Glasgow, Derby's was "ideally placed" for people all over the country to enjoy.
The venue opens to the public from 11:00 GMT.
Dame Storey, who has been training on the track in recent weeks, said: "It's absolutely amazing.
"I love riding here, I look forward to riding here again in the future and I look forward to seeing everybody else enjoying their racing."
Councillor Alison Martin said: "It will bring so many benefits to Derby and to the region."
