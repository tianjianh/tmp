[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aneta Fortuniak assaulted an 83-year-old woman and a 90-year-old man at Spynie Care Home last year.
She was earlier convicted after a trial at Elgin Sheriff Court.
Cairn Group, which operates the Spynie home, said it was proud that other staff members had alerted the authorities.
Andrew Laing, procurator fiscal for Grampian, Highlands and Islands, said: "There is no excuse for such behaviour, it is wholly unacceptable.
"Aneta Fortuniak had been entrusted with the care of some of the older members of our community and having lost her temper, assaulted two of those she was meant to be looking after.
"Cases such as this are thankfully rare as the majority of individuals in this vital caring profession provide an excellent service, treating their residents with the care and dignity they deserve.
"We would like to assure the older members of the community that we will seek to bring those who do commit such crimes to justice."
Ross Hodgson, operations manager of Cairn Group, told the BBC Scotland news website: "We did employ the lady, we went through all the relevant checks.
"We support the court's decision. Our staff alerted the relevant authorities. We are proud of the way in which they acted."
