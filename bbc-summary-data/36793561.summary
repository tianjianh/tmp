He began his shooting spree at 05:20 local time (04:20 GMT) at a police station in north-western Kenya.
Earlier, Kenya's police chief had said the gunman was a suspected recruiter for al-Shabab Islamist militants.
An officer who was part of a police special unit sent to retake the station in Kapenguria town was also killed.
A police source has told the BBC that the gunman was unhappy that his request to resign from the police had been denied as he had not served the requisite 10 years of service after his graduation in 2013.
