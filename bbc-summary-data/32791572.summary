Andy Sward is now walking five thousand miles across Vancouver Island to St. Johns and has collected 31 thousand bottles and cans so far.
He travels around with his litter buggy which is made from an old pram. It's packed with food for the journey, clothes and a tent.
Andy wants to collect one million bottles and cans and hopes that he will inspire others to do the same.
