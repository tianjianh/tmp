The 33-year-old, a member of Spain's 2010 World Cup-winning squad, was a free agent having been released by the European champions in the summer.
"Hopefully I'm going to see the London Stadium full with all our fans and I'm really happy to be here," he said.
Arbeloa already has Premier League experience having initially left Real in 2007 to sign for Liverpool.
He rejoined the Spanish club in 2009 and helped them to two Champions League titles, the La Liga championship and two Copa del Rey crowns.
Arbeloa added: "For me, this is a great chance to be back in England and in the Premier League, which is a fantastic league and I want to put myself here again."
Meanwhile, West Ham have released midfielder Diego Poyet by mutual consent.
The 21-year-old departs the Hammers having made 10 appearances in all competitions in his two years with the club.
