Shares in Rolls-Royce rose 2.1%, despite the aerospace firm reporting a 32% drop in underlying half-year profits to £439m.
Rolls has issued three profit warnings in the space of 12 months, but chief executive Warren East said "our second half outlook remains positive".
"The continued growth in our order book demonstrates the long-term demand for our innovative products and services, and underpins my confidence in the fundamental strength of our business."

Among the fallers, Centrica shares fell 2.1% after the British Gas firm reported its half-year figures.
Profits across the Centrica group fell 3% to £1bn, despite a near doubling in profit at British Gas's residential arm.
