The Football Association of Wales (FAW) is investigating suspicious betting patterns on a Welsh Premier League (WPL) match.

It follows a game on Saturday when relegated Rhyl - who had not won in 16 matches - beat Port Talbot 5-0 at home.
"We are aware of the issue and are working on this with the relevant authorities," said an FAW spokesman.
Rhyl's previous win had come in October against Airbus Broughton UK.
They are 11th in the 12-team league, with Port Talbot one place and 12 points ahead of them.
Betting and sports data analysts Sportradar is the FAW's integrity partner and is involved in the investigation.
All WPL players must sign an agreement before each season, which includes a pledge not to bet on games and competitions in which they appear.
