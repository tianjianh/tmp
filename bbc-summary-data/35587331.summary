Driver deployed smokescreen to escape police officer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Carmarthenshire driver who tried to shake off a chasing police officer by deploying a smokescreen has been given a community order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Chaplin, 62, of Hebron, rigged a bucket of diesel, a pump and pipes in his Peugeot 309.
He activated it after a police officer tried to pull him over for speeding near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.
Chaplin must do 100 hours unpaid work and was given six points on his licence at Swansea Crown Court on Tuesday.
PC Dafydd Burge of Dyfed-Powys Police said Chaplin filled the road with fumes as he followed him along country lanes.
He finally pulled over after about five miles and PC Burge, who was forced to keep a distance from him, was able to follow the trail of smoke to find him.
Chaplin was convicted of causing a danger to other road users by deliberately causing smoke to be emitted and admitted driving without insurance and threatening behaviour.
He said he "sort of panicked" when he saw the policeman's flashing blue lights and told the court the device, which he borrowed from another man, was used to kill moles.
Judge Elwen Evans QC, said: "It is in very unusual circumstances that you find yourself before the court. I do not want to see you here again."
