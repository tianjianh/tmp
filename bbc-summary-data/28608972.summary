One hundred and fifty firefighters tackled the blaze at its height, with smoke being seen 20 miles away.
Twenty years on, the Millennium Library in the city's Forum building is the most visited in the UK.
BBC Look East's Mike Liggins speaks to workers at the former library about what they saw on that tragic day.
