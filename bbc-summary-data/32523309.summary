Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman.
Wyman, who counts England manager Roy Hodgson as a friend after a chance meeting in a restaurant a couple of years ago, is a Crystal Palace fan and first watched the Eagles with his father when they were in Division Three South.
"My dad took me when I was 10 years old to the very first season after the Second World War," he said. "I've been a supporter ever since. When they lose, my weekend is ruined! It's ridiculous."
You can see all of Wyman's predictions on Football Focus at 12:10 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website (in the UK).
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. The exact score earns THREE points.
Last weekend, Lawro got two correct results from 10 Premier League games, with one perfect score.
His score of four points saw him beaten by snooker star Mark Selby, who picked six results, with one perfect score. That gave him a total of eight points.
Lawro and George Ford both pick up an extra point this week for correctly predicting the outcome of Chelsea's postponed game against Leicester - Lawro went for a 2-0 Chelsea win, while Ford thought the Blues would win 3-0. The final score was 3-1 to Chelsea.
But Lawro and Wade Barrett both got their prediction for Liverpool's game at Hull wrong - Lawro backed Liverpool to win 2-1, and Barrett went for a 0-0 draw. The Tigers won 1-0.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
