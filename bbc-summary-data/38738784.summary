And this isn't a sentence from the early 1980s.
At Swansea there's a new Toshack in town these days. Cameron, son of former boss John, helps coach an under-23 side having an impressive season.
On Tuesday night they played in the quarter finals of the Checkatrade Trophy but were beaten on penalties by Coventry City.
The Checkatrade Trophy is tournament much-maligned this season, but Swansea's youngsters beat three league sides to get so far and were the only Premier League academy side to reach the quarter finals.
But there are still three sides they could win this season and Cameron hopes it's just the start of another successful Toshack career.
"The next step for me would be to work in a first team environment," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"Hopefully that's not too far away."
Few can claim to have had the same success at home and abroad as John Toshack. His managerial CV includes Swansea, Wales, Real Madrid and even a league title in Morocco last year.
Toshack Jr worked alongside his father when he coached in Macedonia five years ago, but now he's ready to make his own reputation.
"It can be a help and a hindrance (being John Toshack's son)," he admits.
"Obviously I'm very proud of what my father has achieved over the years. He's one of the most successful British managers ever.
"It's great for me to have that experience on the end of a phone. I speak to him regularly and he watches the progress of our team.
"But I'm not looking to emulate or be somebody else. I'm Cameron Toshack and I'm my own man."
Aside from the name, there aren't too many similarities.
Toshack Senior was a disciplinarian who didn't suffer fools. In his own words, his son is much more analytical.
"He's a learned type - a little bit too much for me," he jokes.
"All this analysis that goes into the game is now is a bit beyond me. But he's very, very conscientious and always looking to learn.
"Hopefully the Swans will get the benefit of it."
Of course transferring success with a youth team to success as a head coach is easier said than done.
But Cameron Toshack only has to look at Swansea's new head coach for inspiration.
Paul Clement started his career as a coach in Chelsea's academy, before his promotion to assistant manager under Carlo Ancelotti.
Toshack is working towards his Pro Licence and is the first person at Swansea to complete the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme.
He feels he's almost ready to make the step up.
"Without getting ahead of myself, I'd like to eventually be in and around the first team here - and if it's not here maybe at another club somewhere in Europe," he says.
"I'd like to follow in my father's footsteps in that respect. I'm not averse to moving to other countries to learn my trade and be a success."
