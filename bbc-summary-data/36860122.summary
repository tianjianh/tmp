On Saturday, there is an opportunity for the public to visit the Iron Age hillfort on Penycloddiau hillside.
A dig on nearby Moel y Gaer at Bodfari, near Denbigh, where a team from Oxford University has been excavating since 2011, will be open on Sunday.
There are several hillforts in the vicinity, which is in an area of outstanding natural beauty.
Denbighshire county archaeologist Fiona Gale said: "It is a great opportunity for us to learn more about what life was like in these enigmatic places when people built them around 2,500 years ago.
"The spotlight is really on sites in our area, with archaeologists from across the UK waiting to see what is found."
Ms Gale will lead a walk up to Penycloddiau from Llangwyfan car park at 10:00 BST on Saturday.
The Moel y Gaer open day is between 11:00 and 16:00 on Sunday.
Visitors will be able to talk to experts about what has been found at the sites.
