[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tosin Femi Olasemo, 37, of Cardiff, used a picture of a uniformed soldier as his profile photo on the dating site match.com, Cardiff Crown Court heard.
He was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison after previously pleading guilty to fraud.
He showed no compassion, police said.
Det Sgt Jamie Holcombe from South Wales Police Economic Crime Unit said the case was an example of how an individual could "sit in front of a computer and destroy another person's life."
He added: "Olasemo took advantage of his victims' vulnerabilities and showed no compassion for their significant losses."
He warned people using online sites to be vigilant and not to send money or give personal details to strangers.
