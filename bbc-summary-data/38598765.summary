The former London Irish man, 29, who can play in the second or back row, was injured in Friday's loss at Newcastle.
"He really hurt his neck and he has got pins and needles in his arms and through his hands," director of rugby Todd Blackadder told BBC Points West.
"So he could be out for a little while yet but it's hopefully not too serious. But to lose a big boy like that is an opportunity for someone else."
