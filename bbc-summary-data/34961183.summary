A car that collided with a taxi in Glasgow, killing a woman who was returning home from her son's wedding, was being chased by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The green Vauxhall Astra drove off from Springhill Industrial Estate after it did not respond to attempts by officers in a police van to pull it over.
It collided with a black Hackney cab on Edinburgh Road at 01:30 on Sunday.
Marie Laurie, 57, from Easterhouse, died at the scene. Mrs Laurie's family said she would "be sadly missed".
A 52-year-old man, who was also a passenger in the taxi, was injured.
He was said to be in a serious but stable condition at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
The man driving the taxi, aged 50, suffered minor injuries, as did the 20-year-old male driver of the Vauxhall and his 16-year-old female passenger.
Police Scotland said a 20-year-old man would be the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal in connection with alleged road traffic offences.
The force also said that the matter had been referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner for consideration as is "standard procedure" in such cases.
Anyone with information about the incident is being asked to contact officers on the non-emergency number 101.
