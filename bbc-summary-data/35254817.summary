Saltdean Lido: Construction work on new pools under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has resumed on restoring a Grade II* listed lido after a delay last year when it was found an old electricity sub-station had been removed.

Phase one of the Saltdean Lido project will see the creation of a swimming pool, a children's paddling pool, and a temporary cafe and changing facilities.
It is hoped the pools will open this summer, with the restoration of the main lido building coming later.
Campaigners are still trying to raise funds for a new sub-station.
The Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company, which has a 60-year lease to operate the pool, has been selling bricks for a Wall of Fame.
Volunteer director Bridget Fishleigh said it was spending Â£2.8m on the swimming pool, and had already built a plant room for Â£700,000.
"Sadly that still isn't enough money. A couple of months ago we realised that there wasn't enough electricity left in Saltdean to actually run the swimming pools, and we're now fund raising for a new sub-station - so we have the electricity to clean the water and heat it."
She said there was still plenty of space left for people to sponsor a brick on the Wall of Fame.
"We're really hoping to open this summer, but it's down to the sub-station - we really need to raise the money," Ms Fishleigh said.
