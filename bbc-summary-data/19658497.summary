[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been revealed to turn a historic hall in Coventry, which was once used as an air raid shelter, into a music centre for the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Drapers Hall, in Bayley Street, was built in 1832 and has also been used as a magistrates' court and church centre.
The Higgs Trust charity said it was working in partnership with Coventry University and Coventry City Council to modernise the grade II listed building.
It will have practice rooms, recording studios and a sheet music library.
As part of the plans, the council's performing arts service would move to Drapers Hall from its current headquarters at Chace Studio Centre in Willenhall.
Peter Knatchbull-Huggeson, clerk for the Higgs Trust, said: "One of the things about music in schools at the moment is that budgets are being cut.
"It's becoming more difficult for children to get access to music and instruments and we want to ensure in Coventry that doesn't happen."
The charity said it would know the full cost of the project once it had done a feasibility study but said it would be "a few million pounds".
The basement at Drapers Hall was used as an air raid shelter for 200 people during World War II.
It is currently owned by Coventry City Council.
