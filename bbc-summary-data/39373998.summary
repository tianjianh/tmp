[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has criticised a hospital after the death of a 10-month-old baby.

Leo Stacey died from a rare bowel condition on 6 October 2015 after suffering sickness and dehydration.
He had been taken to A&E at Luton and Dunstable Hospital by ambulance but several attempts at inserting an intravenous line into a vein failed.
Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Martin Oldham said: "Sadly they did not address his hydration or solve the dehydration fully until he died."
Leo's parents, Nathalie Aubry-Stacey, 38, and Marc Stacey, 37, from Harpenden, told Ampthill Coroner's Court they believed he could have been saved.
But a paediatrician said staff had done all they could.
Dr Jeremy Pryce, a paediatric pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination, said tests showed Leo was suffering from an intussusception of the bowel - a condition where part of the intestine folds into another section, causing an obstruction, and viral gastroenteritis.
He said it was impossible to say which came first and what the cause was.
In a statement, Luton and Dunstable Hospital said: "We have carried out a full investigation into how Leo died and have met with his family to discuss the outcome.
"It is clear there were failings in his care for which we have sincerely apologised.
"There were a number of recommendations that came out of the review, all of which have been implemented, with the learning shared across the trust."
