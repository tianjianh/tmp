The hosts needed 106 in their second innings to win and reached their target for the loss of two wickets.
They had resumed on 19-0 and Murali Vijay went for eight while Cheteshwar Pujara was run out without scoring.
However, KL Rahul's unbeaten 51 - his sixth half century of the series - and stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane's 38 not out eased them to victory.
Rahul hit the winning runs as India won the 10th out of 13 Tests in a marathon home campaign which saw the top-ranked team beat New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia.
India's only defeat in those contests came against Australia when they were thrashed by 333 runs in the first Test of the series.
The hosts bounced back with victory in the second and, after the third was drawn, won the fourth without injured captain Virat Kohli to beat the number two ranked Test team.
"This is our best series win so far," said Kohli. "The maturity and responsibility shown by the boys was great to see.
"The changes we made to our fitness regime have paid off. It has been a team season. The responsibility has been shared."
The fourth Test turned on day three when India bowled Australia out for 137 but visiting captain Steve Smith, who scored three centuries in the series, said he was "proud of the way the guys have competed".
He added: "It was a magnificent series, probably one of best I have been involved in.
"A lot of people wrote us off before we got here but I am proud of how the guys adapted. We probably let a few moments slip and against India you cannot do that."
