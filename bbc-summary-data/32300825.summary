Election 2015: UKIP says immigration is 'raised by voters'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP's leader in Wales has denied his party is obsessed with immigration, saying the issue is raised by voters on the doorstep.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nathan Gill said the UK and Welsh manifestos, out later this week, would be comprehensive, "full" documents on "every single topic you could imagine".
Immigration would merit "just a few paragraphs", he added.
But Mr Gill said voters possibly felt they would not be "vilified" by UKIP for bringing up the issue with them.
