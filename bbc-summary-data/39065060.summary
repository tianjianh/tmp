Pro12: Munster ring changes for Scarlets clash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pro12 leaders Munster make five changes to the starting team for Friday's game against the Scarlets at Thomond Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Keatley and Andrew Conway return from Ireland camp and start on the bench, while full-back Jaco Taute has recovered from a shoulder injury.
Rory Scannell and Jack O'Donoghue are ruled out through injury and academy centre Dan Goggin replaces Scannell.
DTH van der Merwe is one of two recalls for the Scarlets after a hamstring problem along with hooker Ryan Elias.
Munster won 23-13 when the sides met in Wales in September and turned around an 11-point deficit to snatch victory against the Ospreys last week.
It was their 15th win out of their last 16 games, which has impressed Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac.
"Week in week out they're performing over the 80 minutes, every team is striving to do that but they've done it really, really well.
"They've had some close calls but they've come out on the right side and that's a sign of a well bonded team."
In making his second Pro12 start, academy back row Conor Oliver makes his first appearance in the number 8 jersey.
Tipperary lock Dave Foley links up with Billy Holland in the second row and Stephen Archer takes his place in the front row scrumming down next to Rhys Marshall and Dave Kilcoyne.
Fourth-placed Scarlets ran in six tries against Zebre last Friday and are boosted by the return of van der Merwe and Elias.
Scrum half Aled Davies has been released from the Wales camp whilst Steff Evans hasn't been made available for this weekend's game.
Former Wales Under-20s stars Dafydd Hughes and Ioan Nicholas have been named on the replacements bench with Hughes hoping to make his Pro12 debut.
