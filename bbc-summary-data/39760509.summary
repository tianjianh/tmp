[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liverpool v Southampton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is confident he will be fit despite suffering a dead leg against Watford.

Adam Lallana replaced the Brazilian in that game on his return from a month's lay-off and could be in line to start.
Southampton's leading scorer Charlie Austin might be involved for the first time since dislocating his shoulder on 8 December.
He is among several players expected to step up their comebacks by playing for the under-23 side on Friday night.
Steve Wilson: "Having failed to score against Southampton over the course of three matches already this season, Liverpool would be right to be wary of this latest encounter at a time when they can afford no more slip-ups.
"After drawing with Bournemouth and losing to Palace, a home win is overdue - but Southampton have already exploited Liverpool's vulnerabilities as well as anyone.
"If Jurgen Klopp's side do fail to finish in the top four it will be entirely of their own doing after underperforming in too many games which on paper seemed underwhelming.
"Southampton may be securely mid-table without too much to trouble them, but the boos which greeted their inability to beat Hull at St Mary's a week ago will have hurt and should ensure a response."

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "It cannot be our job to count points, our job is to get them.
"There is absolutely no club in the top spots who can waste points in the next match day: not Chelsea, not Tottenham, not Liverpool, City, United or Arsenal.
"We all have to fight with all we have and that makes this league so exciting."
Southampton manager Claude Puel on speculation over his future: "I've been surprised to see these reports because it seems for me it has been an interesting season with many games.
"There have been European games, cup games, with quality. We reached the final at Wembley against Manchester United and we've also improved many players.
"We're ninth in the table with all these games, all these injuries.
"Sometimes we lack consistency and a clinical edge, and all of this we have to correct for next season because we can do better."
Liverpool owe Saints after they lost to them in the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, and I think they will get some revenge.
