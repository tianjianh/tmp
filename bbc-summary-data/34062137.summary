China economy problems may have knock-on effect in NI

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What impact might the problems in the Chinese economy have in Northern Ireland? BBC NI's Economics and Business Editor John Campbell reports.

Northern Ireland does a relatively tiny amount of business with China - just Â£82m of manufacturing exports went there in 2012/13.
But don't let that fool you.
China is now such a huge force in the world economy that what happens there matters everywhere.
Just ask local dairy farmers.
Part of the reason for the collapse in milk prices is that reduced demand in China has contributed to a global oversupply.
Weakening demand in China has also put downward pressure on other commodities like oil, coal and iron ore.
That could represent an initially benign side of a Chinese slowdown - cheaper energy for businesses and consumers; lower input costs for manufacturers.
That will keep inflation low and potentially postpone a rise in interest rates.
But in the medium and longer term, impacts of a slowdown in global trade, caused by a weakening Chinese economy, are undoubtedly negative.
That's particularly when you think about what is going to happen in the Northern Ireland economy over the next few years.
The dominant public sector will shrink - that will happen whether there's a voluntary exit for civil servants or not.
It is perfectly respectable to believe this will be good for the economy in the long term, making it more dynamic and sustainable.
But reduced government spending will remove a source of economic demand in the short term.
That demand can only be replaced from one of three sources: consumer spending, business investment or net exports.
Given the Northern Ireland domestic market is so small, that realistically means that economic growth will depend on our companies selling more goods and services in export markets.
Export-led growth is not easy - it will be even harder if China has a hard landing.
