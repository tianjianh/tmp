[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan moved within one point of Super League leaders Castleford with an eight-try win against Catalans Dragons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three Wigan tries in five minutes, two for Tom Davies and one for Joe Burgess, established a 16-0 lead for the hosts.
But Catalans were level at 16-16 by half-time through Fouad Yaha, Tony Gigot and Louis Anderson.
Wigan's Liam Forsyth and Anderson swapped tries before Forsyth, Burgess, Liam Marshall and Liam Farrell touched down for match-clinching scores.
The victory was Warriors' third in succession and lifted Shaun Wane's side up to third in the table, above Salford, who beat Toronto Wolfpack in the Challenge Cup fifth round on Sunday.
Castleford's defeat at Hull FC means the top five clubs in Super League are separated by only two points.
Wigan assistant coach John Winder: "In the first half we were just a bit slack with the ball.
"Our completion rate was around 50% at half-time, so we just turned over too much cheap ball. They are too good a side to do that to and they took some chances on last play and came up with some points.
"Going in at 16-16 we were really disappointed, but in the second half we controlled the ball a lot better, probably simplified it a bit and played more direct and got the result."
Catalans head coach Laurent Frayssinous: "In effect it was the start that did us.
"The errors we made with the ball cost us because we had to defend a lot.
"Our errors with the ball in the first half cost us and so did our defence in the second. We know what we need to work on."
