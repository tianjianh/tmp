Liverpool rat reports 'up by a third since 2014'

Reported rat sightings in Liverpool have increased by a third in the last two years, the city council said.

More than 7,000 calls were made to the local authority in 2015, compared with 5,374 in 2013.
Liverpool City Council cut its 2014-15 pest control budget by Â£213,597 and plans a further Â£745,809 cut by 2017.
But, Councillor Steve Munby said the rise in the number of calls was not "primarily to do with reductions in the number of people in pest control".
"It is a problem we have to try and manage," he told the BBC's Inside Out North West programme.
The latest figures do not include calls to private pest control services, so the true number is likely to be considerably higher.
Merseyside was identified as a leading "pest hotspot" in 2014 by the British Pest Control Association, with Liverpool second only to Birmingham in terms of rat call-outs.
The association has warned government spending cuts could spark "an explosion" in the pest population.
Adam Hawley, chairman of the National Pest Technicians' Association, said the government's austerity measures have "had a huge impact on environmental departments".
"Pest control services have been done away with or reduced down to an absolute minimum," he added.
"Staff can only try and do their best... so the service they provide may not be as good as they want to provide because they simply can't afford to do it."
But Mr Munby, Liverpool council's cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said the rise was "more likely to be to do with other changes in the city".
"We've got one of the highest proportions of terraced properties in the country," he added. "There's a lot of building work gone on... so that creates problems."
Also, "new businesses... a growing student population and the growth in takeaways" tend to create "environmental problems which in turn encourage a rodent population".
"It's a problem that doesn't go away and you can't ever take your eye off. I'm not the Pied Piper of Hamelin - I can't lead all the rodents out of town by playing on the flute - I wish I could."
