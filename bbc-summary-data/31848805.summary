One of the UK's busiest A&E departments is using Twitter to highlight how staff deal with meeting the government's four-hour waiting time target.

University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said by showing people the workings of the department, "warts and all", it hoped to improve services.
It currently treats about 90% of patients within the time, against a target of 95%.
The trust has 12,000 staff and sees over one million patients a year.
Richard Mitchell, chief operating officer, said: "There are two aims to the day - the first is to give the public an insight into life in one of the NHS's busiest emergency departments and show what happens here every single day of the year.
"The second is to explain that emergency performance is not just an issue for the A&E at the Royal Infirmary - it is an issue for all of our hospitals and health partners."
Mr Mitchell added: "We have made lots of progress over the past 12 months but getting feedback from the public will help us to improve further."
The trust runs three hospitals in Leicester - the Royal Infirmary, General and Glenfield.
Messages posted on Twitter include cases studies, staff profiles, ambulance requests and information about how different departments work.
