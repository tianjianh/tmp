Robots will eventually help carry out less invasive surgery in areas such as ear, nose and throat, and urology.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the "advanced facilities" would attract specialists to Wales and give patients the latest treatment.
A prostate surgery robot at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff will also be given extra funding.
The cash will boost facilities for training doctors from hospitals across south Wales in robotic surgery.
Professor Andrew Davies, chair of Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, said: "This is great news for patients as it will allow our doctors and nurses to improve and extend their skills and surgical techniques."
