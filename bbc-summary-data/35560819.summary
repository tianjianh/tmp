[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The streets of a new housing estate in a Greater Manchester town are to be named after miners who died in a Victorian pit disaster.

The homes at Walmsley Farm, Leigh, are being built close to where Bedford Colliery once stood.
The colliery, which operated from 1874 until it closed in 1967, was rocked by an explosion on 13 August 1886, where 38 miners lost their lives.
Wigan Council is to name 13 streets after some of the men who died.
David Molyneux, the council's cabinet member for regeneration, said: "The mining industry will always be an incredibly important part of our history as it helped shape the borough we have today.
"Many of us have ancestors who toiled away deep below the ground in this extremely dangerous job.
"It's therefore important that we keep our mining heritage alive in a meaningful way."
As well as the streets bearing individual names, Wood End Way will be named after Wood End Colliery - the original name of Bedford Colliery.
A memorial for the victims of the disaster stands in Leigh Cemetery.
