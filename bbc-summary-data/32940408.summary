Drink-driving offences have fallen in Scotland following the introduction of a lower alcohol limit.

New figures show that the number of offences fell by 17% in the first three months of the year.
In December a lower drink-drive limit came into force, meaning just one drink could mean a driver was breaking the law.
Police data shows the number of offences fell from 1,209 to 997 over the same period in 2014.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "Since the introduction of the new lower drink-drive limit six months ago, Scotland is starting to see a real change in behaviour.
"The 17% reduction in drink-driving offences indicates that Scottish drivers are avoiding alcohol when they are driving.
"Fewer drink-driving offences is a positive story for Scotland and shows that we're leading social and legislative change in the UK."
The figures were revealed as Police Scotland launched its summer drink-drive campaign.
Ch Supt Iain Murray, head of road policing, said: "Police stop more than 20,000 Scottish drivers a month. That's one vehicle every two minutes.
"If you have committed an offence, or if we have reasonable cause to suspect that you have been drinking, you may be subjected to a breath test.
"Even if you're just over the limit, you're still a drunk-driver in the eyes of the law - there is no grey area."
He added: "This may affect your current and future employment, and can have wider implications for other areas of your life including overseas travel, even just for family holidays. If you drink and drive, you won't just spoil summer."
