Terry Hill, from Bridgend, was involved in a collision on the A4233 near Wattstown, Porth, at 22:00 BST on Thursday.
The 45-year-old was described as "a pillar" to his family and the community through his involvement as a rugby coach and with a brass band.
A man, 40, from Ferndale, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and police have appealed for witnesses.
Mr Hill, from the Broadlands area of Bridgend, coached Bridgend Athletic under 15s rugby team and was a member of Tylorstown Brass Band.
A tribute from his family, released by police, said: "Terry was a much-loved and devoted husband, father, son and brother. He was a pillar, not only to his family, but the wider community.
"The family is devastated by this tragic event and Terry will never be replaced."
