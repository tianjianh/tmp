The 22-year-old Grimsby-born javelin thrower won gold in Rio in the F46 category, with a throw of 43.01m.
Christina McGilligan-Fell, Mayor of North East Lincolnshire, hosted the private reception at Grimsby Town Hall.
Arnold, who now lives and trains in Cardiff, broke the world record on her way to the gold medal.
A private party with family and friends was held for her on Saturday at Holten Le Clay Cricket Club near Grimsby.
Arnold, who started her career at Cleethorpes Athletics Club, said: "I feel so happy but it just hasn't sunk in yet.
"This gold medal was not just me, it was all my family and friends behind me, and support from everybody at the GB team."
