The 41-year-old, who joined the BBC in 2008, said she was "mega-excited" if "petrified" to be taking part in the BBC One ratings hit.
"I'm going to give it my very best and enjoy what's bound to be a great adventure," she continued.
Munchetty, a keen golfer, also revealed she has known she would be taking part since February.
Only her husband knew she would be following in the footsteps of former BBC Breakfast presenters Natasha Kaplinsky and Bill Turnbull, she said on Thursday.
"I never thought I'd have the courage to say yes, but it would be simply silly to turn down the chance to learn to dance with a professional," Munchetty said.
The broadcaster, who started out career as a financial journalist on the London Evening Standard, said she was "equally excited, nervous and scared".
Munchetty's involvement was announced by BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood - herself a Strictly contestant - at the end of Thursday's programme.
Ed Balls, Daisy Lowe, Danny Mac, Melvin Odoom, Louise Redknapp, Ore Oduba, Laura Whitmore and Will Young are the other confirmed celebrities.
