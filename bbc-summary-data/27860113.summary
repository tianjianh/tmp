After criticism over high profile cases of abuse, the company admits it faces "new challenges".
"We continue to learn from incidents like that," said Twitter's director of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Sinead McSweeney.

Ms McSweeney was talking with Newsbeat's technology reporter Johathan Blake.
