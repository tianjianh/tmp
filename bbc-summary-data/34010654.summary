Porthmadog art deco Coliseum cinema faces demolition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An art deco cinema in Gwynedd is facing demolition after concerns bats might be roosting inside proved unfounded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Coliseum in Porthmadog closed in 2011 because of falling attendances after 80 years of entertaining crowds.
An application to flatten the site in 2014 was put on hold to check for protected bats.
The findings and a new application to demolish the cinema have now been submitted to Gwynedd council.
A decision on the plans is expected in September.
