[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was accused of harassing Reah Mansoor, 19, over four years but the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the allegation at Manchester Crown Court.
The West Ham star, 21, who is on loan at Cardiff City, denies three remaining charges of assault against Miss Mansoor and her mother, Parveen Mansoor.
He will stand trial on 26 January.
Mr Morrison, who is originally from Manchester, pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault by beating and one of assault causing actual bodily harm on 24 July.
The midfielder was bailed on condition he lives at an address in Cardiff and does not contact his ex-girlfriend and Ms Mansoor, 39.
He cannot enter the Greater Manchester area unless he has a court appearance or when he plays in his professional capacity.
Mr Morrison played for Manchester United and appeared in the League Cup before former manager Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for Â£650,000 in January 2012.
West Ham manager Sam Allardyce later loaned him to Birmingham and Queens Park Rangers.
Mr Morrison, who has four England Under-21 caps, is currently playing for Championship club Cardiff City on a three-month loan deal.
