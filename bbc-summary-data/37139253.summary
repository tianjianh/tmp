[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 2-3 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe stayed top of League Two after coming from two down to beat 10-man Accrington Stanley in the Lancashire derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stanley were wasteful early on with the best chance Billy Kee's strike which was tipped away by Barry Roche on 12 minutes.
The goal was coming and it was Kee who opened his account for the season in the 27th minute when Morecambe lost the ball on the edge of the area and the striker dinked it over Roche.
The Shrimps keeper then kept out John O'Sullivan's fierce strike but could not stop a second for Kee when the ball came to him at the far post from O'Sullivan and he slotted home on 34 minutes.
The turning point came on 36 minutes when Stanley defender Mark Hughes was shown red for pulling back Shrimps striker Cole Stockton, who was judged to be through on goal.
Morecambe got back in it on the stroke of half-time when Liam Wakefield's corner was headed home by striker Stockton, on loan from Tranmere.
Seconds after the re-start it was 2-2 when Kevin Ellison got the ball around 10 yards out and rifled it into the top of the net.
They should have had a third when Stockton got the ball with Elliot Parish stranded but Matty Pearson superbly blocked the goal-bound effort.
But it soon came on 57 minutes when Stockton latched onto Ellison's ball and rifled past Parish to secure the victory despite the 10 men forcing pressure at the end.
