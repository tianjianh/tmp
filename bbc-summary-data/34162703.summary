The veterans, led by Cayle Royce will take on the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge later this year.
Trooper Royce, 29, from Dartmouth in Devon, suffered serious injuries serving in Afghanistan that put him in a coma for several months.
He will be joined by Paddy Gallagher, of Cambridgeshire, Nigel Rogof, from Hereford and Devon's Lee Spencer.
