The European Commission has stepped up pressure on Google, alleging that it abused its dominance in internet shopping and restricted competition.

It also accused Google of stopping websites from showing adverts from the search engine's competitors.
And it strengthened an existing charge that Google favours its own comparison shopping services in search results.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had no right to limit its rivals.
She said: "Google has come up with many innovative products that have made a difference to our lives. But that doesn't give Google the right to deny other companies the chance to compete and innovate."
Google is already facing formal anti-trust charges over claims that it abused the dominant position of its Android operating system.
The US company is accused of placing onerous requirements on firms using Android and stifling competition.
A spokesperson for Google said on Thursday: "We believe that our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for European consumers and promote competition.
"We'll examine the Commission's renewed cases and provide a detailed response in the coming weeks."
