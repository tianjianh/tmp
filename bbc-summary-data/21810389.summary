The blast happened during a religious celebration in Jesus Tepactepec, a village in Tlaxcala state.
Villagers had been taking part in a procession when a firework accidentally landed on the vehicle, reports say.
Fourteen ambulances, a mobile medical unit and two air ambulances were sent to the village to treat the wounded.
Many of the injured were taken to hospital in neighbouring Puebla state.
"My God, this is a tragedy," said the Bishop of Tlaxcala, Francisco Moreno, who was at the scene of the explosion.
The state governor, Mariano Gonzalez, ordered all hospitals in the region to treat the victims of the explosion.
"People were taking part in a religious procession in Jesus Tepactepec when a rocket landed on a truck carrying a large quantity of fireworks," said the civil protection director for Tlaxcala state, Jose Mateo Morales.
He said the number of victims could increase, as the street was full of people making preparations for the celebration of the village's patron saint, Jesusito.
