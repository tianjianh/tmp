[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aleshia McLaverty given suspended sentence for abandoning starved pet dog

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman whose pet dog died after she left the abandoned animal trapped in a flat without food or water has been given a suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The black Labrador was found dead by animal welfare officers who called to a flat in the Greystone estate in Antrim.
The starved dog died entangled in a window blind, probably in a failed attempt to escape, the court heard.
Its owner, Aleshia McLaverty, pleaded guilty to permitting unnecessary pain or distress to a dog under her control.
The 23-year-old, who no longer lives at or has any connection to the flat at Firmount Drive, was given a two month jail term, suspended for two years.
The judge at Antrim Magistrates' Court also banned her from keeping animals for five years.
The case against her was taken by Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, after its staff responded to a report of a dead animal at the property last April.
A prosecution lawyer described how the animal welfare officers were met with distressing sights and smells when they entered the flat.
He said the toilet bowl was dry, suggesting the dog had drank from it and there were scratch marks on packets of food consistent with the dog trying to find something to eat.
A post-mortem examination revealed the Labrador had died of dehydration and starvation, and that it was likely it had tried to jump through a window to escape but then became entangled on a blind.
During a previous hearing in the case, a judge said pictures taken at the scene were "the worst photos I have ever seen of cruelty to an animal".
A defence barrister said it was a "tragic case of passive neglect" and said the dog was trapped in the house when his client became pregnant and went to live with her mother.
He said the defendant was "very emotional and distressed" and came to the court with a "good character" and a clear record.
The judge said he had to give McLaverty credit for her guilty plea and her clear record and he suspended the jail term.
McLaverty, who also admitted being the keeper of a dog without a valid licence, was ordered to pay costs of Â£119.
