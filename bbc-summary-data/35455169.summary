[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two Championship clubs agreed a fee, thought to be about £9m, and the 25-year-old held negotiations with promotion-chasing Boro.
However, Boro said they were unable to agree personal terms with the player.
The Scotland international has scored 83 goals in 169 appearances for Blackburn, with 11 of those strikes coming this season.
Rhodes joined Blackburn from Huddersfield for £8m in 2012.
