[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Owens, 19, from Liverpool, was found with crack cocaine and heroin in a Kendal hotel.
Appearing at Carlisle Crown Court, he admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.
Cumbria Police said his phone showed he made the 160-mile round trip to Kendal almost daily for three weeks in April.
A spokesman said the force believed each trip was made to sell drugs there.
Owens, of Windsor Road, was found with 100 wraps of crack cocaine and scores of single heroin deals with a street value of Â£1,740.
Officers also found almost Â£700 in his jacket and a mobile phone used to send group texts advertising his wares.
Recorder Julian Shaw heard none of the teenager's criminal associates had been located by police and concluded he "was taking the fall for everyone".
A spokesman for the South Cumbria Drugs Unit said: "Unfortunately, drug dealers from outside of the county still think they can get away with supplying in Cumbria.
"The arrest and sentence handed down to Owens today shows that this is not the case."
