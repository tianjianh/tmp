Ricky Burns still hopes to land Las Vegas title bout with Adrien Broner

Ricky Burns says a world title fight with Adrien Broner could still happen in 2017 despite the American announcing another opponent for his next fight.

The WBA super-lightweight champion had hoped to face Broner in Las Vegas in February, but Broner will instead fight Adrian Granados that month.
"The fight is still a possibility, but I don't think it will happen until April or May," Scot Burns, 33, said.
Four-division world champion Broner faces American Granados on 11 February.
"I'll sit down with my team in the next couple of weeks and decide what's next," said Burns, who defended his WBA belt against Kiryl Relikh last month.
"I don't know what they've got planned for me, if I'm going to try to get another fight in, or go after another big name."
When Burns was preparing for Relikh, the expectation was that victory would secure a meeting with 27-year-old Broner, who was stripped of his WBA light-welterweight title in April after failing to make the weight for his fight with Britain's Ashley Theophane.
"When we're in the gym, sparring and training, I would know if I still didn't have it and Tony [Sims, his trainer] would be the first to tell me. I've definitely still got a few big nights left in me," Burns said.
"The Hydro [in Glasgow] is some venue. The last couple of fights I've been in there and, if the chance came to get one of these big names over, that would be great.
"Las Vegas was talked about, so if it is over there then I can't complain."
Burns, the first Scot to win world titles at three different weights, was talking at the launch of the North Lanarkshire Sporting Hall of Fame at Ravenscraig.
He is one of the potential first inductees - with nominees selected by public vote for a specially convened panel to then make the final decision on inclusion in February 2017.
Former Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby and former world snooker champion John Higgins could also be among the first 10 figures to be inducted, with the hall of fame to be housed at Ravenscraig Sports complex.
Burns hopes the initiative - the first of its kind to be launched by a local authority and which is backed by SportScotland - will inspire the next generation of sports people.
"They were saying that possibly I might be up for nomination, since people can vote to see who goes into it," Burns said. "When I started boxing, I never dreamed that I would be where I am today. If it did happen, I'd be over the moon.
"Over the years, in all different sports, hopefully the hall of fame is going to inspire the up-and-coming sports people.
"Who knows, in a few years' time, if they work hard and show the discipline they need, they might get their photos up on that wall."
