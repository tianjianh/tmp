[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones could be tempted by a big-money move to MMA - mixed martial arts - after the Tokyo 2020 Games.

Jones, 23, defended her Olympic crown at Rio 2016 and is aiming to become the first fighter in history to win three Olympic gold medals in the sport.
She competes in the World Taekwondo Grand Prix finals in Baku on Saturday.
"I'm not going to lie, it's tempting to think 'what else is out there' and in MMA people earn millions," she said.
"Taekwondo is an Olympic sport so it's hard to get sponsors and hard to make money, but I just love it."
The winner of each weight division at this week's World Taekwondo Grand Prix in Azerbaijan will earn just under £5000.
However, Jones could potentially earn over £50,000 for high-profile victories in the women's UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championships).
And with appearance fees and a share of ticket sales included, the potential prize-fund could more than double.
Ronda Rousey, who won Olympic bronze in judo at Beijing 2008, has since gone into MMA.
"Maybe into the future I'll go to MMA, but for now no-one in the sport has ever got three Olympic gold medals, so I have to continue to get that," she told BBC Sport.
The season-ending World Taekwondo Grand Prix will be Jones' first competition since winning gold in Rio and she is aiming to maintain her unbeaten record in 2016.
"I'm not in peak shape after taking a break following the Olympics, but I love a scrap and it would be amazing to finish the year off with another title," she said.
Jones headlines a six-strong GB squad selected for the event, which also features world champion Bianca Walkden and Rio Olympian Mahama Cho.
Olympic silver medallist Lutalo Muhammad has opted against competing, but his Rio 2016 understudy Damon Sansum, who won world silver last year, will fight in the -80kg division.
Full GB squad:
Jade Jones, Bianca Walkden, Rachelle Booth, Charlie Maddock, Mahama Cho, Damon Sansum.
