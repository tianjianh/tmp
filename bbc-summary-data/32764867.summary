Colin Hough, of Shrewsbury, volunteered to spend time in the box, in a 24-hour Tesco supermarket, to raise money for children's charity Cauldwell Children.
He went into the box at midday on Thursday and came out at 14:00 BST on Saturday.
He said the toughest part had been the nights, with lights on in the shop and people shopping around him.
Former bus driver Mr Hough volunteered for the challenge after reading about the charity's Locked in for Autism campaign. The box in the supermarket measures 3m by 2m.
"The store staff have been so supportive, tapping on the glass to see if I'm okay," he said.
"I was a bit nervous going into it but I thought, it's for a really good cause, and it's actually opened up my eyes to what children with autism go through.
"One little girl gave me a card she had made, thanking me for what I'm doing, that made me feel very proud."
Mr Hough can be supported through his Just Giving page.
