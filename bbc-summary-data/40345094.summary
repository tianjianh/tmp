[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His 46th first-class century ensured Leinster maintained the upper hand on the second day at Oak Hill in Wicklow.
Joyce stroked 23 fours and two sixes as Lightning posted 365 for 9 declared and a first-innings lead of 130.
Niall O'Brien (16 not out) will be key to Warriors' hopes of salvaging a draw on the final day.
Lorcan Tucker scored his maiden first-class half-century for Leinster Lightning, hitting 56 from 119 balls.
Four players got into the twenties, with John Anderson making 29, and George Dockrell, Jack Tector and Simi Singh all scoring 27.
The Warriors' attack battled manfully, with Andrew McBrine, Craig Young and David Scanlon all taking three wickets apiece.
With 17 overs to negotiate before the close of play, the Warriors were soon in difficulty yet again, losing Irosh Samarasooriya, Ross Allen and Andrew Austin to finish the day on 44 for 3, still 86 runs in arrears.
