Police re-opened an investigation into the murder of David Clarke last month after detectives received new information.
The 26-year-old, who had learning difficulties, was beaten to death in his flat at Forthriver Road on 6 June 2001.
The woman was arrested on Tuesday.
At the time, police said Mr Clarke's killing was one of the most savage and brutal they had ever dealt with.
Det Ch Insp Alan Dickson said: "I would continue to ask anyone with information to do the right thing and come forward with anything they know".
