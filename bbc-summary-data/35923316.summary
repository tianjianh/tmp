[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Durham Plan to begin again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The creation of a plan for the future development of County Durham will start again, seven years after the process first began.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham County Council withdrew its previous plan after it was called "over-ambitious" by an independent inspector.
Though the inspector's report was quashed by the High Court, the council said it would start the plan again.
The old plan had been to build 31,4000 homes and create 30,000 jobs by 2030.
The cabinet is being asked to confirm the new plan when it meets next week.
Work on the old plan started in 2009 but last year inspector Harold Stephens said it was "unsound" and assumptions about job growth were "very ambitious".
In a report to the cabinet, corporate director of regeneration Ian Thompson said there would be three stages to the new plan, which would cover the period until 2033.
He also said the information used to draw up the old plan would need "updating" and there would be public consultations with a view to submitting the new plan to the government in December 2017.
Neil Foster, Durham County Council's cabinet member for economic regeneration, said: "The council and its partners fought for the plan because we believed that it was essential in ensuring that our county did not get left behind.
"The position we now find ourselves in is unique so we are extremely pleased to announce that, after a lot of hard work, we now have a way forward for the County Durham Plan."
