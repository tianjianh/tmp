Vulcan XH558: Final flypast over East Midlands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's last flying Vulcan has flown over the East Midlands for a final flypast as part of its farewell tour.

The XH558 bomber appeared over RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, and Rutland Water after taking off from Robin Hood Airport near Doncaster.
It will make one final flight later this month before it is grounded for exhibitions.
The bomber is due to be grounded after engineering backers, including Rolls-Royce, withdrew support.
The plane also flew over Bruntingthorpe Airfield and East Midlands Airport, both in Leicestershire, and Newark in Nottinghamshire.
Bruntingthorpe was the Vulcan's first home after its RAF career and where the aircraft was restored over 14 years.
Paul Johnson, who was involved with the events at the airfield for the flypast, said: "The Victor bomber, the Vulcan's sister, was on the runway - so when the Vulcan flew over it there was a good photo opportunity for people."
Vulcans, which once operated from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, saw action during the 1982 Falklands War.
The Leicestershire-based charity Vulcan to the Sky Trust, which helps maintain and operate the aircraft, said the last remaining model left service in 1993.
