The 23 year old is expected to be registered in time to be available for Sunday's league game against Stoke.
"I am hoping that we win the Premier League and cup this season, and the Champions League," said the midfielder.
The Egyptian international played in Basel's win over Chelsea in the 2013-14 Champions League and is eligible to play in this season's competition.
Arsenal are top of the Premier League, at home to Burnley in the fourth round of the FA Cup and will face defending champions Barcelona in the last-16 of the Champions League.
