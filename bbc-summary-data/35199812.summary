Police dealt with three separate crashes where there was standing water on both sides of the carriageway between junctions 35 (Pencoed) and 36 (Sarn).
Flooding also blocked one lane on the eastbound stretch at junction 26 for Malpas but it has now reopened.
The Met Office has a weather warning for rain in place until 18:00 GMT.
Natural Resources Wales said less rain fell overnight than expected but warned some rivers would be very high, fast flowing and dangerous.
Rivers are expected to peak by early afternoon.
The railway line has been blocked at Pencoed with trains diverted between Bridgend and Cardiff Central and replacement buses will operate for the stations in between.
Localised flooding has been reported in Pontypool in Torfaen, Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, Ferryside in Carmarthenshire and Llanishen in Cardiff.
Three flood warnings are in place for the Lower Dee Valley in Wrexham, Abergwili in Carmarthenshire and Pontargothi and Pontynyswen in Carmarthenshire.
Several flood alerts have been issued across Wales.
The storm also brought winds of up to 75mph, leading to more than 1,400 properties losing power in Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea and Newport on Wednesday morning but most have since been reconnected.
The M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire was closed to high-sided vehicles, as was the Britannia Bridge at Anglesey.
On Anglesey, ferry services between Holyhead and Dublin have been cancelled while phone lines were brought down in Llansadwrn and Penmynydd.

North Wales has suffered in recent days from previous bouts of rain with homes being evacuated and chaos on the roads.
Over the weekend the A55 dual carriageway in north Wales was shut for hours due to flooding.
Drivers were forced to abandon cars while homes at Anglesey and Gwynedd were evacuated.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said Â£1m would be made available for local authorities to carry out immediate repairs and maintenance to river and drainage systems.
