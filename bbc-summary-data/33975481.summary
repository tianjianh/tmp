Cwmcarn Forest Drive trails closure 'confusion'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walkers using a south Wales forest have called for an end to "confusion" over where they can and cannot go during a major tree felling exercise.

Workers are removing 150,000 trees at Cwmcarn Forest Drive to try to stop larch disease spreading.
It has been closed for safety reasons although many foot and cycle paths are open, away from the main felling area.
"Give us a map and tell us which rights of way are open," said Robert Southall of Friends of Cwmcarn Forest.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it wants people to still enjoy the forest but temporary closures were needed close to "dangerous" felling areas.
The woodland in Caerphilly County is one of the most popular tourist attractions in south Wales, with more than 250,000 visitors a year.
Around 4,000 trees - 9,000 tonnes - have been removed from the first area of forestry in the last three months.
The main Cwmcarn Forest Drive is closed to all public traffic and car parks are full of timber ready to be taken away.
A total of 14 rights of way have been closed but the friends group wants to know if they all will remain closed for the next six months.
Andy Schofield, NRW south Wales area manager said: "The complication is we have the forest drive route, the mountain bike and walking routes and bridleways - they all attract a huge number of people trying to enjoy the woodland.
"That coupled with the steepness of the terrain, which is partly what attracts people in the first place, makes this job doubly difficult."
He added: "We don't want to stop people coming here, we have to make people aware of the dangers, put barriers up at access points and exclude people from the harvesting area."
But the problem for some is the uncertainty of where they can and cannot walk.
Ramblers say they are frustrated by what they say is a lack of coordination between NRW staff, contractors and officials at Caerphilly and Torfaen councils.
Robert Southall of Friends of Cwmcarn Forest said the information was not getting out there.
"It's very confusing. We've asked for maps of where the footpaths are open - and closed - and have had no response," he said.
"It's not an impossible job it just needs a coordinated approach and it's easy to use social media these days. Let's have some more definitive information."
Cwmcarn's trails are a magnet for bike riders and temporarily they share one path with walkers.
Cyclist Anna Cipullo said: "We can still use the trails. Felling might mean part of the trail is closed for a while but you just get diverted."
According to NRW, broadleaf trees as well as conifers will be planted after the larch have been taken away. The forest and the attractions could be changed, and developed.
New tracks are being built to move heavy machinery and after the work has been completed the forest is likely to look very different, at least until new trees start growing.
