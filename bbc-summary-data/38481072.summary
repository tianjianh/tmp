Swansea City are set to appoint Paul Clement as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Swans, bottom of the Premier League, are hopeful of completing a deal early this coming week.
Clement, the former Derby boss and current Bayern Munich assistant, has been in talks with Swansea to become the club's third manager of the season.
He was sacked by Derby in February after eight months in charge and was interviewed by Swansea before Bob Bradley's appointment.
Clement is likely to be at Selhurst Park on Tuesday when Swansea visit Crystal Palace.
He has emerged as the frontrunner for the job in recent days, after Wales boss Chris Coleman, former Manchester United assistant Ryan Giggs and former Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett were also linked with the post.

"It's hard to have sympathy with Swansea. It looks like they'll go back to the old principle of hiring a coach.
"It's going to take a miracle from Paul Clement if he's the man to save Swansea."
