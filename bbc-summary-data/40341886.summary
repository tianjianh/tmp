The 23-year-old has scored 12 tries in nine Super League appearances after an ankle injury ruled him out of the start of the season.
"He's got a significant ligament strain and that's a big blow to our team because he's been a revelation," coach Rick Stone told BBC Radio Leeds.
"He's really sparked our team in the right direction."
