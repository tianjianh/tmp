Warrington Wolves coach Tony Smith says his side need to "toughen up" following a third straight Super League defeat.

Wire were thrashed 44-4 by Huddersfield on Sunday to compound a 38-12 defeat by Salford and a 40-0 loss at Leeds.
Warrington face league leaders Castleford next and Smith knows they need to improve to stand a chance.
"We need to recover and we need to do it quickly; confidence is down but we need to work hard," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"We need to go there and not be bullied about."
Wire began the Super League season with six consecutive league defeats before a run of five wins and two draws in their next eight league games, but once again a poor period has followed.
However, despite his side suffering from numerous injuries and low confidence, Smith believes Wire can work their way back into form.
He said: "We were down on confidence early in the season and we worked our way back into a position where we were grafting out some wins. We need to go through that process again and work hard.
"We've got to toughen up and do some hard work over the next couple of weeks to get that [defence] in order because it's just not good enough at the moment."
