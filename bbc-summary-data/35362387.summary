The plants were discovered after Mersey Fire and Rescue Service was alerted to a blaze at a terraced house on Oakfield Road, Anfield, at 09:30 GMT on Monday.
About 350 plants and equipment filled three rooms and the loft of the property, which is believed to have been uninhabited.
Merseyside Police said the fire may have been caused by a make-shift system of heating and lighting in the house.
Crews discovered the blaze on the landing area.
A search revealed electricity had been taken by bridging the meter in the property.
A utility company was called to make the house safe.
Police are trying to trace those responsible for the cannabis farm.
Sgt Angie Norstrom said cannabis farms are "a huge fire hazard due to the dangerous and illegal way that the electricity supply is tampered with".
"Criminal gangs use lots of small properties such as flats or terraced houses to spread their risk... putting those residents and business owners at risk," she added.
Signs of a cannabis farm include:
