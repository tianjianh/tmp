[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angelika Wujtowicz was dropped off in Singer Street, Clydebank, at 16:00.
CCTV images later showed her boarding a train at Singer station at 21:04 that evening, and getting off at Dalreoch station at around 21:34.
Angelika is described as being 5ft 8in tall, of slim build, with very long fair hair and blue eyes.
She was last seen wearing stain-washed denim skinny jeans, a black top, a grey hoodie and black Adidas trainers.
The teenager was also carrying a black and white 'Hype' backpack.
Sgt Joe Gallacher said everyone was "very concerned about Angelika due to her age and the length of time" that she had been missing.
"Officers are conducting inquiries locally, including examining further CCTV footage and speaking to her friends to try and trace her as soon as possible," he said.
"Angelika is a pupil at Clydebank High School and has lots of friends across the Clydebank area. She also has friends in the Brucehill and Dumbarton area close to where she was last seen getting off the train.
"I would appeal to anyone with information on her whereabouts or who recognises her description to contact officers."
Sgt Gallacher added: "I would also appeal directly to Angelika to get in touch with someone to let us know she is safe, she's not in any trouble, we just want to know that she is OK."
