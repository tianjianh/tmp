Laura Robson will not use protected ranking for Australian Open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Laura Robson has decided not to use her protected ranking of 58 to gain direct entry into January's Australian Open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old has played in eight events since a 17-month lay-off with wrist problems, including the US Open.
However, playing in New York - where she lost in the first round to Elena Vesnina - means the world number 555 can only use the protected ranking to enter one more Grand Slam.
She may now instead opt to wait for the French Open.
In the meantime, Robson is likely to try and build up her ranking at smaller events.
Four other Britons - Andy Murray, Aljaz Bedene, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson - all gain direct entry into the draw in Melbourne.
Kyle Edmund is currently the third alternate for the men's singles, meaning he stands a good chance of avoiding the qualifying competition.
