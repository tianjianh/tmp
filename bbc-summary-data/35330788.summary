The home side were in control after full-back Damien McCrory thumped home a low first-half shot from 20 yards.
Nasser El Khayati almost added a second, but Jon McLaughlin failed to hold a corner allowing striker Andy Mangan to net Shrewsbury's equaliser.
Mason Bennett headed El Khayati's cross over before Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro set up Whalley's 93rd minute winner.
Burton surrendered top spot in League One to Gillingham, who moved above them on goal difference, while Shrewsbury moved out of the relegation zone into 20th place.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:
"It's disappointing that we've lost the game having been 1-0 up.
"I don't think we then did enough to go and get that second goal. We started the second half well and positively, then their goal has come out the blue. I did think it was a foul.
"At least nine times out of 10 you get those given - when a goalkeeper goes up, catches the ball and has the opposition interfere with him. The majority of the time you get those decisions. We didn't get one today."
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"It's a fantastic result. We always knew with the pace of our players that we might grab a winner. Shaun Whalley has done fantastically to get on the end of it.
"There is still work to be done, but we have shown quality to come here to a side like Burton Albion and get a result. We have to try and put a bit of a run together now.
"The game was full of fine margins and we were disappointed to go a goal down, but it was nice to get a goal to equalise from the set-piece at that moment."
