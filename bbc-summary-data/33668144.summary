Croagh Patrick: Pilgrims climb holy mountain despite safety warnings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people are climbing Ireland's holy mountain, Croagh Patrick, despite the annual pilgrimage being cancelled for safety reasons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 30,000 pilgrims traditionally climb the County Mayo peak on the last Sunday in July, known as "Reek Sunday".
It is a custom that dates back 1,500 years. Some complete the climb barefoot and in the dark, commemorating St Patrick's ascent to the summit.
But this year, the event was cancelled due to heavy rain and strong winds.
Irish state broadcaster, RTÃ‰, reported that police agreed conditions on the mountain were unsafe.
It said the winds had damaged medical stations set up in advance of the event and also smashed glass panels in a small chapel on the summit.
Mayo County Council, Civil Defence, the Order of Malta charity and Mayo Mountain Rescue were consulted before a decision was made to cancel the climb.
A police officer said the weather was "extremely treacherous" with the possibility of high winds and rain.
Despite the safety warnings, hundreds of people have decided to proceed with the climb. Seasoned climbers said the weather had never been as bad as this year.
The tradition of climbing the 764m high mountain on the last Sunday in July stretches back to 441 AD.
It was then that Saint Patrick reputedly fasted on the summit for 40 days and 40 nights, following the example of Jesus Christ and Moses.
More than 100,000 people visit the mountain every year.
The ancient custom for the most devout climbers has been to make the pilgrimage up the 45-degree slope of loose shale and stones of  the mountain "barefoot and blind" - at night-time and not wearing footwear.
