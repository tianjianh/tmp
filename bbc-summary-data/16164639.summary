Taiwan country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taiwan is an island which has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.
China insists that nations cannot have official relations with both China and Taiwan, with the result that Taiwan has formal diplomatic ties with only a few countries. The US is Taiwan's most important friend and protector.
Despite its diplomatic isolation, Taiwan has become one of Asia's big traders. It is considered to have achieved an economic miracle, becoming one of the world's top producers of computer technology.
Population 23,3 million
Area 36,188 sq km (13,972 sq miles)
Major languages Mandarin Chinese (official), Min Nan Chinese (Taiwanese), Hakka
Major religions Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity
Life expectancy 76,2 years (men), 82,7 years (women)
Currency New Taiwan dollar
President: Tsai Ing-wen
Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan's first female president when she won the election in January 2016.
With 56% of the vote, she led her traditionally independence-leaning Democratic People's Party (DPP) to their biggest ever victory in parliamentary elections.
Ms Tsai's political message has always revolved around the importance of Taiwanese identity and she has pledged that democracy will be at the heart of the island's future relations with China.
By pursuing Taiwanese sovereignty, Ms Tsai runs the risk of antagonising China, reversing eight years of warmer ties under former President Ma Ying-jeou of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang party.
In the 1990s, Ms Tsai negotiated Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization. She joined the DPP in 2004 after working as a non-partisan chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. Four years later she became the youngest person and first woman to lead the party. She lost the presidential election to Ma Ying-jeou in 2012.
A former law professor, she hails from the coastal village of Pingtung in southern Taiwan. Her mixed ethnicity - a Hakka father and Taiwanese mother - has been cited as one of the traits that helped her connect with voters.
The media environment in Taiwan is among the freest in Asia, and extremely competitive.
There are hundreds of newspapers, all privately-owned and reflecting a wide range of views. Laws which prohibit the promotion of independence from China or communism are not generally enforced.
Internet penetration is estimated at 80% of the population.
