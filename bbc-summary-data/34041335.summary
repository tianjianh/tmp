The 20-year-old, who never played a first-team game for the Potters, scored twice in two games for Town's Under-21 side while on trial.
He also had loan spells at five clubs, including Scunthorpe, Mansfield and Accrington, scoring one goal in 16 senior appearances in total.
"I see this as the start of my career now," Alabi told the club website.
"I don't think I have really had the opportunities at other clubs, but the manager here has told me to come in, work hard and we will see what happens."
Meanwhile, 18-year-old defender Myles Kenlock has signed a two-year deal at Portman Road.
