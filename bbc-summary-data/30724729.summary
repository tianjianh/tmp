Bernard Jordan sparked a police search when he left the care home in Hove to join fellow veterans in June.
Irene Jordan, 88, died on Tuesday - a week after her husband. They were married for more than 65 years.
The couple had been living at The Pines care home in Hove. A commemoration service will be held on 30 January.
Brian Fitch, mayor of Brighton and Hove, said: "They were a very close couple who will both be sadly missed.
"They were a devoted couple. After he had gone, she probably gave up the will."
Mr Jordan died in hospital, aged 90, on 30 December.
In June, he left The Pines and travelled to the D-Day events in Normandy, wearing his war medals.
He joined British veterans, many making the final journey to visit the scene of the invasion and to commemorate their fallen comrades.
Mr Jordan was later made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove.
Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare, which runs The Pines, said: "Irene and Bernie will both be much missed by everyone at the home and our thoughts and prayers go out to their friends and family at this sad time."
