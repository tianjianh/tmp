Yann Kermorgant went close for the Royals from Oliver Norwood's corner but his volley was cleared off the line by Joe Newell.
Reading led after the break when Robson-Kanu did well to work the ball home from 18 yards.
Rotherham almost forced a late leveller as Ali Al Habsi was forced to collect Jerome Thomas's deflected cross.
The result means Reading rise to 14th in the table thanks to winning a first Championship match since their 1-0 victory against Bristol City on 2 January.
Meanwhile the Millers are now six points adrift of safety and just a point from the foot of the Championship in 22nd place.
Reading manager Brian McDermott told BBC Radio Berkshire:

"It was an ugly 1-0 win, but we'll take that. A bit of quality has won it. But that win is as important as Saturday's (versus West Brom).
"We have come out of the wrong side of those results over a long period of time. We're now getting the right side of those results.
"There's 46 games in the Championship, you'll get games like that, but the most important thing is to see them through and win them.
"We just need to concentrate on the moment that we're in. I just wish we had 24 games to go, not 14."
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock:
"We have lost it to a mistake and we should know better. That's why we are down there.
"We have shot ourselves in the foot. We have given ourselves a chance of getting results in the games, we are just lacking a bit of quality.
"I have only been in here for three games, I think I would be on anti-depressants if I'd been here all season."
