His manager said the 69-year-old singer was "doing well" and could be released as early as Tuesday morning.
Sebastien Farran told France's RTL radio that he had been treated for bronchitis.
Earlier, French media reports suggested he was suffering from tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat.
Mr Hallyday is "determined to return shortly or to leave for Los Angeles," Mr Farran said, adding that he would leave hospital "this morning - in the coming hours, or on Wednesday".
Mr Hallyday, on holiday on the island of Saint-Barthelemy, had been recording a new album, expected to be released in November.
Mr Farran explained that the singer, hugely popular in France, was taken to hospital when he began to get irregular breathing.
"[He] could leave straight away but those close to him, and he too, prefer that he stays and does some more tests," he added.
Initially, Mr Hallyday was treated at a hospital in Pointe-a-Pitre, on the island of Guadeloupe, having been flown there by helicopter from Saint-Barthelemy.
He was transferred on Monday to a facility in Fort-de-France, Martinique, for further examinations.
Earlier, French news channel TF1 had said he was in intensive care and was conscious.
In December 2009, Hallyday fell gravely ill after a hernia operation and was briefly put into an induced coma in a Los Angeles hospital.
