The accident happened on Sunday morning, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Julia Creek in north-west Queensland.
Three train staff are in hospital with minor injuries. The site was quickly declared an emergency and the 2km exclusion zone was imposed.
The extent of any acid leakage remains unclear, says Queensland Police, who added that local flooding has hampered access to the site.
