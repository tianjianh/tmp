Rosie Ellison from Film Edinburgh said the city's "film-friendly" policy was paying dividends, with the two movies picking up eight awards nominations.
Ms Ellison also welcomed reports of ambitious new plans for a film studio in the Edinburgh area.
She said: "It could only be a positive for the east of Scotland."
A planning application has been submitted for a £40m Pentland Studios project in the Straiton area, which would offer studio space and production facilities that could attract major film-makers.
Creative Scotland has ringfenced £1m towards the cost of a Scottish studio, while the Scottish government has pledged a further £2m loan.
It has been reported that the Pentland studio plans have been extended to provide space for constructing huge sets.
Ms Ellison said: "I am excited by the opportunity of the studios.
"The Pentland plans keep getting bigger. It would bring a lot of production to the area and could only be a positive for the east of Scotland, meaning large-scale productions would have easier access to locations in the Borders and East Lothian as well as Edinburgh."
She said recent films successes such as Sunshine on Leith and Filth showed that the city's policy of getting decisions on filming made quickly was working.
Other films such as the Railway Man and Under the Skin have also recently used the east of Scotland as a location.
Ms Ellison said other recent film success such as One Day had proved a great tourist draw for Edinburgh.
The nominations for the Bafta Scotland awards, to be presented on Sunday 16 November, give the nod to Sunshine on Leith in five categories and Filth in three.
As well as best film, Sunshine on Leith, a musical based on the songs of the Proclaimers, has nominations for Peter Mullan as Best Actor and both Jane Horrocks and Freya Mavor for Best Actress.

Filth, an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's controversial novel, is nominated for Best Film, its star James McAvoy and director Jon S Baird receive nods for Best Actor and Director respectively.
