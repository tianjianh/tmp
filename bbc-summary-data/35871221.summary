'Dangerous' pavements in Surrey to get £20m repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 miles of broken pavements are to be repaired across Surrey as part of a multi-million pound revamp of the county's footpaths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surrey County Council has allocated £20m for the repairs, which will be carried out over six years.
It has prioritised footpaths outside schools, hospitals and shopping centres.
Cabinet member for highways John Furey said some paths are "dangerous" and inaccessible to disabled people.
Pavements listed for early repairs include Southway in Guildford, Godstone Road in Caterham, Windfield in Leatherhead and Banstead Road in Ewell.
The authority said some paths would be smoothed over, while the worst would be "torn up and reconstructed from scratch".
