[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traders have voted in favour of turning the centre of York into a Business Improvement District (BID).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 900 firms will contribute to an annual budget of more than Â£800,000 for projects to improve the city centre over the next five years.
Of the 42% of businesses who voted, 76% were in favour.
Firms will pay an extra levy of 1% on top of business rates to fund the initiatives.
Adam Sinclair, York BID chairman, said: "We will now respond to our members and focus on street cleaning, rubbish collection, safety, the public realm, car parking, Christmas lights, street events and the evening economy.
"York city centre is ambitious but needs to inspire and satisfy its marketplace and thereby attract fresh investment."
BID, which is supported by the city council, is expected to begin work in April 2016.
