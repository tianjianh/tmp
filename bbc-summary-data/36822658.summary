The aircraft, a former military helicopter, crashed at the side of the runway at Breighton Aerodrome, near Selby, at about 18:00 BST on Sunday during a private flight.
All five were taken to hospital - two by air ambulance, police said.
The Air Accident Investigation Branch said: "An investigation is under way and we will report in due course."
The casualties suffered various head, back, chest and leg injuries, officials said.
An eyewitness told the BBC he was about 200 yards away from the scene when he heard a "loud bang" before the helicopter crashed to the ground.
He said he saw people running to help pull the passengers out.
The BBC has been told the aircraft was an Alouette helicopter and was previously owned by the army.
It is also understood the helicopter was coming into land when it crashed.
According to the airfield's website, a 1940's themed event had been taking place over the weekend, which was attended by private owners of classic aircrafts.
North Yorkshire Fire Service said all of the men were out of the helicopter when rescuers arrived.
The wreckage of the helicopter, said to have come down on grass at the side of the runway, has since been taken away.
Breighton Aerodrome is a former World War Two bomber base and is home to a classic aircraft collection.
