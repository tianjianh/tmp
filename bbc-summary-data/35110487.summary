Building trades dominate for drink- and drug-driving

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manual workers in the building industry appear to have the worst records for drink- and drug-driving convictions.

The figures have been compiled by the price comparison website MoneySuperMarket from its own records.
The website looked at the details given by 11 million people who sought car insurance quotes in the past year.
Scaffolders had the highest rate of convictions at 5.7 per 1,000 drivers, while typists had the lowest rate at just 0.021 per 1,000.
Other types of employees in the top 10 for drink- and drug-driving convictions were ground workers, building labourers, roofers, labourers, road workers, plasterers, soldiers, bricklayers and fitters.
Kevin Pratt at MoneySuperMarket, said: "Although it's no excuse, perhaps it's not surprising that manual labour jobs are most likely to have a drink or drug conviction as the desire to relax with a pint, after a long strenuous day, could be high."
"The only job in the top 10 which bucks the trend is a soldier - but that's still a very physical job."
The jobs with the lowest rates of admitted convictions - after typists - were police officers, clerks, health visitors, driving instructors, taxi drivers, nursery workers, occupational therapists, vets and building society clerks.
