Police said Stephen Muncaster, 47, was found shortly after midnight in the front garden of a property in Magdalen, near King's Lynn, while his wife Allison, 48, was discovered inside.
Det Supt Paul Durham said: "There is no evidence to suggest that anyone else was involved in this incident."
Mr Muncaster was the uncle of Michael Carroll, who made headlines in 2002 by winning Â£9.7m in the National Lottery.

Det Supt Durham said it was thought both victims "died from gunshot wounds" and a gun was found at the scene.
Greig Dunsmuir, who lives in the village, said he heard a "loud boom" on Stow Road shortly after midnight.
He added: "I heard a gunshot and some commotion, people shouting and screaming.
"It wasn't drawn out - maybe three or four minutes of commotion, and that's it.
"I didn't think any more of it until this morning."
The East of England Ambulance Service said it was called at 00:08 BST and found two people who were declared dead at the scene.
Det Supt Durham said: "We are in the very early stages of the investigation and while I understand how shocking the news of this incident must be for neighbours of the two people involved, and other local residents, I can reassure them we are putting all our efforts into establishing the circumstances surrounding their deaths."
A cordon has been set up around the scene while forensic examinations are carried out.
Paul Tibbs, a photographer from King's Lynn, said: "As news filters around the village, obviously there will be a definite sense of shock."
Magdalen lies to the west of the River Great Ouse, eight miles (12km) south of King's Lynn.
It is within the parish of Wiggenall St Mary Magdalen and has a population of just over 700 people.
