The Scot finished second behind Katinka Hosszu of Hungary, while fellow Briton Aimee Willmott finished fourth.
World champion Adam Peaty and Ross Murdoch won their 100m breaststroke semi-finals to qualify for Tuesday's final as the two fastest swimmers.
Fran Halsall won her 50m butterfly semi-final with an impressive swim.
"It was never going to be my fastest tonight but for me it's important to focus on making sure my fastest comes in the summer and that is what I'm working towards," Miley said.
Stephen Milne came last in the 400m freestyle final but Britain's world silver medallist James Guy failed to reach the final after finishing 27th in the morning's heats.
Guy is among the favourites to challenge for a medal at the Olympics, but is still in heavy training and competed in old-school trunks.
The 20-year-old, who also raced with a small beard, said he was trying something new and was going to return later to do a 5km training session.
"I'm just focusing on myself. All the main guys heading to Rio are working for that," he said.
"The first 200 felt all right but I felt a bit sick at 250/275 but I just got on with it. I knew it was going to be a hard swim. This is part of the training, that's it."
Two-time Olympic champion Becky Adlington said: "We know James is capable but it's a shame he missed out on getting into the final and getting a medal.
"But I think he's learnt from this experience, he won't wear trunks again, and will come back fighting in his other events this week."
"It's great to come to one of the greatest pools on earth and have a home crowd behind you," world record holder Peaty told BBC Sport.
"All I do is swim as fast as I can. I don't really feel the pressure. I'm just having fun out there and hoping to entertain the crowd."
Halsall goes into Tuesday's final with a quicker time than the world record holder and world champion Sarah Sjoestroem of Sweden.
"That was the second best time ever for me," she said after recording 25.35secs. "I don't know where that came from at this time of year but having the home crowd behind you is a great advantage."
Ben Proud won his 50m butterfly semi-final in 23.42 and was second fastest into the final behind Andriy Govorov of Ukraine.
But he missed out on a medal in the 4x100m relay final, as Britain finished in seventh place.
Defending champion Chris Walker-Hebborn, another swimmer still in heavy training, missed out on qualifying for the final of the men's 100m backstroke after finishing 12th in the semi-finals.
