[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highways England announced Atkins/Arup will devise a preferred route to be taken to public consultation as part of the Â£15bn improvement project.
A bypass of Winterbourne Stoke also forms part of the plan for the heavily congested stretch of road between Amesbury and Berwick Down.
The A303 is a key route in the area and links London with the south west.
Andrew Alcorn of Highways England, said: "This award takes us another step closer to our commitment to deliver the A303 Amesbury to Berwick Down improvement scheme.
"Now we have Atkins/Arup on board to help with developing options for the scheme and pre-construction planning, we will be able to take the next step towards making this scheme a reality."
The Â£17.5m design contract has been awarded under a government investment scheme aimed at delivering "large-scale improvements to England's strategic roads".
Following the preferred route announcement, Highways England will draw up a development consent order application, which will be examined in public by the Planning Inspectorate, before a final decision by the Transport Secretary.
Work on the proposed scheme is expected to start by April 2020.
