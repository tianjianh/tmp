Walliams is writing an as-yet untitled book, while Dame Jacqueline has created the new story Butterfly Beach.
There will be 10 books on offer, aimed at children from pre-school to teenagers.
Children in the UK and Ireland will be given a £1 book token to use to claim their free World Book Day title.
The tokens will be handed out in schools and nurseries from January and can be used in participating bookshops and supermarkets from 27 February to 26 March 2017.
Dame Julia, who created The Gruffalo, has teamed up with author and illustrator Lydia Monks for Princess Mirror-Belle and Snow White.
World Book Day director Kirsten Grant said the reading for pleasure charity was "about creating readers for the future by igniting a love of books and reading in children and young people."
"It's about encouraging them to visit their local bookshop and empowering them to make their own choices about the kinds of books they want to read," she said.
"What better way to do this than offering them stories from the best writing and illustrating talent being published in the UK and Ireland today?"
Other authors with books on the £1 list include Horrid Henry writer Francesca Simon with Funny Fact Files and young adult author David Almond is releasing Island.
The list also includes writing by classic author Enid Blyton and a new story about long-time favourite Peppa Pig.
World Book Day - a Unesco designated charity - will be celebrating its 20th birthday in 2017 and the £1 book initiative follows on from last year, when the charity provided 789,738 books at the knock-down price.
During its 19-year history, World Book Day has provided a total of 13 million £1 books to young people.
