But, despite her remarkable achievement, Ren is already too old to rewrite the record books.
From a 10-year-old Greek gymnast, to an American prodigy who later divorced her parents, BBC Sport looks back at some of the youngest Olympic medallists in history.
While no athlete has won Olympic gold before hitting their teenage years, there has been a preadolescent medallist - all the way back in 1896.
Greek gymnast Dimitrios Loundras was only 10 years old when he won a bronze medal in the team event at his home Olympics in Athens.
Most 13-year-olds will spend this summer engrossed in Pokemon Go and playing out with their friends. Back in 1936, American diver Marjorie Gestring was winning Olympic gold.
A specialist in the art of mixing pikes, twists and somersaults, Gestring remains the youngest Olympic champion, having won the 3m springboard event in Berlin.
She was denied the opportunity to defend her title when the outbreak of World War II caused the postponement of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics, but did attempt to reach the 1948 London Games.
However, her talent had faded and she failed to make the US team.
Fu came to attention - aged just 11 - when she won gold at the 1990 Goodwill Games, and became the world champion a year later.
But it was at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona that she became a household name across the world.
She won the 10m platform with a score of 461.43 points, almost 50 ahead of her nearest rival.
Fu went on to win four more Olympic medals, making her the most successful female diver in Olympic history until she was overtaken by compatriots Chen Ruolin and Wu Minxia.
Until the 1976 Olympics, no-one had achieved a perfect score in gymnastics. A 14-year-old Romanian, competing at her first Games, changed that.
Nadia Comaneci was given a 10 by the judges in Montreal for her opening 30-second routine on the uneven bars.
"I had no idea it was the first time in the history of the Olympics, I just knew it was the highest score I could get," she told the BBC.
"I was really happy. It was like being in school and getting a 10 in a maths test."
Comaneci won three golds at the Montreal Olympics, and another two four years later.
American gymnast Dominique Moceanu's path to Olympic stardom was plotted by her father - Romanian gymnast Dumitru Moceanu - before she was born.
By the age of two she was swinging from the washing line and at 10 she was being driven hundreds of miles to a specialist trainer.
At 14 she had an autobiography and, in 1996, was the youngest member of the USA's "magnificent seven" Olympic gymnastics team, which won gold in Atlanta.
But the dream turned into a nightmare for Moceanu, who sought a "divorce" from her parents aged 17.
Though the name Sarah Hardcastle may not be instantly recognisable to many Britons, she does hold a special place in the nation's Olympic record books.
At the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, she became the youngest British woman to win an Olympic medal when she took silver in the 400m freestyle.
She grew disillusioned with the sport, deciding to quit aged 17 after the 1986 Commonwealth Games, but made a comeback to reach the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta.
