[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republic of Ireland will take on the Netherlands in their final friendly in Dublin before the Euro 2016 finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The match at the Aviva Stadium will be played on May 27, just over a fortnight before the Republic's Group E opener against Sweden, on 13 June.
The Dutch, who failed to qualify for the finals, beat the Irish 4-0 in the last game between the sides in 2006.
Martin O'Neill's men start preparations for France with friendlies against Switzerland and Slovakia in March.
It will be the Republic's 20th encounter against the Netherlands, with the Dutch prevailing nine times to Ireland's seven.
Their game in May eliminates the possibility of a friendly between the Republic and Northern Ireland, who have also qualified for the finals.
The Republic will play a fourth and final friendly before the tournament, although the opponents and match details have yet to be announced.
Belgium and Italy complete a tough group for the Irish, who lost all three games in the Euro 2012 finals.
