British Cycling said Kennaugh, 27, has "struggled for form" since breaking a collarbone in a crash at the Tour of California in May.
Cummings, 35, won stage seven of this year's Tour de France.
"London 2012 was one of the highlights of my career so I am gutted to be missing out on Rio," said Kennaugh, who volunteered to pull out of the team.
"Knowing I'm not able to give my best, I felt it was my duty to withdraw."
Kennaugh finished 51st in last week's Tour of Poland, while Cummings, who won a team pursuit silver medal on the track at the 2004 Games in Athens, said he was in "great shape".
The road team also includes Tour de France defending champion and leader Chris Froome and his Team Sky team-mates Geraint Thomas and Ian Stannard.
Adam Yates, who is third in the Tour de France general classification and wearing the white jersey as the race's best young rider, completes the team.
A strong GB team missed out on a medal in the London 2012 road race when the rest of the field worked against them and Alexandre Vinokourov took gold.
