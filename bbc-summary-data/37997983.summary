Mr Alexander was selling band merchandise for Eagles of Death Metal, who were performing at the nightclub, when he was killed.
The concert - called Peaceful Noise -  marked the official launch of the Nick Alexander Memorial Trust, which will provide musical equipment to small charities and vulnerable groups across the country.
Mr Alexander's older sister Zoe, 43, said the event was "really personal" to Mr Alexander and included performances by artists who had toured with her brother or were friends with him.
She said she would remember her brother as someone who "approached life head on".
"He packed a lot into those 35 years so we will remember him in that way - as somebody who embraced life and forged their own path," she said.
