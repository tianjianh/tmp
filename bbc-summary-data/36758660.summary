Boxing: Liam Williams predicts knocking out Gary Corcoran

British and Commonwealth super welterweight champion Liam Williams is predicting a knockout win when he faces Gary Corcoran on Saturday, 16 July at Ice Arena Wales in Cardiff.

The duo almost came to blows at their last press event and Williams says he does not get on with the WBO intercontinental champion.
"He doesn't get under my skin, but I do dislike him," said the 24-year-old.
"He thinks far too much of himself and is very rude. There is no respect."
Williams has fought just twice in 18 months after overcoming a career-threatening hand injury which had stalled his progress.
He added the British title to his Commonwealth belt by beating Kris Carslaw in December last year before defeating Gustavo Alberto Sanchez in April.
But Wembley's Corcoran is unbeaten in 15 professional bouts and Rhondda fighter Williams thinks the 25-year-old represents his toughest career challenge.
"Corcoran needs to learn some manners, but I certainly respect him as a fighter," he said.
"He's a pretty good all-rounder with a high work rate. He'll come forward and meet me in the middle of the ring.
"But all this talk about his strength certainly doesn't concern. I'm a naturally bigger, stronger man.
"I'll do whatever is needed to win the fight, box, fight, whatever.
"If I keep my mind straight, I just can't see myself losing to him, I'm better in every department. Gary's only hope is to apply constant pressure and hope I wilt, but I won't.
"He attacks with mindless aggression and takes far too many risks. I'll be picking him up off the floor. He's getting knocked out."
Williams shares the top billing at the Cardiff event with two world title contests.
Cuban great Guillermo Rigondeaux meets Jazza Dickens for the WBA super-bantamweight title while Terry Flanagan defends his WBO lightweight crown.
