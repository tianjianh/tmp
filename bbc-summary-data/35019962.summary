Work to complete repairs on the gates of a canal lock in Oxfordshire have been completed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Canal & River Trust carried out the emergency repairs of the Banbury Lock gates in five days.
It is due to be refilled on Monday, but during the weekend the trust has given visitor tours of the drained lock.
Waterway manager Vicky Martin said walking on the bed of the 237-year-old lock to see the original 18th century design was a "real privilege".
The bottom gates have been realigned to make them watertight, helping to conserve water on the Oxford Canal.
They were last repaired following a bombing raid in September 1940.
When the lock was drained, objects including mobile phones, a mattress and a diamond ring were discovered.
The original brickwork of the lock, dating back to 1778, was also visible.
