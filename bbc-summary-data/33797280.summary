Five-month wait for scan results at Derriford Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patients have been waiting up to five months for diagnostic scan results at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One patient was still waiting for the results of an X-ray taken on 6 March, according to a Freedom of Information answer to the BBC on 29 July.
In September 2014, Derriford Hospital had 12,693 patients waiting for results of scans.
Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Ann James said: "Clearly that's not acceptable."
Other local hospitals said they had no-one waiting longer than six weeks.
The Care Quality Commission visited in early May 2015 when 7,000 people were waiting for scan results.
The hospital's diagnostics were rated as inadequate in the subsequent report.
Ms James said: "We need to explore all options to respond as quickly as possible. Nationally there is a shortage of staff such as radiologists and we are feeling that locally."
The delay has also been blamed on the number of staff on long term sick leave and demand for scans exceeding the number they had planned for.
