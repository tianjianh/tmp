The Vaccines: How to be the best live band

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At last year's Brit awards, The Vaccines found themselves in the company of Coldplay, Mumford & Sons, Muse and The Rolling Stones in the category of best live act.

They may have lost out to Chris Martin and his boys but their ability to turn a sold-out Alexandra Palace crowd of 10,000 fans into a bunch of gibbering wrecks cemented their reputation as one of best live bands in the country.
But how did they get there and what makes a great gig? Singer Justin Hayward-Young and bassist Arni Arnason share their tips.
Arni: Normally, what is the Wifi like at the venue?
Justin: There's a very defined line. Is it our show or is it someone else's show, or a festival?  Are we preaching to the converted, where they're going to lift us up with their energy, or are going to have to lift them? That's always the first thing, what's our role in this?
I really do think there's a difference between a show and a gig and for me it's important that it's not just a gig. There's an element of entertainment in the same way that you are entertained at the theatre or watching a movie. When you're half a mile away from a band and you can't see them and the sound is not great in a windy field, then sometimes the music is not enough.
Justin: We like going to big cities for obvious reasons, but we like going to smaller cities because fewer shows go there and crowds go crazy. I remember when we got a call asking if we wanted to play the O2, and I was like, 'Yes, obviously' and then I phoned back and I was like, 'Are you sure this is a good idea?'. Because there's something about playing a venue where you've been to see Bruce Springsteen or Fleetwood Mac.
Playing Ally Pally (Alexandra Palace) was a real landmark in any band's career or playing the Troubadour in LA or the Bowery Ballroom in New York. Venues can have some special significance regardless of their size.
You will want to play new songs like Handsome and Dream Lover, but will be expected to play fan favourites like Post Break-up Sex and Teenage Icon. How long do you spend deciding the setlist?
Justin: We've been accused of many things as a band but I don't think self-indulgence would be one of them, so I think we are always aware of striking a balance. We love playing those old songs because we love seeing people react in the way they do.
Often we'll sandwich a new song between two old ones so as not to be be punishing, it should be entertaining. We have a lot of belief in the new songs but equally they're not ingrained in people's hearts and minds.
Justin: I think energy, we're always completely in the moment and playing with conviction. I can't remember the last time I came off stage and felt, 'Oh I could have given more'.
Arni: Consistency.
Justin: There's a tendency, certainly when you're starting out, you have this energy and you want to prove yourself and you think, 'I've got to be crazy, otherwise it's not exciting' and then you realise that some of the most powerful performers allow their music to do the talking and, often, less is more.
I think we are all learning when to go and when to hold back.
Justin: It's incredibly important to us to put on an amazing night of music. We're lucky enough to have a platform, so I think it's almost a responsibility of ours to share that.
It's also really important that we hear our favourite songs coming through the wall or ceiling every night, rather than some band who just signed to the same label as us and need some exposure. Every band we've ever had on tour with us is because we like their music and they've been our friends.
I think once you're on the show, it's an incredible opportunity. We've supported Rolling Stones, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Arctic Monkeys. There's no way that, at the end of those tours, you're not a better band, not just for playing 10 nights in a row but working harder to convert a crowd.
Going on tour with a good band is like going to rock school, you learn so much.
Arni: I think hard work is the key, there are so many artists you speak to that did an EP last year and played two shows and sit back and say, 'Why isn't it happening?'. You have to rehearse for a year and play every single show that you can find.
Justin: There seems to be a bit of a culture now like, 'we've got to make sure that everything is perfect', and actually that does work for some people but I think you've just got to play, play play, write, write, write, play, play play...
Justin: That's how I made my money when I was doing support shows, i just copied CDRs every day, as many as I could between sound check and playing and I would go and sell them, that's how I got by for a year or so.
It's funny the things you have to think about when you get into the world of 'Officialdom'. But it's all an extension of the art, we just make whatever we want, like, 'I want a skateboard or we want some bomber jackets'.
I love designing all the t-shirts. You look at people standing outside Smith gigs with Morrissey haircuts and you think, 'I'd love to create this legion of people who are all dressed how I dress.' Obviously I'm not as iconic as Morrissey, but I do like this idea of creating this army of people.
Arni: Our motto is 'don't try to flog anything you wouldn't wear yourself'.
English Graffiti is released on 25 May.
