Incidents seem to be inspired by the "killer clown" craze in America which has started appearing across the UK.
Officers said there have been a "small number of reports locally" of people appearing in costumes to scare others.
There have also been reports a clown appearing on a roadside at night in Caernarfon, Gwynedd.
Police in Scotland, Northumbria and Northern Ireland have also issued similar warnings.
A South Wales Police spokesperson said: "Dressing up as clowns or in costumes to frighten others intentionally will have consequences.
"We have received a small number of similar reports locally and would like to remind people that this behaviour can cause concern and worry, particularly to young children and the elderly, and they may end up committing an offence."
