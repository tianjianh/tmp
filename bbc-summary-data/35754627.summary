The wheel, which attracted over 600,000 people in 2015, will be refurbished inside and out during the work, which is due to be completed this summer.
Its visitor centre, trip boats, conference rooms and activity hub will also be refreshed with new branding.
Scottish Canals, which operates the attraction, said the wheel will remain open during the work.
Scottish Canals chief executive Steve Dunlop said the wheel, which opened in 2002, was still drawing "huge numbers" of visitors.
He said: "This investment will build on that success, refreshing the wheel's existing attractions, and encouraging even more people to take a turn on the world's only rotating boat lift.
"The Falkirk Wheel is the jewel in the crown of Scotland's canal network and the income it generates plays a vital role in safeguarding the rich heritage of the nation's 250-year-old waterways."
The wheel links the Forth & Clyde Canal to the Union Canal 35m (115ft) above and is Scotland's busiest tourist attraction outside a city centre.
It opened as part of the Millennium Link, an £84.5 million project that restored Scotland's inland waterways to a navigable state for the first time since the 1960s.
