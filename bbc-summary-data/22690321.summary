[SN]TITLE[SN]
Calum Clark and Ed Slater ruled out of England tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton flanker Calum Clark and Leicester lock Ed Slater have been ruled out of England's tour to Uruguay and Argentina.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clark has not recovered from an ankle injury and is ruled out of England action for a third time in 12 months.
Slater suffered a recurrence of a tricep injury during his side's Premiership final win against Northampton on Saturday.
Sale's Wasps-bound lock Kearnan Myall has been added to the squad.
Clark was ruled out of England's 2012 summer tour of South Africa and the autumn internationals that followed after receiving a record 32-week ban for breaking the arm of Leicester of hooker Rob Hawkins.
He was recalled for the Six Nations only to suffer a shoulder injury in January that sidelined him for the whole tournament.
England will now be taking a squad of 31 players for Sunday's tour match in Montevideo and the two Tests against the Pumas in Salta on 8 June and Buenos Aires on 15 June.
Head coach Stuart Lancaster said: "It's unfortunate for both Calum and Ed that they won't be able to join up with England this summer but I'm sure they will be back and pushing for places next season.
"Calum has been unlucky with the injuries. I had a good chat with him yesterday - he came in and we assessed his ankle and it clearly was not going to be right until beyond the first Test and as a consequence it would take him out of contention.
"Kearnan did well in a good team performance against the Barbarians and now has a great chance to continue his progress with us on tour.
"It means we travel with one player less than originally selected, but we have lots of options in the second row and back row to cover for that."
