[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 2-2 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool rescued a valuable point against Newport County despite playing nearly the whole match with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aristote Nsiala was sent off on three minutes for deliberate handball, with Newport's Sean Rigg scoring from the subsequent free-kick.
That strike equalised Pools' second minute opener from Nicky Featherstone, before a thunderous volley from Jon Parkin put Newport ahead.
However, Padraig Amond levelled for the hosts before half-time.
Neither side could find a winner in a second half that failed to capture the imagination like the first.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "I am disappointed because they were down to ten men, you would like to think you go on to win the game.
"But our final ball was poor. We huffed and we puffed, but the quality was not there.
"Full credit to Hartlepool though, because I thought they did well.
"Today was the first time this season that I thought we looked off it."
