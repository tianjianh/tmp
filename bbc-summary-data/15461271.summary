[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ballet West in Taynuilt, in Argyll, will take its production of Swan Lake to seven venues in Scotland from January to March before heading east.
The school, which is associated with the University of the Highlands and Islands, previously toured China in 2011 and 2010.
Ballet West graduate Sarah Mortimer, 19, from Maidstone, in Kent, will be among the dancers.
Miss Mortimer was the only British finalist in the Royal Academy of Dance's 2011 GenÃ©e International Ballet Competition in Cape Town, South Africa.
She graduated from Ballet West in the summer.
The school's Scottish performances will be held in Oban, Musselburgh, Cumbernauld, Giffnock, Pitlochry and Greenock.
Comedian and actor Billy Connolly is a patron of Ballet West.
He became involved after they choreographed dance scenes in the 1997 film Mrs Brown, in which he starred.
The film centred around Queen Victoria's later years at Balmoral Castle, near Braemar in Aberdeenshire.
