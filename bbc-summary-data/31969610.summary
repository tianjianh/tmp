Scottish Book Trust seeks stories about journeys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Book Trust has asked people to write about journeys they have made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said the stories, poems, plays or letters could be about a memorable commute, an excursion or an emotional journey.
A selection of the writing will be published in a book that will be made available during Book Week Scotland.
Scottish mountaineer Jamie Andrew, a quadruple amputee, is among those supporting the writing project.
Mr Andrew wrote a book about his own physical and personal journeys.
The book trust is running the project in conjunction with the National Theatre of Scotland. The closing date for submissions is 30 June.
Trust director Marc Lambert said: "We know that Scots like to travel and always have.
"So we hope that this project will generate lots of personal stories about journeys that are notable in some way.
"These might include real journeys, good, bad, funny or touching, or stories in turn about internal journeys of health or transformation."
National Theatre associate director Simon Sharkey said: "We are delighted to collaborate for the first time with Scottish Book Trust and are tremendously excited by the theatrical possibilities in bringing these new stories to life in communities across Scotland."
Book Week Scotland will be held in November.
