Couple in their 50s end up accidentally on an 18-30 break

Sun, sand, sea, clubbing all night - what's not to like about an 18-30 holiday?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unless of course you are a 56-year-old man who booked a relaxing holiday but was forced to stay in a 24-hour party resort instead.
John Moore and his partner Angela, 51, from Herne in Kent, didn't quite get their peaceful break in Zante as planned.
Instead they had to listen to shouting and banging on the wall all night.
Thomas Cook, who the couple booked the holiday through, have since apologised for accidentally housing them in the Christina Studios in Laganas, Zante, advertised as a clubbing destination.
After spending two nights in the party hotel Moore and his partner checked out to somewhere quieter and more to their taste.
The parish councillor and sweet shop owner has since won a Â£400 payout from the holiday company.
While also being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as "one of the best chill-out zones" in Zante on the Greek island of Zakynthos.
The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots.
Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: "Don't bother if you are over 30 as it's too noisy."
Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as "filthy" and "noisy".
One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the "ultimate place for a boys or girls holiday".
Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September.
"We would like to apologise to Mr Moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Christina Studios in Zante with our Escapades brand in September 2014," a spokesman said.
"It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction."
