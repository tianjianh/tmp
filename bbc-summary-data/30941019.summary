[SN]TITLE[SN]
Five schools to close under new Pembrokeshire plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five schools could close in Pembrokeshire and be replaced with three new ones.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Council plans involve three schools in Haverfordwest, one in Fishguard and one in St Davids.
Two new schools would then be opened in Haverfordwest and another in Fishguard, which would also include pupils from St Davids.
A Welsh medium school would open for three to 16-year-olds in Haverfordwest, replacing Ysgol Gynradd Glan Cleddau.
Pembrokeshire councillors will vote on the plans on 29 January.
The council wants to:
Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith welcomed the proposal but questioned whether the school in Haverfordwest would be big enough.
"There is also the question why there is no provision for the sixth form as part of the recommendations," said the group's Bethan Williams.
"The decision made by councillors next week will affect education across the county for years to come and it is essential that Welsh education becomes easily available in all parts of the county."
