China's prawn scandal sparks consumer rights furore

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Authorities in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao have said they are fining a restaurant 90,000 yuan (Â£9,300; $14,160) for "misleading consumers" over what's been termed the "38 yuan large prawn" scandal.

A diner on Sunday ordered a dish of prawns marked as 38 yuan at the Shande Live Seafood and Barbecued Home-cooked Dishes restaurant, but was given a bill for 1,520 yuan (Â£160; $240) after he was told the price was per prawn.
The diner tried to seek help from local authorities, but in the end still had to pay a hefty sum, causing a national furore.
Qingdao authorities said Shande was not only fined but also ordered to "correct its unlawful pricing practices". The restaurant was reportedly shut on Tuesday.
News organisations had picked up the story on Monday after the disgruntled customer went on microblogging network Weibo to complain. What followed was public outrage directed not just at the restaurant but also at local authorities for failing to help the diner.
The fine has not stemmed the wave of criticism online over the handling of the case. Many on the Qingdao authorities' Weibo pages called for local officials to be held responsible, punished, and even sacked.
Chinese sociologist Ding Xueliang said the uproar illustrated how "people, for many years, have accumulated so much distrust of consumer rights in China".
Reports said that the diner, a tourist from Nanjing named Mr Zhu, had called in the police twice. He said the first time officers told him they could not do anything as it was a "price dispute", and said he needed to consult the local trade and industry bureau - which was shut.
The second time they were called in, Mr Zhu said he was advised to give the money to the restaurant owner.
"The people who deserve the most punishment in this case are the policemen who were dispatched to help the man, what on Earth were you doing?" said Weibo user Fanny_fanxiaoqing.
Said Aleigedai: "What makes this so chilling is not just an unscrupulous shop cheating customers, but also the police's uncaring behaviour."
The timing of the row may have contributed to the outrage - it came near the end of China's "golden week" national public holiday, when many travel elsewhere in the country and have to contend with inevitably overpriced hotels and restaurants.
Qingdao is also a popular tourist destination.
But the case has also tapped into lingering unhappiness over the lack of enforcement of consumer rights, despite moves in recent years to strengthen laws and public confidence.
China has upped penalties for fraud and false advertising, made it easier for consumers to launch lawsuits, and every year on World Consumer Rights Day on 15 March, national broadcaster CCTV runs a name-and-shame blitz, with a TV special on errant companies.
Prof Ding, who is with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, notes that the government has long established a network of consumer rights bureaus in cities and towns.
"But in most places these organisations are just window dressing for local government. Officials are reluctant to enforce the laws because they are afraid of hurting local businesses," he says.
"In many cases you can complain but nothing can be done. What doesn't help is there are many layers of government and departments will push the issue to elsewhere - it's like a football game."
The Qingdao prawn case is unlikely to change the situation, but it does prove that consumers now have one way to get concrete help, he adds.
"Many people now have a smartphone and know how to use social media. The biggest thing is that they can now go online, publicise the matter, and try to get redress this way."
