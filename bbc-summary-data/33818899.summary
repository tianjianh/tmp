No stranger to controversy, some of Mr Trump's comments drew gasps - and some boos - from the studio audience in Cleveland, Ohio.
Mr Trump was the only one of the 10 candidates on stage to refuse to rule out running as an independent if he fails to win the Republican  nomination.
"I will not make the pledge at this time," he said, drawing jeers from the audience.
Mr Trump's admission that he might run as an independent angered fellow Republican contender Rand Paul who said: "He buys and sells politicians of all stripes."
"You'd better believe it," Mr Trump said. "Most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money."
Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly pressed Mr Trump on past comments he had made about some women, in which he used terms including fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.
"Only Rosie O'Donnell," he said, referring to the actress and talkshow host who has been a longtime critic of the billionaire businessman.
He added: "I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.
I've been challenged by so many people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness."
Mr Trump drew a mixture of boos and applause when he turned on Ms Kelly.
"Honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me," he said.
Some of Mr Trump's most controversial past comments have been on Mexican migrants, accusing them of being responsible for a large number of rapes and other crimes in the US. Commentators said he softened his stance somewhat on Thursday evening.
"We need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly. And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally," he said.
He also took credit for immigration being a major issue in the campaign.
"If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration," he claimed.
