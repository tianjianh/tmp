Taxi drivers's shorts ban review by Denbighshire council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controversial decision banning taxi drivers in Denbighshire from wearing shorts is to be reconsidered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In March, the council introduced the dress code to create "a professional image" among the county's 400 licensed taxi drivers, 70 of them in Rhyl.
The ban came into force on 1 May but drivers have raised a petition with 500 signatures protesting against the move.
The council's licensing committee will look at the issue at their meeting on 10 June.
