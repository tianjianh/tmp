[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Perth Airport operator ACS Aviation has been bought by aviation firm Cloud Global for an undisclosed sum.

ACS, which is based at Perth Airport, offers pilot training and engineering and maintenance services for private and commercial operators in Scotland.
Glasgow Airport-based Cloud Global specialises in aviation recruitment, aircraft leasing and aviation support.
The purchase of ACS will create an operation with a combined turnover of Â£3.5m and a workforce of 20.
The deal will see Cloud Global utilise ACS to maintain its existing fleet of 10 aircraft.
Cloud Global said ACS managing director Allan Falconer would be leaving the business to "pursue other commercial opportunities".
He will be replaced by Cloud Global director Graeme Frater.
Mr Frater said: "This is a very positive development for both businesses.
"We had been looking for an opportunity to expand and it was clear from our previous dealings with ACS that the company provided a very good fit with our business model.
"Our strategy of developing various divisions has proven very successful and this deal will allow us to explore new opportunities to add to our client list which includes such prestigious names as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Apollo Aviation Group and IAS Medical Ltd."
