Banton joined Crawley in May 2016 after being released by Notts County, before joining Scottish Premiership side Partick Thistle on loan in January.
The 24-year-old failed to make an appearance for the Jags after suffering an injury in training.
"Jason is an exciting and very talented player who can be a match winner," manager Anthony Limbick said.
