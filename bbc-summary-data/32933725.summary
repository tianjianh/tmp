Fire at The Mill, Alveley, was arson, police say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fire that destroyed a disused hotel in Shropshire earlier this month is being treated as arson, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mill at Alveley, near Bridgnorth, closed six months ago following financial difficulties.
The fire, on 18 May, tore through the building, causing the roof to collapse. Smoke was visible from several miles away.
Police have now confirmed it was arson and want people seen walking in the area before the fire to come forward.
"Investigations are ongoing and we once again ask anyone with information to come forward directly or anonymously," a West Mercia Police spokesman said.
"The site still remains extremely dangerous and should not be entered."
The 41-bedroom hotel had previously been a popular wedding venue.
