Lizzy Idahosa, 26, was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2014 after being found guilty of trafficking.
A confiscation order for £21,905 has been granted at Cardiff Crown Court under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
The money must be paid back within 28 days or she faces a further nine month prison sentence being imposed.
During the original trial, the jury heard the trafficked women worked in brothels - including in  Cardiff and Swansea - to repay Idahosa £50,000 for travel from Nigeria and false documents.
Both victims, who could not be named for legal reasons, said that before travelling to London on the promise of a better life, they had been subjected to "juju" rituals to make them afraid of disobeying her.
Idahosa was also found guilty of inciting prostitution and money laundering.
Following the confiscation order, Gemma Williams, from Immigration Enforcement's Financial Investigation Unit, said:  "Idahosa was prepared to take advantage of her victims' vulnerability and desperation for her own financial gain, but her greed has not paid off.
"In addition to her hefty prison sentence, she has now been ordered to pay back money she took from her victims."
