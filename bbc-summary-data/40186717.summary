Work has begun on a Â£500,000 skate park in Ceredigion which developers have said will be a UK "first of its kind".

Freestyle hopes work on Parc Kronberg in Aberystwyth will finish this summer.
The firm said the community park is unique in that it will include pathways forming an entrance to the town.
It follows a seven-year consultation with more than 2,000 people and is funded by Aberystwyth council and a Big Lottery grant.
