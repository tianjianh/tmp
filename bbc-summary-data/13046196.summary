Cardiff leads the way with 52 bids to hold events on Friday 29 April when Prince William marries Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey.
There has also been a large number of applications in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot.
Organisers have had to apply for road closures for their events.
BBC Wales contacted all 22 local authorities in Wales.
Some said the figures for the number of applications were not yet available, and others are still processing applications.
Bridgend council has received 16 while Wrexham has 10 and Denbighshire nine.
Residents at Severn Grove in Pontcanna, Cardiff, are staging a traditional street party with bunting, balloons and cakes.
Terry Phillips, who is helping said: "The community spirit is quite extraordinary.
"We are catering for over 100 children. We've invited all the people in the locality."
Anthony Parry, who is helping to organise a party in Mold in Flintshire, said they had received permission to close the main High Street for the day.
"We are trying to do it on a modern twist - we are not having trestle tables down the middle - we are going more for a hog roast, fish and chips and burgers," he explained.
As well as a big screen showing the wedding there will be live bands, a fashion show, children's entertainments and a land train.
The day has been made a bank holiday, and Prime Minister David Cameron has called on the UK to "get on and have fun".
The newest figures from the Local Government Association reveal there have been 4,000 applications for street parties across Wales and England.
