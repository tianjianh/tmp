Lord Geoffrey Howe: Tributes to the former chancellor from Port Talbot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tributes are being paid to the former chancellor Lord Geoffrey Howe by Welsh politicians following his death from a suspected heart attack aged 88.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservative MP, who was born in Port Talbot and served under Margaret Thatcher, died on Friday night.
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he was a "towering" political figure who always had a great affection for Wales.
Welsh Tory Leader Andrew RT Davies called him a man of "great kindness and intellect".
During his time as an MP, he also served as deputy prime minister, foreign minister and leader of the House of Commons. He was Lady Thatcher's longest-serving cabinet minister.
He later became Lord Howe of Aberavon, sitting in the House of Lords.
Mr Crabb said he was from an era which "shaped British politics profoundly".
"He had close connections to Wales and even up to his last days in the House of Lords, he would take a close interest in Welsh affairs," he said.
"Whenever I did briefings in the House of Lords he would always be there listening and he would sometimes give me some advice.
"It was lovely to see the bond of affection he had for Wales."
Mr Davies said Lord Howe visited the rotary club in Cowbridge three years ago "and he was still as sharp as mustard".
"He had been at the epicentre of British politics and he had many stories to recant," Mr Davies said.
"He was a man of great kindness and intellect and a man of his time."
Alun Cairns, Tory MP for Vale of Glamorgan, added: "He was a gentle man, thoughtful and considerate in everything that he said."
Monmouthshire MP David Davies said Lord Howe would be "sadly missed".
"I'm very sorry to hear of his death," he added.
"He made an enormous contribution to the Conservative governments of the 1980s, which changed the face of British politics."
Lord Howe, who represented the East Surrey, Reigate and Bebington constituencies as an MP, died at his home in Warwickshire after attending a jazz concert with his wife Elspeth, his family said.
