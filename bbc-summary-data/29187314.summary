[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newcastle United 2-2 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mass protest against Newcastle boss Alan Pardew failed to materialise as two Papiss Cisse goals saw his side fight back from 2-0 down to salvage a dramatic point against Hull.

What was expected to be a day of deep discontent at St James' Park will instead be remembered for the spirit the Magpies showed as they salvaged a point that takes them off the bottom of the Premier League table.
Spectacular second-half strikes by Nikica Jelavic and Mohamed Diame had put the Tigers ahead but Cisse came off the bench to rescue an unlikely point and, temporarily at least, take the heat off his beleaguered boss.

Pardew was under mounting pressure after his side's miserable start to the season had prompted some supporters to threaten open revolt against his four-year reign.
A fans group had printed 30,000 anti-Pardew posters before kick-off and asked fans to wave them in the fifth-minute to mark the number of wins Newcastle have managed in 2014.
Stewards stopped some supporters from bringing the posters into the ground but, while a smattering of fans still showed them off, the chants that accompanied the protest were directed at the club's owner Mike Ashley, not Pardew.
Unlike during their sorry defeat at Southampton last weekend, however, dissent was not the prevailing mood among the Newcastle fans.
Some enterprising early attacking play from the home side helped ensure the crowd were mostly positive in the first half but the issues in attack that had seen Newcastle fail to score in three of their four previous league games this season did remain.
Remy Cabella and Yoan Gouffran both failed to seriously test Tigers keeper Allan McGregor when well placed and several neat passing moves fizzled out.
A few half-hearted boos were as bad as it got for Pardew at half-time, but the atmosphere changed when Jelavic swivelled to fire Hull ahead in acrobatic style just after the break. It was then the first chants of 'We want Pardew out' were heard from sections of the ground.

Their volume increased when Diame found space to fizz a superb second goal high into the net with 20 minutes left, but the hostility never reached the same levels as it had done when fans protested against Pardew on the final day of last season.
Instead, the home supporters concentrated on helping their team battle back into the game, with their comeback starting as soon as Cisse came off the bench to provide the bite that had been missing up front.
The Senegalese striker reduced the deficit with 16 minutes left when he accepted Cheick Tiote's pass and beat McGregor with an angled drive and, in doing so, inspired his side to press hard for an equaliser.
One came with three minutes remaining, when Gouffran met Moussa Sissoko's ball into the box and Cisse fired home to ensure his first appearance of the season was a memorable one.
A point is not the end of Pardew's problems, but his future at least looks a little more secure than it did last Saturday.
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: "We had some big chances and then we make one mistake and it got punished, and an unbelievable goal out of nothing puts us in a big hole.
"But we had tremendous resolve. The players have had to play under enormous pressure and I'm very proud of them.
"I have to say 80% of the crowd were terrific. They took a view of 'let's see what happens'. We do have some fans who are a little bit more radical than that and they wanted to make their presence felt and you have to accept that as a manager."
Hull manager Steve Bruce: "If feels like a loss. Unfortunately, we've made mistakes and got punished.
"We've scored two wonderful goals, which would have graced any arena. Apart from the mistakes we made late on, we looked a very good team.
"Individual errors are something you can never determine what it is. Is it complacency? Tiredness? A mistake is a mistake and we've got punished."
