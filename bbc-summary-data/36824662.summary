James Warnock, 56, strangled 17-year-old Yiannoulla Yianni in an attack described as "cruel, brutal and without mercy" at her north London home.
Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told the Old Bailey Ms Yianni had endured a "terrifying ordeal" at knifepoint.
The jury took two hours to convict Warnock, a divorced father of two.
How a killer was brought to justice after 34 years
Ms Yianni, who was known as Lucy, was from a Greek Cypriot family from Hampstead. Warnock lived just half a mile away from their house.
He managed to evade justice for 34 years, despite still living in the local community, and was only caught by a chance DNA match.
When the roofer was caught sharing indecent pictures of children on the internet last year he gave a routine DNA sample. It matched a profile retrieved from a semen stain at the 1982 crime scene. The match was one in a billion.
At the time of Ms Yianni's murder, DNA testing had not been invented and the sample that helped convict Warnock was only fully recovered from a bed sheet in 2003.
Sentencing Warnock, Judge Hilliard said: "It is impossible to understand how one human being could do such things to another.
"In the process you visited misery beyond measure on those to whom Yiannoulla was, and is, so dear and which will never leave them."
Following the verdict, the Yianni family described how Lucy's murder had left them "saturated by grief" although they always believed her killer would be caught.
Her brother Rick said: "Thankfully the long arm of the law has reached out from the past to bring this evil being to justice."
