Trott rode tactically in the final race of six disciplines to finish 12 points clear of Belgium's Jolien D'Hoore, with Netherland's Kirsten Wild third.
It was the Briton's second gold medal of the meet following her success in the women's team pursuit on Friday.
Britain also took gold in the men's team pursuit and men's madison.
British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton said: "Our winning mentality is coming back. We're starting to get some results.
"We're not just relying on the women's team pursuit winning."
Trott, who won the individual points race at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, held a 14 point lead over D'Hoore going into the 100-lap race and sat on the wheel of her rival for much of the event.
With five points available for the winner of each of the 10 sprints, the 22-year-old was happy to see riders who were no threat to the overall standings take the majority of them, before leaping clear to win sprint nine and secure gold with 10 laps still to go.
"I'm so happy," Trott said. "The points race has never been my strongest event. I've been doing a lot of work.
"My tactics were actually quite simple, all I had to do was follow Jolien. When I won the second from last sprint I knew it was over."
Trott made an excellent start to the two-day omnium event, winning the scratch race and individual pursuit to give herself breathing room in the eliminator, time trial and flying lap disciplines.
In the corresponding men's event, Jon Dibben, 22, finished seventh despite a technical problem in the eliminator and a crash in the final points race.
In the final event with British interest, Jessica Varnish finished fifth in the women's keirin final after being handed a surprise start.
The 24-year-old was due to race in the minor final but was promoted to replace Russia's Ekaterina Gnidenko, who was relegated for her involvement in a crash in the semi-finals.
