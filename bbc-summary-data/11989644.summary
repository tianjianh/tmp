Anna Brandt, a 41-year-old, had been living in London for three years after leaving her hometown of Wagrowiec in western Poland.

On 7 July 2005 she left her home in Wood Green, north London, and set off to Hammersmith, where she worked as a cleaner.
She took the Piccadilly Line underground train at 0800 BST heading towards Gunnersbury.
But she never arrived at work, sparking a desperate search by her brother Pawel Iskrzynski.
He spent several days searching for her, holding a picture of his sister.
Police took his DNA sample and subsequently confirmed that she had died near Russell Square, with 25 others and the suicide bomber.
In a police statement read out at the inquest into her death, Mr Iskryzinski described his sister as a very private person who did not smoke or drink alcohol and had just two close friends.
"She would normally return home from her job and stay indoors and did not pursue leisure activities," he said.
In 1981, straight out of school, she ran her own restaurant business and a couple of years later, she married Arek Brandt. Together, they had two children, Hubert and Natalie.
In 2002, after the restaurant closed, Ms Brandt moved to London, leaving her husband in Poland to look after their children.
The couple separated a year before Ms Brandt's death.
While in London, Ms Brandt shared a house with her brother and dabbled in bar work before becoming a cleaner.
Most of her earnings were sent back to Poland to help pay for her children's education.
Her daughter Natalie had arrived in the UK on the day of the explosions to visit her mother. Hubert is thought to have been living in Sweden when his mother died.
