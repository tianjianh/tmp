Mark McCall: Premiership and European Champions Cup double talk is 'disrespectful

Talk of a second successive European and Premiership double is "disrespectful" to other teams, says Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall.

The defending champions overwhelmed Muster 26-10 on Saturday to reach the European Champions Cup final.
Sarries have already qualified for the Premiership play-offs with two regular season matches remaining.
"We don't even talk about it - I think it is disrespectful to others to talk in those terms," McCall told BBC Sport.
Not since Leicester Tigers in 2002 has an English club completed a back-to-back European and domestic double.
Saracens now face Premiership games against Bristol and Wasps as they seek a home semi-final, before the European showdown with Clermont Auvergne in Edinburgh on 13 May.
Ahead of Saturday's game against already-relegated Bristol, the squad are spending two days in Barcelona, the latest of the famous Saracens team-bonding trips.
"We will make sure we will celebrate this, because it's a big game and we've done well. You have to to enjoy these," said fly-half Owen Farrell.
"The group just have to stay grounded and stay humble," added McCall.
"They are really frustrated about the try we conceded, because that shouldn't have happened.
"Alex Sanderson - who has done such a remarkable job defensively - is so cross that happened.
"Hopefully those are the standards we are going to need in the next four or five weeks. If we keep on showing that fighting spirit, we will be ok."
Scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth said: "We just want to improve and make sure we get better every week and every year. If you do that then you give yourself a chance."
Since becoming director of rugby at the end of 2010, McCall has led Saracens to three Premiership titles and one European crown.
But, after masterminding the comprehensive defeat of Munster, the Irishman played down the prospect of him coaching the national team in the future.
"I am unbelievably lucky to be at the club I am at. Sometimes in coaching you find yourself in the right place at the right time," he said.
"We have a phenomenal group of players, a phenomenal group of staff, it's a brilliant place to be, so I am very happy here."
