An air show which has run for more than 30 years in Cornwall has been cancelled because of safety concerns.

The annual Red Arrows show at Fowey Royal Regatta has been scrapped after an audit found there was not enough space to perform above the town's river.
The Military Aviation Authority audit raised concerns over the width of the "safety corridor" below the display.
Organisers have scrapped the show rather than move it further out to sea.
"Our only means of achieving the safety standard is to move the display out over the sea which simply won't be the same," a statement said.
"This has led to a reluctant decision not to host the Red Arrows in 2016."
Harbour master Paul Thomas said: "It is hugely important and is without question the busiest day of regatta week. There is a huge sense of disappointment."
Malcolm Palin, chairman of Fowey Regatta Committee said moving the event out to sea would encounter problems.
"To view it, spectators would need to go into fields which would mean a lack of vehicle access, narrow footpaths and uneven ground," he said.
"Also we would need to raise enough money to pay for the display while expecting a significant drop in visitor numbers."
The decision is not believed to be connected to the Shoreham air crash which killed 11 people last year.
