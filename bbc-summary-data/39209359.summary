[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jumpsuits allowed at Royal Ascot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Women will be able to wear jumpsuits in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot this summer following a change to the dress code.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Before the new ruling, female racegoers could wear skirts or dresses falling just above the knee or longer or full-length trouser suits.
For men, a waistcoat and tie are compulsory in the enclosure.
Organisers said the acceptance of the jumpsuit reflected Ascot's "awareness of seasonal trends".
Juliet Slot, commercial director at Ascot, said: "Fashion and style are an important part of the Royal Ascot experience for all of our customers.
"The annual Style Guide forms a key part of our support for customers to give them inspiration for what to wear to ensure they have a special occasion with us.
"The inclusion of jumpsuits as part of the Royal Enclosure dress code recognises our customers' fashion-forward taste and reflects our awareness of seasonal trends."

As recently reported by the BBC, a new enclosure at this year's Royal Ascot will seek to attract a fresh generation of racegoers by offering a "party atmosphere" and a "more vibrant feel".
The Village Enclosure will provide a range of attractions, including eateries, bars, social areas and DJs.
The "popular formality of dress code" of the Queen Anne enclosure - the suits, the hats - will remain, but with a festival touch, say organisers.
Royal Ascot will be held from 20-24 June.
