Rangers have no problem with 'big games' - Mark Warburton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Warburton insists Rangers can handle away games against top-six Premiership sides, despite a poor record in those fixtures this term.

The Ibrox side lost 4-1 to Hearts on Wednesday evening - their second defeat at Tynecastle this season.
They have also lost away to Celtic and Aberdeen as well as drawing with St Johnstone in Perth but have beaten Motherwell at Fir Park.
"I don't think there is a problem with big games," said manager Warburton.
"I don't see it as a big problem.
"We went to Aberdeen and I felt dominated and [we] should have won the game.

"We have gone to all these various other venues, Inverness, Partick, Dundee, Motherwell, we have won games of football very convincingly.
"The Parkhead game [September's 5-1 defeat by Celtic] was well documented. Hearts, we had two bad performances, it's as simple as that.
"Are we worried about going to those grounds? Not at all, absolutely not."
Rangers' fifth league defeat of the season left them 25 points behind Celtic but still two ahead of Aberdeen, who have a game in hand.
And Warburton's side continue their league campaign at home to Ross County on Saturday, with the previous meetings of the sides this season ending in draws.
Last term, the Ibrox side won the Championship but lost all of their away games against both Falkirk and Hibernian, who finished second and third in the second tier.
"Whether you play the top of the table or the bottom of the table, it's three points," Warburton added. "You don't get five for beating someone and two for beating someone else.
"So the fact we are sitting second in the table tells you we are doing some things okay. We have to improve, of course we do, but the fact is the team is growing and we are learning."
