Steven Thompson's Scottish Premiership predictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Predictor for the Scottish Premiership continues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sign up, set up a league with your friends and commence battle for bragging rights across the season.
Each week, former Dundee United, Rangers and St Mirren striker Steven Thompson will take a look at the fixtures in Scotland's top flight and give us his thoughts on how they will pan out.
Last week, Steven correctly predicted four results out of the six Premiership matches and one of those was a correct score. So in the Predictor he amassed a decent 70 points (3 x 10 points + 1 x 40 points).
Think you can do better than an ex-pro turned BBC Scotland pundit? What are you are waiting for? Get involved.
"Kilmarnock haven't beaten Partick in their last four attempts. I do feel Partick have been playing quite well without getting the results.
"As much as Kilmarnock have got two decent results in their last two games, I just feel Partick will get the win that they need to take them off the bottom of the table.
Prediction: Kilmarnock 1-2 Partick Thistle
"Hamilton haven't scored more than one goal all season in all of their games and recently Motherwell have only taken two from a possible 12 points.
"Generally, it's quite close between the teams."
Prediction: Motherwell 1-1 Hamilton Academical
"Rangers have to show a reaction after last week's embarrassment at Parkhead. I don't think they'll keep a clean sheet.
"Liam Boyce has got six goals for the season for Ross County and I do believe they will score but I'm going for Rangers to win."
Prediction: Rangers 2-1 Ross County
"I know that Hearts have won three games in a row but they have struggled to beat St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.
"The last time that Hearts lost a game, it was to St Johnstone in the League Cup."
Prediction: St Johnstone 2-1 Hearts
"Dundee haven't beaten them in the league since 2004, which is quite a stat.
"And, obviously, Dundee are now missing their main centre-half in Kevin Gomis after he was sent off last weekend."
Prediction: Dundee 0-2 Aberdeen
"Celtic have had a very tough week - the Old Firm game then travelling to Barcelona, where they took a thumping but I think they will show a reaction.
"I think Brendan Rodgers will maybe freshen it up. Inverness haven't got a good record against Celtic and they don't have enough firepower to test Celtic."
Prediction: Inverness CT 0-3 Celtic
