Australia, Canada and Malaysia are also interested in hosting the Games, which was stripped from Durban in March.
Liverpool, London and Birmingham are the English cities to have declared an interest in staging the event.
The Commonwealth Games Federation says a final decision is unlikely until early Autumn.
"We are delighted with the level of initial interest expressed by nations across the Commonwealth and look forward to working with all parties as plans develop for a Games to be proud of in 2022," said CGF chief executive David Grevemberg.
"An expert CGF Review Team will work with each country in the evaluation of proposals of potential host cities."
The expression of interest has been submitted by the UK government, who have been canvassing interest from cities around the country.
The Commonwealth Games are held every four years and feature athletes from more than 50 countries, mostly former British colonies.
Britain last hosted the Games in Glasgow in 2014, while the 2002 event was staged in Manchester. The next edition takes place on Australia's Gold Coast in 2018.
