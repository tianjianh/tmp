West Midlands Fire Service was alerted to the fire on Stafford Street, Willenhall, at about 08:15 GMT on Saturday.
Roads were closed while the fire was extinguished, and residents were advised to keep doors and windows shut due to large amounts of smoke.
Nobody is believed to have been injured in the fire, a spokesman said.
A spokesman for the fire service said a cause had not yet been established, but a fire investigation officer would examine the site once it was deemed safe.
