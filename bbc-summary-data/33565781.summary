"Anyone who recognises the description of these men and can help trace them is asked to contact police immediately.
"In addition, anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in Willow Grove on Thursday evening should also get in touch."
All three thieves are white, in their 30s, of medium build with Scottish accents.
One of the men is between 6ft and 6ft 2ins and was wearing a white T-shirt.
Another is about 5ft 10ins with medium-length, spiked, light hair and he was wearing a dark shirt. He also had a golf club.
