[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams went into the match four points behind fourth-placed Stranraer in League One.
Neither side could force a breakthrough during a cagey first half but Marc Fitzpatrick shot into the roof of the net to put Airdrie ahead.
But Love headed in Paul Archibald's cross to ensure both sides moved closer to Stranraer, who lost to Ayr United.
