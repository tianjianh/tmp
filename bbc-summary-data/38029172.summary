A trail of beacons has been lit along both sides of the Firth of Forth in a gesture of hope and solidarity with the besieged residents of Aleppo in Syria.

The displays of light aimed to show support and raise funds for people in the city, which has been ravaged by civil war.
Communities along the coast lit torches at 17:00 on Sunday.
Their message will be spread around the world by social media, using the hashtag #alightforaleppo.
Edinburgh University chaplaincy has organised the scheme, which aims to raise funds for the charities Oxfam and Medicins Sans Frontieres, who are working in the region.
Members of the public were invited to attend an event, to organise an event of their own, or to light a candle in their home to show support.
Rev Dr Harriet Harris, Edinburgh University chaplain, said: "Every day, the people of Aleppo have less food and fewer medical supplies, and aid is not getting through.
"We want them to know that they are not forgotten - the people of the world are watching and are upholding their humanity.
"We are helpless to deliver food, medicine or peace, but we will light beacons to send a message of solidarity and hope to stem despair and renew resolve."
