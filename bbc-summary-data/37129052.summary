Sea defence opening on A174 between Whitby and Sandsend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£9m sea defence scheme along a coast road with a history of landslips is to be officially opened later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It protects the A174 route between Whitby and Sandsend in North Yorkshire.
Worn-out defences have been replaced along a 0.6 mile (1km) stretch of the road, a popular tourist route, where it runs close to the shoreline.
Several landslips had led to costly repairs over the years and road closures, North Yorkshire County Council said.
