Ryan Magee: Euromillions lottery winner's driving ban reduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Euromillions lottery winner has had a driving ban reduced from five years to over two years after winning an appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Magee, 34, from Monnabouy Road, Eglinton, received a five-year driving ban in June when he pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and without insurance last December.
His sentence also included 200 hours of community service and a fine of Â£250.
Magee's defence barrister argued that the ban was extreme.
The lawyer told the appeal court in Londonderry that the five-year disqualification was five times greater than a previous ban imposed on Magee in July 2014, also for driving when disqualified.
Magee won Â£6.4m in the EuroMillions lottery seven years ago.
He spent Â£170,000 on a Ferrari sports car days after the lottery win as well as a house equipped with a champagne bar.
His defence lawyer said that Magee regretted having "ticked the publicity box" after his lottery win.
"Sometimes winning the lottery brings as much bad luck as it does good luck," he said.
"It has brought him more than bad than good. He has struggled to come to terms with the life-changing experience of winning the lottery."
The judge, who reduced the driving ban to two and a half years, said he had no idea that Magee had "been involved in a game of chance and managed to be successful".
