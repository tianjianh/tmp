Braintree Town 0-4 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Angol enjoyed a perfect debut as Lincoln City extended their lead at the top of the National League to six points with a comprehensive win over Braintree Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker, who arrived on loan from Peterborough earlier in the week, scored a hat-trick as the FA Cup quarter-finalists made it 10 games unbeaten.
Angol marked his Imps debut with a goal after just 15 minutes as he converted from a corner.
The striker thumped in a second seven minutes later with a low effort, and completed his hat-trick eight minutes from time after Matt Rhead was fouled in the penalty area by Frankie Musonda.
Nathan Arnold got in on the act five minutes from time with a clinical finish, as Braintree failed to register an effort on target until stoppage time.
