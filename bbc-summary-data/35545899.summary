Sandra Wood death: Maidstone Hospital's weekend working criticised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital's weekend arrangements have been branded "highly unsatisfactory" following the death of a grandmother.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandra Wood died at Maidstone Hospital on 18 April after collapsing at home.
An inquest heard the 69-year-old was referred to Tunbridge Wells Hospital the previous day with a possible bowel obstruction but sent home.
Senior coroner Roger Hatch said she died of natural causes as a consequence of its "failure" to diagnose her properly and give her a CT scan.
The retired shop assistant from Burham, near Rochester, and her partner Richard Wood, were told "hospital policy" meant the scan could only be arranged for an emergency and it was highly unlikely she would receive it at the weekend.
Mrs Wood was diagnosed with a constipation and urinary tract infection, sent home with a prescription in the early hours of Saturday 18 April and told she could return for a scan on 20 April.
Hours later she collapsed at home and was taken to Maidstone Hospital where she died.
Mr Hatch told the inquest at Gravesend Old Town Hall the CT scan should have been carried out on 17 or 18 April "due to the emergency situation that had occurred".
"It is highly unsatisfactory that facilities for a CT scan to be carried out at the weekend at Tunbridge Wells Hospital are not routinely available without having to go through a number of steps for this to be arranged.
"In this case, the delay until Monday was critical as the outcome has sadly demonstrated."
The family of Mrs Wood have launched civil action against Tunbridge Wells Hospital.
Her daughter, Amanda Sparkes, said: "The coroner has now confirmed what we always suspected - the hospital's policy not to carry out a scan caused this tragedy.
"It is devastating to think that had my mum been given the treatment she deserved she would have survived."
In a statement Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said it carried out CT scans at weekends and overnight "based on individual clinical need following careful clinical assessment".
"We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs Wood's family," it continued.
