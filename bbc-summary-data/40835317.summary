[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical consigned a profligate Dundee to consecutive Scottish Premiership defeats.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Allan and Faissal El Bakhtaoui spurned early chances for the visitors, before Darian MacKinnon guided a clever volley home to break the deadlock.
Boyd's sublime lob doubled the Accies' advantage before the break.
Dees' Scott Allan blazed a second-half penalty over the bar, before Dougie Imrie compounded the visitors' misery with a spot-kick of his own.
The victory earns Hamilton their first points of the Premiership season.
There was a bright opening to this encounter from both sides and the first chance fell the way of the hosts, when Ali Crawford's cross was met on the volley by Boyd 14 yards out, his strike flying over the bar.
A mistake by Accies defender Georgios Sarris provided Allan with Dundee's first opportunity. He was clean through on goal but elected to pass when he would have been better to try a shot himself.
A few minutes later El Bakhtaoui had two chances to put the Dark Blues in front. Cammy Kerr's long delivery was controlled by the Moroccan forward, who got in behind the home defence. His first shot was parried by Gary Woods, and he could only find the crossbar with the rebound.
Dundee were to rue those misses when Accies took the lead in the 24th minute. A Crawford corner from the left was cushioned back to MacKinnon at the edge of the box, and he managed to steer the ball into the bottom corner.
Hamilton doubled their lead with a tremendous goal from Boyd. The 20-year-old, from just inside the box on the right, latched onto an Ioannis Skondras through ball before superbly lobbing the advancing Scott Bain.
Early in the second half, captain Darren O'Dea came close to pulling a goal back for the visitors when he got his head to an Allan corner at the near post, and Hendry just failed to make a proper connection as it flew wide.
Another set-piece almost provided Accies with a third goal, as Crawford's corner was met on the volley by Scott McMann arriving late into the box. His left-foot effort, though, was blocked on the line.
Dundee wasted another opportunity when substitute Danny Williams got in behind Sarris, and really should have scored, but his tame shot was turned away by the leg of Woods.
The visitors' misery in front of goal continued as Allan missed from the penalty spot, blasting over the bar after Skondras had pulled down Williams. Then Marcus Haber fluffed his shot after being set up by Williams six yards out and Woods smothered his effort.
At the other end Accies showed precision where their visitors had been profligate. Imrie, on his 200th start for the Lanarkshire club, smashed his penalty past Bain to complete the victory.
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "Dundee had a couple of early chances probably coming from our slack play.
"We were a little bit casual at times and gave them opportunities where Woods made good saves. From there we grew into the game and I thought we were the better team.
"Scoring goals and killing games off is something we struggled to do last season. The second goal was big - it gave us that little cushion - so overall, pleased with the performance and the result."
Dundee manager Neil McCann: "I'm pretty angry with the two goals we've lost. Poor, poor goals. We don't get up on the second header from the set-piece for the first, and the second one was really poor defensively, but we should have been two up before Hamilton got one.
"I changed us to combat their three in the second half and I thought there was only one team in it. I don't know how many chances we need to score.
"Today I'm disappointed by the goals we conceded but I thought we were in total domination second half, and you're always leaving yourself open to counterattacks when you go man-for-man and go so direct in your play.
"But I think we made enough chances there to not only get something from the game but to win it."
