A driving instructor was also fined for using a mobile while he had a learner in his car, West Midlands Police said.
Police used an unmarked HGV cab to peer into lorries and inside cars below during a week-long crackdown, which also caught 30 truck drivers.
They were all fined Â£200 and given six points on their licence.
Inspector Sion Hathaway, from the Central Motorway Police Group, said: "It's disappointing that despite all the publicity around tougher new punishments, and the dangers of distracted driving, many people are still putting lives at risk by using phones at the wheel.
"It's shocking so many HGV drivers were among those we caught: these are professional drivers, ones that should be setting high standards, yet we found 30 truckers phoning, texting or using the internet while driving."
