[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Suspension Bridge Leigh Woods tower repairs begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Restoration work has begun on the second support tower of the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Repainting girders below the bridge deck will mean lifting the footway clear of the girders and closing it to pedestrians for several months.
Masonry will also be cleaned and re-pointed and repairs carried out to the roof of the Leigh Woods tower.
The bridge will be closed to vehicles and cyclists from 14 to 16 March to allow scaffolding to be erected.
During the bridge closures a diversion route will be signed, using Bridge Valley Road, Brunel Way and A369 Rownham Hill.
Protective sheeting will also be installed to prevent debris and dust contaminating the Avon Gorge below.
Work on the first of the two Clifton towers was completed in 2015.
