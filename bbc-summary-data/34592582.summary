A teenage ship's captain who saved his crew as their fishing boat sank has been recognised at a national awards ceremony.

Jake Bowman-Davies, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire, was 16 when his Milford Haven-based boat filled with water at night off the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd.
After two hours of trying to pump the water out, he decided to abandon the crabbing boat.
He has now been given a commendation from the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society.
Jake, now 17, said after the incident: "I just knew if I kept calm it would be better.
"You realise what you're doing and what they've told you in training just kicks in."
He received his award for courage and determination from the charity at London's Fishmongers' Hall on Wednesday.
Ben Ainslie, the most successful sailor in Olympic history, described Jake's feat as "impressive".
His 15-metre (50ft) vessel got into difficulty at 22:30 GMT on 12 February, just weeks after Jake had taken over as skipper of his father's boat, Cesca.
After being woken by his three-man crew - aged 30, 23 and 20 - Jake discovered the boat was taking on water fast.
Before coastguards could reach the boat, the engines cut out but he kept his cool.
As the ship was rolling and pitching heavily, the four men climbed over the side of the listing fishing boat and jumped into an inflatable life raft.
Within 20 minutes, an RAF helicopter arrived and the crew was airlifted away.
The Shipwrecked Mariners' Society has been giving awards for skill and gallantry at sea since 1851.
