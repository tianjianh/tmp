(Close): Leading US stocks ended barely moved on the first trading day of 2015, after disappointing economic news regarding US manufacturing activity.

The Dow Jones added 9.92 points or 0.06% to 17,832.99.
The broader S&P 500 index fell 0.70 points or 0.03% at 2,058.20 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 9.24 points or 0.20% to 4,726.81.
Investors were worried by two reports showing slowdowns in US manufacturing and construction activity.
The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index came in at 55.5 in December, which was below expectations but still indicated expansion.
Another report showed that US construction spending dropped 0.3% in November, when most analysts had been expecting a 0.3% gain.
Overall, however, trading volume was low on Wall Street, as many took the day off after the New Year's holiday.
One of the day's biggest winners was IBM, which saw its share price rise by over 1% after it received positive attention from analysts at consultancy Morningstar and elsewhere.
