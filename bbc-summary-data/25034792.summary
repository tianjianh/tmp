London reacts to 24-hour weekend Tube service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London's Tube is to run 24 hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays on some lines from 2015.

The announcement of a new Night Tube service will support the city's "vibrant night-time economy" and boost businesses, jobs and leisure opportunities, Transport for London said.
Tube users largely supported the move praising increased convenience and a move away from a reliance on night buses, but some were concerned about safety late at night.
Charlotte Lindsey-Cook, 19.
I think it's wicked. They do it in Berlin and it makes going out so much easier. If you go out till one or two you are stranded and night buses aren't great. We went to Berlin on holiday and you didn't have to worry about the buses.
Helen Stansfeld, 56.
I don't use the Tube at night but my kids do. I think it's probably a good idea. We used to live in Hong Kong and they had night stuff happening much more than here. It's good to know your young people can get home safely.
Sam Olaleye, 32.
I don't go out much because I've got kids but when I did it was a case of 'how do you get home?'. It would be good for safety. One night I had to wait for a night bus in a not-so-nice area. Running Tubes at night will make it safer and quicker to get home.
Tim Ednie, 48.
I think it's a good idea. London is a 24-hour city so why can't the Tubes be? It should have happened years ago. I've never known why London doesn't when the clubs are all licensed to 2, 3 or 4am. The people I drive don't generally take the Tube. If they come into London at the weekend I'll be driving them.
Patricia Armario, 23.
I think you will have more independence. When I go out I have to take the bus. I live in the south so it's faster to get to the centre of London on the Tube. I think it might make things more dangerous though because people will be drunk and there might be strange people on the Tube. There are good things and bad things.
Here's some of your reaction to news that LU ticket offices are closing and Tube trains will run for 24 hours
