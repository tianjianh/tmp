The 28-year-old Frenchman, a product of the Monaco youth set-up, has previously played in Scotland with Hamilton Academical, for whom he netted 28 goals in 70 appearances.
He moved to Norwich in 2015 for a reported Â£1m but has made just 19 appearances so far.
"I am delighted with this capture," said United manager Ray McKinnon.
"Tony is an excellent player who is a proven goal scorer and he will add real quality and goal threat to our squad."
Accies and Scottish Premiership rivals Ross County had hoped to sign Andreu, but he will instead be playing in Scotland's second tier with United.
Meanwhile, 16-year-old defender Kieran Freeman has left United to join Southampton for an undisclosed fee.
The Tannadice club have also sent four young players out on loan, with striker Justin Johnstone joining for United boss Jackie McNamara at York City.
Defender Cammy Ballantyne has joined Montrose, striker Aaron Murrell will be with Cowdenbeath and goalkeeper Brett Long with Forfar Athletic.
