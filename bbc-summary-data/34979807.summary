Speculation linking Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny with a move to Wasps next season is "obvious", according to the club's director or rugby Dai Young.

Halfpenny's contract with Toulon runs out in summer 2016, and with Wasps losing All Black Charles Piutau at the end of the campaign, Young is not surprised at the reports.
"Leigh Halfpenny is an obvious one," Young said.
"I'm just looking forward to seeing who we get linked with next week."
Wasps are not the only club being linked with a move for the 26-year-old Halfpenny, who missed the recent Rugby World Cup because of injury.
His former side Cardiff Blues are reportedly interested, while Scarlets have said they would be keen to take the player back to Wales.
"I know Leigh really well. I was at Cardiff when he came through the system. We all know he is a quality player." Young added.
"We will make no bones about it - this is recruitment season and we are looking at getting the best for us.
"It is a great situation to be in, getting linked with these players. But there's no point me saying much more than we are at a point where we are looking to strengthen our squad."
Former Wales and Lions scrum-half Robert Jones wants Halfpenny to continue his career in Wales.
But he feels Halfpenny could help Wasps achieve their ambitions.
"They're a very ambitious club and Dai Young is a very ambitious coach and I think we've seen already in the European competition that they're a side capable of winning silverware this season," Jones told BBC Radio Wales.
"And I think they want to progress to become the best they probably can.
"Leigh Halfpenny is a player who would fit in to ensuring that they do.
"I think Dai Young will be desperately keen to get him on board.
"I hope he comes back to Wales, but ultimately it's going to boil down to the offer that's on the table."
