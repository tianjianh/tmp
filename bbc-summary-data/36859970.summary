[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three early Bronze Age axe heads found in Monmouthshire have been declared treasure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were unearthed in a field in Llanover in August 2014 by Peter Shephard while he was metal detecting.
It is believed they were buried in a ritual ceremony up to 3,750 years ago.
National Museum Wales expert Adam Gwilt said one appeared to be more advanced with a stop across the middle which would have improved the way a wooden handle was attached.
"These axes provide important new information about the development and use of bronze tools," he said.
The museum hopes to acquire the hoard.
