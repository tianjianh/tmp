[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McGibbon, 33, was shot in the legs in an alleyway at Butler Place.
He later died from his injuries in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
Police said his killing bore the hallmarks of a paramilitary murder.
A funeral mass for Mr McGibbon was held at Holy Cross Church, close to where he lived on the Crumlin Road.
He was married with a young family.
Police have said Mr McGibbon had contacted them to say two masked men had arrived at his house on the evening of Thursday 14 April.
The men ordered him to come out of the house but he refused, and they told him they would return.
Mr McGibbon's murder has been referred to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.
