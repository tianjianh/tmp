[SN]TITLE[SN]
Somerset head teacher banned for changing SATs answers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher who changed answers on pupils' SATs test has been banned from the profession for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Knight, the now-retired head of Tatworth Primary School near Chard in Somerset, made a "considerable number of amendments" in Key Stage 2 exams in maths, spelling and reading in 2014.
The school was under pressure to improve after an Ofsted report in 2013 rated it as requiring improvement.
Mr Knight accepted amendments were made but denied he had tampered with papers.
A National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) panel found Mr Knight had a previously good record and had retired from the school in August 2014 after a successful career.
But following a review of the 2014 SATs exam papers by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA), a considerable number of amendments were found, which the NCTL concluded were "more likely than not" made by Mr Knight.
The report said his actions constituted "unacceptable professional conduct" and fell "significantly short" of the standards expected of the profession.
The panel added: "His actions were deliberate and he was aware of the importance of following the STA procedures.
"This was a very serious case of maladministration, involving all the school's Key Stage 2 SATs results being annulled."
Mr Knight, who was head teacher from April 2002, did not attend the hearing.
He has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days.
