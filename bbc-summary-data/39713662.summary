Autumn internationals: Wales face southern hemisphere 'big three'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have confirmed dates and kick-off times for their autumn international series in November and December 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They face Australia, Georgia, New Zealand and South Africa on consecutive Saturdays starting on 11 November and finishing on 2 December.
In 2016 Rob Howley guided the team to wins over Argentina, Japan and South Africa after defeat by the Wallabies.
Warren Gatland is due back in charge this autumn following the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.
Georgia's visit, on 18 November, will see them face Wales for the first time, though they have played at the Principality Stadium before.
A crowd of 69,187 watched New Zealand beat them 43-10 in Cardiff during the 2015 World Cup.
The All Blacks have not played Wales in Cardiff since November 2014, and are traditionally the biggest draw of the autumn series.
The 33-30 win over Japan was the best attended of the 2016 autumn internationals in Cardiff, with games against Australia, Argentina and South Africa all failing to break through the 60,000 barrier - though the aggregate attendance of 235,042 matched the average for a four-match series this decade.
However, the Welsh Rugby Union have announced price reductions for the visits of the Wallabies and Springboks, while tickets for the game against Georgia start at £20 with under-16s paying £10.
11 November: Australia (17:15 GMT)
18 November: Georgia (14:30 GMT)
25 November: New Zealand (17:15 GMT)
2 December: South Africa (14:30 GMT)
