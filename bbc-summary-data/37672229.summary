Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac says Scott Williams is making a big claim for an international starting spot.

Williams shone for Scarlets in their 28-11 Champions Cup win over Sale.
Caretaker Wales coach Rob Howley names his squad for the autumn internationals on Tuesday and Pivac expects to see centre Jonathan Davies feature due to his partnership with Williams.
"I thought Scott and Jonathan [Davies] combined very well and it augurs well for Wales going forward," Pivac said.
"Scott was in a moon boot for the first half of the week with a sprained toe, and so I thought he played pretty well," he continued.
"The medical team managed him really well and for him to go 80 minutes was very impressive.  It was pleasing to see him step up.
"You would expect to see Jamie Roberts and Scott in the squad selection, along with Jonathan, and whichever way they go it will be a good combination."
Pivac was thrilled with the start his side made in the European Champions Cup, but knows it will still be tough to qualify sharing a group with champions Saracens and 2014-15 winners Toulon.
Saracens inflicted a first European home defeat on Toulon on Saturday, as they won 31-23 against the French side and Scarlets travel to Allianz Park to face the reigning champions in their next Champions Cup game.
"This is a very tough pool, we had a look at the Saracens v Toulon game and both of those sides are going to be a step up again," Pivac told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"We have to keep building, take confidence from this performance and throw the kitchen sink at Saracens. This is a very, very tough pool.
"We are in with two giants of the game who in the last two years have held up the silverware. We are under no illusions it will only get tougher from here, but we need to get tougher as a group.
"There are a few areas we can improve on."
