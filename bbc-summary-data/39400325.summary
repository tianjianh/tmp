Football League: Cavan earn draw against Kerry to keep alive hopes of avoiding drop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cavan kept alive their hopes of staying in Division One of the Football League as they earned a 1-10 to 0-13 draw against Kerry at Breffni Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Breffnimen could escape if they beat already-relegated Roscommon next week and Mayo lose against Donegal and Kerry are beaten by Tyrone.
Mayo boosted their survival hopes and hit Tyrone's chances of reaching the final by winning 1-10 to 0-12 in Omagh.
A late Conor McManus penalty snatched Monaghan a draw against Donegal.
Donegal appeared to have weathered a strong challenge from Monaghan - helped by seven points from Michael Murphy and an early Micheal Carroll goal - but against the run of play, the Farney men earned a late penalty and McManus, who had been subdued at Ballyshannon, held his nerve to send Mark Anthony McGinley the wrong way from the spot.
Donegal looked set to put themselves in pole position to clinch a final spot only for McManus' penalty to mean that a plethora of permutations remain heading into the final series of round robin games next weekend.
Rory Gallagher's side remain in second place on eight points, level with Monaghan, but as it stands, even sixth-placed Kerry and fifth-placed Mayo could qualify for the decider by beating Tyrone and Donegal, respectively next weekend.
Tyrone drop to fourth spot, after their narrow defeat on Sunday, and will clinch a final place if they win in Kerry and Donegal and Monaghan are both beaten next weekend.

Cavan led 0-3 to 0-1 early on at Breffni Park but then lost their way as Kerry fought back to lead 0-6 to 0-4 at half-time.
Both teams had players black carded in the first half with Kerry defending Kevin McCarthy departing early on and Cavan's Killian Brady then falling victim following a fly-hack on a loose ball.
Dara McVeety's move to full-forward boosted Cavan as his goal helped them move 1-7 to 0-9 ahead.
Kerry fought back to lead by two but late points by Conor Moynagh and sub Seanie Johnston helped Cavan level.
Michael Geaney has a difficult late free chance to snatch victory for Kerry but was off target.
Paul Geaney hit five of Kerry's points while substitute Barry John Keane also notched two scores for the Kingdom.

Carroll struck Donegal's goal in the fifth minute after good work by Ryan McHugh and Eoghan Ban Gallagher but six Jack McCarron points helped Monaghan fight back to lead 0-9 to 1-5 at half-time.
Four unanswered points after the resumption, including a score from substitute Patrick McBrearty, helped Donegal move three ahead and while McManus' first point of the day contributed to Monaghan closing the gap to one, the home side looked home and hosed as they moved three up once more.
But a moment of slackness in the Donegal defence, as Martin McElhinney push Darren Hughes, saw Monaghan being awarded their late penalty which McManus coolly converted.
Both teams suffered worrying injuries with influential Donegal star Ryan McHugh stretchered off in the second half with Monaghan defender Ryan McAnespie having endured a similar fate in the opening period.
Kevin McLoughlin's late winner helped Mayo repeat last summer's narrow win the Red Hands.
Tyrone were left to lament 14 wides, with Mickey Harte's side also dropping short a series of chances.
With Mattie Donnelly restored to his favourite midfield position following a brief experiment as an inside forward, the Red Hands pressed forward with pace from deep, but their finishing was poor
A Niall Sludden point was immediately followed by him being black carded for a challenge on Lee Keegan.
Keegan himself also received a black card for hauling down Kieran McGeary ten minutes later, with Sean Cavanagh edging the home side two points clear from the resultant free.
But Mayo crafted a superb 28th-minute goal as Cillian O'Connor's inch-perfect pass found Andy Moran, who spotted Tom Parsons' run, with the midfielder slotting past Niall Morgan.
After Mayo led by 1-6 to 0-8 at the break, Tyrone missed a goal chance as Conor Meyler scuffed his shot.
With Chris Barrett beginning to find the measure of the jinking Mark Bradley, Tyrone's attack started to labour before Kieran McGeary landed a long range point to bring the sides level for the fifth time.
As both teams retreated when not in possession, a 14-minute period without a score followed Bradley's 48th-minute leveller.
Tyrone dropped a couple of glorious chances short before McLoughlin edged Mayo ahead in the second minute of injury-time.
At the death, Tyrone had claims for a free turned down as Sean Cavanagh went to ground but Conor Lane instead awarding Mayo a free for over-carrying as the visitors held on for a gutsy win.
