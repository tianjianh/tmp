Tube ticket office closures caused 'significant issues'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Underground (LU) offices were closed before measures were taken to ensure passengers still received a proper service, a review has found.

The independent review by TravelWatch said offices should not be re-opened but called for staff to be more visible and ticket machines to be improved.
The ticket office closures were agreed while Boris Johnson was London's mayor.
Sadiq Khan, who commissioned the review, said he had "asked TfL urgently to present a full action plan".
TravelWatch review said "significant issues" needed to be addressed to "deliver good customer service".
Stephen Locke, chair for the travel watchdog, said problems found included "the layout of stations, the services provided by ticket vending machines... and assistance for people with disabilities".
The mayor of London said the report "makes it clear that more has to be done to ensure passengers can get the right information and support".
Specific initiatives from the action plan he ordered include:
Mark Wild, managing director of LU, welcomed the review and said TfL was "completely focussed on making the changes needed".
Conservative London Assembly member Keith Prince said the report vindicated Mr Johnson's decision to close the ticket offices, calling them "outdated in the modern transport system".
But Rail Maritime and Transport (RMT) union general secretary Mick Cash said the report was "an opportunity missed as it fails to tackle the crisis of understaffing on the Tube".
