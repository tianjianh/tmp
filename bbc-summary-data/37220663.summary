[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh fly-half Jason Tovey will miss the first two months of the new season with a fractured wrist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh stand-off, 27, who signed a  two-year deal in May after an initial loan spell in the capital, is expected to be sidelined for around eight weeks.
Tovey sustained the injury in training last week and a scan revealed a small fracture, although it is thought the injury won't require surgery.
Edinburgh open their Pro12 campaign away to Cardiff Blues on Saturday.
Tovey is likely to miss at least Edinburgh's opening six Pro12 matches as well as the first two rounds of European Challenge Cup fixtures in October.
In his absence, new arrival and Scotland international Duncan Weir is set to start the campaign in the number 10 jersey.
