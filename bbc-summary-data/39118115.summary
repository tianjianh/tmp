Paul Robinson: Birmingham City club captain has Wolves red card overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City club captain Paul Robinson has had his red card in Friday's Championship victory against Wolves at Molineux overturned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robinson, 38, was sent off in the 53rd minute following a challenge involving Wolves striker Jon Dadi Bodvarsson.
Both players ended up on the floor, after which referee Stephen Martin showed Robinson a straight red card for violent conduct.
But an Independent Regulatory Commission has upheld Blues' appeal.
Martin has shown three red cards this season and all three have been rescinded - he sent off Newcastle pair Jonjo Shelvey and Paul Dummett in a game at Nottingham Forest on 2 December, but both dismissals were subsequently overturned.
The offence would have carried an automatic three-match suspension, but Robinson is now clear to play and available for selection when Blues host his former club, promotion-chasing Leeds United, at St. Andrew's on Friday.
Blues recorded only their second win under Gianfranco Zola when they hung on to beat neighbours Wolves 2-1 with only 10 men.
That lifted Zola's side 12 points clear of the relegation zone ahead of Friday's match, the first of 12 they have left to play this season.
