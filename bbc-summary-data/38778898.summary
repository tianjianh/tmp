[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 2-2 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One promotion chasers Bradford were held to a draw by Gillingham despite Charlie Wyke's debut goal at Valley Parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wyke, a deadline-day signing from Carlisle, took just 15 minutes to score for his new club as he cancelled out Josh Wright's opener.
The striker then played a role in Tony McMahon's goal which put Bradford ahead seven minutes before half-time but Deji Oshilaja's strike earned the Gills a third successive draw.
Gillingham took the lead in the 14th minute when Ryan Jackson's long throw fell to an unmarked Wright and he drilled in his third goal in as many games.
But a minute later Mark Marshall hung up a cross to the far post where Wyke headed home.
The Bantams took the lead when Wyke was fouled on the edge of the area and, after Billy Clarke's free-kick was tipped on to a post by Stuart Nelson, McMahon tucked in the rebound.
Oshilaja levelled four minutes into the second half when Jackson's ball found its way to the back post where the defender stabbed home.
Wyke had a header cleared off the line by Rory Donnelly with 21 minutes left and Gillingham survived some late pressure to earn a point.
