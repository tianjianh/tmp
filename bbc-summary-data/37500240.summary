The 21-year-old admitted offering money to another player to underperform at an ITF Futures F1 tournament in his home country in November 2015.
The fellow player reported the approach to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), which carried out an investigation.
Chetty is currently ranked 1,857th in the world, with a career high of 1,370.
The TIU said the identity of the player who was approached will remain confidential.
"The findings of a resultant TIU investigation were referred to independent anti-corruption hearing officer, Ian Mill QC, who considered the case and imposed the lifetime ban from all professional tennis," said a TIU statement.
"The lifetime ban from all professional tennis applies with immediate effect and means the player is not allowed to compete in, or attend, any tournament or event organised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of the sport."
