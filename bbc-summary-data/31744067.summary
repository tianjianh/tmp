The One Direction singer says the claims are "out of order".
The 21-year-old wrote on Twitter that he spends his time off at the gym and playing computer games with mates.
The Inquisitr's article quoted tweets where Liam had written about performing at an "early show after a night out".
The story was also promoted on the website's Twitter account, which has 4,600 followers.
In a series of tweets, aimed at The Inquisitr's Twitter account, Liam says he usually does not really like to respond to news articles but was making an exception for this one.
"Thanks for worrying but I don't spend my time off stage drinking," he explains.
"Don't treat me like I'm any different to a normal boy my age."
The article has not been taken down from The Inquisitr's website.
Liam also said sorry to his followers for the series of messages, tweeting: "Apologies for the rant guys have a nice evening."
