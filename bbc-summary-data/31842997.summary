The British band will kick off their Psycho tour in Belfast on Sunday, before playing venues in Glasgow, Newport, Exeter, Manchester and Brighton.
The album, which is released on 8 June, will be called Drones.

The first single from the album, Dead Inside, will be out on 23 March.
Download 2015 headliners say they'll premiere some of their album tracks on their YouTube channel in early March.
