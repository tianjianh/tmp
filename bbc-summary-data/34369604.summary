Mr Brett was last seen running in the Torridon area of Wester Ross last Sunday.
A search involving a coastguard helicopter and several mountain rescue teams was launched for the 65-year-old, from the Dingwall area, after he was reported missing.
Police confirmed a body was recovered earlier on Saturday.
Mr Brett left on Sunday 20 September and was reported missing on Thursday when he failed to return from a trip.
The experienced hill runner was thought to have planned to run a route covering Beinn Eighe, Beinn Dearg, Beinn Alligan and Liathach.
The force said in a statement: "During extensive searches carried out in the Torridon area, sadly a body was recovered in the area of Liathach this afternoon and has subsequently been formally identified as that of Mr Brett.
"There are no suspicious circumstances regarding his death."
