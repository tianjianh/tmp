It has launched the next phase of its 10-year regeneration strategy.
It will focus on the Broomielaw, Blythswood, Central and St Enoch districts.
The council said it would work with businesses and developers as part of a "conversation with Glaswegians" aimed at shaping the future of their city.
It said the strategy - called the Glasgow City Centre Districts Regeneration Framework - was the first time stakeholders in these areas had been given the opportunity to "put forward their aspirations for regeneration and physical change".
Key priorities for the regeneration of the city centre include:
Launching the latest phase, council leader Frank McAveety said: "The future of Glasgow city centre is of huge importance to so many of us as this area is, without doubt, the economic powerhouse of Scotland.
"This next stage of the regeneration framework for the city centre will look at four districts that play a significant role in our economic and cultural life, to identify and support and then develop the assets they have in new and innovative ways to ensure Glasgow continues to grow.
"There will be an investment of Â£115m in the city centre from the Glasgow City Region City Deal, and our engagement with the stakeholders of these areas will help decide how this investment is delivered."
He added: "At the end of this process, we can look forward to a city centre that has changed for the better to become an even more attractive place in which to live, work, study, invest and visit."
The first stage in the regeneration of the city centre was carried out in 2015 in the Sauchiehall and Garnethill districts.
After that public consultation, key recommendations included a new cycle and pedestrian bridge and a new urban park over part of the M8 near Charing Cross.
