[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-3 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster extended their lead at the top of League Two to seven points with a comfortable victory at Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A first Rovers goal for Mathieu Baudry and a John Marquis double earned the visitors a fifth straight win.
Doncaster were always going to be favourites and their captain James Coppinger was first to seriously threaten as he hit the outside of the post from 20 yards.
Seven minutes later and the visitors did take the lead. A well-worked free-kick routine caught the home side napping as Conor Grant's cross was swept in by Baudry.
By the 35th minute it was 2-0, Matt Butcher at fault as he lost the ball to Coppinger who found Marquis and the striker hit it low past Artur Krysiak.
The second for Marquis was a superb individual effort on 80 minutes, as he broke from the halfway line and into the box before finding the bottom corner.
