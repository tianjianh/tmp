[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 1-0 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Compton's first-half penalty was enough for Yeovil Town to move above Newport County in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Compton scored from the spot after Tavhon Campbell was upended by Danny Holmes.
Newport seldom looked like scoring and have now lost four successive games, slipping down to 21st in the table.
They are 12 points above the relegation zone while Yeovil are 19th and 13 points clear of safety.
Newport County manager Warren Fenney told BBC Radio Wales: "I wanted a performance and wanted a response and they gave me that.
"I don't think we deserved to lose the game. Over the percentage of the game I thought we had more of the game.
"But it's fine lines in football. This league for me is between set plays and desires in both boxes and unfortunately we didn't have that."
