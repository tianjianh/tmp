The American, 27, posted nine birdies on the Fife coast to sit one clear of South Korea's Kim In-Yung (65) and two ahead of American Lindy Duncan (66).
England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Mel Reid and are part of a five-strong group on five under, after 67s.
"I'm really proud," said Wie, who equalled her best professional round.
"I really took advantage of the [morning] conditions, but it was a really fun day."
Wie, who shot to prominence when she turned pro at the age of 15, finished 19th at the Ladies Scottish Open at Dundonald last week.
She won the US Women's Open in 2014 but her best finish at the British Women's Open is tied third 12 years ago.
"I felt like I struggled a little bit in the past at British Opens, so I made it a point to come to the Scottish Open last week and get some good practice in," Wie said.
"I felt like that really helped me a lot, just getting used to playing links golf as it is so different."
Ewart Shadoff recorded three birdies on the back nine in compiling a flawless 67 amid the worse of the fluctuating conditions, with play suspended twice because of heavy rain and the threat of lightning.
Reid, conversely, had the better of the weather in the morning and managed to make seven birdies before dropping shots on the 14th and 16th to slip back to five-under.
"You're not going to get it much tamer than that at Kingsbarns," she said. "It's very important to take advantage of your early tee time so I was very happy to do that today."
Taking part in her 37th consecutive Women's British Open, Dame Laura Davies carded seven birdies in a round of 68.
The 53-year-old was also hampered by the weather, with three dropped shots after the hour and 20 minute delay causing her to fall down the leaderboard.
British number one Charley Hull, again playing in the trickier afternoon weather, also finished with a 68 despite a terrific eagle putt on the 11th, as did fellow Englishwoman Georgia Hall.
Pamela Prestwell is the leading Scot at one under, with Sally Watson and Heather Macrae a further shot back.
Catriona Matthew, looking to earn a playing spot at the Solheim Cup, was joint poorest performing Scot on four-over-par 76, which left her in 133rd position.
Carly Booth, who was the top performing Scot at the Ladies Scottish Open, struggled on the back nine as she, too, ended with a 76.
