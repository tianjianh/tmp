[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Cruwys, 44, was assaulted in Littles Lane on Saturday. He suffered head injuries and remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.
Almost Â£23,000 has been raised to help Mr Cruwys' family after a fundraising appeal was set up by a Wolves fan.
An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of wounding, in Wednesfield, during the early hours.
He has since been released on police bail.
West Midlands Police said father-of-two Mr Cruwys, from Hemel Hempstead, was with a group of friends when he was assaulted.
Det Insp Toni Naylor thanked anyone who had already come forward but appealed for anyone else who could help to contact them.
Wolves fan Ollie Floyd, 16, also of Hemel Hempstead, started the appeal on the Go Fund Me website after saying he was "absolutely disgusted" by the attack.
He said he would be contacting Watford FC to get the money to Mr Cruwys, a milkman.
