The 35-year-old 2004 Olympic silver medallist suffered head injuries when a taxi he was in with a team-mate crashed head on into a concrete barrier.
"He has very, very serious injuries and his condition is life-threatening," team doctor Bernd Wolfahrt said.
Another canoe team official, Christian Kaeding, had minor injuries and was treated in hospital, but then released.
Henze was first treated at a nearby hospital but had to be transferred to another clinic that has a special neurosurgery department.
Security and traffic have been a main concern for teams at the Games and several official Olympic buses have been involved in road accidents.
