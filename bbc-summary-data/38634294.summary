Swansea cinema-goers could be forgiven if a new release seems a tad familiar.

The city's Guildhall is the backdrop to new film trailer Their Finest, starring Gemma Arterton, Sam Clafin, Bill Nighy and Jeremy Irons, due for release in April.
Set in the early 1940s, it tells the story of filmmakers trying to make a patriotic film about Dunkirk, to boost British morale during the Blitz.
It is not the first time the building has featured on the big screen.
In 2014, Elijah Wood graced the Guildhall in Set Fire to the Stars - a story of Dylan Thomas' New York years.
It also featured in many scenes in The Collection, a TV series on Amazon Prime, set in a post-war Paris fashion house.
Based on a 2009 novel by Lissa Evans, the cast and crew in Their Finest spent several weeks filming at the Guildhall last autumn.
Councillor Robert Francis-Davies, cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said TV and movie filming was "very positive news for the city".
"It raises Swansea's profile, helps attract tourism and offers direct economic benefit," he added.
Other sites around the city to appear in the film include Glamorgan Street and areas of Brynmill, close to Rhyddings Park Road.
