The silver Vauxhall Corsa knocked down a bollard before crashing into the Salvation Army store in Trinity Street, Dorchester, just before 11:00 GMT.
Dorset Police said the driver, a man in his 70s, was checked over by ambulance crews and is not believed to have been injured.
There were no reports of anyone being hurt inside the shop.
The driver was attempting to park in the adjacent car park at the time of the crash, according to reports from the scene.
Ray Slater, from the Salvation Army, said staff were "shocked" after the crash.
Mr Slater said: "Our staff were at the other side of the shop so heard it, they didn't actually see it.
"It looks like the damage is just to merchandise - so that's fine - we're just pleased nobody was hurt."
He said it was likely part of the shop would have to close while repair work is carried out.
