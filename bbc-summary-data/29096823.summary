The "sky is the limit" for British modern pentathlete Joe Choong after the 19-year-old finished 16th in his World Championship debut in Poland.

That is the view of the sport's performance director Jan Bartu, who on Friday saw saw GB's Samantha Murray claim the women's title.
Jamie Cooke, who recently returned to the sport after a break to complete his studies, came 20th.
"He [Choong] handled the pressure superbly," Bartu told BBC Sport.
"He produced his first clean round in the show jumping and that's a dream result for him."
Although pleased with the overall result, Choong admitted he was frustrated that he could not score more points during the opening fencing event - when he placed 27th out of 36 athletes.
"I was getting evens all of the way around, winning one and then losing another and it was just silly mistakes," Choong told BBC Sport.
"I know I'm young but it does annoy me that with five or six more hits I could have finished near the top - but apart from that I'm chuffed."
Cooke, 23, a World Cup winner in 2013, is the current holder of the modern pentathlon 200m freestyle world record of one minute 49.59 seconds.

However, after taking nearly two months away from the British programme to complete his business communications degree at Bath Spa University, he was far from his best.
"Today was a bit of a disappointment," said Cooke.
"It has been a difficult year finishing university, but that's all out of the way now and I have two years to knuckle down ahead of the Rio Olympics."
The final day of the World Modern Pentathlon Championships in Poland will see Britain's Kate French and Joe Evans compete in the mixed relay event.
