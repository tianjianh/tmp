Scotland will boost their Six Nations hopes if they can secure back-to-back wins by beating Georgia on Saturday, captain Greig Laidlaw says.

Vern Cotter's side go into the match in Kilmarnock having beaten Argentina 19-16 after a 23-22 defeat by Australia.
"If we can get a performance and a result this weekend, we'll be in a great spot," said Laidlaw, 31.
"We enjoyed winning on Saturday, so it's very important we finish off this series with another win."
Gloucester scrum-half Laidlaw, who will join French Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne at the end of the season, described Scotland's series so far as "pretty brutal" but added: "That's part of the challenge.
"It won't drop off and we as players have got to drive that part of our performance forward.
"We understand what this game will be about and it's up to us to put in a performance at the weekend.
"To be honest, even though we fell short against Australia, we can still take confidence from the type of performance we put in."
Georgia overcame Samoa 20-16 on Saturday and Laidlaw expects another physical battle at Kilmarnock FC's Rugby Park on Saturday.
"Georgia are developing into a good side," added the former Edinburgh man. "They have had a lot of positive results this year and I'm sure they will be confident in their own right.
"They are big on their scrummaging and their forward play. Coming off the back of a big win they will be coming here to cause an upset.
"We will have to be right up for it. We need to play an aggressive game because they are an aggressive team themselves who like the contact side of the game.
"But so do we and we have shown that these last two weeks."
Laidlaw, meanwhile, says that his understudy Ali Price's "chance will come", after the Glasgow scrum-half remained on the bench for the whole of the matches against Australia and Argentina.
