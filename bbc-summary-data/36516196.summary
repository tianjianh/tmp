Kent's batsmen piled up 231-6 in just 30 overs as they thumped Somerset by 95 runs in a rain-reduced One-Day Cup match at Canterbury.

After the 11:00 BST start was delayed until 14:30 BST, Daniel Bell-Drummond (68) and Kent skipper Sam Northeast (64) took the attack to the bowlers.
Alex Blake added an unbeaten 36 while Somerset's Lewis Gregory claimed 3-37.
Somerset were never in the chase as they lost regular wickets to slump to 136 all out in just 24.2 overs.
At one stage Somerset were 64-6, before a quick-fire seventh-wicket stand of 53 between Roelof van der Merwe (29) and Alex Barrow (27) made sure the visitors reached three figures.
Earlier, Kent opener Bell-Drummond, who has been in superb form this summer in all three formats, shared 72 for the second wicket with Northeast in nine overs, striking eight fours and one six in his 51-ball innings.
Northeast was equally as impressive, reaching his half-century in just 35 balls, while Blake provided the impetus at the end of the innings smashing Craig Overton for two fours and two sixes in the 29th over.
The defeat was Somerset's first in four South Group matches, while Kent have won two out of three.
