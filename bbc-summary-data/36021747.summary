Amond fired the visitors ahead after being teed up by Andy Monkhouse.
Woking's Cameron Norman saw his free-kick crash against a post before Amond netted his second following good work from Omar Bogle and Craig Disley.
Bruno Andrade slotted home from close range to pull a goal back, but Amond sealed the points with a cool finish.
Grimsby, who were beaten in last season's play-off final, need two points from their remaining two games to secure a top-five spot this term.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"We started against a Grimsby side who started very quickly and moved the ball around and showed a lot of quality in a big way.
"We found ourselves 1-0 down in the first 20 minutes. they had players all over the park and we couldn't really live with them - they were playing some superb football.
"Playing against such a good side, a lot of teams would have turned around and buckled and folded, but I felt we showed a great deal of character and commitment and for a 15-minute period we played some very good football."
