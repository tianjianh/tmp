Gerry Adams: PPS 'correct' not to prosecute Sinn Féin leader for withholding rape allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision not to prosecute Gerry Adams for allegedly withholding evidence about his rapist brother was correct, a review has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sinn Féin leader's brother, Liam Adams, was convicted in 2013 of raping and abusing his own daughter, Aine Dahlstrom, in the 1970s.
She has waived her right to anonymity.
Mr Adams confronted his brother in 2000, who confirmed that he had abused Ms Dahlstrom. However, Gerry Adams did not report it to the police until 2007.
He made the report shortly after his party voted to accept the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
When Ms Dahlstrom's case came to court, a decision was made to use Gerry Adams as a witness in the case.
Following Liam Adam's conviction, Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin was asked to investigate the decision-making process employed by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).
Mr Larkin made two recommendations, the first of which is procedural.
However, he found that further inquiry ought to have been made about how much Gerry Adams knew about the abuse, and the allegations of serious offences such as rape.
The PPS has re-interviewed the rape victim in the case, who has indicated that she does not want to pursue the matter.
There will be no prosecution for withholding information.
