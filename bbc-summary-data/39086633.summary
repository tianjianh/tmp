[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goalmouth action was limited in the early stages with the first real chance not coming until the 29th minute when Stanley defender Matty Pearson hit the crossbar following Sean McConville's corner.
Barnet had to resort to some desperate defending to stop Stanley, with Michael Nelson blocking a goal-bound strike from McConville on the stroke of half-time.
The Bees' first shot on target did not come until first-half stoppage time but Mauro Vilhete's effort was easy for Stanley's on-loan goalkeeper Marek Rodak.
The home side started the second half with purpose and forward McCartan fired narrowly over from 30 yards while, at the other end, winger Jamal Campbell-Ryce saw a chip comfortably saved by Rodak.
McCartan then provided the game's decisive moment, firing a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner in the 54th minute after Billy Kee had been fouled on the edge of the area
The Bees' 22-goal top-scorer John Akinde should have levelled six minutes from time but his unmarked header from 10 yards was blocked on the line.
There was still time for Stanley substitute Jordan Clark to hit the woodwork.
