Swansea City manager Francesco Guidolin has confirmed he will look to replace Ashley Williams after his departure.

The Wales and Swans captain moved to Everton to replace Man City-bound John Stones in a deal Swansea 'reluctantly accepted' for a fee around Â£12 million.
"We need just one more signing - a central defender," Guidolin explained.
The Italian is yet to decide on Williams' replacement as Swansea captain. "When Leon Britton plays he'll be captain. After that I don't know."
Replacing Williams, who departed after eight years with the Swans, is Guidolin's priority.
"I have something [in mind] and with the chairman we have a short list of players," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"When a player decides to move for a new challenge then its best to let him go."
Swansea begin their Premier League campaign with a trip to Burnley on Saturday.
