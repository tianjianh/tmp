Under the deal Sportswise, which trades as rugbystore.co.uk, will create a new website and exclusively host Intersport's online offering.
The firm will hold and distribute Intersport products throughout the UK.
It will also boost its product range to include football, swimming, running and fitness on behalf of Intersport.
Sportswise, which has had a long-standing relationship with Intersport, said it planned to hire about 15 new staff. Roles will range from customer service and logistics, to marketing and graphic design.
The expansion of its headquarters, which has increased stock warehouse capacity, was made possible by a Â£500,000 loan from Bank of Scotland and a grant of Â£82,000 from Scottish Enterprise.
Rugbystore managing director Fraser Patterson, who has a seat on Intersport's board, said: "The expansion of our Peebles base and the amazing new facilities housed there will both continue to strengthen our relationship with Intersport and allow us to continue to build our reputation as providers of the highest quality sports merchandise in the UK and around the world."
Sportswise was originally established in 1974 as a high street retailer, with seven shops in the Borders and north of England, under the Intersport banner.
In 1997, it changed direction to become an online trader of rugby clothing and equipment, shipping merchandise to countries including Australia, USA, New Zealand, Latvia, Canada, Europe and Russia.
