London Irish have secured the signing of Edinburgh captain Mike Coman from next season on a three-year contract.

New Zealander Coman, 28, has been with Edinburgh for three seasons after moving from Hawke's Bay Magpies.
The back row led Edinburgh to last season's European Challenge Cup final and played two seasons of Super Rugby for the Wellington Hurricanes.
"Having spoken to Tom Coventry and seeing where he wants to take the club, I was happy to sign," Coman said.
"I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Edinburgh and will continue to work hard for the remainder of the season."
London Irish head of rugby operations Glenn Delaney added: "The addition of Mike to our squad for next season is a huge coup.
"He's a proven leader and will bring plenty of physicality to our forward pack."
