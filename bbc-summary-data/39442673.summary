The 29-year-old has been out of action since early January because of a neck injury, which he has had surgery on. The length of his new contract has not been disclosed.
"I couldn't be happier to have extended my time here at Bath, and there wasn't really any hesitation," Garvey said.
"It's the light at the end of the tunnel after going through my rehabilitation in the last few months."
Garvey has made 91 appearances for Bath since joining in 2013, but has featured in only 11 league games this season.
Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder said: "He's edging his way back to fitness and I know he will be determined to play a vital role in the run-in."
