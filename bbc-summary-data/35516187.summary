[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prayer service for a mother and two children who were murdered at their home has been held in their village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geraldine Newman, 51, daughter Shannon, 11 and son Shane, six, were found on Tuesday in Allerton Bywater, near Leeds.
The children's father, Paul Newman, 42, is suspected of killing them and was found dead on cliffs in Anglesey the same day.
About 100 people were expected to attend the service at St Mary's Church.
Reverend Canon Rosemarie Hayes said there had been "a lot of bewilderment and shock" over the deaths.
"The whole village is hurting," she said.
"I can't believe something like this has happened in a village like this. It's a small and caring community."
"I'm hoping the prayer service will help by trying to give a place for the village to gather in their grief."
Mrs Newman died of head injuries, a post-mortem examination showed. Her two children were stabbed to death.
The 51-year-old, a branch manager for Wilko in Castleford, was found downstairs in the house while the two children were discovered upstairs.
West Yorkshire Police said Mr Newman, from Normanton, had been previously jailed for domestic violence. He was charged with common assault on Mrs Newman in July 2013 and received a custodial sentence.
Detectives described the case as "shocking" and have said they were not looking for anyone else over the deaths.
The force said it would carry out a full review.
