In a conference call, the US reaffirmed its commitment to the security of its two allies, the South's defence ministry said in a statement.
South Korean news agency Yonhap also said US F-22 stealth fighters and a nuclear-powered submarine would join military exercises next month.
The UN has also condemned the test.
The Security Council called it a grave violation of UN resolutions.
US President Donald Trump described North Korea as a "big big problem". He said he would deal with it very strongly, but didn't give details.
North Korea said it had "successfully" test-fired a ballistic missile on Sunday in a launch supervised by leader Kim Jong-un.
State news agency KCNA described the device, fired into the Sea of Japan, as a "surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile".
