[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 3-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport were relegated from the National League after a dismal trip to Dover saw the home side prevail 3-0 and Ricky Modeste net twice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andy Preece's men were late to arrive due to traffic problems, and matters worsened for the Sandgrounders once they took to the Crabble Athletic Ground pitch.
Modeste put the hosts ahead on the half-hour, scoring on the rebound after Chris Cheetham had saved his initial effort.
Thirty-five goal man Ricky Miller was quiet until the last 20 minutes, but burst into life when he slammed home after getting on the end of a Moses Emmanuel chip.
Modeste notched another seconds later with a fine lob as Southport got that sinking feeling again.
