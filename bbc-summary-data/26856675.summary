The traditional Red Imp logo is being brought back by Lincoln City Football Club as part of celebrations to mark the club's 130th anniversary.

The symbol was originally used in the 1970s and 80s, an era which brought record-breaking success under Graham Taylor.
The club also secured promotion in 1980-81, finishing behind Southend United, with Colin Murphy in charge.
The new logo will appear on shirts from next season.
The club's nickname comes from a pair of imps which were said to have terrorised Lincoln Cathedral in the 14th Century.
General manager John Vickers said: "The return of a traditional imp to the shirts has a bit more of an identity with the club, and with the city as a whole."
"It has been a topic of discussion amongst supporters for some time," he added.
He added: "It is a new start for the club, and a chance for a new generation of supporters to embrace an element of our history."
The first known record of the club being referred to as The Imps was in the Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury, from an edition dated 2 February 1912.
The current branding, which has been in use since 2001, will continue to be used by the club's sport and education trust.
