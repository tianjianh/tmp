County Championship: Sam Northeast's century for Kent puts pressure on Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent captain Sam Northeast's unbeaten 173 rescued his side on day one against Derbyshire at Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Playing in only his third first-class match, Derbyshire paceman Will Davis took two early wickets to leave the hosts in a spot of bother on 90-4.
But Northeast's second Championship ton of 2016 then came in a 150-run stand with Adam Ball, a Kent seventh-wicket record in games against Derbyshire.
After Ball had gone, Northeast helped to see his side close on 354-7.
He has so far put on a further 38 for the eighth wicket with England spinner James Tredwell (11*), to leave Kent within 46 runs of a fifth batting bonus point.
