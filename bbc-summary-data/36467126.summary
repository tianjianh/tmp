Footballer Eniola Aluko, Scottish poet Jackie Kay and novelist Sunetra Gupta are also among the "remarkable" women who have been invited to edit editions.
Berry said she "jumped at the chance" to guest edit a show she had listened to "for as long as I can remember".
The Woman's Hour Takeover week runs from 13 to 17 June.
Berry's edition, to be aired on 13 June, will look at beekeeping, the legacy of girl guides and the therapeutic applications of gardening.
Jolie Pitt's, to be aired on 17 June, will explore the refugee crisis in the lead-up to World Refugee Day the following Monday.
The US actress and director, who is married to actor Brad Pitt, is the special envoy for the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.
Woman's Hour editor Alice Feinstein said each guest editor would bring "their own curiosity and unique insights" and share "their personal experiences on a series of topics".
Previous guest editors during Takeover week have included Harry Potter creator JK Rowling, actress Kim Cattrall and children's author Dame Jacqueline Wilson.
