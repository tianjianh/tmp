Former 70s boy band Bay City Rollers - whose return was announced earlier this week - have added two more concert dates at the Barrowlands in Glasgow.

The extra gigs were announced after tickets for the first two sold out in just three minutes.
During their heyday, the Scottish group sold 120 million records and had a huge teenage fanbase.
Three members of the band, which broke up in 1978, said they were reuniting to perform and record a new album.
Famed for their tartan outfits, the band had several line-ups over the years.
The reunion features three of the "classic five" - Les McKeown, Alan Longmuir and Stuart Wood - who had hits such as Bye Bye Baby and Shang-a-Lang.
They also performed several sell-out tours and hosted their own TV show.
All the available tickets for two shows at the Barrowlands were snapped up within minutes of going on sale on Friday morning.
Promoter Regular Music then announced that a third date had been added and later announced details of a fourth concert.
The band - who said they were reforming mainly for the fans - described the response as "amazing".
