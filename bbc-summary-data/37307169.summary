[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boy who drowned in the sea off northern France was on a day trip when he died, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Quinlan Pringle, 13, from Colchester, Essex, went to Boulogne-sur-Mer with his parents and four siblings on 15 August.
His mother saw three of her sons in difficulty in the sea when she went to get them to start the journey home.
Two made it back to shore but Quinlan could not be seen. His body was found by fisherman several days later.
A post-mortem examination found the cause of his death to be asphyxiation by drowning.

Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray recorded a verdict of accidental death.
She asked for her sympathies to be passed to Quinlan's family, who were not present at the inquest.
Colchester's Philip Morant School, where Quinlan was a pupil, described him as "an aspirational and hardworking young man with a cheeky, endearing side to him".
