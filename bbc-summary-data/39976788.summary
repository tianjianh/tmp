The 61-year-old, of Newton Abbot, Devon, is alleged to have committed the offences between 1973 and 1998.
He is due to appear before Newcastle Magistrates' Court on 9 June, Northumbria Police said.
The charges followed an investigation into "non-recent child sexual abuse in the sporting community", the force added.
Ormond is the first person to be charged as part of Operation Tide, which was set up late last year to look into allegations of child sex abuse at football clubs in the North East.
In November, Newcastle United said it would co-operate fully with the investigation.
Assistant Chief Constable Darren Best said inquiries were continuing.
He added: "We urge anyone who may have been a victim of abuse or has any information about suspected abuse within any sporting community to come forward and report it to us."
