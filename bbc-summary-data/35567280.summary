Stanley played the last seven minutes with 10 men after centre-back Tom Davies received a second booking.
Scott Brown's low drive proved the winner with three minutes left.
Kemar Roofe had earlier given the hosts a first-half lead with his 20th goal of the season but Billy Kee equalised just after the interval as he beat Benji Buchel at his left post.
