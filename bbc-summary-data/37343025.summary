The 35-year-old centre half was injured in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Swansea and left the Liberty Stadium on crutches.
The former England defender later posted a video on his Instagram page showing him having treatment.
A scan has revealed he will now miss Friday's home match with Liverpool, with David Luiz a possible replacement following his return to the club.
Brazilian international Luiz re-signed for the Blues from Paris St-Germain.
