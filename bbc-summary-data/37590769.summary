[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol flat fire death 'accidental'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a vulnerable man in a fire at his seventh floor flat was an accident, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bob Crane, 61, who had bipolar disorder, died from smoke inhalation, at his home in Carolina House, Dove Street, Bristol, in September 2014.
The court heard Mr Crane had burnt wood at his flat to cook and keep warm because his gas and electricity had been cut off.
Deputy coroner Peter Harrowing recorded a verdict of accidental death.
Mr Harrowing accepted the view of the local health and social workers that Mr Crane had the mental capacity to "understand and decline their offers of help".
He said at the time of Bob Crane's death "there was no real and immediate risk to Mr Crane's life that the State should have been aware of".
