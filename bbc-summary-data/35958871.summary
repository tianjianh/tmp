West Heslerton: Village goes up for sale for £20m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A village in North Yorkshire has gone on the market for a guide price of £20m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Heslerton, near Malton, has a 21-bedroom mansion, pub, petrol station, 43 homes and 2,116 acres of land.
The village has been owned by the same family for over 150 years, but has been put up for sale after the most recent owner died.
Cundalls estate agents said it had already attracted interest "from far and wide".
Eve Dawnay owned the estate until her death five years ago, with the family now deciding to sell.
West Heslerton also has a church, primary school and a playing field with a pavilion.
Tom Watson, of Cundalls, said: "Miss Dawnay was a wonderful lady.
"She was very kind and the property rents are - and have always been - very low.
"This has helped keep a vibrant village community with a mixed group of ages and there are obviously a lot of people hoping that somebody with a similar benevolent nature will come along to take over the estate."
More than 110 acres of woodland is also being sold by the family.
Mr Watson added: "All the tenants were told it was going on the market in September, since then the rumour mill has started going about potential buyers.
"We already have had interest from far and wide."
Miss Dawnay's sister, Verena Elliott, said: "We all loved it and it would be very hard to find a village with more loyal and lovely people living in it.
"There is a real sense of community which is hard to find these days."
Cundalls said about half a dozen properties in the village were privately-owned and, therefore, not included in the sale.
