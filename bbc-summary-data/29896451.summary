St Mirren: Jim Goodwin faces violent conduct charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Mirren player-coach Jim Goodwin has been charged by the Scottish FA with violent conduct and offered a two-match suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old Irishman is accused of striking Dundee United striker Aidan Connolly in the face with his elbow.
Goodwin was not pulled up for the offence during United's 3-0 win.
Should he accept the ban, the midfielder would miss three games from 15 November because of an additional suspension due to his recent record.
Goodwin has until Wednesday to respond to the complaint, with a hearing set for Thursday.
He was banned for two matches last season for elbowing United midfielder Stuart Armstrong.
This came after United released their own footage of the incident in the match at St Mirren Park.
