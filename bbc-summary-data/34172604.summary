Ulster Unionist MLA Michael Copeland has resigned his seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly due to ill health.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Copeland, who represented the East Belfast constituency, has stepped down as he has been suffering from depression.
The party's leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr Copeland "was good for us because he valued compassion above all else".
He added that Mr Copeland would now create "space for himself to concentrate on his own wellbeing".
"As an elected representative, Michael relentlessly championed policies which put the rights and needs of people first, particularly the vulnerable," Mr Nesbitt said.
"It is ironic that that very compassion has exhausted his capacity to continue in the role he cherished.
"Michael remains a member of the Ulster Unionist Party. We wish him well and hope that his health improves."
