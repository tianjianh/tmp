Emergency services were called to Coniston Street, Salford, at 23:20 BST on Monday after the shooting.
The 34-year-old suffered torso wounds and is in hospital, Greater Manchester Police said, although his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
Officers are keen to trace two men who were seen leaving the scene on a motorbike and are seeking witnesses.
Det Ch Insp Clare Devlin said: "People will understandably be alarmed when they hear about this incident but we believe that this was a targeted attack.
"We are treating this as an attempted murder but we are in the early stages of our investigation and are working to establish who may be behind the shooting.
"We are not linking this to any other recent shootings in Salford at this stage."
