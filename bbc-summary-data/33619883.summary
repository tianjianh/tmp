[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bloodhound SSC speed record helmet designed by schoolboy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A helmet designed by a schoolboy at the age of 11 is to be worn by the driver of a supersonic car when he attempts to break the land speed record.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam James, from Salisbury, now 13, entered a competition to design the helmet's artwork two years ago.
It will be worn by Andy Green when he attempts to exceed 1,000mph (1,609km/h) in the Bloodhound SSC next year.
It has been hand painted by the same artist who paints many F1 helmets, including Lewis Hamilton's.
The artwork by Sam was selected from thousands to form the basis for the final design.
Sam and his family met the driver and the team behind the record bid at the technical centre near Bristol where the car is being assembled.
He said it was "really interesting" to see how his design had been used to make an "amazing helmet".
He added: "I thought the colour orange was like fire, and it would be a good way to interpret it.
"They've even included my signature at the back."
