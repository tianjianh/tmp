[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four people were killed in the collision at about 20:15 BST on Friday on the B1102 Freckenham Road in Worlington, near Barton Mills.
A man, 77, and a woman, 75, from Ely, in Cambridgeshire, and two men aged 24 and 28, both from Mildenhall in Suffolk died at the scene.
Police have appealed for witnesses.
The man and woman from Ely were in a Hyundai i30, and the two men were in a BMW M3.
Suffolk Police said the vehicles appeared to be travelling in opposite directions when they smashed into each other causing the BMW to burst into flames.
People living nearby tried to put out the fire and save those inside, but the blaze was too fierce.
One woman said: "There was a horrendous noise and when we went outside the car was in the garden on fire... and it kept exploding.
"We tried to douse the flames, but there was nothing we could do."
Another witness said: "The BMW somersaulted and landed in the garden. We went out with a hosepipe to try to put the flames out."
It is believed the BMW was travelling in the direction of Worlington village when the collision occurred.
Friends and relatives have been laying floral tributes at the scene of the accident.
Police have appealed for witnesses who may have seen the collision or "the manner of driving of either of the two cars beforehand".
The road re-opened at 03:30 BST.
