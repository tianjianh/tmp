London Irish: Tom Coventry says side must end away drought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Irish head coach Tom Coventry says his side have to start winning away from home to lift themselves off the foot of the Premiership.

Irish are five points adrift at the bottom after Sunday's defeat by Exeter and wins for Worcester and Newcastle.
"We need to worry about the next game without worrying about Worcester and Newcastle," Coventry told BBC Sport.
The Exiles claimed a first bonus point of the season in their 22-15 home loss to the Chiefs.
"It's consolation as we haven't picked up any before this game (against Exeter)," Coventry added. "It's pleasing, but we've got to win away from home, simple as that, and we need to do that quickly."

Irish's next two games take them to fifth-placed Leicester and ninth-placed Bath before a "home" game against Saracens in New York.
Their visit to Welford Road on Sunday will mark a whole calendar year since their last away Premiership win at London Welsh.
"People talk about the other teams at the bottom all the time and that can't help us," Coventry said.
"We can only just help ourselves by doing what we need to do. It's been a pretty similar message from me all year."
