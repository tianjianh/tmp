Few details have been released about the TRNSMT Festival, which will run from 7-9 July at Glasgow Green.
However, those behind the festival have launched a website which reveals the date of the event.
Scotland's largest music festival, T in the Park, had previously announced it was to take a break this year.
Organisers DF Concerts had said it needed to "take stock" and the two years since the festival moved to Strathallan from Balado had seen "challenges".
The BBC is to broadcast highlights of the TRNSMT Festival across the weekend.
