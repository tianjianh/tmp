The bid would bring ultrafast broadband to the region, benefiting businesses in the technology and creative industries.
Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said if successful it will "provide the jobs and regeneration that is our priority for the county".
The bid must go before Chancellor George Osborne for approval.
In Carmarthenshire the city deal would also support a £100m Wellness and Life Science Village in Llanelli;  S4C's new home at Yr Egin in Carmarthen; and the Cross Hands East strategic employment site.
The bid has been analysed by Cardiff University and it is estimated the economic potential could see 33,000 jobs created over 20 years - worth £3.3bn in output.
