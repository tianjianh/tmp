[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Collins, 50, from Chatham, who admitted harassment, sent letters to Cox and told her he was psychologically disturbed and had a criminal past but wanted her to invite him to the BBC.
When police arrested him, they found he had a fake BBC visitor's pass, Cox's sister's work address, and indecent images of girls aged four to 15.
Collins, of Afghan Road, was jailed for 16 months at Maidstone Crown Court.
Sentencing, Judge Martin Joy told him: "You have an obsessive personality."
The court heard Collins bought Cox's address online and sent her letters written in felt-tip pen.
In one letter, he told her he was living unhappily in a bedsit and asked her, to invite him to the Radio 2 studios, saying she was "lovely, warm, kind and sexy".
He wrote: "I'm 49, tall with green eyes. I know you are married to Ben Cyzer and know he is a successful man. I'm unsuccessful in my life."
He also wrote to Cox's husband at his workplace - the letter included a picture of Cox holding a child, and a diagram with the words "Cancer Analysis" in capital letters.

Prosecutor Mary Jacobson said: "Needless to say that when Ms Cox found out her husband had received a letter she was immediately much more scared, as she put it, and the matter was reported to the police."
The court heard when Collins was arrested he said he "wanted to be in the news" and admitted his actions amounted to harassment.
Officers found the indecent images in Collins's bedside drawers and discovered more unposted letters as well as pictures and press cuttings.
Collins had pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images and making indecent images of children.
The court was told he had a criminal history that included an 18-month jail term for poisoning a 13-year-old girl in a bid to sedate her and have sex with her.
Collins had also broken a restraining order by speaking to two girls aged six and seven and making lewd comments.
In mitigation, defence counsel Ian Dear said Collins's actions towards Cox amounted to harassment but had not intended to cause alarm or distress, adding it was "a cry for help".
Collins was given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and a restraining order.
