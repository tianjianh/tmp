Henry Trinder: Gloucester centre sidelined following further knee surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester and England Saxons centre Henry Trinder has been ruled out of action 'for the foreseeable future' after undergoing knee surgery.

The 27-year-old injured the same right knee in February 2015, on his first start for five months after hamstring and shoulder problems.
Trinder played 14 games last season, scoring four tries.
But he suffered the latest injury towards the end of it and has now had to undergo another operation.
A club statement said: "The new injury is not as severe as the previous one, but surgical repair was deemed to be necessary.
"Henry underwent the procedure last week and will now embark upon an extended rehabilitation programme."
Swindon-born Trinder, who has played all his professional career at Kingsholm apart from one brief loan spell at Moseley, has scored 19 tries in 78 Premiership appearances for the Cherry and Whites.
His news comes in the wake of Gloucester signing another centre, Worcester's Andy Symons, who opted to move to Kingsholm rather than relegated London Irish, where he had agreed a deal.
