Northampton backs coach Alex King says reports he was being considered for a role in new England boss Eddie Jones' set-up were "unfounded".

The 40-year-old was linked with the position of attack and skills coach.
"I think Eddie has probably met all the coaches and directors of rugby in England to understand the English game," King told BBC Radio Northampton.
"Just because you have a conversation with Eddie Jones doesn't mean there's more to it."
In December, Saints boss Jim Mallinder said the club had been "kept in the dark" about any approach for former Wasps fly-half King, who said he "was always staying at Saints".
Former Australia and Japan boss Jones is expected to oversee England's attack for the Six Nations, with Ian Peel in charge of scrummaging, and Paul Gustard and Steve Borthwick completing the coaching line-up.
King said he was never in the frame for a role in Jones' backroom staff.
"Not at all," he said. "I think Eddie wants clarity on what he wants to bring and I think that's probably one of the reasons why he doesn't want another coach.
"He's going to run the attack and along with Paul Gustard, Steve Borthwick and Ian Peel, four coaches is enough at this stage. There is nothing more to it than that."
He added: "It's been a frustrating couple of weeks because of what's been written and I'm glad it's come out that Eddie will be running the attack with other coaches and I'm looking forward to seeing how England play and the squad that he picks."
