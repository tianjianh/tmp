The Canadian indie band is the first act announced for the festival, which was under threat of being cancelled.
The band were recommended to the event's organisers by music legend David Bowie. It will be their first UK festival performance since 2014.
The four-day festival at Seaclose Park, Newport will run from 8-11 June.
The band will be following previous Isle of Wight headliners that have included Queen and The Who.
John Giddings, Isle of Wight Festival promoter, said: "I'm so happy to have secured Arcade Fire as our first headliner. David Bowie recommended them and I've been a fan ever since. Last year was incredible and I'm ready for us to come back even better."
Made up of husband and wife Win Butler and RÃ©gine Chassagne along with Win's brother William Butler, Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara, the band will take to the stage on 10 June.
Arcade Fire's music reached number one in the UK charts after the release of their fourth album Reflektor three years ago.
The band also received an Academy award nomination after being featured in the film Her in 2013.
