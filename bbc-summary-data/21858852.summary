The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) has cancelled a Napalm Death concert over fears the high decibel levels could damage the "fabric of the building".

The grindcore band's gig was to feature three ceramic sound systems which could disintegrate due to the sound levels.
The London museum said it dropped the event after safety inspections.
The band was due to play on 22 March in the Europe Galleries - currently undergoing refurbishment.
Friday's concert, called Bustleholm, was a one-off experimental collaboration between the band and artist Keith Harrison, who is a resident ceramic artist at the V&A in South Kensington.
Mr Harrison created the ceramic sound systems based on the tiles used on buildings in the Bustleholm Mill estate in West Bromwich, where he grew up.
Before the concert was cancelled, Napalm Death's frontman, Mark "Barney" Greenway, said he was looking forward to it.
"Sound as a weapon - or a weapon of change - is a very interesting concept and I think that the whole process of our sound gradually degrading clay sculptures is captivating," he said.
A spokesperson from the V&A said the concert was cancelled "with regret".
"This was due to take place in the Europe Galleries which are currently being refurbished and a further safety inspection has revealed concerns that the high level of decibels generated by the performance would damage the historic fabric of the building."
"The safety of our visitors and building remains our priority at all times," they added.
