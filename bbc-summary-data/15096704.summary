The team beat the Island Sailing Club from Cowes in the annual cricket contest held on Bramble Bank.
David Mead, Vice Commodore of the Royal Southern Yacht Club, said more than 150 people watched the match, which lasted 30 minutes before the tide returned.
The teams take turns to win the match, which was first played in the 1950s.
Mr Mead said: "I've never seen such a big turn out in all my time at the Bramble Bank cricket match. It was unbelievable.
"A good time was had by all and the weather was beautiful."
