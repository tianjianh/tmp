Ethan Couch, 18, was on juvenile probation after killing four people in a drink-driving crash in 2013.
Last month, he and his mother fled Texas after he allegedly broke probation. They were arrested in the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta.
His mother Tonya Couch has already been sent back to the US.
Ethan Couch had appealed against his deportation, but dropped the legal challenge on Tuesday.
He arrived in Texas on Thursday morning.
Couch's 2013 court case became well-known after a psychologist at his trial argued that his privileged upbringing meant his parents had not taught him a sense of responsibility - a condition the expert called "affluenza".
The condition is not recognised as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association and was widely ridiculed.
Couch was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation centre.
In December, an arrest warrant was issued for Couch after he failed to report to his probation officer.
His disappearance came shortly after he had apparently been filmed at a party where people were consuming alcohol, police said.
He could go to prison for up to 10 years if found to have violated his probation by drinking.
His mother Tonya Couch faces charges of hindering an apprehension.
