"Seven people who were in the pool or the area, plus one maintenance worker were conveyed to hospital for precautionary checks," the fire spokesman said.
A David Lloyd Clubs spokesman said: "We have very strict health and safety policies in place to ensure the safety of our members and team, and will be launching a full investigation to understand how this incident happened."
