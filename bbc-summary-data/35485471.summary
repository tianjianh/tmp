Grand National 2016: Many Clouds among 126 Aintree entries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Last year's victor Many Clouds is among 126 entries for the 2016 Grand National at Aintree on 9 April.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 2014 winner Pineau De Re - which, like Many Clouds, was ridden to victory by Leighton Aspell - features in the largest list of entries since 2008.
Five of the top six horses from last year's race have been entered - but Monbeg Dude, who finished third, will not have recovered from injury in time.
A maximum field of 40 will be selected to start the Liverpool race.
