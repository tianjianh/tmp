The 12 goals scored at the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday surpassed Monaco's 8-3 win over Deportivo La Coruna in 2003.
There were seven goals in 22 first-half minutes, and Marco Reus scored twice on his return from six months out.
Polish champions Legia became the first side to score four goals in a Champions League match and lose.
Dortmund captain Marco Reus celebrated his return after six months out with goals in the 32nd and 52nd minutes, while his shot was deflected by Legia's Jakub Rzezniczak into his own net in the 92nd minute.
"I was just happy to be there from the start," said Reus, who missed the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 because of injury.
"It is how you imagine your perfect comeback. I waited a long time for this and so it is even sweeter. The ball will be signed by everyone and will go on the shelf."
