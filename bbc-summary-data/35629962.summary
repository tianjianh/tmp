Match Commander David McCallum said the majority of the crowd at the match in Dumfries had been well behaved.
However, he said there were a number of incidents of disorder during the game.
They included one incident, which remains under investigation, where visiting supporters refused requests to remove a banner.
Police said an 18-year-old man had been arrested in relation to public order offences committed while a banner was being removed from advertising hoardings by stewards and police in contravention of ground rules.
They stressed the content of the banner was not in question and number of other banners had been displayed in a manner which had not contravened ground rules.
