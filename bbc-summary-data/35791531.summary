Sullay Kaikai's 25-yard shot into the top corner put Shrewsbury ahead but Tom Soares' glancing header made it 1-1.
Kaikai restored the lead when he curled home from 16 yards after a fine run, and both Kyle Vassell and Andy Mangan then went close to adding a third.
But Peter Clarke bundled in the Bury equaliser from a corner before Chris Hussey had two chances to snatch a win.

Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:
"We've been beaten three times at home this season. I don't want to get beaten on the road or at home.
"It's a dig-out performance. In the second half, it should have been out of sight but it wasn't.
"I'm not relieved or happy with a point, because I wanted all three."
Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"In the first half we were excellent and we should have scored a few more goals to be out of sight but Bury have a great record here and can come back at you and I fully expected that.
"They battled hard and some of the set-plays from them were the best I've seen this season. Sometimes, the quality of those balls at the set plays are hard to defend against.
"You have to respect the point coming away to Bury. We have changed the shape of the team but we have been as good on the road as we have been for a long time and all in all I am happy."
