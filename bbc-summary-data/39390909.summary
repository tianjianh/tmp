[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 0-2 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth took another step towards automatic promotion from League Two with a victory at Hartlepool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kal Naismith and Gary Roberts grabbed the goals as Paul Cook's men ensured their advantage over fourth-placed Stevenage remains at six points with just six games remaining.
The contest began in end-to-end fashion before Naismith opened the scoring after 17 minutes. Enda Stevens found space on the byeline and picked out the forward, who powered home an unstoppable half-volley.
Hartlepool continued to match the promotion-chasers and almost levelled when Nathan Thomas rattled a post just after half-time.
Portsmouth were menacing every time they went forward, though, and should have added a second when Roberts sent a diving header over the crossbar from six yards.
The hosts were not so lucky moments later as Nicky Featherstone gifted the ball to Naismith who, having seen an initial effort blocked, crossed for Roberts to fire into the roof of the net.
That appeared to knock the wind out of Hartlepool's sails as Portsmouth saw the game out comfortably.
