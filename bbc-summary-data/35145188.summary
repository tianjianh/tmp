[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Church bells over a century old have been restored to their former glory after a five-year appeal.

St Mary's Parish Church, in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, raised Â£30,000 to carry out repairs to eight 105-year-old bells.
Work included refurbishing the frame and fitting and rehanging the bells.
Dave Bamford, from Taylor's Bell Foundry in Leicestershire, who helped restore and reinstall them, said help from local offenders on community service was "absolutely incredible".
The original bells, from 1732, were recast and added to the church in 1910.
Mr Bamford said the offenders carried out much of the heavy-lifting and the "lightest is over half a tonne".
"You've got to get the bells out of the mechanisms and get the mechanisms down all the steps to the bottom," he said.
"Without them [the offenders] we would probably still be working on it to this day."
Erewash Borough Council and the community donated money towards the restoration work.
Councillor Chris Corbett, leader of the authority, said: "This council values the history and heritage of our borough and is committed to protecting it - so keeping the church bells ringing, an age-old tradition in this country, is very important to us."
