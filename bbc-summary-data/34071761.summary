Cycle superhighway: A glimpse into London's future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Is this London's future?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been contentious and controversial, but part of the mayor's flagship east-west cycle superhighway is nearing completion.
These photos give you an impression of what some streets in London will look like when they have been converted to protect cyclists.
Of course, not everyone will like road space being given over to cyclists. Many drivers fear the works and the scheme will create congestion for vehicles.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) still has a judicial review pending on this scheme; I'm told the chances of that succeeding are very slim.
Cyclists will love this space and a cycle lane running straight up to Parliament will invigorate cycling campaigners who'll say "if it can be done here, it can be done anywhere".
The full scheme along Embankment is not yet complete but is due to open in summer 2016.
