Actor Sir Patrick Stewart has said it would be a "grave mistake" to close an A&E department in his birthplace.

In a tweet from Los Angeles, the Star Trek and X-Men actor added a link to a petition against the move involving Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.
The hospital could be demolished for a new facility in the town, a report revealed on 15 January.
Sir Patrick was born in Mirfield, near Huddersfield, and was chancellor of the town's university for 10 years.
Health bosses have said the way hospital services are currently run is not "sustainable".
It means people in Huddersfield could have to travel to Halifax, Wakefield or Barnsley for emergency treatment.
The recommendation is part of a wider shake-up of NHS services in the area, which include replacing the Huddersfield infirmary with a new hospital at Acre Mill, although it would not have an A&E department.
The Calderdale and Greater Huddersfield clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are to put the plans out to consultation.
The petition against the closure move currently has more than 43,000 backers.
Huddersfield Town players are to wear T-shirts publicising the campaign during the warm-up before their Championship match against Cardiff City.
Dean Hoyle, the club's chairman, said: "I believe this is a decision that needs to be looked at very closely by those in charge."
