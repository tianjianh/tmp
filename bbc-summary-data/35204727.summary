The second leg of the 1872 Cup between Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh will be staged at Murrayfield after the pitch at Scotstoun was deemed unplayable, BBC Scotland has learned.

Heavy rainfall in Glasgow recently has left the playing surface waterlogged.
Murrayfield played host to the first leg on Sunday, with Edinburgh emerging as 23-11 winners.
The news will come as a boost to Edinburgh, who have not won away to Glasgow in 12 years.
Glasgow Warriors managing director Nathan Bombrys told the club's website: "We're disappointed that the game cannot go ahead at Scotstoun as originally planned and all efforts were made to get the game on.
"However, after unprecedented rainfall over the last couple of days we wanted to make an early decision to help our supporters make appropriate plans and ensure the game went ahead this weekend.
"We investigated a number of options, however BT Murrayfield was the only stadium which allowed us to play the game on the same day and time, with a large enough capacity.
"It's not an ideal situation going back to Edinburgh, but we need to get the game played and we'll do everything we can to make this a Glasgow home game.
"We're working on a travel plan and we will communicate directly with all our supporters who have bought a ticket for this match.
"We would encourage supporters to make the trip to Edinburgh and get behind the team, for what is an extremely important fixture."
All tickets purchased for the match at Scotstoun will be valid for the game at Murrayfield.
