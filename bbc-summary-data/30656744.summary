[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An oil leak in a Neath Port Talbot river could harm wildlife in the area, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NRW is investigating suspected oil pollution in the Neath Canal, Resolven.
It is thought to have been caused by a leak from a domestic heating oil tank in the area and nearby residents are being asked to check their tanks and pipes for damage.
Environment officer Owen Caughlin said the leak could also cause the water quality to suffer.
