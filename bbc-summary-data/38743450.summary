[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The premises in Lower Dunbar Street was broken into some time between 16:00 on Sunday and 12:15 on Tuesday.
Nick Clasper, area inspector with Police Scotland, said any theft was "deplorable" but this incident was "particularly disappointing".
He said the food bank was run by "selfless volunteers" and provided support to people in the local area.
