The magic lantern slides were photographed by William Nowell and found during a recent loft clearance.
Auctioneer Graham Paddison said: "It is the extraordinary contrast in this set of 30 photographs that is so unusual."
Mr Paddison, of auctioneers Dee Atkinson & Harrison, said the pictures showed the gulf between rich and poor in late Victorian England.

Mr Nowell was the manager of the Great Northern Steamship Fishing Company and a keen photographer.  He shot the images between 1895 and 1902.
They were found in a house in Hessle, East Yorkshire, belonging to Mr Nowell's great-grandson.
The auction is to be held in Driffield on 30 September.
