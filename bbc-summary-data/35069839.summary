A decision by Becky Watts' killers to appeal against their jail terms has been attacked by the murdered teenager's family.

Nathan Matthews, 28, and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, are intending to challenge their sentences for murder and manslaughter respectively.
Becky, 16, was killed during a sexually-motivated kidnapping, before her body was dismembered.
Her aunt said news of the appeals was a like "punch in the gut" for the family.
"Only this week reality was slowly returning, obviously with a massive void, but we were trying to rebuild our lives," said Sarah Broom.
"And to hear this news is a punch in the gut. It is the not knowing if they'll succeed which is the hard bit.
"The thought of having to do another trial is incomprehensible. We just hope the justice system doesn't fail Becky at the last hurdle."
Matthews was last month given a life sentence and told he would serve at least 33 years. Hoare was jailed for 17 years.
The lengthy trial at Bristol Crown Court heard how Matthews suffocated the teenager at her home in the St George area of Bristol on 19 February while trying to kidnap her.
Becky's body was dismembered and hidden in a shed while a huge manhunt in Bristol attempted to track down the 16-year-old.
Hoare was convicted of manslaughter because she had participated in a kidnap where any "sober and reasonable person" would have known some harm would come to Becky, the court heard.
