Nurse practitioner, Elaine Lowery, 50, from Whitehaven, cared for a woman suffering from paranoia but instead stole £6,242 to spend on holidays.
In October 2015, Lowery helped withdraw £16,000 from the woman's account for her new home and funeral plan.
At Carlisle Crown Court, Lowery, of Gable Road, admitted two theft charges and was jailed for a year.
Lowery did not have the means to make any repayment and the rest of the money was spent legitimately, the court heard.
Recorder Abigail Hudson said: "It is a tragedy in the circumstances that the victim is unlikely to ever see that money again."
