Burton Albion have gone back to the top of League One with victory at Peterborough United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brewers took the lead when Tom Naylor converted Mark Duffy's pass from three yards in the third minute, while John Mousinho twice went close.
There was a long delay at the end of the first half when Posh defender Harry Toffolo was carried off.
Posh rallied after the break and Chris Forrester's flicked header went just wide and Michael Smith also shot wide.
Burton, who surprisingly lost at home to Shrewsbury at the weekend, now have a three-point lead over second-placed Gillingham.
The visitors dominated the first half and after Naylor scored his third goal of the season, Duffy and Mousinho saw shots miss the target.
At the other end, Marcus Maddison's turn and shot was well saved by Jon McLaughlin.
As the half came to a close, Burton came close to a second as Mousinho's header was superbly saved by Posh keeper Ben Alnwick.
Peterborough, who drop to eighth, created better chances in the second half but Nigel Clough's side never looked in any real danger.
