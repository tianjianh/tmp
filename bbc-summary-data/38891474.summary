The plants were found during "routine checks" by park staff on Monday.
It is thought the building - outside of the park resort but on the theme park's land - was accessed from nearby land owned by the Queen.
A 40-year-old man from Windsor and a 34-year-old man from Burnham have been arrested on suspicion of producing cannabis.
Thames Valley Police are currently on-site investigating the discovery of the plants and equipment.
A Legoland spokesperson said the building "appears to have been accessed via the Crown Estate".
The arrested men have been bailed until 28 February.
