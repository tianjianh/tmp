[SN]TITLE[SN]
Great-grandmother Joan Porter to become a first-time author

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A great-grandmother who has Alzheimer's is to become a first-time author.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joan Porter, 85, lives in sheltered accommodation in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire.
But 40 years ago, she wrote down the stories she used to tell her children when they were small.
Now the same stories are to be published for the first time - and can sit on the book shelves of her seven great-grandchildren.
The series is being published after her daughter Arlene Harrison found the stories in one of her mother's cupboards.
She agreed with the rest of her family to send them off to a publisher and see what happened.
Arlene said: "We grew up in Kilberry - surrounded by countryside.  Mum used to make up stories for us, and then she started telling the stories to the children in her playgroup and started to write them down. Everyone always encouraged her to get them published, but she wouldn't.
"She said she was too busy and didn't think anyone would be interested.  She was always too busy running about caring for the family to ever fulfil her own ambition."
But now, Joan has - the first two books in the series are to be released in October.
"When I first told her we had sent her books off, she kept asking me not to make a big fuss of it and said that no-one would be interested in her ramblings.
"She still can't believe that her writings are being made into children's books. It's got her talking about writing more. It's a lovely legacy to leave.
"She really is wonderful - she never lets her dementia stop her doing anything. She is proof that being a pensioner and having dementia shouldn't get in the way of fulfilling your dreams."
