[SN]TITLE[SN]
Councils challenge Welsh language rules more than 270 times

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councils have made more than 270 challenges against standards imposed by the Welsh Language Commissioner, figures obtained by BBC Wales have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neath Port Talbot council challenged the most - 54 since they were made in September 2015, saying some were "unreasonable" and "disproportionate".
The assembly passed the rules, written by civil servants, two years ago.
The Welsh Government challenged some of its own standards in March.
The 176 standards imposed on the Welsh Government, councils and national parks in Wales aim to make it easier for Welsh speakers to know which services they can receive in the language.
Merthyr Tydfil council's figures, obtained by BBC Radio Cymru, were the second highest with 40 challenges followed by Torfaen at 32.
Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd and the Vale of Glamorgan councils did not challenge any of the rules.
The Welsh Language Commissioner's office said it would be inappropriate to comment.
