[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Canaries, who surrendered a 3-1 lead to lose at Newcastle on Wednesday, went ahead at Molineux when Cameron Jerome headed past Carl Ikeme.
Robbie Brady doubled the advantage with a fine curling effort, moments after Nouha Dicko spurned a great chance in his first senior match for 13 months.
Dave Edwards headed a late consolation for Wolves, who remain in 12th.

Following eye-catching wins over Newcastle and Brentford, Walter Zenga's side have now lost successive matches for the first time this season - and they will rue several missed opportunities when the score was 1-0 against Norwich.
Dicko, only just on as a substitute for his first appearance since suffering a cruciate ligament injury in August 2015, was most guilty, miscontrolling when well placed and then allowing Michael McGovern to make a smart save.
Conor Coady also failed to hit the target from inside the area, shooting over the crossbar as the home team pressed for an equaliser.
But Brady's superbly-taken goal from 25 yards proved decisive, giving Norwich their seventh league win of the season and their fifth in six matches.
