Rebecca Gibney has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is blind.  She lives in the Short Strand area in the east of the city.
Last year Rebecca was given just six months to live but has defied the odds.
Her mum Tracy says Rebecca has been listening to Adele for years will smile and try to sing along.
If anyone turns it off, Rebecca goes into a mood, she said.
Tracy set up a social media campaign to try to get the star to visit.
The singer's manager called her on Tuesday afternoon to say they would be at the house in a hour.
"It's amazing. I'll never forget it. And I do know that when Rebecca passes away she did get her dream come true," Tracy said.
"It's made me feel like I'm the best mummy in the world which I never felt. Adele told me I was the best mummy in the world too."
Adele also invited Tracy and her other daughter to Tuesday's concert as her guests.
