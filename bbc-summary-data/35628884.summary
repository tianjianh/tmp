[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bill Irwin: Former DUP councillor admits 23 fraud charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former DUP councillor has admitted more than 20 fraud charges at Londonderry Magistrates Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bill Irwin, who is 55-years-old, from Duncastle Road in Newbuildings, faces a total of 23 charges which date from March 2009 until February 2014.
He is accused of making a false claim to the Northern Ireland Assembly for payment towards heating oil expenditure.
The total amount involved was Â£8,960.
The court was told he had heating oil delivered to his home and was invoicing it through the DUP constituency office at Ebrington Terrace in Londonderry.
A prosecution lawyer said it was therefore being paid out of the public purse through the Northern Ireland assembly.
Irwin's defence barrister said his client was instructed to enter a plea of guilty in relation to all the charges.
During the period of the offences, Irwin was a constituency office worker in the DUP's main Waterside office.
He had previously represented the party on Derry City Council from 1993 until 1997.
The defendant will be sentenced for the offences on 1 April following the preparation of a pre-sentence report.
