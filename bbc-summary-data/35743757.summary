Appeal over almost featherless parrot found in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish SPCA is seeking the owners of an almost featherless parrot found in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The male Senegal parrot, which the charity has named Apollo, was rescued in the Torry area on Wednesday.
He has plucked out all of his feathers except for those on his head and wings, and has bruising to his chest area.
The bird is now in the care of the Scottish SPCA's animal rescue and re-homing centre in Drumoak.
Animal care assistant Kyle McWhirr said: "Apollo has plucked out all his feathers other than the ones on his head and wings.
"He also has some bruising on his chest and our vet believes he must have flown into something.
"A lot of birds pluck their feathers due to boredom or stress."
He added: "Senegal parrots aren't known for speaking much but Apollo is starting to make noises such as squeaks and whistles.
"It's not uncommon for pet birds to escape through an open door or window so we think there may be someone looking for Apollo.
"If no one comes forward we'll find him a loving new home."
Anyone who recognises Apollo has been asked to contact the Scottish SPCA.
