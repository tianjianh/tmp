The 30-year-old is a free agent after being released by Crystal Palace and is open to the possibility of playing abroad.
Ledley, capped 73 times, has been linked with moves to two former clubs, Championship side Cardiff City and Scottish champions Celtic.
Cardiff boss Neil Warnock has played down the possibility of Ledley moving back to his home city club.
