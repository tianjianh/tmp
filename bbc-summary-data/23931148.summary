They join BBC presenters Susanna Reid and Vanessa Feltz, Countdown's Rachel Riley and golfer Tony Jacklin, who had already been announced.
Others taking part include singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Hollyoaks actor Ashley Taylor Dawson, actress Fiona Fullerton and rugby star Ben Cohen.
The series returns on 7 September.
The 15-strong line-up is completed by Hairy Biker Dave Myers, former Casualty actor Patrick Robinson, Waterloo Road star Mark Benton and former Coronation Street actress Natalie Gumede.
The first episode will pair up the celebrities with their professional dancing partners, with the live shows beginning after a few weeks' rehearsal.
Five new professional dancers have joined for the 11th series: Anya Garnis, Iveta Lukosiute, Janette Manrara, Kevin Clifton and Aljaz Skorjanec.
Reid told BBC Breakfast she was "really excited" about taking part in the show but was worried about the competition from the other celebrities.
"When I saw them in rehearsals they already looked like pros," she said.
She added she was already feeling the strain of training and was "aching in places I've never ached before".
Designer Macdonald said he was looking forward to the wearing the costumes.
"I like the fact I can have the sparkles and the crystals, and the glamour that I've spent my life putting on other people," he said.
"I'm loving the rhinestones and lace, and the crystals. I just want more and more. I'll probably look like a Christmas tree by the end of it!"
Riley admitted the only dancing experience she had was an hour's lesson before her wedding.
"As my friends know, I'm really clumsy and I have never been graceful in my life so maybe now is the time to start."
Hairy Biker Myers admitted his ambition on the series was to be able to get far enough to dance in the live show from Blackpool.
"I can remember going to Blackpool Tower Ballroom with my mum and dad when I was a child and have such great memories so it would be fantastic to go back there," he said.
This year as well as voting for their favourites by phone, viewers will be able to vote online for free via the Strictly website.
Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly will return to host the series on BBC One on Saturday at 18:50 BST.
