Organisers say the nine-month show at London's O2 Arena will be Europe's largest ever retrospective of the singer, featuring more than 300 items.
It will display "as much of Graceland as will fit into the O2", they said.
The exhibition will include a virtual tour of the Memphis mansion where Presley died in his bathroom in 1977.
The pool table that he played on with The Beatles in 1965 and stage costumes including the black leather suit from his 1968 Comeback Special are also being brought from the museum in his old home.
"While each and every item contains a lifetime of memories, we are more than happy to allow these treasured memories to leave Graceland," said Priscilla Presley, who was married to the singer for six years.
"Elvis meant so much to me and our daughter Lisa [Marie Presley], but we both know that our family truly shares him with the world," she continued.
Pieces leaving Memphis for the first time include the singer's wallet containing photos of his daughter, his front door keys and a TCB ring, which stands for taking care of business.
Some items, such as the American Eagle jumpsuit and Cadillac, will only go on show for a limited period during the exhibition's nine-month run.
Exhibition co-ordinator Nic Wastell said: "For people who can't get to Graceland, Graceland is coming to them."
Elvis At The O2: The Exhibition Of His Life will open on 12 December and run until 31 August.
