The deal with the Welsh government will see the removal of some "unnecessary" bureaucracy, and is part of a plan to reform primary care services.
Changes over the next two years could see a requirement for surgeries to offer more GP appointments and repeat prescription services online.
A GPs' committee said it would offer practices greater financial stability.
The Welsh government said the new arrangements for 2015-16 and 2016-17 would strengthen the primary care cluster arrangements in Wales.
Dr Charlotte Jones, chair of the General Practitioners Committee Wales, said: "The practice will be able to share the services that they provide.
"They will be able to support each other if certain practices are having difficulties, which we know is happening across Wales."
She said there would be more collaboration with community nurses and pharmacists to help deliver more care in the community.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "The two-year agreement reached with GPC Wales directly addresses GPs' concerns about unnecessary bureaucracy.
"This places more trust and reliance on the professionalism of GPs to use their clinical judgement and will allow GPs to spend more time caring for the most vulnerable people with complex care needs, in particular, the frail and elderly.
