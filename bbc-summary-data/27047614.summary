BBC Sport App for Connected TV
Connected TV uses your broadband internet connection to bring online content directly on to your television. In addition to our sport coverage on network TV, the BBC Sport Connected TV App offers extra live streams from major sporting events the BBC covers.
The BBC Sport App for Connected TV also offers live coverage of popular sports throughout the sporting calendar including live football, rugby union matches, athletics events including the Diamond League, tennis and snooker. The Sport App also provides a platform for showcasing sports that are not usually covered on network TV such as equestrian and triathlon.
Along with coverage of live events, the BBC Sport App for Connected TV also offers the latest video highlights and headlines for each major event, our most popular sports and for each of the UK nations.
2016 is a huge year for British Sport with a number of major sporting events including the UEFA 2016 European Championship, starting on the 10th June and the 2016 Rio Olympics beginning on the 5th August. These events, plus Wimbledon will have dedicated homescreens where users can access:
•LIVE STREAMS -- Follow the action with the BBC's exclusive live coverage
•HIGHLIGHTS AND CLIPS - Video highlights of the key moments from each event
•LATEST HEADLINES - Full screen sports analysis and news direct from the BBC Sport website
