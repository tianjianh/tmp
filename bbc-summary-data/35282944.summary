The 22-year-old, who won team sprint bronze with Becky James at the 2013 World Championships, collided with Elis Ligtlee during an omnium race.
She already had surgery on Sunday.
"Plan to operate tomorrow on hip joint and lower spine. If successful fly home Friday. More lucid but still hurts a lot," tweeted her father Mark.
Racing was cancelled after the crash, with fans asked to leave the velodrome.
On Sunday, British Cycling released a statement saying she was "in a stable condition after receiving fractures to her pelvis and several vertebrae".
