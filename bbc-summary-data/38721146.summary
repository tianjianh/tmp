As with the first game, which ended 2-2, the Danes had the better of the first half, but Scotland were the stronger side in the second.
Frankie Brown deflected in an own goal from an early Denmark corner.
Following a good spell of Scotland pressure, the influential Little converted from the spot in the 76th minute after a handball.
Head coach Anna Signeul made six changes to Friday's starting XI.
Shannon Lynn replaced Gemma Fay in goal, with the Scotland captain due to have an MRI scan in Edinburgh on Wednesday after injuring her left ankle in the first game.
Starts were also given to Rachel Corsie, Jo Love, Lisa Evans, Lizzie Arnot and Erin Cuthbert, while Denmark made five changes.
The game had barely started before Scotland were behind. A corner from the right was deflected past Lynn by right-back Brown. It was a dreadful goal to lose and it set the tone for the first half.
They very nearly scored from an identical corner 16 minutes later when captain Pernille Harder, who plays for Wolfsburg, was unmarked to send in a powerful header. Lynn made an excellent save low to her right, though Cypriot referee Trattou Leontious had spotted an infringement.
Scotland were struggling to get any purchase in the game and when they did get possession the well-organised Danes were happy to let them pass the ball about in non-threatening positions.
Denmark continued to press and Lynn's work was largely confined to cutting out crosses, which she did with increasing confidence.
Signeul introduced Jenny Beattie, Leanne Crichton and Christie Murray for Brown, Arnot and Cuthbert after the interval. As in Larnaca, the substitutes had a galvanising effect.
Lynn had to make an early save from Sanne Troelsgaard, but after that most of the attacking threat came from the Scots, and particularly down the left through full-back Emma Mitchell and Lisa Evans.
The best chances fell in quick succession midway through the half. A Little shot was blocked and from the rebound Murray forced Line Johansen to make a low stop on her line. Then Little shot wide.
The equaliser arrived from a handball as Danish defender Janni Jensen attempted to block Murray's shot from just inside the box. Little stepped up to score her 47th international goal - and her first since rejoining Arsenal from Seattle Reign at the end of last year.
With Denmark being ranked six places higher, and having won seven of their eight games prior to coming to Cyprus, the two draws were a decent return for Scotland and Signeul, who will join Finland after Euro 2017.
Scotland midfielder Kim Little: "It's hard because it's January and we're just getting back into things. A lot of things can be better, but these were two reasonable performances.
"A definite positive is that we finished the games very strongly. Without a doubt we're fitter now than we ever have been in January.
"It has been worthwhile. The starting teams were different in the two games and it allows us to look at different combinations and work with different players to see what works best.
"I can't remember the last time I took a penalty - but I was happy to put that one away."
