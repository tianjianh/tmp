Mile End father and baby killed in French holiday crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father and his nine-month-old son from east London died in a road crash during a family holiday in Brittany, France, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baby Max Naman died at the scene of the crash in Finistere on 7 June. His father, Lawrence Naman, 37, of Mile End, died the next day in hospital.
Opening inquests into the deaths coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said Mr Naman's wife remained in hospital.
The hearing, in Chelmsford, was adjourned to a date to be confirmed.
The court heard how Mr Naman had been driving the car with his wife - who was not named in the hearing - by his side and baby Max was in the back when their vehicle collided with a lorry.
Mr Naman was taken to Brest Hospital where he later died. A post mortem examination found he died of skull trauma.
Mrs Beasley-Murray said the deaths were a "tragic loss" and were currently subject to a criminal investigation in France.
It is understood the inquest will resume once the police investigation has been completed.
