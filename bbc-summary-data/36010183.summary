Simon Middleton's side beat Canada 26-14 in the bronze final after losing to New Zealand in the last four.
In the Hong Kong Sevens, England's men's team beat the United States 19-0 to lift the second-tier Plate trophy.
England were knocked out at the Cup quarter-final stage after a 14-5 defeat by Australia, but it was Fiji who went on to win the main competition.
"It is tough sometimes when you get knocked out in the quarters to turn it around, but we've put in some good performances since then," said England captain Tom Mitchell.
Wales exited the Cup to runners-up New Zealand in the quarter-finals, while Scotland were beaten 26-0 by Argentina in the third-tier Bowl final.
Tries from Emily Scott, Amy Wilson-Hardy, Kay Wilson and captain Emily Scarratt gave England women the victory they needed for third place.
"It was a great squad effort with a lot of emphasis on that last game with Canada likely to be in our Olympic pool," said head coach Middleton.
England, Wales and Scotland compete separately in the Sevens World Series but will form one team at Rio 2016, where sevens makes its Olympic debut.
