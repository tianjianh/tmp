The 22-year-old Olympic champion, who had lowered the World Championship mark in qualifying, clocked 57.47 seconds - 0.34secs outside his own world record.
Peaty told BBC Sport: "You aim for world records, but they are world records for a reason."
Fellow Briton Ben Proud, 22, took the 50m butterfly title, clocking 22.75.
Peaty, who now holds the top 10 times in the world for the 100m breaststroke, finished more than a second ahead of his nearest rival.
That was American Kevin Cordes (58.79), with Russia's Kirill Prigoda (59.05) third. Peaty's fellow Briton Ross Murdoch was eighth.
"I felt like a little boy again going out to the crowd," said Peaty.
"I was a bit long into the wall, but I'm very happy with that. I'm more than happy to come here and attack my title."
Peaty is attempting to become the first swimmer to break the 57-second mark in the event, a challenge he refers to as 'Project 56'.
The Briton, who in 2015 became the first man to complete the world 50m and 100m breaststroke double, will begin the defence of his 50m title on Tuesday.

Any swimmer will tell you every time you get out you can go faster.
The start has been his weakest part of the race but after that he goes past people and just keeps going and going.

Proud, the 2014 Commonwealth champion, qualified fourth fastest from the 50m butterfly semi-finals.
But he took the sprint event by 0.04 seconds from Brazil's Nicholas Santos, with Andrii Govorov of Ukraine in third.
"I am on the verge of tears," said London-born Proud, who moved back to the UK from Malaysia at the age of 11. "It has been a dream since I was six years old.
"The pieces of the puzzle have come together. I was panicking before as I couldn't get my clothes off, but once I put my foot on the block, it was just about me and my race."
Siobhan-Marie O'Connor made an impressive start to the 200m individual medley final, but eventually took seventh as home favourite Katinka Hosszu won a sixth world title.
"It's going to teach me a lot. It was a test of character," said O'Connor.
"I knew I wasn't in the shape I wanted to be, but I've made the team and you don't get this opportunity very often."
Duncan Scott and James Guy both won their 200m freestyle semi-finals to progress.
"The plan was to be relaxed but go in hard. It felt great," said Guy.
Sarah Vasey set the eighth-best time in the 100m breaststroke heats to qualify for Tuesday's final.
"I am absolutely over the moon," said the 20-year-old. "I'm chuffed to make the final. I've got nothing to lose, I might as well just go for it."
In the 100m backstroke semi-finals, Kathleen Dawson qualified in eighth but Georgia Davies narrowly missed out.
