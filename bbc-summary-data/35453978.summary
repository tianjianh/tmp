Search on for new Scots Makar as Liz Lochhead ends term

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The search is on for a new Scots Makar - Scotland's national poet - as Liz Lochhead ends her five-year term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
During her tenure, Ms Lochhead carried out more than 300 engagements including workshops in schools and prisons.
She has written poems on subjects ranging from whisky and theatre to the opening of the Scottish Parliament.
Last year she was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. Her replacement is expected to be announced in the spring.
Thanking her for her work, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Liz Lochhead has brought poetry to every level of society in Scotland without fear or favour.
"She has brought vitality, warmth, wit and tremendous talent to the role of makar."
She added: "In her time as Scotland's national poet, Liz has worked astoundingly hard. She has a real conviction that poetry enriches and transforms lives which she bring to everyone she meets.
"Liz's work over the past five years has made a lasting and positive impact on many people, in particular the young students she has worked with, and she has played an ambassadorial role for Scotland.
"It's fitting that last year she was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, chosen by her fellow poets.
"Work is continuing to find Liz's replacement. We have much to thank her for."
The Scots Makar position was established in 2004 by the Scottish Parliament with Edwin Morgan the first poet to receive the honour.
