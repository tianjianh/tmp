A large fire at the derelict North Wales Hospital site in Denbighshire has been put out after five hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Firefighters were called to the Grade II-listed building outside Denbigh at 16:28 GMT on Monday.
Four appliances and an aerial ladder platform were used to tackle the blaze and crews will remain there for some time, damping down.
The building's roof collapsed in September, prompting police to label the site "dangerous".
The former psychiatric hospital has been at the centre of a long-running dispute over its future.
It was also the target of arson attacks in 2016.
