Scotland call up uncapped Cornell du Preez for Argentina Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uncapped Edinburgh back row forward Cornell du Preez has been called into the Scotland squad for Saturday's Test against Argentina at Murrayfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Africa-born Du Preez, 25, became eligible to represent Scotland last month after completing three years of residency in the country.
Edinburgh team-mate John Hardie is a doubt after suffering concussion during the defeat by Australia at the weekend.
Lock Richie Gray will be monitored after he too suffered a head knock.
Glasgow number eight Ryan Wilson was forced off with a laceration to the ankle in the early stages of the 23-22 defeat at Murrayfield but is expected to be in contention to face the Pumas.
Hardie's hopes of recovering in time for the second of Scotland's autumn Tests are further diminished by knee and ankle sprains he picked up before being substituted in the 61st minute against the Wallabies.
