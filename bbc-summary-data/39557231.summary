Wigan interim boss Graham Barrow says he has "never stopped believing" they can avoid Championship relegation.

Barrow, who took charge following Warren Joyce's departure on 13 March, oversaw a 3-2 victory against Rotherham on Saturday to pick up his first win.
Despite the result, Wigan are 23rd in the table, seven points from safety.
"The way things have gone, I was just looking to win a game - the hand I've been dealt hasn't been easy," Barrow, 62, told BBC Radio Manchester.
The Latics were four points from safety with nine games remaining when Barrow, in his third stint as caretaker manager, took over from ex-Manchester United Under-21 boss Joyce.
He began with three successive losses to Newcastle, Aston Villa and Ipswich, but despite their perilous situation the former Wigan player is staying positive.
"I've never stopped believing," Barrow said. "I've tried to motivate the players - the two performances against Newcastle and Villa in particular showed that.
"They're an honest bunch of lads and there's ability there, [but] the best of their ability, the star quality, hasn't been there all season."
Wigan will look to reduce the gap to safety when they play Barnsley at home on Thursday, 13 April before travelling to leaders Brighton, four days later, on Bank Holiday Monday.
