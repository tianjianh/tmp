Rangers 'fraud' case: Six men appear in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six men have appeared in court in connection with the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers assets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club's former owner Craig Whyte and former chief executive Charles Green attended a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Former club secretary Gary Withey, and David Grier, David Whitehouse and Paul Clark, who worked for administrators Duff and Phelps, also appeared.
The 15 charges in the case cover fraud, conspiracy and serious organised crime.
Mr Whyte bought Rangers from Sir David Murray in 2011 for a nominal sum of Â£1 but the club went into administration the following year.
A consortium led by Charles Green later bought Rangers' assets after a deal could not be agreed with creditors to exit administration.
Mr Whitehouse, Mr Clark and Mr Grier were employees of MCR Partners, prior to its acquisition by Duff and Phelps, in October 2011.
Duff and Phelps acted as Rangers administrators from 14 February 2012.
Mr Withey worked for Mr Whyte's London law firm, Collyer Bristow, before he took on a post with Rangers.
