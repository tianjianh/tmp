[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 2-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Gregory's double eased Millwall to victory over Swindon at The Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker took his tally to the season to nine with a goal in each half as the Robins went a fourth game without a win.
Gregory looked dangerous from the off and it took him just 10 minutes to open the scoring, bamboozling Swindon defenders before firing home from a tough angle.
That woke Swindon up but Sean Murray's shot fell easily into Jordan Archer's arms, before Michael Doughty blazed over the home side's bar.
At the other end Gregory fizzed a shot just over before Shaun Hutchinson's goal-bound header from a corner was hooked clear by Robins defender Raphael Rossi Branco after half an hour.
The Lions continued to press but could not add a second before half-time, and should have been made to pay on the hour only for Swindon's Luke Norris to flash an effort wide with just Archer to beat.
And Gregory showed Norris how it was done five minutes later, volleying home Steve Morison's chip from close range.
The closest Swindon came to a goal was with two minutes remaining when Branco headed a Darnell Furlong cross over the bar.
