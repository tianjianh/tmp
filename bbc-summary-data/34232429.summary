About 50,000 music fans are attending the annual festival at Robin Hill Country Park, with a theme of "Summer of Love".
Headliners at this year's event include Duran Duran, The Chemical Brothers and Missy Elliott.
The festival is also marking the 20th anniversary of organiser Rob da Bank's Sunday Best club, from which Bestival eventually developed.
Pop legends Duran Duran topped Friday's billing in front of a sell-out crowd on the day their 14th studio album, Paper Gods, was released.
Known for its eccentric events, attractions at this year's Bestival include a fake wedding ceremony hosted in an inflatable chapel, which couples pay Â£45 to take part in.
Simeon, the church's appointed choirboy, said: "There comes a time in your life when you feel you need to share your love in a giant rubber church.
"We dress people up in whatever they want to wear, get the congregation in, get the DJ playing and everyone goes nuts."
