The 28-year-old Englishman,  who tied for 37th at last week's US Open, opened at Gut Laerchenhof with a two-over-par 74 that contained two double bogeys.
Three birdies in a second-round 70 left him level par, a shot outside the cut.
Kiradech Aphibarnrat shot seven birdies and an eagle in an eight-under-par second-round 64 to share the lead with Raphael Jacquelin and Henrik Stenson.
