Constable Daniel Woodall, 35, and another officer were shot while serving an arrest warrant at a home in Edmonton, Alberta, earlier this month.
Mr Woodall had been working for Edmonton Police for eight years.
His funeral in the city featured a procession of hundreds of officers who marched to the sound of bagpipes.
Mr Woodall's coffin was draped in the Canadian flag and carried as the cortege moved across the city.
Four locations around Edmonton were set up for the public to watch a live video stream of the ceremony.
Howard Burns, president of the Calgary Police Association, said officers' "hearts go out" to Mr Woodall's family.
He told the Calgary Sun newspaper: "I know this is a terrible tragedy. Their lives will never be the same, but hopefully all of the support they've been shown will make this just a little easier for them.
"Often the police can become the public punching bag.
"But I can tell you, when something like this happens and the public rallies around our people, you have to take a step back and say, 'Wow, this is why I do my job.'"
Mr Woodall worked for Edmonton Police's hate crimes unit after being recruited from Greater Manchester Police.
The arrest warrant he was serving was for criminal harassment.
Another officer, Sgt Jason Harley, 38, was shot at the same time.
He was saved by his bulletproof vest.
The CBC reported that the last member of Edmonton Police to be killed on duty before Mr Woodall was in 1990.
