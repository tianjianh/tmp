[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All employees at a Rolls-Royce base which makes reactors for nuclear submarines were evacuated earlier after steam set off a fire alarm.

Rolls-Royce said the evacuation at 17:00 BST at its Marine Power base in Raynesway, Derby, was a "false alarm".
It was thought to have been more serious when Derbyshire Police tweeted there had been a "chemical spill".
But the firm said emergency services were called as a precautionary measure only and no-one was injured.
A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said all employees were evacuated after "a steam release in a conventional manufacturing process" triggered the automatic alarm.
