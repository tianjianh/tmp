The tour, which started in Wales, is due to enter Dumfries and Galloway on Tuesday and head for Kelso.
On the following day, it will start at Holyrood Park before heading out to East Lothian and the Borders.
VisitScotland hopes the high-profile event will encourage more people to discover Scotland's cycle routes.
It estimated road cycling and mountain biking trips by domestic visitors over the last three years had contributed on average Â£114m to the Scottish economy.
Latest statistics suggested there were 284,000 road cycling and 191,000 mountain biking trips across the country.  It is also estimated that visitors stayed more than two million nights and spent Â£123m.
The Tour of Britain last came to Scotland in 2013 when 21,000 spectators lined the Peebles to Drumlanrig Castle stage.
VisitScotland said a survey conducted after the event found 70% of spectators were "inspired to cycle more regularly" as a result of their attendance.
VisitScotland chairman Mike Cantlay said: "The Aviva Tour of Britain is a high profile, prestigious event and I hope the accompanying footage will inspire even more visitors to get on their bike saddles and explore the breathtaking landscapes of Scotland either by road, mountain, path or trail.
"With continued popularity in cycling tourism there is a huge opportunity for the Scottish and local economies.
"From cycling tours around the incredible Highlands to mountain biking in the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway, hotels, restaurants and accommodation providers are amongst those businesses which can capitalise from this year-long leisure pursuit."
The first stage of this year's Tour of Britain was won by Elia Viviani, who edged out Mark Cavendish at the line in Wrexham.
The race features other top names in the sport, including Sir Bradley Wiggins.
