[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron drew their opening two games but they were well beaten by the Silkmen, who took the lead in the 10th minute and never looked back.
Former Stockport striker Danny Rowe broke the deadlock, driving into the bottom corner after being put through in the box by Kingsley James, and Chris Holroyd nipped in front of everyone at the near post to make it 2-0 after 31 minutes.
Braintree managed to scramble a Paul Lewis header clear off the line in the 56th minute but Macclesfield got their third goal in the 73rd minute as Jack Simpson smashed home into the roof of the net.
Lee Barnard stuck a late consolation from the spot for Braintree after 81 minutes, before Macclesfield defender Mitch Hancox and Braintree goalkeeper Jamie Butler were sent off late on.
