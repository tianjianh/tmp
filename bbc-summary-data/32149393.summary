The Epping Ongar Railway, set to host an Easter egg hunt this weekend, featured in a video by adult film company Brazzers.
Dean Walton, business development manager at the heritage railway in Essex, apologised to customers for what he called "an error of judgement".
He said any further approaches for such productions would be refused.
Ongar station is clearly recognisable in the opening sequences of the 28-minute movie.
Mr Walton said the railway, which describes itself as "family friendly", had been made available for commercial hire "on a number of occasions" to generate money to run the trains.
He said: "Earlier this year we took a decision to allow an adult film, subject to certain conditions, to be filmed on the railway.
"We are sorry that our decision may have caused offence. It is clear that this decision was an error of judgement."
Mr Walton said the railway had no "editorial control" over the content of the movie and that filming took place when the attraction was closed to the public.
A spokeswoman for the railway said conditions included insisting Brazzers worked in line with the legislation governing the porn industry and that it showed "discretion".
She said officials "would have imagined there would be a film that did not look like it took place at the railway".
