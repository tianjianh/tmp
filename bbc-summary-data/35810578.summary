Here we take a closer look at the problems in Brazil and what went wrong since Ms Rousseff was elected for a second term in October 2014.
Dilma Rousseff's approval ratings plummeted after she narrowly won her second presidential election in October 2014.
According to a Datafolha poll (in Portuguese) released on 11 April, 63% of respondents across the country said her government was "bad or terrible", with only 13% saying it was "good or excellent".
Experts say this reflects voters' disillusionment with a deep recession and a corruption scandal involving the state-controlled oil company Petrobras.
The investigation into the corruption scandal, dubbed Operation Car Wash, has implicated important figures from Ms Rousseff's Workers' Party, but also some of her opponents.
The impeachment trial against Ms Rousseff was based on allegations that she manipulated the government's accounts in 2014 when she was seeking re-election.
Her opponents said what she did was illegal and warranted her impeachment. She argued it was a common practice which previous presidents also engaged in.
Ms Rousseff said her opponents were trying to mount a coup against her and were using the impeachment trial to oust her and her Workers' Party from office.
Much of the public discontent was based on the high level of corruption that has tainted the highest echelons of business and politics in Brazil.
Since the Workers' Party came to power in 2003, there has been a series of corruption scandals involving politicians from the governing party and also opposition parties. The two biggest are:
Operation Car Wash has uncovered a widening corruption scandal with dozens of politicians accused of paying or receiving kickbacks.
One of the most well known politicians to have been named in connection with the investigation is former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Brazil's Attorney General has accused him of playing a key role in the scandal, which Lula has denied.
But it is not just members of the Workers' Party who have been named in connection with Operation Car Wash.
Since Michel Temer took over as interim president, two of his ministers have resigned after leaked recordings suggested they had tried to obstruct the investigation.
Both ministers said their words were taken out of context.
The political crisis has deepened old political rivalries.
Supporters of the Workers' Party pointed to the achievements the Rousseff administration and that of President Lula brought about, such as lifting millions of people out of poverty and reducing inequality.
They said the allegations against them were a smear campaign designed to drive Ms Rousseff from office and prevent Lula from standing for the presidency in 2018.
They said the massive corruption investigations were a sign that under the Rousseff government, such crimes were being punished rather than swept under the carpet as in previous administrations.
The fact that high-ranking members of the Workers' Party had been convicted, they argued, was proof that there was no immunity.
Opponents of Ms Rousseff accused her of mismanaging the economy and said her government was deeply corrupt.
They said they were fed up with the Workers' Party after its 13 years in power and demanded a clean slate.
Brazil's economy is going through its worst recession in more than three decades following a drop in prices for Brazilian commodities such as oil, iron ore and soya.
In 2015, the economy shrank by 3.8%, its worst annual performance since 1981.
Inflation reached 10.7% at the end of last year, a 12-year-high.
Unemployment increased to 9% in 2015 and economists predict it could go into double figures in the coming months.
The forecast for 2016 does not look any rosier with GDP expected to decline by 3.8% again and inflation expected to rise.
