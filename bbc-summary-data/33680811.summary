Emergency services received a report at about 15:00 BST of a collapse at the derelict four-storey building on Hulme Hall Road, Castlefield.
A number of fire engines attended but there were no immediate reports of casualties, the fire service said.
Station manager Phil Nelson said a rescue team and dog would conduct a search "to ensure nobody is trapped".
Nearby resident Kevin Leach told the BBC: "I returned home on my motorbike to find bits of debris and drainpipe across our car park entrance.
"I was then met by neighbours who told me that it had happened just a few minutes earlier. They heard an almighty rumble and, by the time they looked outside, that section of the building had completely collapsed.
"They say it only took about five seconds."
