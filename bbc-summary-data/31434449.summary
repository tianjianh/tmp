The man had shouted abuse at waiting parents and pushed two women to the ground outside St Luke's CE School in Longsight on Wednesday afternoon.
He walked away but later returned to the school carrying two knives and threatened officers who had been called to the scene, police said.
He was shot with a Taser and arrested on suspicion of affray.
Det Insp Gareth Davies said the man had been "verbally and physically aggressive" causing "understandable distress to those parents who had arrived to pick their kids up from school".
"Officers arrived within minutes and were able to quickly resolve the situation," he added.
