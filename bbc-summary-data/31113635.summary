More money was spent making films in the UK last year than in any other year since measurements began, figures from the British Film Institute have shown.

The £1.471bn spent shooting movies like Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2014 represents a 35% increase on 2013.
Money spent on homegrown UK films also increased, with £188m spent making films budgeted at £500,000 and above.
Box office takings, though, were down 2% on the previous year.
Overall, 157.5 million tickets were sold, representing a 5% dip in attendances compared with 2013.
Yet the BFI's figures show an increased market share for UK independent films, thanks in part to the box office success of Paddington and The Inbetweeners 2.
The former title took £34.7m in 2014 and has now made more than £35.5m at UK and Ireland box offices.
"The UK film industry is a powerhouse for growth and I'm delighted that 2014 saw an all-time high spend on film production," culture secretary Sajid Javid said.
"The huge amount of inward investment we are seeing is a sure-fire sign that the UK is the best place in the world to make films."
BFI chief executive Amanda Nevill said its report "illuminates a dynamic and vibrant story of success for the screen industries in the UK".
The £1.471bn spend represents the highest figure since statistics were first recorded 20 years ago.
