The foot, in a boot, was found by a walker on Llanddwyn Island on 11 September.
DNA tests have confirmed it was that of Avril Whitfield, 57, who was last seen leaving her Caernarfon home on 1 April 2016.
Her death is not being treated as suspicious.
In a statement, Ms Whitfield's family said: "It is with a heavy heart we can confirm that the boot with remains found on Llanddwyn beach was that of Avril.
"[Her sister] Ann's family and close friends would like to thank all the people of Caernarfon and surrounding areas for all their support and kindness shown to them during the months that Avril was missing.
"Avril was very well liked and very much loved by all who knew her."
