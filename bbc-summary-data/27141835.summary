[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Knox, 80, who plays Rita Tanner in the ITV soap, was charged after being held at a police station in Knutsford, Cheshire, on 10 March.
She had gone there after her daughter, Maxine Ashcroft, 56, was earlier arrested for the same offence.
Ms Knox, who was represented by lawyer Nick Freeman, nicknamed Mr Loophole, will go on trial in July at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court.
The exact date of the trial has yet to be confirmed.
Coronation Street said the case was a private and personal matter and it would not be commenting.
Ashcroft, from Lechlade, Gloucestershire, was banned from driving for two years in a hearing at the same court earlier this month.
