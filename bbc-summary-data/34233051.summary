Refugees spoke at the gathering on Queen Street, as calls were made for concrete action.
The Welsh Refugee Council's Hannah Wharf welcomed moves to resettle 20,000 Syrians displaced by war in the UK.
Meanwhile, there was a demonstration on Swansea's Castle Square and a human chain is planned in Caernarfon, Gwynedd.
Ms Wharf said: "Wales has made it clear that we are prepared to welcome refugees.
"Winter is fast approaching for many of the most vulnerable in the refugee camps that neighbour Syria. The need for resettlement is now."
Methodist minister Paul Martin, who is based in Canton, Cardiff, called it "the most serious human-made disaster of our time".
David Cameron announced on Monday that the UK would accept up to 20,000 people from camps surrounding Syria with priority given to vulnerable children.
First Minister Carwyn Jones will hold a Wales summit on the refugee crisis next week.
Local authorities in Wales have said they are willing to "play their part" but asked for help to meet the costs.
