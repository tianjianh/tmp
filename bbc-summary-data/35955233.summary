Braid Group pays £2m bribery penalty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Glasgow logistics group has agreed to pay more than £2m after it uncovered illegal bribery operations in its own organisation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Braid Group found it had won contracts which breached the Bribery Act.
The act was introduced more than five years ago and forbids companies based in the UK from paying bribes to gain business anywhere in the world.
The logistics firm became suspicious of two contracts in 2012.
After an investigation, it found that one of its staff had set up an account which was used by an employee of a customer to buy holidays, hotels and cash.
In the second case, a profit-sharing arrangement was set up which rewarded the director of a company for placing orders with Braid.
The company reported itself to the Crown Office and has agreed to pay a penalty of £2.2m. It said it was implementing new policies to stop bribery happening again.
