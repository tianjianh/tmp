Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny says he will consider all his options before making a decision on his future.

The 27-year-old's contract with French club Toulon expires in the summer.
Halfpenny, who scored 16 points in Toulon's European Champions Cup win over Scarlets on Sunday said his international career was a major consideration.
"I'm weighing up everything. Hopefully I can make a decision very shortly," he said.
Should he decide to remain in France, Halfpenny would rely on a wildcard pick to play for Wales under terms of the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy.
"I want to be playing top-flight rugby but the biggest consideration is obviously the wildcard," Halfpenny said.
"International rugby is hugely important for me and I have to consider that."
Halfpenny said in late October he would decide whether to stay with Toulon or return to Wales "in the next month or so" following the autumn Test series.
Former Toulon head coach Diego Dominguez said earlier in October he was confident Halfpenny would stay with the former European champions, whom he joined in 2014
"I know I said I was going to focus on the internationals and then think and that's what I'm doing now, going through that process of making a decision," Halfpenny added.
"My agent's looking at the options and hopefully he can get them on the table and I'll have a look at my options and make a decision then."
Halfpenny said it was "good fun" facing a number of his Wales team-mates in Toulon's 31-20 win over Scarlets.
The former Cardiff Blues player scored 16 points in a victory which lifted the three-times champions to nine points in the pool, five behind defending champions Saracens.
"We'll enjoy this win and then look to prepare heading to Wales next week," Halfpenny added.
"The Scarlets will look to come out fighting and it's going to be tough there. They've got quality across the park.
"All we can do is take each game as it comes. We know the task ahead of us is a huge challenge.
"We're trying to build, week on week, game on game.
"If we continue to improve then hopefully we can achieve what we set out to do and that's to advance in this competition and challenge for the title."
