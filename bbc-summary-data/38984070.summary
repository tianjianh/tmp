In the first, five people died when two suicide bombers targeted a government compound in the Mohmand tribal region.
Three of the dead belonged to a tribal police force, while two were said to be civilians.
A faction of the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, said it was behind the bloodshed.
In the second attack on Wednesday, a bomber on a motorbike rammed a government van carrying four judges in the city of Peshawar.
The driver and a pedestrian bystander were killed, and the four judges were injured. They have been transferred to a nearby hospital.
Peshawar police chief Tahir Khan told media at the scene that the judges appeared to be the bomber's target.
Pakistan has seen an upswing in militant attacks of late, after a period of relative calm.
On Monday, a suicide bombing in the eastern city of Lahore killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 100, most of whom are still being treated in hospitals.
The blast occurred when owners of medical shops were demonstrating against amendments to a law governing drug sales in Punjab province.
Jamaat-ur-Ahrar said it had carried out the attack, as well as two gun assaults in Karachi on 12 February.
