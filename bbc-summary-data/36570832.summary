'Black Friday' sculpture plans prepared in Eyemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sculpture commemorating the families who were affected by Scotland's worst fishing disaster is to be unveiled in Eyemouth later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 189 men were killed in waters just outside the town's harbour when a hurricane struck in October 1881. All but 70 came from Eyemouth.
Many of them drowned within full view of their families on the shore.
The tragedy, which became known locally as Black Friday, left 78 widows and 182 fatherless children in Eyemouth.
A five-metre long bronze sculpture called "Widows and Bairns" is due be unveiled in October.
It was created by local sculptor Jill Watson, who was commissioned to design memorials representing the surviving widows and children from four of the communities affected by the disaster - Cove, St Abbs, Eyemouth and Burnmouth.
In 2009, a series of 12 "waymarks" by artist John Behm were installed along the Berwickshire coast in honour of the victims.
