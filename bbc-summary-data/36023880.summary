A photographer has spent two weeks travelling the streets of Ipswich by bus to complete an unusual artistic project.

George Georgiou, 55, said he wanted to take photos of everyday "micro-dramas" in the town.
He chose to use public transport because it took him to areas "you have no reason to normally go".
"I hope people recognise their town from a different perspective," Georgiou, said.
The idea to take photos from buses follows on from similar projects in London and Ukraine.
Mr Georgiou, who was born and bred in London but now lives in Folkestone in Kent, said he knew little about Ipswich apart from its football club before beginning the project, which is part of the PhotoEast festival.
"Ipswich is a much quieter place than I expected," he said.
"I found people friendly and the bus drivers were great and would wait for people if they could see them running from 50m away, which is how it should be, but you wouldn't see that so much in London.
"I wanted to capture Ipswich's micro-dramas. I like the centre and its architecture, but I was photographing from buses and they don't got through the pedestrianised areas, so they won't feature.
"London feels like hundreds of villages, whereas Ipswich felt like one suburb, but less frenetic and it seems like an easier place to live."
Adrian Evans, the director of PhotoEast, said Georgiou spent hours at a time on the buses and "must have been on every route".
"It is amazing how different a place can look from the top of a bus," he said. "It's a great way to take art and photography out into the community.
"Some of the photos will be displayed on the buses in the future, so it's like a portable gallery."
