A great-grandmother has been knitting miniature Christmas toys every day since Easter to raise money for cancer patients.

Retired dressmaker Carole Wheadon, of Leckwith, Cardiff, has created little Santas, snowmen, trees and puddings.
The 79-year-old has also filled the little gifts with chocolates and sold them to raise funds for Velindre Cancer Centre.
"I knit a bit every day," said Mrs Wheadon.
She started knitting the figures to raise money for the specialist cancer hospital in Cardiff about five-years-ago after a friend lost her father to cancer.
"I volunteered my services because I wanted to help in any way I could," said Mrs Wheadon, who buys the wool herself and gets the patterns from the charity.
"People use them as decorations or in stockings, or even on a plate for Christmas dinner."
And, her knitting is not just for Christmas, as she creates crochet blankets for the charity to sell at their summer fayre, and at Easter she knits little chicks with eggs hidden inside.
