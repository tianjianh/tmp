Cocaine worth an estimated £150m was seized after the Makayabella was stopped off the coast of Ireland last September.
She was taken by a boarding party from the LÉ Niamh after they found 1,025 kgs of cocaine on board.
An anonymous Irish sailing enthusiast is its new owner.
The Makayabella was purchased by Cork solicitor, Barry O'Meara in trust for his client.
"The owner has a keen interest in sailing and the boat will be for his own personal use," he said.
The auction took place at a hotel in Carrigaline, County Cork, on Thursday.
In all, eight people in the UK and Ireland have been charged in connection with the drug smuggling operation.
The Makayabella was built in 1986 in a naval shipyard in Antibes, France.
She was in poor condition when she was intercepted in the Atlantic Ocean, 200 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland.
