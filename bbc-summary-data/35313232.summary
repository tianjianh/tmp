[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
LENNY ABRAHAMSON
Age: 49
Nominated for: Room, about a kidnapped woman who lives in an enclosed space with her five-year-old son.
Oscar record: No previous nominations.
The critics said: "Irish director Lenny Abrahamson returns after the triumph of Frank for an utterly unique tale which has seen the film-maker deservedly thrust onto the world stage." [Irish Examiner]
ALEJANDRO G INARRITU
Age: 52
Nominated for: The Revenant, about a frontiersman's fight for survival after a brutal bear attack.
Oscar record: Won best director, best original screenplay (as co-writer) and best picture (as producer) for Birdman in 2015. Nominated for best director and best picture (as producer) for Babel in 2007.
The critics said: "Few prestige directors have so fully committed to the notion of cinema as an endurance test as Alejandro G Inarritu, and he pushes himself, the audience and an aggrieved 19th Century frontiersman well beyond their usual limits in The Revenant." [Variety]
TOM MCCARTHY
Age: 49
Nominated for: Spotlight, in which investigative reporters at the Boston Globe uncover child abuse in the Catholic Church.
Oscar record: Nominated for best original screenplay (as co-writer) for Up in 2010.
The critics said: "McCarthy's earlier films marked him out as an attentive carver of mature and intelligent dramas... Spotlight, a more intricate story told on a broader canvas, represents a significant step up." [Daily Telegraph]
ADAM McKAY
Age: 47
Nominated for: The Big Short, in which canny investors seek to make money by betting on the 2008 financial crisis.
Oscar record: No previous nominations.
The critics said: "[McKay] dabbles in genuine irreverence, political energy, and a formal inventiveness here that is a delight to see, and a constant surprise." [IndieWire]
GEORGE MILLER
Age: 70
Nominated for: Mad Max: Fury Road, in which post-apocalyptic "road warrior" Max Rockatansky falls in with a female rebel.
Oscar record: Won best animated film (as producer) for Happy Feet in 2007. Nominated for best original screenplay (as co-writer) for Lorenzo's Oil in 1993 and for best adapted screenplay (as co-writer) and best picture (as producer) for Babe in 1996.
The critics said: "Miller's old-school post-apocalyptic vision dazzles the eye and engages the mind in ways that practically no contemporary blockbusters do.." [New York Post]
