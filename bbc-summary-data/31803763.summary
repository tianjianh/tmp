Daniel Morgan murder: Appeal for new information

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been made for anyone with information about the murder of a Welsh private investigator killed almost 30 years ago, to come forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Morgan, from Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbran, was found outside a London pub in 1987 after an axe attack.
His family claim he was on the verge of exposing police corruption.
The police have been criticised in the past over their handling of the case and an independent panel, set up in 2013 to look at it, wants more help.
Panel chairwoman Baroness O'Loan said: "As we approach the 28th anniversary of Daniel Morgan's murder the panel would like to hear from anyone who believes they may have information which is relevant to its work.
"If you believe you have any such information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please contact the panel."
