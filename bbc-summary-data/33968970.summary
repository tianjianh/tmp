Poultry processor Moy Park is ranked the number one NI company for the fourth year running.
Its profits jumped by £33m, off the back of a 10% rise in sales.
Other companies which saw turnover grow "significantly" included Shorts Brothers PLC, part of aerospace giant Bombardier.
The research was compiled by business information firm Dun & Bradstreet for Ulster Business magazine and is based on 2013/14 trading figures filed at Companies House.
Combined sales for the top 100 local companies rose by almost 6% on the previous 12 months.
David Elliott, editor of Ulster Business, said: "The list shows the Northern Ireland economy is continuing to grow at an impressive rate.
"Our biggest companies have managed to grow sales in an increasingly profitable manner, a factor which bodes well for long-term economic health."
