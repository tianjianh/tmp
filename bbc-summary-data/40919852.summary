Simone Inzaghi's side led 2-0 thanks to Ciro Immobile's double, the first from a penalty and the second a fine header after the break.
Paulo Dybala scored twice in the last five minutes for Juve, with a free-kick and a penalty, to level the score.
But Alessandro Murgia converted Jordan Lukaku's cross in injury time as Lazio won without needing extra time.
