Crews were called to the two-storey building in Inchinnan Road, Paisley, at about 00:10 on Thursday.
They rescued a man and woman who both appeared to be suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation.
Both were checked by paramedics and taken to the town's Royal Alexandra Hospital as a precaution. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and checked it had not spread to neighbouring homes.
