'Action needed' over high private rent costs in Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Putting a halt to expensive private rents is a key issue for Bristol East, candidates have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liberal Democrat Abdul Malik said there were "notorious" landlords. Labour's Kerry McCarthy and Conservative Theodora Clarke highlighted high costs.
UKIP's James McMurray said the party wanted a "brownfield revolution".
It comes after a petition over a letting agent who called on landlords to consider hiking prices was signed by some 11,000 people.
The four candidates were speaking on a BBC Radio Bristol election debate programme.
The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition's Matt Gordon, who was not at the event, told the BBC Britain was experiencing a "terrible and escalating housing crisis", with Bristol being one of the worst-hit places.
The Greens' Lorraine Francis, who was also not at the debate, has so far not responded for comment.
Mr Malik said the area had a "reputation... of some notorious landlords".
"They own these properties and don't do anything with them because they bought them for pennies and now they're worth a huge amount more. They have no reason or incentive to move them on."
Ms McCarthy said: "The first thing we obviously need to do is build more houses and make sure they're affordable houses.
"Rents in the private sector are [also] absolutely extortionate, so [Labour] will stop extortionate letting agents' fees, where they charge the landlord and the letting agent at the same time."
Ms Clarke said: "I think it's about working with the planning authorities, the council and making sure we're working with the developers to have access to their sites."
Mr McMurray said: "At the moment it's cheaper for developers to develop on greenfield land and they have been doing that around the Bristol area."
Mr Gordon said there was an out-of-control "Bristol bubble" and that rent controls should be introduced.
The candidates for the constituency are:
Theodora Clarke, Conservative
Lorraine Francis, Green
Matt Gordon, TUSC
Abdul Malik, Liberal Democrat
Kerry McCarthy, Labour
James McMurray, UKIP
