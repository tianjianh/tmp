The Colombian black-headed spider monkeys, which are usually found in parts of South America, arrived within three weeks of each other.
Zookeepers say these primates are a critically endangered species in the wild, due to deforestation and hunting, so these births are really important.
"Both of our new black-headed spider monkey mums are taking great care of their little ones, spending lots of time cradling them. They'll continue to care for them in this way until the youngsters are at the age of 20 months" said Claire Parry, the zoo's assistant team manager of primates.
