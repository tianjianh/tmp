More pressure on Hibs than St Johnstone - David Wotherspon

St Johnstone midfielder David Wotherspoon reckons his former club Hibernian will feel more strain in Saturday's League Cup semi-final.

The teams meet at Tynecastle, with Saints fifth in the Premiership and Hibs second in the division below.
"They are talking about a treble," Wotherspoon told BBC Scotland.
"They're still in the Scottish Cup, they're in the League Cup semis and second in the Championship, so I feel the pressure is on them."
Wotherspoon, 26, joined Saints in 2013 following four seasons as a first team regular at Easter Road.
Overlooked for Scottish Cup final squads in 2012 and 2013, he made it third time lucky, playing for 85 minutes as St Johnstone won the trophy in 2014.
"As soon as I came here I felt less pressure and it allowed myself to express myself more," he said.
"It's a great club and we've shown that we can be up there fighting at the top end of the league.
"We've had good cup runs as well in the past few years. It's just a great place to be at the moment."
The Perth club, who beat Rangers and Morton to get to this stage, have gone six games without a win but Wotherspoon is not overly concerned by the dip in form.
"We just need to stay positive," he said.
"Our performances have been good. There have been a few cracking goalkeeper displays against us. It's going to come for us."
Hibernian are aiming for a third top flight scalp in this season's tournament, having disposed of Aberdeen and Dundee United, and John McGinn is full of confidence ahead of the tie.
"St Johnstone are in a higher league and have a lot of good, experienced players but we fancy our chances against anyone," the midfielder told BBC Scotland.
"St Johnstone are always very well organised and they are dangerous on the break.
"We need to match their hunger and desire and if we do that then I feel we have the ability in the dressing room to come through.
"We'll have more supporters in the ground and hopefully we can use that to spur us on. It should be a great atmosphere and I always enjoy playing at Tynecastle."
