[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tottenham Hotspur v Southampton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is expected to pick Son Heung-min in place of injured striker Harry Kane.

Midfielder Mousa Dembele is fit, but Kyle Walker and Victor Wanyama are doubts with minor knocks.
Southampton manager Claude Puel has no fresh injury worries and he could pick the same team that beat Watford.
Striker Charlie Austin is edging closer to a return from a shoulder problem, but defender Virgil van Dijk remains a long-term injury absentee.
Simon Brotherton: "Last week's FA Cup thrashing of Millwall came at a heavy price for Tottenham, who now face four to six weeks without their star striker Harry Kane.
"It's his second spell on the sidelines this season and others will need to step up if they're to maintain any sort of a challenge to Chelsea at the top. Spurs have already played top-flight opposition without Kane in the team nine times in the current campaign. In those nine matches, they managed only three wins and eight goals.
"Finding the net hasn't been a problem for Southampton lately, who have won their last two away games at Sunderland and Watford, scoring four in each of them.
"They also won this fixture last season 2-1, inflicting a first defeat for Mauricio Pochettino against his former club."

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "We have to find a solution until Harry [Kane] is available again. We have players who can cope with the pressure and it's a great opportunity for Sonny [Son Heung-min] and Vincent [Janssen]."
"We are not worried, we are in good condition. We hope it will be different [to the last time Kane was injured]. I think the team now is completely different, that was in September.
"It was a difficult pre-season after the Euros and we are in a completely different level. The team is now more solid. We have improved a lot since that period."
Southampton manager Claude Puel: "They [Tottenham] have a lot of wins at home, so it's a good challenge for us.
"It will be interesting to see our progress. It's difficult with one game every two weeks to keep concentration, but it's important to have a good response at Tottenham."
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been making all the right noises about how his side will cope without the injured Harry Kane, but they will undoubtedly miss him.
Southampton are a strange team and very difficult to predict, but I am going to go for a scruffy Spurs win - even without Kane, they still should have enough.
