A parachute mine dropped on the occupied island of Guernsey during World War Two has been safely removed from a beach.

It was the same as the device found in the Bluebell Woods - the removal of which involved the evacuation of houses and air and sea exclusion zones.
The device was discovered off Salerie Corner on Sunday, during a particularly low tide, and recovered on Tuesday.
PC Simon Hamon, from the bomb disposal team, said no explosives were found.
He said: "We recovered the firing section from a MK-1 Type 4 ground mine, otherwise known as a parachute mine, which is identical to the weapon that was dropped and we discovered in the Bluebell Woods.
"This was minus the explosive element, clearly some work had taken place on it - it had the firing pistol removed and the remote pressure switch removed."
PC Hamon said: "The decision was taken to recover it so it didn't get reported again.
"Because it was in such a good state of preservation we're transporting it up to the German Occupation Museum and they are going to preserve it so the public can see what a section of the bluebell bomb would have looked like."
The mine was among 74 dropped by the Royal Canadian Air Force in June 1944, aimed at St Peter Port Harbour in a bid to stop submarines using it as a base.
PC Hamon said: "We can only account for 16 or 17 of them so there are plenty more out there.
"It's in a wonderful state of preservation so there's nothing to say there won't be others out there with cases intact and therefore explosives intact, which is a potential danger to the public."
He urged anyone who saw something they were not sure about to get in touch.
