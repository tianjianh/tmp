Care home owner's misconduct over woman's lift fall death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a care home where a woman died after falling down a lift shaft has been reprimanded for professional misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
May Lewis, 96, died when a carer walked backwards into the open lift shaft at Pontcanna House Care Home, Cardiff, in 2012, while manoeuvring her wheelchair.
Owner Dr Nasik Al-Mufti was fined Â£100,000 in August for breaching health and safety regulations.
Care Council for Wales said her actions were not deliberate or reckless.
Dr Al-Mufti was the joint owner of Pontcanna House with her husband when in early 2012 there were problems with the home's platform lift.
The hearing in Cardiff was told an engineer had advised the doors on the second floor could not be used, but staff routinely used an emergency key to override it when they did not open.
On 6 March, 2012, carer Carol Conway walked backwards into the lift while moving Mrs Lewis's wheelchair.
The lift platform was not there and they fell 20ft (6m) down the shaft. Mrs Lewis died instantly and Ms Conway received life-threatening injuries.
The hearing was told Dr Al-Mufti "acquiesced but did not encourage" the use of the emergency key override.
It was also told staff mistakenly believed the lift's chime indicated the platform had risen to the correct level when it only indicated the door was opening.
Andrew McGeem, representing Dr Al-Mufti, said there had been increased inspections at Pontcanna House since the incident, which had found no cause for concern.
He said Cardiff council continued to house people there and the incident had been an "isolated" one.
Care Council for Wales panel chairwoman, Helen Potts, said the incident was a "tragic accident, but an accident waiting to happen".
She said Dr Al-Mufti's actions had not been deliberate or reckless and the risk of repetition was very low, but she said the incident had damaged the reputation of social care.
