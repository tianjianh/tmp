Police urge vigilance in Borders over 'slip-in' thefts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in the Scottish Borders have been urged to be vigilant following a spate of "slip-in" thefts.

Police said thieves targeted two properties in Melrose and Innerleithen while the residents were at home.
A wallet was stolen from a home in Darnick Vale, Melrose, between 14:00 and 14:50 on Saturday.
And a laptop was taken taken from a home in Montgomery Square, Innerleithen, between 19:00 on Saturday and 11:00 on Sunday.
Insp Tony Hodges said: "With the warmer weather now upon us, residents should be vigilant when out in gardens or within their homes not to leave external doors open or unlocked.
"As can be seen from this weekend's incidents, it's fairly simple to slip into an insecure property and make off undetected with stolen items without the residents being aware.
"Keeping your house, vehicles, garage and outbuildings secure at all times prevents this type of opportunist theft."
