Trust seeks names for Loch Arkaig sea eagle chicks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the public have been invited to suggest names for two sea eagle chicks that have hatched in a west Highland pine forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two-month-old birds at Loch Arkaig in Lochaber are believed to be a male and a female.
Woodland Trust Scotland has come up with the naming competition as part of its efforts to raise funds to buy Loch Arkaig Pine Forest.
Forestry Commission Scotland is selling the woodland.
Parts of the forest still bear the scars of a fire that broke out during commando training in World War Two.
Scorched tree trunks still stand in the woods that in war-time formed part of a large area near Fort William used for secret training of Allied commandos.
Woodland Trust Scotland is working with the group Arkaig Community Forest on the bid to purchase the woodland.
The wood includes areas of ancient Caledonian forest, which provides habitat for birds such as Scottish crossbill.
