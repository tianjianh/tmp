England are capable of completing a 3-0 whitewash over Australia this summer, says the Wallabies' record points scorer Michael Lynagh.

Australia beat England 33-13 at Twickenham in last year's World Cup.
But England regrouped under new head coach Eddie Jones and completed a Six Nations Grand Slam in March.
"Eddie's going down there to win the series 3-0 and why not? It's realistic. It's a good squad," former fly-half Lynagh told BBC Sport.
"The only thing is, it's the end of the season and a lot of the England players will be involved in Premiership and European finals.
"It's going to be a fascinating series."
England and Australia face each other in a three-Test series for the first time when they meet in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney in June.
Australia's victory in October saw England exit the World Cup at the pool stage and preceded the exit of head coach Stuart Lancaster.
Australian Jones, who led Japan to a famous victory over South Africa in the same tournament, replaced Lancaster in November and won all five games as England won their first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2003.
Former Saracens playmaker Lynagh, who won 72 caps for the Wallabies and scored 911 points, believes Jones has brought a swagger back to England's performances.

"He's come in and said 'we are going to be arrogant, we have to be like that to win'," said Lynagh.
"I think Eddie looks at the culture of English rugby and there is a perception that arrogance is part of it - so he's said we'll go and do that.
"He's not trying to 'Australianise' England. It would be wrong to do that, you have to come in and work on what culturally works within the country."
