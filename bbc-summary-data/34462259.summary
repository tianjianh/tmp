Paul Shaw is stepping down as head of performance after the summer's Ashes loss to Australia, with a head coach to be hired in a reshuffle.
England and Wales Cricket Board head of women's cricket, Clare Connor, told BBC Test Match Special: "The qualities and experiences we are looking for are going to be found more than likely with a coach who has worked at as high a level as possible in the men's game."
The formal recruitment process starts this week, with Shaw leaving at the end of the year.
Connor added: "The players are in a very different place in terms of their responsibilities, their accountability, their status as professional sportswomen - and the scrutiny and pressure that goes with that.
"The person who will lead those players in the next stage of their professional development is more than likely going to be a man who has had those experiences in the men's game."
England are next in international action in February, when they play three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 internationals in South Africa.
