The missing aircraft, believed to be flying from Inverness, was due to arrive at the airport at about 12:00.
Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane about four miles (6.4km) west of the airport.
Police Scotland said a plane was found close to the village of Abernyte in Perthshire.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed it had "deployed a team to investigate a light aircraft accident".
The emergency services, including the coastguard, RNLI and the RAF had been helping with the search.
Lifeboat crews from Broughty Ferry and Montrose and a Coastguard helicopter from Inverness were called out.
Weather was poor when the plane went missing, with heavy rain, low cloud and gusts of up to 35mph (56kmh).
A spokesman for Aberdeen Coastguard said they received a call about a "possible aircraft crash" at 12:43.
Dundee Airport operates only a maximum of two scheduled services a day, but is a popular base for light aircraft enthusiasts.
A training school also operates from the site.
The airport is less than two miles (3.2km) from the city centre.
