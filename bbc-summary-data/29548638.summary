As in Middlesbrough, UKIP pulled into a second-place finish, with Jane Collins winning 4,648 votes for the party - 21.7% of the total.
Eastleigh - 28 February 2013
Chris Huhne's resignation after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice led to some by-election success for Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. The party's candidate Mike Thornton retained the seat for the party, with coalition partners the Conservative Party finishing third and Labour fourth.
UKIP came second, with Diane James winning 27% of votes cast, against the Liberal Democrats on 32%.
Mid Ulster - 7 March 2013
Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned from his role as an MP at the end of 2012. He was replaced as the Westminster representative of Mid Ulster by Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy, who won 46.9% of the votes and a majority of 4,681.
South Shields - 2 May 2013
The resignation of David Miliband, former foreign secretary and candidate for the Labour leadership, triggered a by-election in a seat held by Labour since 1935. The party's Emma Lewell-Buck won the seat with a 6,505 majority - down almost 5,000 from Mr Miliband's three years previously.
Big gains were made by UKIP, who finished second again, winning 24.2% of the vote.
Wythenshawe and Sale East - 13 February 2014
The death of Labour MP Paul Goggins triggered a by-election for the Labour seat he had held since 1997. The party's candidate, Mike Kane, won with a majority of 8,960, taking 55.3% of the vote.
UKIP's John Bickley - who would later stand for the party in the Heywood and Middleton by-election - came second, with 18% of the total vote. The Conservatives were pushed into third, and the Liberal Democrats came fourth.
Newark - 5 June 2014
Former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer resigned after he was suspended from the Commons for six months for allegedly asking questions in Parliament in return for money. He was replaced as MP for Newark by 32-year-old Conservative Robert Jenrick, who won 45% of the vote and a majority of 7,403.
The by-election was held in the wake of UKIP's victory in the European elections in May. Despite the hopes of Nigel Farage's party that the momentum from that win would help them triumph in Newark, the party's candidate, Roger Helmer, came second, with 26% of the vote.
Clacton - 9 October 2014
Douglas Carswell's announcement on 28 August that he was defecting from the Conservative Party to UKIP triggered a by-election in Clacton. The prospect of UKIP winning their first seat in the House of Commons led to huge media attention, with party leaders descending on the constituency to campaign in the last week before the vote.
In the end, Douglas Carswell won the seat comfortably with a majority of 12,404, giving Nigel Farage's party its first seat in Parliament. The Conservatives' Giles Watling came a distant second, with Labour third, the Greens fourth, and the Liberal Democrats falling to fifth.
Heywood and Middleton - 9 October 2014
The death of Labour's Jim Dobbin in early September triggered a by-election that was scheduled to coincide with the one in Clacton. Ed Miliband's party had held a healthy majority and was thought unlikely to lose.
As expected, Labour's Liz McInnes won the vote, but the night's big story was the close second-place finish of UKIP's John Bickley, with Labour's majority slashed from 5,971 to 617. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats trailed far behind in third and fourth.
Rochester and Strood - 20 November 2014
When Conservative MP Mark Reckless defected to UKIP, and resigned his seat in the Commons, he set in train a by-election in his Rochester and Strood constituency. Unlike Clacton before it, which had been won by Douglas Carswell, Rochester was way down UKIP's list of "winnable" seats at a general election.
Despite five visits to the constituency by David Cameron, who was campaigning for his party's candidate Kelly Tolhurst, Mr Reckless won the by-election with a majority of 2,920 votes.
Long-serving Labour MP Michael Meacher died, prompting the contest. The party's candidate, Jim McMahon, secured a 10,722-vote majority over UKIP's John Bickley, and a 62% vote share - higher than at the general election.
The Conservatives came third and the Liberal Democrats fourth.
Labour comfortably held on to the seat, vacated after MP Harry Harpham died. His widow Gill Furniss ran for the party, gaining 14,087 votes, a majority of 9,590 and a 6% increase in Labour's share of the vote.
UKIP came second, followed by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives.
Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies stood down to run for the Welsh Assembly election, and was replaced by his party colleague Chris Elmore.
He won 52% of the vote, with UKIP second and Plaid Cymru third.
Labour held the south London constituency in a by-election prompted by the departure of newly elected London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
Junior doctor Rosena Allin-Khan received 17,894 votes, winning with a majority of 6,357 over the Conservatives. The Green Party came third.
Labour's Tracy Brabin won with an increased majority for her party in the seat left vacant because of the murder of MP Jo Cox.
The other major parties opted not to stand, but a number of smaller parties - including the National Front and BNP - did.
The Conservatives held on, albeit with a reduced majority, after former Prime Minister David Cameron stood down as an MP.
Robert Courts won by 5,702 votes, with the party's vote share falling from 60% in 2015 to 45%, as the Liberal Democrats pushed past Labour into second place.
