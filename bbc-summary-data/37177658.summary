[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review into the death of a four-year-old girl from Bridgend who died of peritonitis has said her death "was not down to neglect".

The child, one of seven, was taken ill over Christmas 2015. Following her death her siblings were taken into care.
The Western Bay Safeguarding Children Board review did not suggest her death could have been prevented.
But, it added, "working practices have been modified".
Authors said lessons could be learned about communication between agencies like children's services, foster carers, schools and police.
A board spokesman stated: "The safeguarding of children remains an absolute priority for all of the board's member agencies.
"The board has ensured that all of the agencies involved have been made aware and that working practices have been modified accordingly to take account of the review's findings."
The review said other improvements included relocating social work teams into "multi-agency community hubs".
The Western Bay Safeguarding Children Board covers the three local authority areas of Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend.
