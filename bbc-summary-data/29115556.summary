Scottish independence: Brown sets out more powers timetable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former prime minister Gordon Brown has set out a timetable for boosting the Scottish Parliament's powers if voters reject independence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Brown said a "No" vote would be the "starting gun" for Holyrood to be handed greater control over finance, welfare and taxation.
It is understood the three main Westminster parties will formally back Mr Brown's proposals on Tuesday.
The SNP has said the "No" campaign is in a state of "absolute panic".
A Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Brown's announcement: "We welcome this Labour initiative and we are content with the proposed timetable".
On Sunday, Chancellor George Osborne pledged to set out a "plan of action" on the implementation of new powers.
It came in the wake of a YouGov poll which gave the pro-independence campaign a narrow lead for the first time in the campaign ahead of the referendum on 18 September.
In other developments:
Mr Brown formally unveiled his proposed timetable for those new powers, in a speech at the Loanhead Miners Welfare and Social Club in Midlothian on Monday evening:
Despite the apparent momentum building behind the Yes campaign, Downing Street insists there will be no change of strategy, no surge of announcements, no rush of ministerial visits.
Instead, the UK government intends to stick doggedly to its core strategy of warning about the economic dangers of separation and doubts about a future Scottish currency. No 10 hopes this, coupled with the promise of more powers for Scotland, will be enough to save the Union.
But among MPs on all sides, there is mounting anxiety. One senior Tory told me it was "typical last-minute panic from Cameron and Osborne".
Anxiety centres on what is seen as a lack of passion and a call for Mr Cameron to inject more emotion into the case for the union, to talk less about sterling and more about family and values.
There are also demands for the prime minister to show more urgency, to sweep aside the rest of his diary and to focus solely on Scotland.
As for Ed Miliband, there are similar worries that he has failed to shore up the Labour vote and made little impact in its Scottish heartlands.
In short, leaders may not be panicking just yet but there are plenty of their MPs who are already deeply fearful that the break-up of the union may be just 10 days away.
Mr Brown went on to restate what new powers Labour would be pushing for, in 12 policy areas. They included the option of a non-profit making railway company and devolving powers over the work programme and housing benefit.
He said: "There never again could be a bedroom tax imposed by Westminster on Scotland because we would give the power to set housing benefit to the Labour people and everyone else who is in the Scottish parliament.
"These are big changes that we are proposing. To strengthen the Scottish Parliament but at the same to stay as part of the United Kingdom for pensions, for social security for funding out health service, for the currency,  interest rates, the economy, defence and security."
A Downing Street source earlier said Mr Brown's timetable was  "not a million miles away from our thinking" while another added: "This is in line with the fruits of the cross-party discussions."
The poll by YouGov in The Sunday Times at the weekend has led to an "intensifying debate on how to react", according to a very senior business figure close to this debate I spoke to this morning.
Two banking sources have also revealed that bank branches north of the border have started holding more cash at branches, in case members of the public decide they want to take out their money.
That is how seriously the banks themselves, and the Bank of England (which has been informed about this cash move), are taking the possibility of a Yes vote on 18 September.
Let's be clear. There appears to be no evidence yet of "deposit flight" - people moving money to English domiciled banks. And sources have said that moving some additional cash to branches is often a reaction to electorally volatile situations - a close general election, for example.
But financial institutions are preparing for all eventualities with movements of cash (a very small percentage of the liquidity they hold) and short-term buffer arrangements, should the need arise.

Speaking ahead of Mr Brown's announcement, Alistair Darling, the head of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, stressed that no new powers would be put on the table beyond those already announced by the three main Westminster parties earlier this year.
He added: "The additional powers coming to the Scottish Parliament were announced by the party leaders, north and south of the border, some time ago.
"People have said, 'Yes we want to know the timetable and the process' and that is something the government is going to announce this week.
"But remember this, this is a referendum on whether or not we stay on the United Kingdom. It is not a referendum on what further powers we are going to get. We are going to get them anyway, if we stay in the United Kingdom.
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said plans to increase the powers of the devolved Edinburgh parliament were a "panicky measure" announced without credibility, because the Yes Scotland campaign for independence was "winning on the ground".
Speaking on behalf of Yes Scotland, former Scottish Labour Party chairman and Labour for Independence campaigner Bob Thomson said: "This smacks of utter panic and desperation by the 'No' campaign as they lose their lead in the polls.
"Gordon Brown is in no position to offer anything - he is a backbench MP, and the Tories are in power at Westminster.
"The choice is to vote Yes for all the powers we need to create jobs and protect Scotland's NHS - or No for a Tory-led talking shop.
"The people of Scotland will not trust the Tories to deliver powers that in any event fall far short of what we need. The sure fire way to achieve the full range of powers Scotland needs to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy is to vote Yes a week on Thursday."

Labour leader Ed Miliband is to welcome Gordon Brown's proposals in a speech at a TUC dinner later.
Arriving at the event in Liverpool, he said many trade unions were campaigning for a No vote for "solidarity and social justice".
He insisted Labour would deliver the timetable outlined by Mr Brown if elected to government in May 2015.
"Voting No in this referendum is not a vote for no change, we will deliver change, we are determined to deliver change," Mr Miliband added.
"Change for greater social justice for Scotland but also change for greater devolution to Scotland.  We know things need to change and a No vote will deliver that change."
