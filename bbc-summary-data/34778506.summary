The rise was helped by wet and windy weather in Scotland and Ireland, which boosted renewable output.
However, the company's chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, warned market conditions continued to be challenging.
He said he expected profits in domestic energy supply to be lower at the end of the year.

"The last six months have seen us invest substantially in the UK's energy infrastructure - committing one and a half times what we've made in profit in the first half of the year.
"We've upgraded our fleet of gas fired power stations, opened our new multi-fuel power plant and completed the Beauly to Denny transmission link and started work on the vital subsea link between Caithness and Moray.
