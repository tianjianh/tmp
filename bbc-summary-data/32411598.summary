Premier League predictions: Lawro v snooker star Mark Selby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is Mark Selby, the reigning snooker world champion.
Selby's nickname is the 'Jester from Leicester' and he supports his local team - he is a lifelong Foxes fan.
Selby is currently defending his world title at the Crucible in Sheffield but is also keeping a close eye on Leicester's bid to stay in the top flight.

"We started off the season in fantastic form but then we went on a bit of a bad run," Selby told BBC Sport. "It wasn't as if we were playing that badly, but we were having some bad luck that was costing us results.
"But now we seem to be coming good at the right time and hopefully we have not left it too late.
"Would I rather retain the World Snooker title or see Leicester stay in the Premier League? That's a tough one. I have got to know [Foxes manager] Nigel Pearson quite well over the past year so, as long as he is not listening, I think it would have to be me winning the world title."
You can see all of Mark's predictions on Football Focus at 12:15 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website (in the UK).
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. The exact score earns THREE points.
Last weekend, Lawro got three correct results from seven Premier League games, with one perfect score.
His score of five points saw him beat WWE wrestling star Wade 'Bad News' Barrett, who picked two results, with no perfect scores. That gave him a total of two points.
Barrett is joint bottom of the guest leaderboard but will have a chance to improve his score on Tuesday when Liverpool travel to Hull for their game which was postponed because the Reds were playing in the FA Cup.
Lawro and Barrett both correctly predicted that Arsenal would reach the FA Cup final, but they both wrongly thought Liverpool would beat Aston Villa. Those results do not count towards their weekly totals.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
