Cardiff have signed Kenneth Zohore on loan from Belgian club KV Kortrijk, which also owned by Vincent Tan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff can only make loan signings and pay them up to £10,000 a week under the terms of their transfer embargo.
They say signing the Denmark Under-21 striker, who joined Kortrijk from Danish side OB Odense on Monday, meets Football League rules.
Cardiff want to offload forwards Alex Revell and Federico Macheda by the time the transfer window shuts on Monday.
Zohore, 21, underwent a medical with the Championship club after finalising his transfer to Belgium.
Malaysian businessman Tan owns the Bluebirds, Kortrijk and Bosnian club FK Sarajevo.
A Football League spokesman said: "From the information made available to the Football League, so far, we are satisfied that there isn't any evidence to suggest this transaction is being designed to circumvent the club's Financial Fair Play embargo and that it is consistent with how clubs in common ownership generally operate.
"Common ownership of a number of clubs by a single ownership vehicle is not uncommon in world football, with the success of the Pozzo family whose clubs include Watford being the most prominent current example."
Zohore's arrival follows the departure of striker Joe Mason to Wolves for a fee thought to be around £3.5m.
He started with Copenhagen before moving on to Fiorentina in Italy and then had loan spells at Brondby and Swedish club Gothenburg.
He joined Danish Superliga club OB in February 2015 and has scored seven goals in 16 appearances.
Zohore's father is the second cousin of former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba.
