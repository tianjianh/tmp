[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teresa MacTavish, 67, died in the blaze in Kinninmonth Street, Kirkcaldy. Emergency services were called to the fire at 01:51.
They said the flat was heavily smoke-logged when they arrived at the scene. At least 15 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was extinguished at 02:17.
Inquiries into the fire are continuing, but there appear to be no suspicious circumstances.
Alex Smart, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: "The loss of life through fire in the home is utterly devastating and the thoughts of everyone are with those in this tragedy.
"This tragic loss of life must always bring home the importance of working together to prevent fires and raise awareness of how to be safer from the risk of fire in the home."
