The six-year-old girls were "touched inappropriately" by a man at a playground in the theme park in Windsor, Berkshire on August 11.
One of the parents said she had not expected an adult to be inside the pirate-themed Castaway Camp play area.
Thames Valley Police released an e-fit of a suspect last month.
A reconstruction will be broadcast on BBC One's Crimewatch at 21:00 BST, followed by a police appeal.
The assaults happened between 12:15 BST and 12:30 in the Pirate Shores area of the attraction on a day when about 14,200 attended the theme park.
One of the mothers told the programme: "I wasn't concerned about them being in there, I was concerned with one of them running out and getting lost."
"You just wouldn't even think that there was an adult in there."
The other mother said: "They did a bucket and spade list of what they wanted to do in the summer holidays, Legoland was on the bucket and spade list."
A man in his 20s, from Bracknell, was arrested on suspicion of sexually assault but was released without charge on 31 August.
