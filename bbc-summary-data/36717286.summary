Four members of a so-called Islamic State cell dismantled in the Belgian town of Verviers last year have been jailed for between eight and 16 years.

Prosecutors said the men were in constant contact with IS in Syria through Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the leader of the attacks in Paris last November.
He was killed in a shootout in Paris days after the attacks in which 130 people were murdered.
The Verviers cell was planning an attack in Belgium, prosecutors said.
Molenbeek's gangster jihadists
"The cell in Verviers aimed for the bloodiest possible attacks using bombs and automatic weapons," Judge Pierre Hendrickx said.
"For Abaaoud and the Verviers cell, the airport at Zaventem constituted a target," he added.
The airport was eventually targeted in March by militants who were also connected to Abaaoud. Two men detonated suicide vests, killing 17 people.
What we know about the Brussels attacks
Who were the victims?
Marouane El Bali, Souhaib El Abdi and Mohamed Arshad were charged with forming a terror organisation and given 16 years. Omar Damache was jailed for eight years on the same charge.
The men had returned from fighting with IS in Syria and a cache of explosives and weapons was found in the building where they lived, prosecutors said.
Paris and Brussels bombers' links uncovered
Two other men, Sofiane Amghar and Khalid Ben Larbi - who were killed in the Verviers raid - had also travelled to Syria.
A total of 16 suspects were charged in connection with the raid last January, but nine remain on the run.
The raid came a week after jihadists attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, killing 12 people.
