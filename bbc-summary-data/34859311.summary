The 15-year-old, from Measham, has not been seen since about 18:00 GMT on Friday when she was dropped off outside Ibstock Community College.
Police said the find of the teenager's mobile phone and belongings, alongside other information had led them to believe she has been killed.
Two men, aged 27 and 28, have been re-arrested on suspicion of murder.
More updates on this and other stories from Leicestershire.
Det Ch Supt David Sandall said: "Since we started looking for her we have found her mobile phone in Melbourne Road, Ibstock and items of clothing which we believe are hers in the Ibstock and Diseworth areas.
"In all the circumstances, we fear the worst and have told her family to prepare themselves that we are now treating her disappearance as a murder enquiry.
"We have become increasingly concerned for Kayleigh's safety as the hours have passed since she was dropped off by her dad on Friday evening.
"Five days on, we've heard nothing from her, and this is completely out of character."
Leicestershire Police has searched several locations including Sence Valley Forest Park, Ibstock and a field off Ashby Road, in Belton, Leicestershire.
Mr Sandall said: "The park has been cordoned off and is likely to remain so for some days yet while we conduct a thorough search of the area looking for her.
"A number of other locations are currently being searched, including an area in Belton and Diseworth."
The two men were arrested on Monday on suspicion of kidnap and have now been re-arrested on suspicion of murder.
They remain in police custody for further questioning.
Mr Sandall has urged anyone who was in the Diseworth or Belton areas between Saturday afternoon and Monday morning to contact them.
