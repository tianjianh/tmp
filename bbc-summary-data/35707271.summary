Tests on human foot found in Bath park 'inconclusive'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tests on a human foot found in a park in Bath have failed to identify who it belonged to.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The foot, severed just above the ankle, was discovered in Weston Park East near Royal United Hospital last month.
Forensic tests carried out on the body part were "inconclusive", Avon and Somerset Police said.
Detectives say the foot- believed to have belonged to a man - is not being linked to any crime or missing person report.
The body part was discovered in undergrowth by a member of the public on 19 February.
Det Insp Paul Catton described it as a "complex and unusual investigation".
"There are indications it was a man's foot but we have not been able to take a full DNA sample so we can't be sure," he said.
"There is no other damage and we can say for certain the foot has not been separated from the leg due to some sort of impact."
Further tests will be carried out to determine its origin.
