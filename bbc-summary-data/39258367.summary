'Taliban-fleeing' teen fears Afghanistan deportation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An apprentice builder who fled to the UK from Afghanistan when his grandfather was killed by the Taliban says he now fears he will be deported.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walid Durani arrived in Hampshire when he was 14. His sister also lives in the area but his parents now live in Austria with the rest of his family.
Since turning 18 he said he has been told he must return to Afghanistan, where he knows no-one.
The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases.
Mr Durani, who has a job with a building firm in Fleet and was highly commended in last year's Young Builder of the Year Awards, said the worry was causing him sleepless nights.
"I just wake up, sweating," he said.
"It's quite difficult to think about leaving here. I have friends, family, I have a job. I have never claimed any benefit, I have always worked."
Mr Durani, now 19, said his grandfather was beheaded by the Taliban and his father was also kidnapped by the group for a time, so his mother and grandmother sent him to the UK with his sister.
He added he was being threatened with deportation because he could not prove what happened to his family.
"Everything is going absolutely perfect here, it's just my visa has run out," he said.
"In Afghanistan I don't have anyone and they want me to go back, but I don't know where I should go."
Mr Durani's employer Ruth Beach said: "It's just so wrong. He's been to school here, college, he's worked so hard.
"He's got a National Insurance number, he pays tax, he's got a British driving licence, all his friends are here and he is so deserving to stay."
His colleague Cameron Beach described the situation as "ludicrous".
"This is his home. Where he was before, that isn't a home."
