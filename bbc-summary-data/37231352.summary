The Real Madrid forward, 27, scored three goals as Wales made the semi-finals, their first appearance at a major tournament in 58 years.
Wales' bid to reach the 2018 World Cup in Russia begins against Moldova in Cardiff on Monday 5 September.
"It's great to be back together again," Bale said.
"It doesn't feel too long ago we were finishing the Euros but we've got that out of our system and we're fully focused on the campaign ahead."

The Wales squad are together for the first time since Euro 2016 ahead of the qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium.
Bale says there is a feel-good factor in Welsh football because of the team's exploits in France as well as the fact Cardiff's Principality Stadium is hosting the 2017 Champions League final next June.
Cardiff-born Bale is a two-time European winner and is aiming to help Real defend a title they won against Atletico Madrid in May.
"Welsh football is growing on every level, whether it's us as a team or as a country hosting big events," Bale said.
"It's exciting times for us all and we all look forward to it.
"I played the [2014 European] Super Cup in Cardiff before and it was an amazing experience to have my friends and family close by.
"I suppose there's a little more motivation if there needs to be any more and we'll be trying to make history in Cardiff."
