[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The big move during January in League Two was the sale by Arbroath of top scorer Simon Murray to Dundee United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But the 22-year-old striker was not lost to the Red Lichties' promotion bid as United loaned him back until the end of the season and the extra cash has allowed manager Allan Moore to strengthen their squad with several loan signings.
The other main mover during January was Clyde boss Barry Ferguson, with the former Rangers and Scotland continuing to reshape his squad in an attempt to revive the Bully Wee's promotion hopes.
Montrose parted company with manager George Shields in February.
