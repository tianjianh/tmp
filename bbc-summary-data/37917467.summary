Witnesses said the polling station in Azusa, about 40km (25 miles) east of Los Angeles, was put on "lockdown" after shots were heard.
Police called to the scene exchanged gunfire with the attacker.
A female suspect with an automatic assault rifle has not been apprehended so far but the area is "contained", a police spokesperson said.
Unconfirmed reports suggest a second, male suspect is in the area.
An eyewitness told the Los Angeles Times he had seen "a heavily armed man" fire at least 10 rounds at people before retreating into a house.
Acting chief of police Captain Steve Hunt said the incident appeared to be focused in the residential area, rather than on the polling station itself.
Nearby buildings have been evacuated.
The Azusa Police department said one victim was dead and two were taken to hospital in critical condition.
