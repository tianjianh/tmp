'Good progress' in ScotRail talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Train drivers' union Aslef and the owners of ScotRail have said good progress has been made in talks over pay and conditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The talks were called in a bid to resolve an industrial dispute which has hit Sunday services.
They follow moves by Aslef to ballot its members for industrial action from next month.
The dispute centres around plans by ScotRail franchise holders Abellio to introduce a seven-day rota for drivers.
Currently drivers work a six-day week, with Sundays classed as overtime.
The union has said it does not object to the plans, but wants to see drivers given a pay rise for the extra work.
About a third of ScotRail's trains were cancelled on Sunday after drivers refused to work overtime.
Aslef has warned that industrial action could start as early as 17 August, if no settlement can be reached and members back action.
The talks are due to continue on Wednesday.
