Nativity Mary gives birth in Devon lay-by

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pub landlady who played Mary in a village nativity has given birth - not in a stable, but in a lay-by.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tess Baker, 35, of the Millbrook Inn at South Pool, Devon, was nine months pregnant when she played Mary.
But unlike the virgin birth, Mrs Baker's baby daughter Lola was born next to the A379 at Ermington on the way to hospital on New Year's Eve.
"We had a huge party the next day," said husband Charlie, 33.

Many in the village had jokingly expressed their hope Mrs Baker would give birth during its nativity play, echoing the famous Vicar of Dibley TV episode.
But it was not until 12 days later, at about 04:00 GMT on New Year's Eve, she went into labour.
Mrs Baker had hoped to have a home birth, but after seven hours' labour midwives ordered an ambulance to take her to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.
About half way to the hospital, they told the driver to get into the nearest lay-by.
"It was quite dramatic and not what we expected," said husband Charlie, who helped the midwives and ambulance crew with the birth of Lola Misty Blue, weighing 7lb 8oz.
"Mother and baby were checked over and we were driven home."
Lola is the couple's second daughter after Juno, who is two.
Mr Baker added: "Lots of locals suggested we call her lay-by, but that would have been over the top.
"Nevertheless it will be quite special for us every time we go down that road."
