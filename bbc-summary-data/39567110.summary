[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old's contract was not due to expire until the end of this season, but Robson wanted to be released early.
Robson said: "I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Leicestershire but have decided to take on a new challenge at this stage of my career."
He scored 2,995 first-class runs at an average of 31.52 in 53 appearances, hitting a career-best score of 120 against Essex at Chelmsford in 2015.
Chief executive Wasim Khan said they were "disappointed" to see Robson move on.
He added: "We have a big squad and fully understand that he wants to have an opportunity to start a new cricketing chapter in his life."
Leicestershire lost their opening Division Two County Championship match of the season to East Midlands rivals Nottinghamshire by 10 wickets.
