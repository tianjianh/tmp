Junior doctor deal: Which side has won?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After months of deadlock, five strikes, including the first-ever all-out stoppage, and thousands of postponed operations, the government and British Medical Association have finally reached an agreement on a new contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vast swathes of the old deal will now have to be re-written. So how are things changing?
The deal ministers had said they were imposing included an average hike in basic pay of 13.5%.
Under the terms published on Wednesday that will be reduced to between 10% and 11%.
Night-shift pay is also being reduced from 50% extra to 37%.
Clearly both of these represent a saving for the government but it has left more money to be distributed elsewhere.
Those working one in two weekends will get an extra 10% on top of their salary. The supplement then reduces as the frequency of weekends drop, down to 3% for one in seven.
Those doing one in eight or fewer get nothing for working Saturday or Sunday.
That compares to Saturday evening work and all-day Sunday attracting a premium payment under the terms which were to have been imposed.
Add to that the 8% extra doctors will now get if they do on-call duties - most of them - and the BMA are happy that unsocial hours are being properly rewarded.
One of the major criticisms of the original deal is that it unfairly penalised women. The guaranteed pay rises doctors currently get was to be replaced by a system whereby pay is linked to achieving certain levels of training.
But if doctors take time out, such as women on maternity leave, or move to part-time work such grades take longer to reach.
To mitigate against this, the government has agreed to pay for extra support to help people in this position to catch up.
Doctors wanting to work extra hours as a locum (a lucrative sideline) will now have to give first refusal to the NHS. Rates of pay for that are being improved to 22% above their normal rate, but that should still represent a saving to the health service as private agencies charge much more.
Some doctors may be unhappy with this restriction. But most will be pleased with other changes. When doctors work extra hours beyond their shift (as many do) there will be a formal mechanism to make sure they are appropriately rewarded or able to take time off in lieu.
Junior doctor oversight and involvement in the work of the independent guardian is also being strengthened.
Neither side, of course. The art of any Acas mediation is to ensure both sides get some of what they want.  It is why Sir David Dalton, the boss of Salford Hospital brought in to negotiate with the BMA, has called it a "score-draw".
Another telling sign is that the deal agreed remains cost-neutral, ministers are not putting extra money in beyond that which they had already planned to.
The BMA feels it has got a better system for rewarding those who work weekends frequently, while the government believes increasing weekend cover will now be more affordable.
The big question now is whether this will be enough to persuade the BMA membership. More than 40,000 junior doctors will be asked to vote on the deal in June. If they agree to it, and this dispute finally comes to an end, you could say the patient is the winner.
