DF Concerts said the stage had also been repositioned and announced an increase in security for the 2016 event.
The three-day festival was held in the grounds of Strathallan Castle for the first time in 2015.
The new site has been opposed by some locals and wildlife groups.
However, Perth and Kinross Council finally approved the plans in May 2015, just weeks before the event.
The  revamp was announced after a "thorough multi-agency debrief" and feedback from fans, concert organisers said.
Additional land has been secured to increase the size of the main arena, with the Main Stage, Radio 1 Stage, King Tut's Wah Wah Hut Tent and the Slam Tent all being moved to new areas.
The extra room and new layout is designed to cut down on congestion and bottlenecks, as well as giving fans more space to move around.
Geoff Ellis, festival director and chief executive officer of DF Concerts and Events, said: "Our fans are our number one priority and we've listened to all of their feedback from last year and now we're putting that into action.
"These changes will ensure that watching the wide array of amazing artists at the stages, as well as moving around the main arena, will be much more comfortable and a positive experience for all fans, ultimately making T in the Park 2016 a year to remember for all the right reasons - brilliant music and outstanding entertainment enjoyed with your best mates."
