Dagmara Przybysz, originally from Poland, was found at Pool Academy in Redruth, Cornwall on Tuesday.
The event was organised on social media by her friends, many of them wearing red which was Dagmara's favourite colour.
One girl who spoke at the event said: "She was the girl who was always there for everyone else no matter what."
Debora Reeve, deputy mayor of Redruth, said: "I think it's a testament to them that they have managed to organise this at such short notice."
Devon and Cornwall Police are not treating the death as suspicious.
Dagmara was described by the school as a "beautiful, bright and creative 16-year-old student with a very promising future ahead of her".
Police are preparing a report for the coroner.
