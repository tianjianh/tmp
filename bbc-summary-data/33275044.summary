Drinkers over-50 who do not think they have a problem are being targeted in a £5m project.

The charity Drink Wise, Age Well will attempt to engage with the "hidden population" of drinkers in Cwm Taf via their GPs and roadshows.
Doctors can refer patients, who they think consume too much alcohol, to the group.
Women should not drink more than three small glasses of wine a day and men no more than four, the NHS says.
The charity provides group therapy, group activities and a counselling service.
Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were chosen by the project, financed by the Big Lottery Fund, because of its high rate of alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions.
The project's Richard Broadway said: "People over 50 find themselves drinking more than the recommended guidelines for a number of reasons.
"They might be drinking at home alone or with one other person."
The scheme's roadshow will be in Maerdy community centre on Monday, Nazareth House day centre, Williamstown, Tonypandy on Tuesday, Soar in Merthyr Tydfil on Wednesday and Abercwmboi rugby club in Aberdare on Thursday.
Katrina Williams, 53, from Merthyr Tydfil, began drinking heavily at 18 when her baby died from cot death and worsened when her husband died of a heart attack 14 years ago.
At her lowest point she was drinking 10 pints of cider a day.
She said: "I never considered myself to be an alcoholic because I still went to work every day."
Since getting help from Treatment and Education Drug Services (TEDS) she tries to have four nights off drinking a week.
She said: "I don't want to stop drinking altogether. I'd just like to be able to go and out get merry and enjoy myself."
Retired deputy head Alun Parry, 65, from Merthyr Tydfil, referred himself to Drugaid Wales five years ago when he ended up drinking on a park bench and getting arrested.
"I would pick up a glass of wine instead of a cup of tea," he said.
Mr Parry is now involved in the running of the project.
Mother-of-three Beth Evans, 55, from Aberdare, started drinking daily when she divorced in 2006.
The former nurse said it spiralled from a few drinks at home after work to four bottles of wine a day.
"Eventually my children reported me to social services because they were worried I'd end up dead," she said.
Ms Evans has not had a drink since May and is receiving counselling.
