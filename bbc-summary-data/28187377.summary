Netherlands boss Van Gaal, who replaced David Moyes at United, is preparing for Wednesday's semi-final with Argentina.
Assistant manager Giggs will be helped by Marcel Bout and new assistant coach Albert Stuivenberg.
Stuivenberg, most recently coach of Netherlands Under-21s, was added to Van Gaal's coaching team on Sunday.
Bout, also an assistant coach, joined United's backroom staff when Van Gaal was appointed in May.
Van Gaal, 62, has been in regular contact with Giggs, who had a spell in charge last season before ending his 22-season playing career.
He plans to be present for the start of a five-match tour of the United States on 18 July, just five days after the World Cup final.
Netherlands face Argentina in Sao Paulo on Wednesday having beaten Costa Rica on penalties in the quarter-finals after Van Gaal successfully introduced goalkeeper Tim Krul as a last-minute substitute.
New signing Ander Herrera will be among the players at United's training ground on Monday after his Â£29m move from Athletic Bilbao.
