The drugs were found packed inside 30 suitcases on 11 September, but the operation was revealed on Saturday.
France's Interior minister, Manuel Valls, said it was the biggest drug haul ever made in the Paris area.
Six people were arrested, accused of being members of an international drug smuggling ring, Mr Valls said.
Officials say they believe the drugs were meant for sale in France and had a street value of 200m euros (Â£169m; $270m).
The Air France flight came from Caracas.
The suitcases with the cocaine reportedly were not registered to any of the passengers.
