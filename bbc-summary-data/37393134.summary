Morecambe 2-3 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Adi Yussuf was the star of the show as he inspired Crawley to an exciting 3-2 victory at Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yussuf scored one and made two more despite only coming off the bench just after the hour mark in a game that came to life with five goals in the last 20 minutes.
The frontman broke the deadlock when he scored just seconds after coming off the bench with a cool finish after the ball fell perfectly into his path after Kaby Djalo's shot had been blocked.
Yussuf then turned provider seven minutes from time when he ran down the ball on the right-hand byline and pulled it back to tee up James Collins to double the Reds' advantage from 12 yards out.
The home side gave themselves hope when they pulled one back two minutes from time when Michael Rose curled a superb free-kick around the Crawley wall from 20 yards out to beat Glenn Morris low to his right-hand side.
But the visitors restored their two-goal advantage moments later when Yussuf once again provided the telling pullback to tee up midfielder Jim Smith to stroke the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the Morecambe goal.
There was still more to come, however, as Morecambe scored a second two minutes into stoppage time, when Cole Stockton volleyed superbly past Morris from the edge of the area.
Kevin Ellison almost snatched a dramatic leveller four minutes into stoppage time but his shot was superbly blocked on the line.
