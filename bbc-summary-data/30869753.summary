Patrick McIntosh, a chartered financial adviser from Surrey, reached the pole on Saturday on the anniversary of Captain Scott's 1912 expedition.
He travelled with polar explorer Conrad Dickinson from Hexham, who led Prince Harry and his team on Walking With The Wounded in 2013.
After reaching the pole, Mr McIntosh said he felt like "a million dollars".
He decided to take on the gruelling 138-mile (222km) trek after battling three types of cancer over a 13-month period in 2012-13.
The reason behind the expedition was to get people "thinking and talking about their health and reacting quickly to any symptoms" and to raise Â£222,000 for charities Bowel Cancer UK, Prostate Cancer UK and the Voice Of The Listener And The Viewer.
Mr McIntosh said the best part of the expedition was "to have had absolutely no malfunctions in my body whatsoever".
"I don't feel as if I've done anything for the last 11 days and yet I know I've been through the most unbelievable ordeal," he added.
The pair reached the South Pole unsupported, meaning they carried all supplies and equipment with them.
Mr McIntosh's granddaughter, Gemma Barker, said: "They arrived at 7pm our time, they're both fine, and Patrick sounds on cloud nine. He's so excited to have arrived and is very happy with what he has achieved.
"They've already had a cup of tea."
