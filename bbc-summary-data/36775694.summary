The outcome of the tie looks to be already decided going into next Tuesday's second leg in Denmark.
The Irish Premiership champions made a lively start and Declan Caddell headed over from Richard Clarke's cross.
The hosts created a number of further chances in the second half, with Gavin Whyte going close and substitute David Cushley posing a real threat in his first competitive appearance for Stephen Baxter's side.
The former Ballymena United forward forced Robin Olsen into a fingertip save with a half-volley, then fired over and also brought another fine stop from the visiting keeper with a late effort.
Santander could have scored another after the break but Sean O'Neill saved well.
Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter: "We were up against top European opposition littered with internationals of really high quality.
"Having said that, we competed in the game, created a number of chances against a really good team and asked their keeper to make a couple of smart saves.
"We were under a lot of pressure, as we knew we would be, but from our perspective we gained a lot in terms of fitness and our tactical approach to a lot of things."
