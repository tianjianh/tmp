Oldham's best effort came when Connor Brown's drive had to be turned round the post by Chesterfield's Tommy Lee.
The Spireites created their best chance in the 82nd minute, but Armand Gnanduillet blazed over from close range after a Sam Clucas flick came back off the post.
Oldham hung on to record their third straight draw, and remain in 14th.
Oldham manager Dean Holden told BBC Radio Manchester:

"You just take each game as it comes, I'm quite calm about it. I think what you don't want to do is get all emotional and make rash decisions.
"For me, it's about remaining calm and there's a staff behind me that have all pulled together and in one direction and we're working every single day to prepare the players properly.
"Whether I'm going to be here next season, or whether I'm not, for me doesn't come into it. I'm giving it everything everyday, as is everybody.
"If the chairman decides to offer me the job, then we'll have a conversation. But I'll control what I'm in control of which is, you know, remaining focused on the next game "
