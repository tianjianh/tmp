The blaze started in Ross Walk, near Abbey Park, in the Belgrave area of the city at about 14:00 GMT.
Leicestershire Police have asked people to avoid the area and told residents to keep windows and doors shut.
Eyewitness Roy Rollings, a local parish councillor, said he could hear "loud bangs" and homes had been evacuated nearby.
Fire crews are taking water from the canal help tackle the flames and dozens of onlookers have been moved on by police due to "toxic" smoke.
Ronak Jason Kamat, who lives in the Wolsey Building in Abbey Park Street, told the BBC he was having lunch when the blaze started.
He said: "We watched from the window for a while - at the time all we could see was plumes of smoke. But things soon escalated and as more and flames became visible.
"I was metres away from the fireman in one of the service yards outside and watched as they desperately tried to put the raging fire out."
About 140 people have been evacuated from their homes in Westbourne Street and Kensington Street, and the Belgrave Neighbourhood Centre has been prepared as a refuge.
Abbey Park Street, Olphin Street, Moorgate Street, Westbourne Street, Kensington Street and Marjorie Street have all been closed by police.
There have been no reports of any injuries, the force said.
Leicestershire Fire and Rescue said 12 appliances, two aerial ladder platforms and six water jets had been used to fight the fire.
Smoke could be seen from Bradgate Park, about five miles [8 km] away.
