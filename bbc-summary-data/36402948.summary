[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Father-of-two Andrew Phillips suffered severe head injuries on the first night in the resort town of Magaluf.
He fell from a first floor apartment on Wednesday and was found by staff on the hotel lawn.
Family members have flown out to be with him at hospital in Palma.
His mother Joanne Phillips said the injuries were "serious" but not life-threatening.
"He's in an induced coma and has multiple fractures. It's his head and face - his body is fine.
"As soon as it happened his friend phoned his dad who phoned me. I was in shock with it all. It's not something you expect to hear."
Civil Guard officers are probing the incident but say there is nothing at this stage to indicate any crime has taken place.
