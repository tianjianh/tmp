The batsman, 29, stood down from the national team last year to pursue a career in property investment.
But Mommsen has agreed to use his annual leave entitlement to take part in the matches on 11 and 13 June.
Scotland also face Namibia in the four-day Intercontinental Cup match on 6 June, but Mommsen will not feature.
Cricket Scotland said in a statement: "After announcing his retirement from international cricket in late 2016, Preston Mommsen's inclusion for the WCL fixtures confirms the selectors' view that he is still considered one of Scotland's leading international batsmen.
"Mommsen, who still holds a burning ambition to be part of the Scotland set-up, is now working full-time but has taken leave to represent his country once more. Mommsen has been in fine early-season form for his club side Grange and has been training regularly with the national coaches."
Kyle Coetzer, who succeeded Mommsen as skipper, will lead the side with Con de Lange named as vice-captain.
The I-Cup meeting takes place at Ayr Cricket Club, while Edinburgh's Grange hosts the two WCL matches.
Scotland head coach Grant Bradburn added: "The team are looking forward to this block of international cricket at home throughout June.
"Preparation over the winter and early part of the summer has been excellent and the players are now itching to play. The I-Cup is a format we value highly, however we have had limited actual game time as 11 of our 16 days of I-Cup cricket during this three-year cycle have been washed out.
"We look forward to our opening contest against Namibia in Ayr, where the conditions normally offer something for every skill-set."
Scotland I-Cup squad: Kyle Coetzer (captain), Con de Lange (vice-captain), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross, Alasdair Evans, Safyaan Sharif, Michael Leask, Calum MacLeod, Mark Watt, George Munsey, Craig Wallace, Chris Sole, Stuart Whittingham.
Scotland WCL squad: Kyle Coetzer (captain), Con de Lange (vice-captain), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross, Alasdair Evans, Safyaan Sharif, Michael Leask, Preston Mommsen, Calum MacLeod, Mark Watt, George Munsey, Craig Wallace, Chris Sole, Stuart Whittingham.
