Investigators are trying to determine what killed two people and made five others sick, including four police officers, inside a home near Chicago.

Four police officers entered the home in Des Plaines, Illinois, on Thursday after someone called emergency services asking for help.
Inside the suburban house, they found two men dead and a woman seriously ill.
But after a few minutes inside, the officers fell ill, complaining of breathing problems.
Officials cordoned off the home and sent in teams in protective Hazmat suits to test the air and water inside the home, but could not determine the cause.
"They didn't find anything in particular, but they were able to rule out anything that was bad," Rick Dobrowski, chief of North Maine Fire Protection District, told Chicago TV station WMAQ.
"They were also able to test the water that they found to make sure there was nothing mixed, chemical wise."
Police later named the victims as Hong K Kim, 53, and John Tae Kim, 83.
The woman is in a critical condition at a local hospital. The officers were treated and released.
