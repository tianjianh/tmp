A motorist launched a foul-mouthed verbal assault on BBC presenter Jeremy Vine as he cycled down a west London street.

The Radio 2 presenter was riding home on Friday after hosting his show when the driver tailgated him, beeping her horn.
He paused and she got out, shouting at him to "get... out the road" and appearing to kick his bike.
The incident has been reported to the Metropolitan Police.
Posting a video of the encounter on Facebook [warning: this video contains language that may offend], Vine invited viewers to "see what you think".
"I hate to overload our hard-working London police with footage from my commute, but I feel the person you see on the tape will at some point hurt someone very badly - either with her car or in a direct personal assault," Vine wrote.
A police spokesperson could not confirm whether it was being investigated.
The incident took place in a narrow street in Kensington after the black Vauxhall drove close behind Vine, beeping her horn.
"Concerned this motorist may be dangerous, I slow to explain," Vine captioned the video.
She yelled: "Why would you do that?"
"There's got to be a car's width," he replied.
Getting out of her car, she kicks out, telling Vine to "get ... out the road.
"I could be done for murder."
After passing him, she again got out of the car at a junction, warning Vine she would "knock you out... if you take a picture of my car again" and apparently making the shape of a gun with her hand.
"Wow. A gun. It's not appropriate," responded Vine.
The woman then drove off.
Vine has declined to comment further, saying the incident is now in the hands of the police.
