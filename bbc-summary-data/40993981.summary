World number 27 Brecel hit breaks of 110, 103, 81 and 57 to secure victory.
He will face Li Hang, after the home favourite defeated Mark Williams 5-3 in Guangzhou.
Shaun Murphy beat China's Zhou Yuelong 5-2 to set up a last-four match against Ali Carter, who defeated Fergal O'Brien by the same score.
Delighted Brecel said: "It was unbelievable. Against most players you think you can come back from 4-1 down, but against Ronnie you don't fancy it because he is so good.
"When I made a century I started believing again. I kept really cool and made some good breaks."
