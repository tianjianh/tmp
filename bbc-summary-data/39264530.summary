Steve Dyer was admitted to a hospice on Friday, prompting messages of support from fans and club chairman Darryl Eales.
The 59-year-old was given four months to live when he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in November 2015.
Now the club has given Mr Dyer the number 12 shirt on the official squad list in the match programme.
Mr Eales added: "It is a story that has touched everyone.
"Steve is such a positive person and is fighting so hard. He is part of the club and we want to show him that he is in our thoughts every week."
The former Oxford resident moved to New Hampshire in the United States in 1986.
He flew back to the UK to watch the U's play at Wembley in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final last April and was invited to meet the team.
Last year, Mr Dyer donated two Oxford United season tickets to the Helen and Douglas House hospice.
Oxford will return to Wembley on 2 April for the Checkatrade Trophy Final against Coventry City.
