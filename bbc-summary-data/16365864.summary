Veteran Fred Reynolds in fresh call for WWII Arctic convoy medals

A Sussex war veteran has made a fresh call for sailors on the WWII Arctic convoys to be awarded military medals.

Fred Reynolds, of Haywards Heath, said the government should have acted sooner to honour those who risked their lives.
A year ago, Prime Minister David Cameron, said the veterans should get medals and the issue was referred to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
An MoD spokeswoman said an independent review into the rules governing military medals would start soon.
The Arctic convoys transported four million tons of crucial supplies and munitions to Russia between 1941 and 1945 to fight off Hitler's advances.
In 2005 an arctic badge was awarded to the veterans but they say that does not go far enough.
Caroline Dineage, the Conservative MP for Gosport, is backing the veterans' campaign.
She said: "I think this is our way of saying 'we recognise that you suffered the most unimaginable hardships in order to keep this country safe'."
