She was thrown on to metal railings and was taken to a hospital, where she later died.
An initial investigation showed her seatbelt had broken and a passenger safety bar did not fit tightly enough at the Chaohua Park near the city of Chongqing.
The "Travel Through Space" ride was inspected in December, reports said.

The West China Metropolis Daily reported on Sunday that the girl's family had reached a compensation agreement with the park for their only child's death amounting to 870,000 yuan ($127,000; Â£100,000).
China's safety regulator said it had asked Chongqing authorities to suspend all the park's big rides for checks to be carried out.
It also ordered other companies operating the same ride to stop using it and contact its manufacturer in the city of Chengdu for further checks.
