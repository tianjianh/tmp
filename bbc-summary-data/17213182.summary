[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Celtic manager, Neil Lennon, has been back at Windsor Park in Belfast for the first time in 10 years.

He was a spectator at the Northern Ireland international friendly against Norway on Wednesday night.
Lennon was booed by home fans in one of the last games he played there for his country in 2001.
But he said those days were in the past.
"Those days are long gone," he said.
"It's completely incidental now. I haven't actually been here at Windsor Park but I've done my coaching badges through the IFA.
"And I've been in Belfast the last consecutive years three or four times, on really good courses, I've learned a lot, which has stood me in good stead for what I'm doing now."
Thursday's visit marked his first return to the ground since he quit international football.
The Lurgan man was there to watch Northern Ireland's Celtic players Pat McCourt and Niall McGinn and Celtic's Norwegian player Thomas Rogne.
Norway beat Northern Ireland 3-0.
