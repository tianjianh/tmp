Flamini, 32, left the Gunners this summer having made 246 appearances over two spells and winning three FA Cups.
The Frenchman, who also won the Serie A title in 2011 during five years at AC Milan, is Palace's fifth permanent signing of the summer.
Meanwhile, loan signing Loic Remy has been ruled out for a number of weeks with an ankle injury.
The 29-year-old joined from Chelsea on 30 August and has now returned to the Blues for treatment.
On Flamini, Palace manager Alan Pardew said he was pleased to "have secured a player of his stature", adding: "His playing ability will help us but also his leadership qualities and his ability of how to win games in a passing style."
Flamini described his new club as "very ambitious" and said the move was a "very interesting challenge".
The Eagles signed Andros Townsend, Steve Mandanda, James Tomkins, and Christian Benteke earlier this summer.
