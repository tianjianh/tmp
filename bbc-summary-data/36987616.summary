German Shepherd Nero jumped over railings in Watford which, unknown to his handler, had a 12ft (3.5m) drop on the other side.
PC Clive Warncken said he was delighted to have Nero back and he was "doing well and was comfortable".
An X-ray released by the vet who treated the dog showed the extent of his injuries - two clear fractures.
Nero was with PC Warncken, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire dog unit, when the accident happened in the early hours of Thursday 21 July.
He had been called in to track four people suspected of assaulting a woman.
PC Warncken said Nero was not used to resting.
"I suspect he might be a bit frustrated as he's used to being so active, but I will ensure he receives the rest he needs," he said.
Surgeon Liz Tilson, from The Roebuck Veterinary Group, said Nero arrived with "severe neck pain and weakness in his hind legs".
"X-rays revealed that he had fractured two vertebrae in his neck," she said.
He was kept at the surgery's Stevenage hospital for a week for pain relief and rest and has so far responded well to treatment and been incredibly brave, she said.
