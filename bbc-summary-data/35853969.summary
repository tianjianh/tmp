Liverpool's Siobhan Chamberlain kept Toni Duggan and Jane Ross out early.
Stanway, 17, found the top corner with a fine long-range shot on the half-hour, having earlier replaced injured England midfielder Isobel Christiansen.
Nikita Parris then headed home from a Duggan corner as Scott Rogers' reign as Liverpool boss started with defeat.
The remaining seven fifth-round ties will be played on Sunday.
