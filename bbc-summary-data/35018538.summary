The Ospreys fly-half succeeds cyclist Geraint Thomas, who won in 2014.
Results of a public vote were revealed at the Wales Sport Awards in Cardiff where BBC Cymru Wales and Sport Wales celebrated Welsh sporting success.
The Wales football team were named team of the year award after qualifying for the Euro 2016 finals and their manager Chris Coleman is the elite coach of the year.
Biggar reacted to the award by saying: "I'm so thrilled to bits that enough people voted.

"I'm very, very privileged to receive this and thank you everyone for voting.
"There are some great names on there and it's scary to think that mine name is on there with them.
"It doesn't feel right but I'm very, very pleased."
Biggar gave outstanding performances for Wales during the Rugby World Cup, the Six Nations and for regional side Ospreys.
The 26-year-old scored 23 points in a man-of-the-match performance in the 28-25 win over England in the pool stage at the World Cup, including a long-range winning penalty.
In total he scored 56 points in four matches as Wales were knocked out in the quarter-finals against South Africa.
In the 2015 Six Nations, he scored 26 points in five games as Wales missed out on the Championship on points difference with four wins from five. He also helped Ospreys to the semi-finals in the Pro12.
Biggar secured the public vote ahead of second-placed Geraint Thomas and world featherweight boxing champion Lee Selby.
Thomas became the first British rider to win the formidable E3 Harelbeke race in Belgium in March and as a key member of Team Sky helped Chris Froome claim his second Tour de France title.
Selby became the 12th Welsh world boxing champion by beating Russia's Evgeny Gradovich to claim the IBF featherweight title and defended his crown against Mexican Fernando Montiel in the USA.
The other nominees chosen by an expert panel for BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality 2015 had been footballers Gareth Bale and Ashley Williams, triathlete Non Stanford, taekwondo competitor Jade Jones and para-athlete Aled Sion Davies.
Wales' footballers ended a 57-year wait when they qualified for the final stages of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.
Under manager Coleman, and inspired by on the field by Bale, Wales finished second behind Belgium in their qualifying group.
Legendary rugby player Sir Gareth Edwards received a lifetime achievement award.
Edwards played 53 consecutive Test matches for Wales between 1967 and 1978, winning three Five Nations Grand Slams.
He inspired the British and Irish Lions to Test series wins against New Zealand in 1971 and South Africa in 1974 and scored the most famous try in history for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973.
The Carwyn James Award for the best young sportswoman was won by sprinter Hannah Brier. The 17-year-old Swansea Harrier won the 100m and 200m at the 2015 Welsh Championships and then equalled the Welsh 100m record of 11.39 seconds at the World Youth Championships.
The best young sportsman award went to tennis player Matt Story, who won the Welsh National Junior Championship Under-18 title for the third year in a row.
