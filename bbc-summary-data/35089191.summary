Levi Nelson hit the corner of the Belfast net to put the hosts ahead late in the first period.
Guillaume Desbiens finished a fine passing move to make it 2-0 early in the third quarter before Kris Beech struck to give the Giants hope.
Cullen Eddy sealed the Sheffield win as the Giants failed to follow up Saturday's victory over Manchester.
Beech deflected in from a Mitch Ganzak slapshot in the 53rd minute before Eddy netted with 61 seconds remaining.
Brandon Benedict scored his 100th Elite League goal in the 4-1 away success over the Storm.
The 33-year-old Canadian, who played for the Nottingham Panthers between his spells with Belfast, finished superbly for the final goal in Altrincham.
Meanwhile, the draw has been made for the Challenge Cup semi-finals with Belfast Giants or Manchester Storm up against Cardiff Devils or Dundee Stars.
The other semi sees Sheffield Steelers or Fife Flyers take on Braehead Clan or Nottingham Panthers.
