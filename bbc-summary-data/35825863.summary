Rangers: Wallace international class in Warburton's eyes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Warburton says captain Lee Wallace is among those in his Rangers squad ready to "step up" for Scotland but concedes international recognition may require promotion first.

Wallace, 28, won the last of his eight caps in late 2013.
And the left-back was left out of Gordon Strachan's squads for the games with Czech Republic and Denmark.
"Lee has been first class," said Warburton, whose side are top of the Scottish Championship.
"He's club captain and has been outstanding for us. Can he perform at international level? My opinion is very clear on that one.
"It's important that Lee knows what we think of him and his level of performance, so we always feedback to him.
"It's really important we respect Gordon's decision. He's the national manager and we absolutely respect him. All we can do is give our honest opinion.
"There is a healthy gap at the top of the Championship and that is down to the players and the level of consistency and quality they've shown throughout the season.
"So I have no doubt the likes of Lee Wallace and a number of others could make the step up.
"If it takes going up to the Premiership to do that, then so be it but I have no doubts about their ability."
Strachan announced separate squads for the match in Prague (24 March) and the visit of the Danes (29 March), with midfielder John McGinn - of Rangers' Championship rivals Hibernian - included for the latter match.
With Hibs also having players called up for international duty at age-grade levels, the Easter Road side's match against Dumbarton on 26 March has been postponed.
Rangers have players involved with the Scotland youth squads as well. However, the Ibrox side's home game against Queen of the South on the same day will go ahead.
"We were desperate to get the game on because a lot of the fans have booked flights, ferries and hotels and we're very aware of the expense involved," explained Warburton
"We run a very tight squad so it was a tight call for us. We'll be without certain players. A number of young players who have been on the bench will be away with the Under-17s and Under-19s.
"We're light on numbers but we'll deal with it."
Meanwhile, Warburton confirmed Maciej Gostomski, who joined Rangers on a six-month deal in January, has been released by the club.
The former Lech Poznan goalkeeper has been allowed to return to his native Poland to deal with a family-related "personal issue".
