Thomas Baker was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on Friday.
The 44-year-old, from Everton, had been shot in the head and chest. He died later in hospital.
Mr Baker, known as Tommy, had visited Phoenix Gym at the market and was shot as he got in his car, Merseyside Police said.
Detectives believe his attacker had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour.
The offender had been parked in a small grey car next to Mr Baker's black BMW in the gym's car park, police said.
Det Supt Mark Guinness said: "The number plates on the car had been obscured. It is possible that the person in the car may have done this in a nearby street earlier that morning.
"When the car left the car park at about 08:10 GMT it turned right at speed onto Prescot Road and would have had to drive across both carriageways.
"The road would have been much busier then and drivers may have had to brake suddenly or swerve to avoid a collision. "
Police said the motive for the attack was unclear but officers believe it was targeted.
