The Giro, one of three three-week Grand Tours that include the Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana, begins on 5 May in Sardinia and ends in Milan on 28 May.
Welshman Thomas goes into the race in fine form after becoming the first Briton to win the Tour of the Alps.
"My preparation has gone well and to win the Tour of the Alps was obviously a boost to my morale," said Thomas, 30.
Landa claimed third place at the 2015 Giro but was forced to retire early last year due to illness.
"As always, it is a race for the climbers and I think that will suit me," he added.
"We have a strong team and I'm really looking forward to returning to the Giro with Team Sky."
Sky Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford has picked a team of climbers as Team Sky "focus on competing in the general classification".
"The last week of this Giro will be particularly demanding and the severity of those stages will be determining factors, so making sure we have climbing support in the high mountains has been a key consideration," he said.
Team Sky's Three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome will not contest the Giro as he focuses on defending title in France and winning a fourth Tour in five years.
Team Sky line-up for Giro d'Italia:
Philip Deignan, Kenny Elissonde, Michal Golas, Sebastian Henao, Vasil Kiryienka, Mikel Landa, Salvatore Puccio, Diego Rosa, Geraint Thomas.
The BBC Sport website will carry daily reports on the Giro d'Italia.
