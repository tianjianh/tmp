Two men are facing life sentences after stabbing a man to death who was trying to save his son from an attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Walsh, 45, died of 34 injuries, including stab wounds and blunt force injuries. He was found in the street in Hendon, Sunderland, on 20 November.
Raymond Brown, 37, admitted murder and Charles Lamont, 40, was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court.
Dalton Barnett, 19, was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter. They will all be sentenced on Monday.
The jury heard that on the night of his murder, Mr Walsh and one of his sons had driven to the area after being told another son, David Richardson, was being attacked.
The violence intensified when Mr Walsh, described in court as "in a mood to fight", arrived.
He was attacked by the men with an assortment of weapons, the hearing was told.
Barnett, who is Lamont's son, of Fuller Road in the city, was also convicted of violent disorder.
Brown, of Canon Cockin Street had also earlier admitted violent disorder, and Lamont, of Villette Street in the city, was convicted of the same charge.
Patrick Duggan, 19, of Palmstead Place, Sunderland, was earlier cleared of murder, manslaughter and violent disorder.
