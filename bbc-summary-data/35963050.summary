[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wilson, 30, allegedly made illegal contact with Kruis in the second half of his side's 30-10 defeat on Friday.
Kruis, 26, has been cited for biting Wilson during the same incident.
The pair, who were both in England's 2015 World Cup squad, will face a Rugby Football Union panel on Tuesday.
Kruis was an ever-present during England's Six Nations Grand Slam-winning campaign this year, but Wilson is yet to feature under new head coach Eddie Jones.
Hosts Bath had England back Anthony Watson sent off for a dangerous tackle on Saracens full-back Alex Goode during Friday's match at The Rec.
The Blue, Black and Whites, who also had scrum-half Chris Cook sin-binned, are investigating reports one of their supporters entered the referee's room to confront the match officials after the game.
Saracens wing Chris Ashton, playing for the first time since a 10-week ban for making contact with the eyes of Ulster's Luke Marshall, scored two tries.
