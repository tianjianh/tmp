Jesus has agreed a five-year deal but will stay with Palmeiras until the end of the Brazilian season in December.
City regard the player as the best young talent in South America and fought off interest from Barcelona.
Jesus was voted the best newcomer in the Brazilian top flight last season and is part of his country's squad at the Rio Olympics.
He has scored 26 goals in 67 first-team appearances for Palmeiras and is the top scorer in the Brazilian Serie A this season - but is yet to make his senior international debut.
The add-ons in the deal are believed to be worth £4m, depending on his success at Etihad Stadium.
"We have many great talents in the team and a fantastic manager in Pep Guardiola that I can learn so much from," said Jesus.
"I'm looking forward to showing the City fans what I can do and I think we'll have a great future together."
Jesus is capable of playing across the forward line and further boosts new manager Guardiola's attacking options following Tuesday's £37m capture of Germany international Leroy Sane from Schalke.
Guardiola has now spent around £100m on players so far this summer and also signed Ilkay Gundogan, Nolito, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aaron Mooy.
