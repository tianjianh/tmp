Argentine Caballero, 35, signed from Malaga in 2014, while 31-year-old Spaniard Navas spent four years at City after arriving from Sevilla for Â£14.9m.
Director of football Txiki Begiristain said working with Navas, who made 123 league appearances, was "a pleasure".
Clichy and Sagna both joined from Arsenal, in 2011 and 2014 respectively.
Clichy, 31, was part of the side to win City's first Premier League title in 2012.
"It's amazing to see where the club is today and I am sure there is plenty more success to come," the France international told the club website.
Compatriot Sagna, 34, added it was a "privilege" to play for the club.
The quartet join long-serving defender Pablo Zabaleta, 32, in leaving Etihad Stadium at the end of June.
