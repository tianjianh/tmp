A reality television star has been jailed for stealing more than £13,000 from a holiday camp where he worked as bar manager.

Christian Taylor, 50, who starred in the Channel 4 show The Hotel, rang up huge bogus refunds for rounds of cocktails at the Devon park.
He failed to attend his trial in September where he was found guilty of one charge of theft by an employee.
Taylor, who also did not attend his sentencing, claimed he had been set up.
A judge at Exeter Crown Court sentenced him to two years in prison in his absence.
Police are still hunting him and have nicknamed him the Scarlet Pimpernel because he frequently changes his name.
Judge Erik Salomonsen said Taylor was in a "position of trust" which he breached.
Managers became suspicious when they realised the huge refunds he was putting through the tills at Twitchen House Holiday Park at Mortehoe didn't match the stock records.
He started by creating refunds for fictitious rounds of Pimms, including one of 20 jugs costing £300, but moved on to other cocktails when this triggered a stock check.
In all there were 66 fraudulent transactions totalling £13,467.60. All were when he was on duty and 16 were caught on CCTV.
Taylor told police he had been framed and accused a colleague of altering computer records to cover up his own thefts.
When he was starring in The Hotel, filmed in the Grosvenor at Torbay, he called himself Christian Scott Lee but his original name is Nigel McCartney.
Taylor was also ordered to pay £850 compensation and £100 victim surcharge.
