Fury, 27, was filmed making homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic comments in a video posted online earlier this month.
The Briton also voiced his views on bestiality, paedophilia and women during the 57-minute clip on YouTube.
"I said some things which may have hurt some people - which as a Christian man is not something I would ever want to do," said Fury.
"I apologise to anyone who may have taken offence at any of my comments.
"Though it is not an excuse, sometimes the heightened media scrutiny has caused me to act out in public.
"I know more is expected of me as an ambassador of British boxing and I promise in future to hold myself up to the highest possible standard.
"Anyone who knows me personally knows that I am in no way a racist or bigot and I hope the public accept this apology."
In November, Fury caused an upset by outpointing 40-year-old Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, with the rematch for his WBA and WBO heavyweight titles to take place at the Manchester Arena on 9 July.
His previous comments on homosexuality, paedophilia and women resulted in more than 100,000 people signing an online petition in an attempt to get him removed from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.
Fury remained on the list and apologised at the award ceremony in December.
