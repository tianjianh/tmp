[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found dead on the island of Koh Tao on 15 September.
The court was told that Mr Miller was formally identified by his father. A post-mortem examination was carried out by a Home Office pathologist.
A reward of more than Â£13,000 has been offered as Thai police try to find the killers of the two British tourists.
Col Kissana Phathanacharoen of the Royal Thai Police said a reward of 700,000 baht (Â£13,300) - was being offered for information leading to arrests of the culprits.
"We're trying to narrow our inquiries and collect more evidence. We're encouraging the public who may have information to come forward," he said.
Post-mortem examinations revealed that Miss Witheridge, from Hemsby, Norfolk, died from head wounds and Mr Miller, from Jersey, was killed by severe blows to the head and drowning.
A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby.
About 150 police officers were posted to Koh Tao as part of the murder investigation.
A group of Burmese migrants who were interviewed by police after bloodstains were found on their clothes have been eliminated from inquiries because no matches were found between them and DNA found on Ms Witheridge and a cigarette butt at the scene.
Mr Miller's funeral will be held in Trinity in Jersey on Friday.
