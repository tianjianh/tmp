It hopes the move will lead to gathering more evidence, changing the behaviour of offenders and prevent an increase in violence at a scene.
The cameras should allow more time on the beat and reduce paperwork, while they can also be used to investigate complaints against officers.
It would be one of the largest body camera roll-outs outside of London's Metropolitan Police.
Assistant chief constable Richard Lewis said: "The technology is very exciting and will assist officers and staff in doing their jobs, it will ensure that we are more accountable to the public that we serve and in turn build trust with our communities.
"This will be one of the largest deployment of body worn video cameras to police officers outside of the Metropolitan Police with all uniform frontline officers being personally equipped with devices and all our PCSOs."
