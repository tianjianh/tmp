Luke Fitzgerald has been ruled out of Ireland's summer tour to South Africa by a knee injury suffered in Leinster's 20-10 Pro12 final defeat by Connacht.

The 28-year-old had been named in coach Joe Schmidt's 32-man squad for the three-Test tour last week.
Fitzgerald's misfortune could open the door for uncapped Connacht wing Matt Healy, who rounded off a terrific season with a fine display on Saturday.
Connacht full-back Tiernan O'Halloran is another option available to Schmidt.
A decision on Fitzgerald's replacement should be made in the next few days, with Healy the favourite to get the nod.
Ulster's in-form Craig Gilroy could also be in the running to join the squad,
The Leinster back joins a lengthy list of absentees for the tour which includes wings Simon Zebo and Tommy Bowe, and forwards Cian Healy, Denis Buckley, Nathan White, Sean O'Brien, Peter O'Mahony, Josh van der Flier and Andrew Conway.
Meanwhile South Africa have named hooker Adriaan Strauss as captain for the series.
New coach Allister Coetzee praised the 30-year-old's leadership skills in what is a new-look squad.
"Adriaan's leadership qualities are impressive and well-established and he has the respect of his team mates on and off the field," Coetzee said in a statement from SA Rugby.
Strauss will become the 57th Springboks captain, taking over from Jean de Villiers who retired after last year's Rugby World Cup.
The 30-year-old hooker has 54 international caps with the 'Boks and he served as vice-captain in 2012 and '13.
Ireland face the Springboks in the first Test in Cape Town on 11 June, with the sides meeting again over the following two weekends in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth.
