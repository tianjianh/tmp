York City 1-1 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late Kane Richards strike spoilt the day on York boss Gary Mills' homecoming as he secured a draw for Chester at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a slow first half, the action livened up after the break.
Chester could have taken the lead when James Alabi forced Minstermen goalkeeper Kyle Letheren into a fine save with his feet on 67 minutes.
They were made to pay just three minutes later, when Matt Fry headed home Danny Galbraith's corner much to the relief of the home crowd.
Alabi was once again foiled by Letheren moments before Richards smacked the woodwork with nine minutes remaining.
But home hearts were broken when the striker made amends by heading in a left-wing cross on 89 minutes, a goal that condemned York to a 10th game without a win.
