[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wild deer important to Scotland, says review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The positive and negative impacts of Scotland's wild red and roe deer have been examined in a newly-published review.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The benefits include the animals' importance to sporting estates and tourism and also being a source of "healthy food".
Negative impacts include harm grazing deer do to native woodlands.
The review was done to help guide Scottish government decisions on deer management.
In the review document's foreword, Scottish Natural Heritage chairman Ian Ross said deer, especially red deer, "are emblematic of the wild beauty and nature of Scotland's upland and woodland landscapes".
The study found that between 1961 and 2016, red deer densities in Scotland have increased by 60% overall.
However, it added that there were "marked variations" in deer densities across the country.
The review suggested the animals were important to rural economies and ecosystems, but also that in certain places deer were damaging to some habitats.
