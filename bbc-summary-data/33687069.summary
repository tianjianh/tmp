William Hague has been named as the new chair of the defence think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).

The former foreign secretary, who stepped down as an MP at May's election, succeeds former Labour minister Lord Hutton in the role.
Announcing his appointment, RUSI's director general Prof Michael Clarke said having someone of Mr Hague's experience and calibre was "gold dust".
Mr Hague said RUSI's input was vital in an "increasingly unstable world".
Mr Hague served as foreign secretary between 2010 and 2014, during which he also played a key role in global efforts to tackle sexual violence in conflicts.
The role at RUSI is the first that Mr Hague has taken on since leaving Parliament.
"At a time when we face an increasingly complex and unstable world, we need ever greater insight and scrutiny into the challenges confronting our global security and defence," he said.
Prof Clarke said Mr Hague would help the think tank, which was founded in 1831, to better understand the security and foreign policy challenges facing the UK, in the context of the government's current strategic defence review.
"In global political terms, this is a difficult time to be a political leader, but a wonderful time to be an analyst. Mr Hague has been both and his experience is gold dust to an institute such as this," he said.
