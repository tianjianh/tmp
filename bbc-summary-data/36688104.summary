Laura Trott became the first British woman to win three Olympic gold medals as Great Britain's women set a new world record to retain their team pursuit title in Rio.

Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald clocked four minutes 10.236 seconds to beat the United States in the final.
Becky James added keirin silver for Great Britain soon after.
Trott, 24, won gold in the team pursuit and omnium at London 2012.
She could add a fourth when she defends her title in the latter on Tuesday as she closes in on Sir Chris Hoy's record of six Olympic gold medals.
"I could not be prouder right now," said Trott, the fiancee of Jason Kenny, who goes for his second gold of the Games - and fifth overall - in Sunday's sprint final.
Earlier, Canada beat New Zealand to win the bronze medal.
Great Britain's victory continued their track cycling dominance in Rio after the men's team pursuit win on Friday.
"This means the world to me," said Rowsell-Shand, who now has two Olympic gold medals following team pursuit victory with Trott in 2012.
"I won gold four years ago, but this was a much harder battle. It has not all been going our way over the last two years, but we pulled together."
"It was phenomenal," said Sir Chris Hoy. "USA attacked at the start, but the Brits responded. Laura produced a two-lap spell that turned things around, America lost a rider and the gap got bigger and bigger.
"It is so great to see the celebrations. So much work has gone into this and it is great to see the hard work paying off."
