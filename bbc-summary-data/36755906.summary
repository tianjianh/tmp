Laura Whittle and Eilish McColgan were fifth and sixth respectively.
There was also bronze for Julian Reid in the triple jump, the 27 year-old's first leap of 16.76m enough for his first senior international medal.

Reid is the fourth Briton to win a triple jump medal at the European Championships after Keith Connor, Jonathan Edwards and Phillips Idowu.
