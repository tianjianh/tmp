[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British troops began landing on the islands in the South Atlantic on 21 May 1982.
The Hampshire town, which is home to the Falklands Veterans Foundation, has hosted a national commemoration service and parade every five years since 1997.
A civic procession and a service at the town's Falkland Gardens was followed by a parade through the High Street.
The march past was led by the Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Collingwood.
The mayor of Gosport Linda Batty, Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire Rear Admiral Iain Henderson and First Sea Lord Sir Philip Jones took the salute.
Falklands Veterans Foundation chief executive Derek "Smokey" Cole, who served on board HMS Intrepid, said: "Gosport has a very special place in the hearts of veterans and their families, because many of those who served in the conflict lived there, and the town's military facilities played a crucial role in supporting the Falklands campaign - including supplying and arming the taskforce."
