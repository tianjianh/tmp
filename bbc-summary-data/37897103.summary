The briefs, part of a collection that went under the hammer at the Philip Serrell auction house in Malvern, were expected to fetch around £400, but sold for £2,900.
A gold ring, a silver mirrored box and a silver holder still containing Eva Braun's bright red lipstick were also sold.
They were sold to a private collector.

The knickers, featuring a lace and ribbon trim, are embroidered with Eva Braun's initials.
The gold cluster ring, set with an opal surrounded by six rubies, sold for £1,250, while the silver lipstick case engraved with 'EB' sold for £360.
Meanwhile, a collection of early 20th century black and white photographs depicting Eva Braun, some with Adolf Hitler, sold for £100.
The auction house confirmed the lots were all sold to a collector based in the UK.
Sophie Jones, auctioneer and valuer at Philip Serrell, said an "array" of people bid on the items.
She said it was generally private collectors interested in the lots.
"It is generally people fascinated with that period of history," she said. "I think people who were bidding on them were private collectors more than dealers."
Many of the items at the auction, including the underwear, had certificates of authenticity from the relevant seller, she added.
