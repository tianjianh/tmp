Kilmarnock: Cryo chamber to give Lee Clark's Killie 'the edge'

It worked for English Premier League Champions Leicester City, now Kilmarnock are hoping the use of a "cryo chamber", will give them the edge over their rivals this season.

The chamber exposes the body to temperatures of -137 celsius, and among other benefits, helps the prevention of and recovery from injuries.
Killie manager Lee Clark believes it could provide his players with a crucial filip.
"The extreme cold conditions attack the central nervous system which reproduce the cells that help you recover quickly," Clark told BBC Scotland.
"So we can do this after matches and after intense training sessions."
Kilmarnock are the first football club in Scotland to have a Cryo chamber installed, and will try it out for the next month.
Clark admits he pitched his idea to the Kilmarnock board more in hope than expectation, but is a firm believer that there will be many benefits.
"Obviously something like this in terms of finance doesn't come cheaply but they (the club's board) have bought in to what I'm trying to do," he said.
"In terms of playing budget we've not got a huge one, and we have a small squad, so we have to look at other things to try and gain that extra inch, the difference between winning and losing.
"We can't go out and splash ridiculous amounts of money and buy players and I want to give the players every opportunity to perform to their optimum on a match day."
While Kilmarnock are the only club to adopt this technology in Scotland, clubs in England have been using such science as part of their training regimes.
"I was aware of it when I was a player," Clark explained. "I've been aware of it for a few years."
Newcastle United and Sunderland had a chamber installed while Sam Allardyce was manager, and Leicester City players used it last season as they went on to win the English Premier League.
Clark, it seems, wants to embrace technology and is adamant science has a vital role to play within a football club.
"I just want to try and build the club up," he said.
"I want to build the quality of the players up, I want to build the infrastructure up, I want to build the sport science and medical team up. I want it to go to a new level."
