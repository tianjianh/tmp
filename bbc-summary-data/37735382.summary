[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MEPs are heading back to Strasbourg for the second time this month after a fractious leaders' summit last week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Tuesday the announcement of the Commission's legislative programme for next year will provide the opportunity to talk of a new start.
However, events at last week's two-day meeting may cast a long shadow.
On Wednesday, MEPs will get a chance to react to the failure to reach a compromise with Belgium's Wallonia region over an EU trade deal with Canada.
The agreement, known as CETA, was due to be signed this week after seven years of negotiations.
Last-ditch talks are being made to salvage the deal, but its future is hanging in the balance.
With it, trade talks with the United States, Japan - and potentially a post-Brexit UK - face an uncertain fate.
Also on Wednesday, MEPs are due to take their position on next year's EU budget ahead of a looming December deadline.
Here are the main events coming up this week...
The sitting starts with a debate on new rules to harmonise penalties against firms that break EU customs law.
The EU Commission has argued that an agreed scale for penalties would provide a level playing field for companies.
MEPs will set out their "first reading" position on the regulations on Tuesday.
After this they will discuss what the EU's diplomatic strategy should be with Iran following the landmark nuclear deal agreed last year.
A draft motion to be voted on during Tuesday calls for the bloc to explore ways of boosting economic links with the country.
However it also says Iran's human rights record could present "obstacles to trade".
The evening will see short debates on six advisory "own initiative" motions on EU policy ideas.
Among the ideas being debated this month is a motion backing an EU strategy to boost imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The morning sitting will kick off with a debate on an advisory motion calling for an EU monitoring system of fundamental rights breaches in member states.
Under the scheme, the Commission would issue annual "recommendations" to national governments on their respect for EU fundamental rights.
It comes amid an ongoing EU probe into respect for the rule of law in Poland.
At lunchtime MEPs will vote on an amending budget to increase security spending at EU buildings by a total of â‚¬15.8m this year.
It includes money for 35 new recruits at the European Parliament, exempted from the institution's target to cut staff by 5% by the end of 2018.
The extra money was proposed following a review after recent terror attacks in Paris and Brussels.
They will also decide whether to grant immunity to ex-UKIP MEP Jane Collins in the libel case brought against her by three South Yorkshire Labour MPs.
The MPs took her to court after she claimed in 2014 that they had known about child exploitation in Rotherham but did not intervene.
Parliament's legal affairs committee has recommended not doing so, arguing that the comments did not relate to her role as an MEP.
In the afternoon, a commissioner will join MEPs to debate the EU executive's legislative plans for next year.
Ahead of the vote on Wednesday, they will also debate their position on next year's EU budget, which has to be agreed by December.
As per tradition, their draft motion proposes reversing cuts demanded by national governments.
It also calls for increasing spending on EU economic development schemes and programmes to help with mass migration.
In the evening the Commission will present its new plan for a common system to calculate corporate tax payments due by multinationals across the EU.
Plans for a Common Consolidated Corporation Tax Base (CCCTB) were originally put forward in 2011 but were blocked by member states.
Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk are due to speak during a debate on last week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels.
The summit was overshadowed by failure to reach agreement with Belgium's Wallonia region over the signing of an EU trade deal with Canada.
Belgium, the only country blocking the accord, needs consent from Wallonia's regional parliament before it can sign.
It leaves the credibility of the EU as a trade negotiator in doubt, with trade talks with the United States also on rocky ground.
During the lunchtime voting session, MEPs will also vote on a motion calling for a mandatory EU-wide limit on the amount of trans fats in foods.
The fatty acids, often found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHOs), have been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks.
Denmark, Austria, Hungary and Latvia have all placed national limits on the trans fats in oils and fats.
PHOs are also due to be banned in the US by June 2018.
However the motion will not be binding on the European Commission, which would need to propose legislation to introduce the limit.
The afternoon will see a series of external relations debates on relations with Belarus, Afghanistan and the situation in Iraq.
It comes after government and Kurdish forces began a long-awaited operation last week against so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the northern city of Mosul.
They will also debate the arrest of journalists and closure of media organisations following the failed coup in Turkey.
The morning sitting opens with a debate to mark the 20th anniversary of the European Volunteering Service (EVS).
MEPs will debate a non-binding motion calling on the EVS to drop its age limit for volunteers.
It also urges the EU Commission to set up a scheme allowing volunteers to gain formal recognition of their skills to help them find jobs afterwards.
A second non-binding motion to be debated during the morning calls for Common Agricultural Policy funds to be directed at smaller farms.
It notes that just 13% of beneficiaries received 74% of all funding during 2014.
A third and final motion to be debated in the morning calls for the next version of the EU's Youth Strategy to focus on tackling youth unemployment.
It says more investment should be made in vocational training teaching skills that "reflect labour market opportunities".
There will be no human rights motions at the voting session, with this having been done at the first of this month's plenary sittings.
Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.
