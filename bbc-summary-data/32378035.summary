The FTSE 100 closed up 57.5 points, or 0.82%, at 7,052.13, helped by Anglo America's 2.72% rise, and Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton adding 2.61% and 2.46% respectively.
China's stimulus plan buoyed stocks, offsetting fears about Greece, which led to Friday's 1.3% FTSE 100 fall.
Ashtead, up 2.88%, was the index's big gainer after Barclays tipped the stock.
Another big mover was InterContinental Hotels, 2.35% higher on speculative chatter about a merger deal.
Outside the 100 top companies, oilfield services provider Petrofac extended recent losses to finish down 10%.
Petrofac said it would incur an additional Â£130m loss this year on its Laggan-Tormore gas plant project in the Shetland Islands.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.33% against the dollar at  $1.4914, but was up 0.12% against the euro at â‚¬1.38571.
