[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Organised' gang jailed for bringing class-A drugs into Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drugs gang which ferried heroin and crack cocaine from Liverpool into north east Wales has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mold Crown Court heard the gang brought class-A drugs into Mold, Flintshire, and rural areas for distribution on the streets.
The seven admitted drugs-related offences and were given jail terms ranging from five years to 18 months.
Head of the gang, Kevin McMullen, 30, of Muirhead Avenue, Liverpool, was jailed for five years and eight months.
Judge Geraint Walters described them as "an organised criminal enterprise".
The court heard the offences were carried out between February and August last year.
Judge Walters said evidence showed houses were used to store and then distribute drugs, and vehicles were hired to distance them from police attention.
They also had an array of weapons and balaclavas along with phones which were not easily traceable.
It was not known how many dangerous drugs were brought into the rural area but it was significant and its impact would be huge, Judge Walters added.
McMullen was also banned from driving for five years after he admitted two charges of dangerous driving following police pursuits.
Courier David McDonagh, 54, of Sedgemoor Road, Liverpool, was said to have played an active part and was jailed for four years.
The judge said he had not been deterred by a two-year sentence in 2010 for conspiring to supply cocaine.
Danny Burrows, 26, formerly of Maes-y-March, Mold, employed to sell drugs in the town, received two years consecutive to a prison sentence he is already serving for burglary and attempted robbery.
His mother Carol Burrows, 48, who allowed her flat in Maes Abad in Mold to be used by the drugs gang, was jailed for two years.
The youngest member of the gang, James Johnson, 21, originally from Liverpool, appearing on a link to Durham Prison, was jailed for three years.
Judge Walters said it must be served consecutive to a three year and nine month sentence he received in Glasgow in June for ferrying three kilos of heroin into Scotland.
All five had admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine.
Meanwhile Burrows' father Julian Williams, 45, of Ivy Crescent in Mold, admitted being concerned in the supply of drugs, and received 18 months.
Danielle Davies, 27, at the time of Rhyl Road, Rhuddlan - McMullin's partner who hired some of the cars and who stored weapons and balaclavas for him - also admitted being concerned in the supply of drugs and received two years.
Police who caught the gang under Operation Baste were commended by the judge for their diligence.
Cash seized would go to the police to help them in their work against criminal gangs, he added.
