The Swede scored four goals as PSG demolished Troyes 9-0 to seal the Ligue 1 trophy with eight games left.
The 34-year-old told beIN Sports: "For the moment, I will not be at PSG next season. I still have a month and a half left here.
"If they replace the Eiffel Tower with a statue of me, then I will stay."
Ibrahimovic has recently been linked with moves to Manchester United and Major League Soccer in the United States.
PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said that he wants Ibrahimovic to stay when his contract ends in June.
"Zlatan is magical," he said. "He is a great player. We are going to talk him and see what he wants to do. We want him to stay."
Ibrahimovic's four goals on Sunday included a 10-minute hat-trick, which took his league total to 27 in 24 games this season and increased his tally in the French top flight to 102.
The victory over the bottom club sealed a fourth straight title after just 30 games, a record for one of Europe's 'big five' leagues.
Qatari Al-Khelaifi added that PSG will now target a maiden Champions League triumph having beaten Chelsea 4-2 on aggregate in the last 16.
"We must now stay focused because the season is not finished," he said.
"We have three more cups to fight for (Champions League, French League Cup and French Cup) but the Champions League is our biggest dream.
"We want to go as far as possible but we know there will be some very strong teams."
Their only major European trophy to date was the Cup Winners' Cup in 1996.
Coach Laurent Blanc told beIN Sports: "We did what we needed to do, particularly in the second period.
"From day one we've wanted to set a rhythm that would be difficult to match.
"We did it and we've maintained it. We know that no-one can match us."
