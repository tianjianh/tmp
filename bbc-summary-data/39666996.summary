[SN]TITLE[SN]
New tributes at Scotland's Poets' Corner in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It has been described as Scotland's answer to Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey, with the words of the country's best writers preserved in stone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Now Makars' Court, the tribute to Scottish writers in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, has had two more wordsmiths added to its ranks.
Memorials to poets George Campbell Hay (1915 - 1984) and William Soutar (1898 - 1943) have been unveiled.
Makars' Court is the paved area in front of Edinburgh's Writers' Museum.
Richard Lewis, City of Edinburgh Council's culture convener, said: "Makars' Court is a highlight of the Old Town tourist trail and the addition of these two new inscriptions celebrates these poets' skills in their craft.
"Scotland, and not least its City of Literature capital, has produced an extraordinary number of accomplished writers and Makars' Court is an excellent place to pay tribute to them and celebrate their work.
"Thanks to the generosity of sponsors, these flagstones for George Campbell Hay and William Soutar continue the city's long-held appreciation of great Scottish writing."
Campbell Hay and Soutar wre both members of the Scottish Literary Renaissance and are acknowledged for their influence and lasting legacy in Scottish literature.
The commemorations have been created with the support of the Makars' Court Committee of the Scottish Saltire Society and sponsors Anne Artymiuk and the Friends of the William Soutar Society.
