Greece vote set for 20 September as interim PM takes office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greece's new caretaker government has been sworn in and snap elections confirmed for 20 September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The country's top Supreme Court judge, Vassiliki Thanou, becomes caretaker prime minister - the country's first female PM.
Last week, Alex Tsipras resigned as leader to seek a new mandate for office.
He called a new vote after a rebellion by MPs in his party over the bailout he agreed with European creditors.
Mr Tsipras is expected to win the next election although it is unclear whether he will secure enough votes to form a majority government.
Earlier this week an opinion poll for Greece's Vergina TV suggested support for his Syriza party had declined to 24%, down from 34% in July.
New Democracy was in second with 22%, while the far-right Golden Dawn ranked third with 6%.
Popular Unity, which split from Syriza, was put on 4.5%.
