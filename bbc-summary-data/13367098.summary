The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which investigates Nazi war criminals, has published its latest list of its most wanted surviving suspects.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Those on the list are "wanted" because they have not been punished, even if they have extradition orders against them or have been tried and convicted. In some cases it is unclear whether they are still alive. They remain on the list until it is proven that they are dead.
Resident in Austria. Former Croatian police chief, accused of role in deporting hundreds to their deaths. Extradition to Croatia was requested in 2005 but was refused on medical grounds due to dementia.
Resident in Syria - possibly dead. Commander of Paris internment camp, deported thousands to death camps under orders of Adolf Eichmann. Convicted in absentia in France but never punished.
Resident in Germany. Arrested Jews who were later murdered by Nazi collaborators in Lithuania. Deported from US. Convicted by Lithuania and sentenced to jail - but sentence was not carried out.
Resident in Germany. Sentenced to death in the Netherlands for murdering prisoners at Westerbork camp and Groningen prison but sentence commuted to life imprisonment in 1948. Escaped to Germany in 1952. German courts currently considering an arrest warrant issued by Dutch authorities.
