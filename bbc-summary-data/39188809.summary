[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 5-0 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient plunged to the bottom of the League Two table after being thrashed at Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Kee's header late in the first half handed Stanley the lead, which was doubled six minutes after the interval by Matty Pearson.
And the hosts ran riot in the last six minutes, with Sean McConville's quick-fire double - the second from near the halfway line - being added to by Pearson's second in added time.
Kee headed home a McConville corner at the far post to get Stanley off the mark in the 44th minute.
Highly-rated defender Pearson made it two when he headed home a McConville free-kick at the far post.
The third came through McConville when he fired home from 25 yards on 84 minutes.
And one minute later it was McConville who scored the goal of the game when he let fly from near the halfway line, beating Orient goalkeeper Charlie Grainger with an effort that bounced in off the crossbar.
Pearson celebrated his seventh of the season, sliding home in added time, to give Stanley their biggest win of the season that moved them 12 points clear of the relegation zone.
But it was agony for Orient, who now prop up the EFL and lost experienced defender Nicky Hunt to injury.
