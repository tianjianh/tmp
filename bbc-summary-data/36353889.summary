The discovery was made at Toms Hill in Chandlers Cross, after Hertfordshire Police were alerted by a member of the public at about 11:00 BST.
The Thames Valley force, which is investigating her disappearance, said her family had been told of the find.
Ms Hemming's partner Paul Hemming, 42, was charged with her murder on 6 May.
Ms Hemming, 31, of Alderney Avenue, Newton Leys, Milton Keynes, was last seen in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, at about 15:00 on 1 May and was reported missing by a relative on 3 May.
Police have conducted searches for her body in an area around Salden Wood near Newton Longville in Buckinghamshire and a disused railway line, both near the family home.
The Thames Valley force said it was working closely with Hertfordshire Police, whose officers discovered the woman's body.
Mr Hemming was remanded in custody by Milton Keynes magistrates on 7 May and is next due to appear in court in July.
