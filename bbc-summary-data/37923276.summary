[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs have demanded an explanation from Sports Direct after an alleged attempt to bug a private meeting of MPs at the firm's Shirebrook warehouse.

The parliamentarians felt "anger and disappointment about the placing of the recording device", wrote Iain Wright, chair of the business select committee.
The incident allegedly occurred after a spot-check of the warehouse.
Mr Ashley had earlier suggested that one of the MPs had planted the device herself.
The committee has been investigating working practices at the warehouse and wanted to see if improvements had been made there.
The MPs gave notice on Monday morning that they would visit the Derbyshire site as part of a previous agreement for an unannounced spot-check.
After a three-hour tour, they went to a room for a private meeting and were served refreshments including a plate of sandwiches.
Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, said the lady who had served the sandwiches also left a recording device in the room.
Mr Wright wrote: "I appreciate the time taken by several members of staff to show us round the warehouse and answer questions.
"However, I also have to express our anger and disappointment at the placing of a recording device in a room in which we had requested to hold a brief and private meeting at the end of the visit."
He said the committee wanted an explanation of "how and why the camera came to be placed in the room, who authorised its placing and what steps you have taken as a result".
Mr Wright added that he assumed Mr Ashley's suggestion that one of the MPs had planted the device was "a spur of the moment misjudgement".
Sports Direct declined to comment on the MPs' letter, but in a statement yesterday said: "The [Sports Direct] board is disappointed that reporting of a possible recording device (the veracity of which has yet to be determined) has overshadowed the truly important issues that this visit should have focused on - the true working conditions and worker satisfaction at Shirebrook.
"The board would like to make it clear that it did not authorise or have any knowledge of the possible recording device."
