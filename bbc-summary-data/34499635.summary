Hundreds of fans travelled to Helsinki for Northern Ireland's game against Finland on Sunday, the final leg of a historic Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
The city centre was a sea of green and white before kick-off.
The team qualified for its first major tournament in 30 years after beating Greece 3-1 at Windsor Park on Thursday.
"We just came to party," was the chant from the supporters. And they didn't disappoint.
Even the locals found themselves caught up in the celebrations.
Northern Ireland fans made all the noise inside the half-full Olympic Stadium.
The reward was seeing their team collect the single point they needed to head to France as Group F winners.
Defender Craig Cathcart scored Northern Ireland's goal in a 1-1 draw.
It is the first time Northern Ireland has qualified for the finals of a major football tournament since the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.
"Qualifying means everything," one fan said.
"I can't describe what this means after so many disappointments."
When asked about his realistic expectations for the Euro 2016 finals his answer was simple: "I expect we'll win."
Northern Ireland supporters' optimism is as hearty as their singing.
The Republic of Ireland, however, had to settle for a place in the play-offs for the tournament finals after they fell to a 2-1 defeat by Poland in Warsaw.
