[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gary Glitter appears in court on sex offence charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Glitter has appeared in court accused of a series of sex offences against two girls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former pop star, 70, has been charged with six counts of indecent assault, one of unlawful sex with a girl under 13 and one count of administering a drug to obtain sex.
He appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court under his real name, Paul Gadd.
The offences are alleged to have taken place in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Mr Gadd is to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 3 July.
Judge Emma Arbuthnot bailed him until that date.
Mr Gadd, who listened to the proceedings through a hearing loop, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address.
It's a long time since Gary Glitter's heyday as one of the stars of 'glam rock' in the 1970s.
But more than three decades on he still cut a flamboyant figure in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court.
Looking healthy and suntanned, he was wearing a linen suit, cream scarf and - much to the concern of the district judge - a pair of sunglasses.
Judge Arbuthnot was assured by the defence lawyer that they were being worn for medical reasons and no disrespect to the court was intended.
The defendant's next appearance will be at Southwark Crown Court on 3 July.
The judge said that appearance must be without the sunglasses.
Dressed in a beige suit, pink shirt and cream scarf and wearing tinted glasses, he spoke clearly and spelled out his surname.
The deputy chief magistrate asked Mr Gadd's defence barrister, Christopher Ware, why he was wearing sunglasses, to which he replied that the defendant had a "medical condition".
Mr Gadd, whose hits include I'm the Leader of the Gang, is accused of "administering a drug, namely alcohol, to obtain intercourse".
He is also accused of one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with an under-age girl and two counts of indecent assault between 1 October 1979 and 31 December 1980 involving the second complainant.
