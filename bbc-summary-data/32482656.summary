The 20-year-old helped the hosts from 317-5 to 444 all out as he surpassed his previous first-class best of 89.
Mitchell Claydon (4-103) starred with the ball for Kent, while wicket-keeper Sam Billings took six catches.
Kyle Jarvis then claimed 3-35 as Kent reached 214-7, a deficit of 230, before rain brought an early close.
After Darren Stevens removed Jordan Clark with the first ball of the day, Davies steadied the innings and looked set to reach a deserved hundred.
However, he drove loosely at a ball from Claydon and was snaffled at second slip by Matt Coles after making 99 off 199 balls, including 15 fours.
Kent's hopes of scoring the 81 more runs needed to avoid the follow-on look likely to rest with Sam Northeast who is unbeaten on 48.
Lancashire wicket-keeper Alex Davies:
"It was a good day for us. It is a flat pitch but we knew we would be in with a shout of getting wickets if we bowled in the right areas.
"We put them under pressure, and it paid off. We are in a really good position and couldn't have asked for any better of a day.
"Kyle has worked really hard and it is just coming together for him nicely. When he catches fire, he is unplayable at times. Some of them balls are going to get anyone out."
Kent seamer Mitchell Claydon:
"I thought we toiled away quite well. There wasn't a lot there at some stages especially when the sun was out.
"We've still got guys who can bat and we've still got a guy in, so our role is to get as many runs as we can and then hopefully put in a performance in the second innings because I think we're a lot better with the bat than we've shown at the moment.
"The lads have just been saying the batting conditions changed quite a lot when the lights came on.
"When it became quite overcast the ball started nipping around a bit and I don't think we got to do that at all as the sun was out for the whole 130 overs we were out there, but that's cricket."
