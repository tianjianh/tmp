Grand National 2017: Barry Geraghty fit for Aintree return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jockey Barry Geraghty has announced he will be fit to ride at next week's Grand National meeting at Aintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irishman has been absent since breaking six ribs and suffering a collapsed lung in a fall at Kempton at the end of February.
Those injuries ruled him out of this month's Cheltenham Festival.
But 37-year-old Geraghty has told the At The Races website he is now "good to go" and is hoping to be back in action at Fairyhouse on Sunday.
He said: "I got the results of my scan and, thankfully, everything came back clear."
Geraghty, the retained jockey for racehorse owner JP McManus, has yet to announce his intended mount in the Grand National on 8 April.
He rode Cause Of Causes, trained by Gordon Elliott, in an exercise on Wednesday and plans to school More Of That for Jonjo O'Neill on Friday.
Geraghty won the National in 2003 on Monty's Pass.
