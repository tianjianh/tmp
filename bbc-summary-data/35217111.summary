Parts of Wales are set to see more bands of heavy rain and prolonged showers as another weather warning comes into force.

The Met Office has put a yellow 'be aware' rain weather warning in place until 12:00 GMT on Tuesday.
The downpour is expected to affect south, mid and west Wales, and 10mm (0.4in) of rain could fall in an hour.
It comes after a number of roads were flooded in Powys, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire on Sunday.
The forecaster has warned flooding is possible given the saturated ground.
The warning covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Powys, Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Caerphilly, Swansea, Torfaen, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, Cardiff and Newport.
