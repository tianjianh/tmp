The company is best known for making Denman hairbrushes, but also has customers in aerospace and other industrial sectors.
The investment is focused on growing its aerospace business and will involve expanding its factory.
Invest NI is giving a £400,000 grant towards the capital investment.
John Rainey, Denroy's managing director, said the company would be developing its research and development capability and test laboratory.
The firm's aerospace customers include BAE, Airbus and Bombardier.
Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell said the 32 new jobs, to be created by 2017, would generate almost £600,000 annually in additional salaries.
