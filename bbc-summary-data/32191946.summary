Asda recalls dummy after complaint of detached teat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Asda has recalled some of its dummies due to a "possible risk of choking", after a customer complained that one device came apart in a baby's mouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Packs of "Little Angels 2 Newborn Soothers 0+ Months" are being recalled from stores "as a precaution", and should be returned for a refund or disposed of, the retailer said.
Asda apologised for "any inconvenience" and said it would investigate.
It is the second time the retailer has recalled soothers for babies.
In January 2013 Asda asked parents to return packs of the Little Angels Cherry Soother after a fault was identified.
In the latest recall, the Â£2.25 dummy is being withdrawn from shops after a customer complained on Facebook that the teat had come away from the casing of one of the products.
In a notice to customers, the supermarket said: "These [affected dummies] are sold in twin packs, the shield is clear and the plug on the front has a number of different designs.
"We have had one customer complaint that the teat has broken away and detached from the hard casing, so we have taken the precaution of taking the product off sale and recalling from customers due to the possible risk of choking.
"The care and safety of our customers is our top priority, which is why we are recalling the product even though there has been only one complaint and we are yet to conduct our investigation."
The statement added: "We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused."
