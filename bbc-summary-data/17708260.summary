[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincolnshire fire service AssetCo contract 'ended'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincolnshire fire service has insisted the ending of a contract with the firm which provided its fire engines will not affect its operation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokesman confirmed the contract with AssetCo Lincoln had ended, but for legal reasons, could not give details.
The company, which has had financial problems, supplied, maintained and tested engines and equipment.
The fire service said long-standing contingency plans meant its emergency cover was unaffected.
'Business as usual'
In 2006, AssetCo Lincoln and fire bosses signed a 20-year contract and then announced the acquisition of 35 new engines and 22 refurbished ones.
But the parent company AssetCo Plc has struggled with financial problems and in September last year needed to raise Â£14m in a refinancing deal together with agreeing a write down of debt with banks.
A spokesman for Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue said: "Due to legal obligations, the service is unable to specify at the current time why the contract has ended.
"As good practice the service maintains and tests business continuity plans for all eventualities.
"Consequently the service is prepared to maintain business as usual in relation to providing fire engines and equipment to firefighters so that they are able to respond to 999 calls."
AssetCo, which also provides fire equipment for London, was unavailable for comment.
