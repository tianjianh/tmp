If fulfilled, the deal could be worth around $3bn (Â£2bn).
The airline, flymojo, has signed a letter of intent to buy 20 CS100 aircraft, but it may lead to the purchase of a further 20.
The wings of the CSeries will be made by Bombardier in Belfast.
The CSeries has been hit by years of delays and cost overruns.
It is finally due to enter service later this year.
Michael Ryan, vice-president and general manager, of Bombardier Belfast, said: "We are pleased that flymojo has placed this letter of intent for up to 40 CS100 aircraft.
"This is a further endorsement of the aircraft's game-changing credentials, to which we in Belfast are contributing with the production of the advanced composite wings."
Bombardier has now booked orders and commitments for 603 CSeries aircraft.
