Animal campaigners have appealed for information after 11 hamsters were found abandoned in a shoebox in a layby near Dunblane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three adult hamsters and eight babies were found in the Nike shoebox off the A9 near the Perthshire town at about 08:30 on Friday.
Four of the babies had died, but the others were rescued and are in the care of the Scottish SPCA.
Animal rescue officer Lauren Graham said dumping them was "very cruel".
She said: "The hamsters were abandoned in a Nike shoebox which had sawdust, bedding and food inside.
"Sadly half of the litter had died but we are hopeful the survivors will make it.
"Abandoning these hamsters in a layby was very cruel. There was no guarantee they would be found and it would have been really distressing for them."
Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act, and anyone found guilty of doing so could be banned from keeping animals.
