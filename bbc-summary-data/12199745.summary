[SN]TITLE[SN]
Additions to Middlesbrough heritage list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New buildings in Middlesbrough have been added to a list which aims to recognise the town's heritage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The town has just a single Grade l listed building - Acklam Hall - and more than 100 Grade ll and II* listed buildings.
The list aims to recognise those buildings of particular local interest which do not qualify for statutory protection.
A further 66 suggested entries arose from consultation with the public.
The list has now been expanded to 92 buildings following a review by Middlesbrough council.
New additions to the draft local list include Middlesbrough Dock, originally designed by William Cubitt, The Navigation Inn, Cargo Fleet Lane, the Evening Gazette offices on Borough Road, Psyche, Linthorpe Road, The Green Tree pub, Gilkes Street and King Edward's Square, Teesside University.
Members of the public are invited to comment on the updated draft local list as part of a consultation which concludes on 19 February.
The council said that while local listing would not offer the protection afforded to listed buildings, it would ensure locally important buildings, and their special qualities, were recognised within the planning system.
Councillor Charlie Rooney, Middlesbrough Council's executive member for regeneration and economic development, said: "For a relatively young town, Middlesbrough has a great number of buildings of interest.
"The first local list was a great talking point. I'm sure this latest round of consultation will prompt people to have another close look at the buildings around them - and I have no doubt there will be some interesting new suggestions."
The revised local list can be found on the Middlesbrough Council website.
