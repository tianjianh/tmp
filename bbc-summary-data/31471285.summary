The 22-year-old heptathlete cleared 1.97m at the British Indoor Championships, and made an unsuccessful attempt at two metres.
"I'm glad to jump a PB [personal best] but I can't believe I'm a little disappointed with a 1.97m," she said.
Chijindu Ujah won the men's 60m in 6.57 seconds, while Dina Asher-Smith took the women's event in 7.15.
Morgan Lake, 17, set a new British indoor junior record in clearing 1.94m to finish second behind Johnson-Thompson.
Lake's effort was enough to secure her place in the British squad alongside Johnson-Thompson for March's European Indoor Championships in Prague.
Ujah, who broke the 10-second barrier last year with a run of 9.96, powered clear of Sean Safo-Antwi (6.66) and Roy Ejiakuekwu (6.72).
Heptathlon specialist Johnson-Thompson, from Liverpool, won a high-quality high jump competition from 17-year-old Morgan Lake, who cleared a new personal best of 1.94 to break the British junior record, and Isobel Pooley (1.88).
The world indoor silver medallist, who set the previous record of 1.96m at last year's meet, was taking part in only her second competition since suffering a foot injury which forced her to miss last summer's Commonwealth Games and European Championships.
Hurdler Lawrence Clarke continued his return to form, after two years blemished by injury, with victory in the 60m hurdles at the English Institute of Sport.
Clarke, 24, clocked 7.69 to guarantee selection for the European Indoor Championships, beating David Omoregie (7.78).
