Derek Adams: Plymouth can compete with Premiership clubs for players

Plymouth manager Derek Adams believes his club can compete with bottom-six Scottish Premiership sides when it comes to wages.

The 41-year-old guided Plymouth to promotion to League One following a 6-1 win over Newport County.
Adams has signed a number of players from Scotland and says his team can continue to attract targets south.
"Players come because they see it as a stepping stone to a bigger club and to get to the Championship," Adams said.
"We couldn't compete at the top end of the Premiership, but we could at the bottom end wage-wise.
"We've taken a few players from Scotland and they've all done really well for me - [Graham] Carey, [Jake] Jervis."
Adams's side, which is three points behind League Two leaders Doncaster, also contains former Partick Thistle defender Gary Miller and ex-Livingston goalkeeper Marc McCallum.
Plymouth lost the League Two play-off final last year to AFC Wimbledon, but that set-back did not impact on this season's promotion campaign.
"Last year, we exceeded expectations, we made the play-off final after a very good season and failed to get up," Adams told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"Over the summer we changed the squad dramatically, we signed 14 players and we went again. We took in a new freshness to the squad and it was about building a better squad than last year.
"The city is thriving, the population is around about 300,000-350,000 and that's only in close proximity. We had a full house of 14,000 [against Newport County] and we take on average about 1,000-1,500 to away games.
"They've been in the Championship and they've fallen through the divisions after being in administration and they want to try to get back to League One and we've been able to deliver that."
Adams was involved in a confrontation with fellow Scot Steve Evans during a recent game against Mansfield Town and he admits there is a competitive edge between the Scottish managers in England.
He also expects to return to Scottish football at some point in his career, having previously managed Ross County twice and been assistant manager at Hibernian.
"We went to Mansfield and they were pushing to get into the play-off positions," Adams explained. "Steve just had a problem with the referee and the two benches had a go at each other. It finished after that.
"It's always good to come up against Scottish managers. I've done it in the past - Jackie McNamara, Darren Ferguson and Steve Evans. We all have a good rivalry.
"One day I'll be back in Scotland managing, there's no doubt about that. But I enjoy my time in England, it's a different experience for me. I had a terrific time going up against Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool twice in the FA Cup and that experience is very helpful."
