Data from energy analysts WeatherEnergy indicated wind farms provided 699,684MWh of electricity to the National Grid.
They said the total was enough to power 79% of average Scottish households, equivalent to 1.9 million homes.
The energy output was up by 15% compared with the same time last year.
WeatherEnergy said on eight days in April, wind turbines generated enough electricity to supply 100% of Scottish homes.
Karen Robinson of WeatherEnergy said: "After a relatively slow start to the year, Scotland's wind power output is back on the up thanks to some powerful winds during the month.
