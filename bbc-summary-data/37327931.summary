Karl Swift, 33, from South Yorkshire, was found by police in New Road in the early hours of Friday.
He was taken to hospital but died on Saturday morning, a spokesman for West Midlands Police said.
Two men aged 23 and 58, also from South Yorkshire, were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm on Friday but later released on bail.
A force spokesman said they believe there was an "incident" at the William Shenstone pub before Mr Swift left, and are appealing for witnesses.
