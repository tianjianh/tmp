His single One Dance is now only two weeks away from breaking the record for the longest uninterrupted reign at the top of the chart.
Bryan Adams's single Everything I Do (I Do It For You), which held the number one spot for 16 weeks in 1991, is the current record holder.
The last single to notch up 15 weeks at number one was Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around, released in 1994.
One Dance owes much of its continued success to its popularity on streaming sites.
The song received 4.33 million streams this week - equivalent to 43,300 sales.
It has also been boosted by its absence from YouTube, which has prompted music fans to download or stream the song in order to hear it.
Cover versions of the song are available to listen to on the video sharing website, but Drake's original version has yet to be uploaded by his official account.
Drake's closest competitor this week was Jonas Blue ft Cooper's single Perfect Strangers - which climbed one place to number two.
Don't Let Me Down by Chainsmokers ft Daya dropped to number three - while Calum Scott's Dancing On My Own and Kungs vs Cookin' on Three Burners' This Girl held their positions at numbers four and five respectively.
This week's highest new entry was Katy Perry's Rise - which landed at 25.
Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer also scored a new entry, with Girls Talk Boys, taken from the new Ghostbusters movie, debuting at 28.
On the album chart - which celebrates its 60th birthday this week - Michael Kiwanuka debuted at number one with his second record Love & Hate.
His previous peak on the album chart was in 2012, when his first album Home reached number four.
Adele's album 25 held its number two placing this week, while Christine & The Queens leapt five spots to hit a new peak at number three with Chaleur Humaine.
Drake's album Views and Coldplay's A Head Full Of Dreams both dropped a place to numbers four and five.
This week's other new entries included Good Charlotte, who reached number 13 with Youth Authority, and Jeff Beck's first album in six years Loud Hailer - which entered at 27.
