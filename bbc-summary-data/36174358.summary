[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four English football fans have each been fined £1,500 for fighting in a Glasgow hotel after a row over tickets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men were staying at the Thistle Hotel in Cambridge Street for the Scotland v England game at Celtic Park.
They admitted shouting and taking part in a fight on 18 November 2014 after finding out no tickets were available.
Those fined were George Policelli, 34, from Oxford, Darren Bigglestone, 48, from Berkshire, Charles Kennett, 35, and Lee George, 36, both of Portsmouth.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that because game was being shown live at the hotel it was treated as an offence under the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.
Sheriff Bill Totten fined the four £1,500 each but told them he was not going to impose a football banning order.
He told them: "The catalyst of this incident, as it has been presented to me was the difficulty with football tickets and is plain from everything I have been told it is recognised the incident had been sparked by the conduct of someone else."
England won the friendly, which was held at Celtic Park, 3-1.
Four other men had not guilty pleas accepted in relation to the incident.
