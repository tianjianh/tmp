[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering a schoolboy after becoming infatuated with his teenage girlfriend told a jury he did not think he was "too clever to be caught" by the police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Thomson, 19, was giving evidence at Carlisle Crown Court where he is on trial for murdering Jordan Watson.
The 14 year old was stabbed to death in a Carlisle cemetery in June.
Mr Thomson and co-defendants Brahnn Finley, 19, and Daniel Johnston, 20, all deny murder.
Prosecutor Simon Medland QC said text messages to friends showed Mr Thomson boasting that he would not be caught.
The accused claimed the messages had been "a joke" and did not relate to Jordan's death.
Mr Medland said: "You got out one of your knives and you told Jordan Watson to shut up.
"You pulled it across his throat when he was screaming for his life."
"No," replied Mr Thomson.
"You thought you were too good," said Mr Medland.
Again, Thomson replied: "No".
He also denies hating Jordan and referring to him as "that little runt".
"You hated him. You despised him," said Mr Medland.
"No, I didn't," Mr Thomson replied.
The prosecution claim he killed the youngster because he was infatuated with Jordan's girlfriend.
The girl, who is now 15 and cannot be identified, said in police interviews shown to the jury that Mr Thomson told her he wished Jordan was dead.
Last week, the jury was told a search of Mr Thomson's home revealed a blood-stained Gurkha knife and a large collection of weapons.
It is alleged his co-defendants were present at Upperby Cemetery during the murder to "lend support".
Mr Thomson, of Upperby Road, Carlisle; Mr Finley, of Furze Street, Carlisle, and Mr Johnston, of Petteril Bank Road, Carlisle, all deny murder.
The trial continues.
