[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A German court has sentenced a former security guard to life imprisonment for molesting and murdering two young boys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One victim was a four-year-old Bosnian migrant, snatched in October from a refugee registration centre in Berlin. The other boy disappeared last July.
The judge said the guard, identified only as 33-year-old Silvio S, kidnapped and sexually abused the boys, then killed them to cover up the abuse.
Silvio S was arrested after his mother recognised him in CCTV footage.
In the court in Potsdam he admitted both murders and expressed remorse.
The life term means he will have to serve at least 15 years before seeking early release.
Elias, aged six, was abducted from a Potsdam playground, near Berlin, last July. Later the boy was murdered and buried in a rented garden plot. His body was found after the defendant led police to it.
Mohamed Januzi, aged four, came to Germany with his family from Bosnia-Hercegovina. He was murdered in October.
As the murder was being described in court, Mohamed's mother stood up and screamed at the defendant: "What have you done with my child?"
The German news website RBB said court officials restrained her and led her away at that point.
