B. Traits: Will someone die at my gig?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ B. Traits is "terrified" someone will die at one of her gigs from taking drugs.

"There's always that thought in the back of my mind," she told Newsbeat.
"I spend every weekend at events, in raves, at festivals and I play music for these people and it's always the same scenario.
"There are lots of young people noticeably taking drugs and I just think the environment they're in could be a bit safer."
In a new BBC Three documentary - How Safe Are My Drugs?  - she speaks to people taking so-called legal highs, which she says is "scary and concerning".
"It's the legal high stuff that concerns me the most because they're such new substances and we just don't know what any of the effects are going to be."
Legal highs - or new psychoactive substances - are manufactured to cause effects similar to illegal drugs. They can be sold openly because it takes time for governments to outlaw them. Once they are banned, the makers change the formula slightly to get around the law.
Deaths linked to these drugs have increased sharply in recent years, with 97 reported in 2012.
Over the summer 20 UK music festivals, including T in the Park and Bestival, banned the sale of legal highs by traders.
B. Traits, whose real name is Brianna Price, says she thinks club venues can be doing more to help make sure people know what's in the drugs they're taking.
"The younger generation are always going to be curious, they're always going to dabble and try drugs.
"It would be amazing if you were going to take a drug and you could take an amount of that drug to a drug testing facility on-site.
"They could tell you what's in it, how strong it is and what would happen to you if you took too much of it.
"We have to accept the fact people have been doing drugs for years. They will continue to be curious and continue to try things."
The safety of drugs is something personal to B. Traits.
The Canadian DJ, 28, told Newsbeat about an ex-boyfriend who took some cocaine in Ibiza but didn't know what it was cut with and got really sick.
"I believe it was cut with Levamisole, which is a cattle de-worming agent. It's supposed to enhance the high of cocaine, which is why they cut it with that drug.
"It destroys your white blood cells and unfortunately for my ex, in that amount of time he took quite a number of flights and was in the club and just contracted all these different types of sicknesses.
"He got really, really sick, incredibly sick and we just didn't know what was wrong with him."
B. Traits says she's still in touch with him, but he's not the person he was when they were together.
"He contracted glandular fever, his liver was in a really rough shape. When anyone gets really sick like that it changes you. He wasn't able to work, he wasn't able to do anything for months.
"It was quite emotionally draining.
"I was terrified and really worried about him and just wanted to be there for him as much as I could and he kind of just shut me out. He wouldn't let me come and see him. He just wasn't that same person."
How Safe are My Drugs? airs on BBC Three on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.
