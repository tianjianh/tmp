Younus Khan & Misbah-ul-Haq bow out of Test cricket as Pakistan face West Indies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq and legendary batsman Younus Khan were honoured by team-mates and opponents as they played their final Test innings.

With Pakistan in their second innings on the penultimate day of the third Test against West Indies in Dominica, the veteran pair came together at 57-3.
But Misbah, 42, was caught for only two before Younus, 39, top-edged a sweep on 35 from the last ball before tea.
Between them, the duo have scored 15,321 runs in 193 Test appearances.
Both received guards of honour after their final innings.
Misbah announced last month that he would retire from international cricket after this three-Test series in the Caribbean - which is level at 1-1 - shortly after he and Younus were named as two of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year.
Younus, Pakistan's leading Test run-scorer who captained them to World Twenty20 success in England in 2009, revealed his own retirement plans two days later.
The match itself is intriguingly poised going into the final day, with West Indies on 7-1, chasing a victory target of 304 as Pakistan bid to seal a series win in the Caribbean for the first time in their history.
