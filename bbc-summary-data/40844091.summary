He was "very quickly overpowered and arrested" and no-one was hurt, the company that runs the landmark said.
France has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 attacks in the capital that left 130 people dead.
The incident at the Eiffel tower happened at 23:30 pm (21:30 GMT) on Saturday night.
After the arrest, police evacuated the tower.
How France is wrestling with jihadist terror
The detained man, wearing a Paris Saint-Germain football shirt, shouted "Allahu Akbar" - God is greatest - as he broke through security, a source told AFP news agency.
The tower was lit up with PSG's team colours and hosted a screen displaying a message welcoming Brazilian star Neymar to the club.
French prosecutors have opened a counter-terrorism investigation because of the suspect's statements to police and his apparent radicalisation.
The unnamed source said the knifeman was aged about 19 and had a history of psychological problems.
He told investigators that he wanted to attack a soldier and that he had been in contact with a member of the Islamic State terror group, the source added.
