Her Majesty's relatives discussed her music taste in BBC documentary Our Queen: 90 Musical Years.
"The Queen loves the theatre and musicals like Showboat, Oklahoma! and Annie Get Your Gun," her cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, told the programme.
"These were the tunes that remained in one's head and were very danceable to."
She added: "The Queen is a fantastic dancer. She's got great rhythm."
Speaking to the Radio Times, the programme's presenter, Eve Pollard, described the Queen's music taste as "mainstream, no airs and graces."
A playlist featuring the Queen's 10 favourite songs has been unveiled as part of the BBC Radio 2 documentary.
In addition to songs from musicals, they include The White Cliffs Of Dover by Vera Lynn and Cheek to Cheek by Fred Astaire.
More recent tracks on the list include Sing, performed by Gary Barlow and the Commonwealth Band featuring the Military Wives - which was co-written by Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Lady Anson told the programme the Queen is particularly knowledgeable about military music and is a fan of pipe bands.
"We did a lot of singing at Kensington Palace," Lady Anson said.
"Nobody thought it was odd after dinner if we put on a record and all sang Doing the Lambeth Walk, so music has always been part of her life."
Our Queen: 90 Musical Years, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 12 June at 7pm.
