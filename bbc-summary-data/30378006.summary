A British man who went missing on a stag weekend in Prague has been found dead in a river in the Czech capital, a family member has said.

Karl Law, a 34-year-old father-of-one from Fareham, Hampshire, disappeared on 15 November on the second night of the trip with 12 other men.
Lee Cross, the party's stag, told BBC News a body found in the River Vltava on Sunday was identified as his cousin.
His family had run a campaign and hired an investigator to find him.
Mr Cross said he and the family were "devastated" at the news.
"It's been awful. I know people say these things, but he was such a lovely person," he said.
"He was amazing. He was the kindest person you could meet and didn't have a bad bone in his body. He's a great dad to Lenny and a great partner.
"He was the dream cousin."
Mr Cross had been due to marry on 29 December but has now postponed his wedding until March to allow family and friends to grieve.
A group of about 20 friends and family members came together earlier to have a drink in Mr Law's memory and celebrate his life.
Hundreds of tributes have also been paid to Mr Law on the Facebook page set up to find him.
Kez Abbatt said: "I'm so sorry to hear this tragic news. I'm literally speechless, was convinced that you'd find him and bring him home safe and sound in time for Christmas! Deepest sympathy to you all."
But a funeral is unlikely to take place before Christmas because Czech authorities plan to keep the body for up to four weeks.
Family and friends had initially believed the body found by police was not that of Mr Law, who worked in the building trade and had a fiancÃ©e and son, Lenny, who turned three in November.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Prague and are in touch with the local authorities, we are in close contact with the family and are providing consular assistance at this difficult time."
Thousands of pounds were raised through events to support the family's search efforts and more than 14,000 people liked a Facebook page set up to find him.
At the end of November, relatives looking for Mr Law had found the body of a Czech man, who proved to be unconnected to Mr Law's disappearance.
Family had criticised Czech police for what they said was a lack of help in finding Mr Law.
Mr Law's mother Sue and her brother joined the search on Sunday.
