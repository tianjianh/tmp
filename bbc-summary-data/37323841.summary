A 68-year-old Newry man has won more than £1m on the National Lottery.

Jim McLoughlin, a former plumber's mate, had not realised he had won for almost a week.
Mr McLoughlin bought the ticket for the EuroMillions draw on 26 August when the weather had been cool.
After putting the ticket in his coat pocket he promptly forgot all about it and, due to warmer temperatures, did not need his coat again for a couple of days.
When the typically erratic Northern Irish weather shifted back to chilly he found his winning ticket.
But the Newry man still did not know he had won anything.
It was only during a shopping trip when he happened to ask a member of staff to check his ticket that his new found wealth became known to him.
Mr McLoughlin said: "I asked the young lady behind the counter to check it for me.  She duly took the ticket and once she put it into the machine a noise went off - the two of just looked at each other wondering what was going on?
"It never once occurred to me that I was about to become a millionaire."
When he got home the dazed lottery winner rang the National Lottery.
"My mind was totally buzzing, I just couldn't process what was happening to me", he said.
When asked what he planned to do with his winnings Mr McLoughlin said:
"I want to help some friends and family out.  I'd also like to buy my flat and totally renovate it and maybe buy a new car as well."
