The undefeated former world super-middleweight and light-heavyweight champion says he could not face getting down to his fighting weight.
"Losing the weight and getting punched in the head - nope, don't fancy it. I've done my bit," said the 43-year-old Welshman.
But Calzaghe is keen to become a manager and has applied for a licence.
"Promoting is a no-no - that's hard work. Training is a full-time job, but I don't have time to do that full-time," he said in an interview for the BBC Sport Wales programme.
"But managing is something I'll be good at. I was self-managed for a lot of my career as well so I know both sides. That will be perfect for me."
Calzaghe reigned as a world champion for more than 11 years, and quit the ring with a glittering record of 46 wins from 46 fights.
That career is the subject of a new feature-length documentary called "Mr Calzaghe" which goes on general release on 23 November.
"It looks at my career, my relationships with my father Enzo and my sons. It was quite emotional for me watching it," he added.
"It crams 25 years into 90 minutes - it's surreal."
Calzaghe hopes the film shows the importance of his family played in his success and the role "people that support you even when you're down" had when he was still an active fighter.
That is a role Calzaghe himself wants to fulfil now that his eldest son Joe Jr, who is 21 years old, has decided to take up boxing.
"I never really really pushed my boys into boxing but I guess it's in the blood," he said.
"I don't mind as long as he takes it seriously and he's happy.
"I can see he's got the dedication then I encourage him. Because there's a lot of pressure on him anyway because of who is father is, so I just say be yourself and just have fun and do your best."
Calzaghe stands alone as the most successful boxer to come out of Wales.
He announced his retirement after comfortably outpointing Hall-of-Fame boxer Roy Jones Jnr in Madison Square Gardens in 2008.
The Welshman says he knew before that fight that he would not step into the ring again.
"Before the Roy Jones fight I knew I was going to retire because I couldn't train, my hands had gone and the hunger had gone," he said.
"If you know you're just fighting for the money and you're not fighting for the championship you're going to lose, so I thought 'it's time for me to quit'."
He regrets the fact that Jones has continued to fight - and is attempting to fight for a title in Russia against Welshman Enzo Maccarinelli in Russia in December.
"Roy Jones Jr should have retired a while back," added Calzaghe.
"He was one of the best fighters pound-for pound and that's what I say about it's not nice to see fighters still fighting when they shouldn't be."
Current IBF world featherweight champion Lee Selby from Barry has impressed Calzaghe.
Selby, 28, took the crown from Evgeny Gradovich in May this year, but surprised the former super-middleweight champion by choosing to make his first defence in America.
That turned out to be a tough points win over Fernando Montiel.
"Having just won the title and to just jump straight into the States that's a wake-up call," said Calzaghe.
"And that's a tough division he's in, so I think he should take it gradually. I've been impressed; he had to dig deep in that last fight. He didn't fight his best, but a win's a win and that's all that matters."
Calzaghe was also impressed with the latest performance by former world light-heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly.
The Caerphilly fighter lost on points to former world champion Andrzej Fonfara, but gave a gutsy display despite of suffering a facial injury.
"It's a fight he could have won," said Calzaghe. "He showed that he's got a massive heart, a lot of courage.
"If he hadn't have broken his nose in the seventh round he could have won the fight just if he'd used his boxing skills a bit more.
"And if they have a rematch I think he'll win."
