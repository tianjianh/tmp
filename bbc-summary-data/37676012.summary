The 24-year-old Gambian has twice been on loan since joining the Swans in 2014, but impressed in their 3-2 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday.
"I think he's just scratching the surface. My gosh, this is a player with talent," said Bradley.
Swansea face Watford in American Bradley's first home game as manager on Saturday.
Before then, the Premier League's first American manager intends to closely guide Barrow during training.

He will concentrate on trying to improve Modou's tactical awareness and decision-making.
"We worked at it in training (before facing Arsenal) and I was pleased that what I saw was positive, for sure," added Bradley.
"I already told him that 'I'm not going to be easy around you next week. This is just the start'."
Barrow's cross allowed Borja to tap in at Emirates Stadium to set up a tense finish.
Soon after, Xhaka was sent off for a trip on Barrow, who was replaced by Angel Rangel in the 84th minute.
