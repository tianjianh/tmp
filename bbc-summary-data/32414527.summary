River Thames garden bridge judicial review backed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners opposed to the planned Garden Bridge over the River Thames in London have won the right to challenge a council's approval for it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The judicial review of Lambeth Council's decision to give planning permission for the Â£175m bridge will be heard in June.
Questions were raised about bridge's funding and its impact on views across the river of St Paul's Cathedral.
Plans were backed by Lambeth and Westminster councils last year.
Lambeth said it would benefit "both the local and wider London economy".
The London Garden Bridge Trust said the project would greatly benefit the capital, linking cultural centres and tourist attractions on both banks of the river.
But, local resident Michael Ball fears the impact would be devastating, and claimed the council unlawfully granted planning permission for the bridge.
He is a former director of Waterloo Community Development Group (WCDG), which has campaigned on planning policies in the area since the early 1970s.
Mayor Boris Johnson approved plans for the bridge in December after the councils granted planning permission.
Actress Joanna Lumley came up with the idea for the crossing, which will link Temple with the Southbank, and it has been designed by London 2012 cauldron creator Thomas Heatherwick.
It is estimated seven million trips per year will be made across the bridge.
