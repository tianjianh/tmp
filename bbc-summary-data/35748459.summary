The six-nation tournament, running from 10-17 June, will take place at Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
The International Hockey Federation (FIH) switched hosts after cancelling its contract with the Confederacion Argentina de Hockey (CAH).
The women's event was already due to be held at the same venue from 18-26 June.
An FIH spokesman said: "FIH had to terminate all contractual agreements with the Confederacion Argentina de Hockey (CAH) following CAH's position that it is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations in regards to television rights, sponsorship and the hosting of events."
The men's tournament, taking place less than two months before the start of the Rio Olympic Games, will feature Great Britain, world champions Australia, Olympic and defending champions Germany, Belgium, India and South Korea.
GB will face Australia in the opening match.
Six nations also compete in the women's event: Britain, world and Olympic champions Netherlands, defending champions Argentina, USA, Australia and New Zealand.
Tickets for the men's tournament go on sale on 15 March while the women's tickets are already on sale.
England Hockey chief executive Sally Munday said: "The opportunity to host this prestigious event was one not to be missed, particularly given the excitement building around the Olympics in Rio."
