Claire Sykes believes her husband Darren, 44, started the blaze at the house in Penistone on 22 October.
Son Paul, nine, died in the fire along with his father, while Jack, 12, died six days later in hospital.
Police have said the blaze in Tennyson Close was started deliberately and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
Speaking to the Mirror, she said: "I want people to know they were murdered by their father. He killed them because of pure evil spite.
"They had no chance. They were like rats in a trap and they fell for his cold and calculated plan."
She told the newspaper her husband lured the children to the former marital home and started the fire deliberately in revenge for her splitting up with him in April.
Writing on Facebook, Mrs Sykes paid tribute to her sons.
She wrote: "Please please enjoy Halloween and carve pumpkins for the boys treasure every minute you share as a family."
She continued: "My boys were murdered by their father but he never had their hearts and they will stay with me forever xx.
"I don't know how I will carry on without my boys.
"My heart is broken in two but knowing that so many people are thinking of them makes me proud to have been their mum."
