[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 40 posts could be made redundant at Northern Ireland broadcaster UTV.

The broadcaster is controlled by ITV, which bought the business last year.
The jobs at risk are understood to be primarily in the sales department but also include library staff, online staff and 'playout' (transmission services). News is not affected.
A UTV spokesperson said a total of 43 roles are under threat - potentially a quarter of the workforce.
She said staff had been informed of the restructuring plans, which are understood to be linked to the proposed sale of UTV Ireland to Virgin Media.
UTV Belfast currently has a staff of 138.
The spokesperson said: "From today, 43 roles are at risk of redundancy.
"That's 27 new roles put at risk today on top of the 16 in playout that were already at risk from July. There are eight redeployment opportunities, so that's potentially 35 job losses - potentially a 25% decrease in workforce."
