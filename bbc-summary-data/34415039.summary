'Drunk in charge of pram' woman admits endangering child

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted endangering a toddler by losing control of a pram while drunk and on drugs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fiona Winter admitted pushing a pram containing a three-year-old girl onto a road in Perth without looking and while under the influence of drink and drugs on 23 April this year.
The 35-year-old, of Dundee, pleaded guilty to exposing the child to "the likelihood of unnecessary suffering" at Perth railway station.
Sentence was deferred for reports.
Perth Sheriff Court heard Winter was supposed to be looking after the child when she was seen staggering around the streets of Perth.
Police were called, and found she was heavily under the influence of drink and drugs.
The court heard Winter has 11 previous convictions dating back 15 years, including for possession of heroin, shoplifting, assault, theft, breach of the peace and making false statements to police.
