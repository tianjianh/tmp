The boy's family has met medics to discuss plans for him to be sent from Malaga to the Czech Republic for Proton Beam Therapy treatment.
The Proton Therapy Centre has arranged for a medically-equipped private plane to take Ashya, five, from Spain.
Doctors in Prague are to meet on Monday to review Ashya's medical notes and decide whether he can travel.
The family's lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, said: "He is in perfect condition to travel at the moment.
"He is playing with toys, with his parents, with his brother, and we are preparing the last documentation to travel."
Doctors in Malaga have now seen documents showing the Prague clinic has accepted the five-year-old as a patient.
An expert panel of physicians have agreed to discuss the transportation details and additional treatment needed on Monday at 07:00 BST.
Parents Brett and Naghemeh King were given permission by the High Court to take him to the Czech Republic for Proton Beam Therapy.
The Proton Therapy Centre in Prague said it would be ready to treat Ashya four to five days days after they have carried out further tests and adapted a new treatment plan.
A spokeswoman for the clinic said legal and administrative requirements first had to be met.
Ashya's grandmother, Patricia King, has meanwhile condemned the way his parents have been treated by the British authorities as "inhuman" and "barbaric".
