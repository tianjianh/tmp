Leaders in gloves off over Type 26 frigate delay claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs might be away for the summer, but that doesn't mean political debate is in recess. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson used Twitter on Wednesday to show there's plenty to discuss outside the Scottish Parliament chamber.

Ms Davidson responded to a tweet by SNP MP George Kerevan regarding economics in an independent Scotland. That had followed on from a heated Twitter debate about whether the Type 26 frigates building programme on Clyde was being delayed.
Nicola Sturgeon didn't take long to weigh in on the conversation, asking Ms Davidson's thoughts on claims of stalling over the shipbuilding timetable.
Ruth Davidson retaliated to Ms Sturgeon's comment by saying there were no plans to build any frigates on the Clyde in an independent Scotland.
Commitments to build the fleet were given ahead of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when then Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said only a vote to remain would guarantee shipyard jobs.
The Ministry of Defence signed a Â£859m development deal in February towards the manufacturing of the Global Combat Ships, which the UK government said would safeguard 1,700 jobs in the UK. Ms Davidson insisted the design of the ships was not yet complete.
Silence from the First Minister prompted Ms Davidson to press her for answers.
Nicola Sturgeon deflected the Tory leader's questions on independence.
Ms Davidson's retort made reference to weekly First Minister's Questions at Holyrood.
The exchange came to an amicable end, as each party leader wished the other an enjoyable holiday.
