Marine wildlife experts believe dolphins attacked a young pilot whale which was found stranded on a beach in Skye.

Vets had to put down the badly injured three-year-old female calf, which was discovered on Tuesday at Dunvegan.
Teeth marks were found on the whale's body, flippers and dorsal fin.
The Scottish Marine Animals Stranding Scheme and Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust suspect the calf was attacked by bottlenose dolphins.
Scotland is home to the world's most northerly resident population of bottlenose dolphins.
On the east coast, they feed and breed the Moray Firth and North Sea.
Charlie Phillips, a Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer, said the injuries may have been caused while the dolphins and whale were playing, or inflicted in an act of aggression.
He said: "Dolphins and whales do interact in the marine environment and this is part and parcel of their natural behaviour.
"Dolphins are wonderful creatures but people should remember that they are not these fluffy cartoon characters, they have a dark side too."
