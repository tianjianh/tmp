The 70-year-old Scot broke the news while in Glasgow for Celtic's match against Barcelona.
During an interview with Sky Sports News he said: "I got the clearance on Wednesday on my cancer so I'm OK."
Last month his spokeswoman said he had undergone minor surgery for early-stage prostate cancer. He has also been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
The spokeswoman said he was receiving "appropriate treatment" after being assessed as having the initial symptoms of Parkinson's, but she added he would continue to perform on stage and screen.
Connolly started his showbusiness career as a folk singer, developing the stand-up act that made him famous and led to a career in television and film.
He went on to perform sell-out stand-up shows around the world, present a series of documentaries and become an in-demand character actor, starring alongside Judi Dench in Mrs Brown and playing a dwarf warrior in the Hobbit movie.
He is married to New Zealand-born actress and psychologist Pamela Stephenson and has five children.
