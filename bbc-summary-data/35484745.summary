Scottish League One ins and outs - January 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic's rivals must have watched with envy as the Scottish League One rivals strengthened their ranks with two defenders with top-flight experience.

The full-time club added Brad McKay, on loan from St Johnstone, and Craig Reid, released by Motherwell.
At least second-top Ayr United managed to hold on to influential midfielder Ryan Stevenson, who was allowed to leave Partick Thistle after a spell on loan at Somerset Park.
Fourth-top Airdrieonians, under new head coach Eddie Wolecki Black, and relegation-troubled Cowdenbeath have experienced the busiest turnover during January.
Wolecki Black, looking to repeat his success with the Glasgow City women's team, has reshaped the squad inherited from Forfar Athletic-bound Gary Bollan, with former Livingston midfielders Jacob Esposito and Hugo Faria notable arrivals.
They will be chased for a promotion spot by a Stranraer side bolstered by the return of wing talisman Willie Gibson from Dumbarton.
Stenhousemuir's promotion hopes will not have been helped by midfielder Harry Monaghan accepting a full-time move to Derry City and striker Jon McShane's exit to Australian club Hume City.
