County Championship: Glamorgan and Sussex frustrated by rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan finished a frustrating day three on 149-2, a lead of 118 over Sussex, after rain and bad light cut play to just 26.3 overs.

Will Bragg and David Lloyd added 72 for the third wicket to steady home nerves after their first-innings collapse.
Jacques Rudolph made an elegant 47 before being trapped lbw by Steve Magoffin (2-30) just before lunch.
Fine weather is forecast for the final day, with Sussex needing to win to keep alive their outside promotion hopes.
It could take an agreement between the two captains to contrive an agreed declaration and a run chase for Sussex on the final afternoon.
Glamorgan batsman Will Bragg told BBC Wales Sport:
"Tricky conditions (for batsmen), ideal conditions for seam bowlers, overcast with a bit of rain about.
"But I think we've come though a very tough period and done a lot of the hard work getting their seamers into their second and third spells, so hopefully we can have a chance of winning.
"With 96 overs left, I think we'll start off the day as normal, they'll hunt for early wickets.
"But these guys (Sussex) are chasing a few wins while we don't have anything to lose, so there may be a bit of manufacturing a declaration."
Sussex head coach Mark Davis told BBC Sussex:
"It's been very frustrating, the first two days have been proper cricket, this is disappointing but we'll get a game in (on the final day.)
"We haven't thought (about the two captains agreeing a target), we'll see in the morning.
"Draws aren't good enough, with (leaders) Essex doing their bit (winning) against Leicestershire, we've got to win otherwise we'll get too far behind."
