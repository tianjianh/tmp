The Welsh-qualified second-row has already linked up with Blues and is available for their Pro12 clash in Glasgow on 7 January.
Blues head coach, Danny Wilson, said 22-year-old Edwards would provide essential cover.
"BJ is a promising, Welsh qualified player and has represented Bristol in the Premiership A-League," said Wilson.
"With George Earle's suspension and the injuries we have in the back-five of the pack it was important we brought in another player.
"He will provide much needed cover for a few weeks while the likes of Josh Turnbull and Seb Davies are side-lined."
Edwards joined Bristol from from Eastern Suburbs in Australia in the summer.
Regarded as a physical and athletic second-row, Edwards previously represented Queensland County before coming through the Eastern Suburbs ranks.
