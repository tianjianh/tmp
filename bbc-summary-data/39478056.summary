The government money will be used to revamp Ness Point in Lowestoft, Suffolk, which is currently marked only by a circular stone plaque.
The council hopes to turn the semi-derelict promenade area into an attraction similar to Land's End and John O'Groats.
Ness Point visitor centre will celebrate the area's maritime heritage.
New cycle links and footpaths are also planned along with an area dedicated to cultural events such as festivals.
It is one of 30 coastal projects to benefit from up to £40m of government funds.
Up to 250 coastal communities bid for a share the Department for Communities and Local Government funding, which Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said was to "back the Great British Coast... to create new jobs, boost economic growth and increase tourism".
"There's a range of exciting projects set to benefit across the country, from a new conference centre for Blackpool to new beach huts and lifeguards for Hastings.
"This new funding will help attract even more tourists to our coast and help our seaside towns and coastal areas thrive," he said.
Coastal tourism is worth £8bn to the economy each year, Mr Javid added.
Also set to benefit is the West Norfolk Coastal Corridor, where cycling paths and walking trails will be improved and Ipswich town centre, where £750,000 will boost an £8m scheme to regenerate the Suffolk waterfront and dock area.
Funding has also been secured for a new conference centre planned for Blackpool's Winter Gardens, and on Merseyside, Southport Pier will use its share of the money to help promote the area to birdwatchers.
Money has also been awarded to Plymouth History Centre to improve visitor attractions ahead of the Mayflower 400 celebrations in 2020, and the White Rock area of Hastings will receive funds to boost lifeguard numbers and build new beach huts.
Since 2012, £120m has been invested in more than 200 projects through the Coastal Communities Fund across the UK, the government said.
