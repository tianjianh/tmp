The 650 statues called Figures and made by Bristol-based Liz Crow, represented all the UK's constituencies.
Ms Crow wanted people to think about the effects of continued austerity on people at "the sharp end" ahead of the recent general election.
The artist said saying goodbye to the figures had been "emotional".
Ms Crow planned to take the figures through a life cycle.
It began on the banks of the River Avon at Shirehampton in Bristol where the mud was gathered.
This was then taken to the banks of the River Thames in London where the artist moulded the figures over 11 days and nights while sitting opposite the Houses of Parliament.
The figures were taken on a mobile exhibition tour starting in Trafalgar Square then on to David Cameron's constituency office in Witney, Oxfordshire, and returning to Bristol.
Before making their final journey by boat to be scattered over the sea near Portishead, the figures were taken to a brick makers to be ground up.
"It was really emotional," said Ms Crow.
"I had such a strong sense of what the figures represented."
As the pieces were thrown into the sea, Ms Crow said she was thinking about "what it is to be human and the sort of society we want".
She believes the election result shows society thinks "some people are more significant than others".
