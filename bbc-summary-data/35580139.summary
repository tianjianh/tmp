Chris Simpson says he is frustrated with his England National Championship semi-final loss to James Willstrop.

Guernsey's fourth seed has never beaten the former world number one, but was three points away from victory.
Willstrop eventually prevailed 11-5, 8-11, 8-11, 11-7, 11-8 in 80 minutes.
"I've played James quite a lot of times in the past few years and I'm coming closer and closer, but that elusive victory against him in a big tournament seems to still evade me," he said.
Simpson had beaten Joel Makin and Ben Coleman in the previous two rounds, before coming up against second-seed Willstrop, who eventually lost to top-seed Nick Matthew in the final.
"I wanted this match more than I have for a long time," Simpson told BBC Sport.
"Being in the finals of the National Championships is a big thing, so it was very frustrating, but I felt like I played good squash and I can't be too disappointed with my performance.
"I've known throughout this season that I'm playing well and these are the sorts of players I want to start beating."
