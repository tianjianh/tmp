[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rail system booming despite prophecies of decline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new interactive map has revealed how, against all the odds, the railways have witnessed a stratospheric revival in popularity in the past two decades.

Put together by the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), it's measured all the people going into and out of 2,500 British stations since 1997-98.
Check out how your station is doing.
Twenty years ago, around the time the network was privatised, 1.45 billion clocked in and out. Last year, that figure had nearly doubled, to 2.75 billion.
The CBT also says:
The map also shows that growth has been uneven across Britain. London and the South East are booming. So are Leeds and Birmingham. But growth in Humberside's been thinner.
Fun train facts
Apropos of nothing other than giving you some good pub facts, here are some cracking things I read in Rail Magazine recently, based on a book called 'The Railways: Nation, Network and People' by Simon Bradley.
Did you know that:
"Investment has tended to focus on relieving overcrowding in south east England, while leaving other parts of the country in a time warp," says the CBT's Andrew Allen.
"Our mapping shows areas which are strong candidates for growth and where targeted investment in better services and even new stations could make a real difference. The government needs to be braver, both in anticipating the potential for growth and in getting more places onto the network."
This rapid expansion has left parts of the system unable to cope.
Punctuality has been poor in recent years. We've got a Victorian network, ravaged by decades of underinvestment, which is only now being put right and is, understandably, struggling to squeeze in record numbers of people.
No-one really saw this massive growth in numbers coming.
When the conservatives privatised the system twenty years ago, just about everyone assumed they were managing the decline of train travel.
And the rot set in a long time before that.
More than 3,000 miles of track disappeared in the 1950s and the government still wanted to axe a lot more. The following decade, ministers asked a grey civil servant from the Isle of Sheppey, Dr Beeching, to come up with a blueprint for the future.
He recommended axing another third of the network - 5,000 miles of track, including hundreds of branch lines and 2,363 stations. It was assumed we'd all use cars instead.
But when I met him recently, the new chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy was evangelical about the future. Money's going in. People are back. Services are better (mostly).
So it turns out that reports about the death of the train were greatly exaggerated.
