Contador pulled out of the Tour during Sunday's ninth stage and says his recovery will take four weeks. The Olympic road race begins on 6 August.
"To reach them in optimal condition looks like it will not be possible," said Contador.
He is now targeting the Vuelta a Espana on 20 August for his comeback.
