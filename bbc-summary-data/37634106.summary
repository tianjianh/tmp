Uefa rejected Legia Warsaw's appeal against a stadium ban and the Polish club must host Real Madrid behind closed doors in the Champions League.

The ban followed crowd trouble during Legia's 6-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in September.
Fans were seen trying to attack away supporters, covering their faces and using pepper spray against security staff.
"The appeal lodged by Legia Warsaw has been dismissed," a Uefa statement read.
European football's governing body added: "Consequently, the Uefa control, ethics and disciplinary body's decision of 28 September 2016 is confirmed."
A charge of racist behaviour was dropped after a meeting of Uefa's disciplinary committee.
However, Legia have been fined Â£69,000 in relation to the remaining five charges, which included setting off fireworks, blocking stairways and throwing objects.
Legia Warsaw are without a point from two games and sit bottom of Group F.
The Polish side travel to Real Madrid on Tuesday, 18 October before the return match on 2 November at the empty Army Stadium.
