[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On-loan Kilmarnock duo Luke Hendrie and Sean Longstaff may miss Saturday's final Scottish Premiership match of the season against Ross County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burnley full-back Hendrie has a tight hamstring while Newcastle midfielder Longstaff is suffering with a dead leg.
County's lengthy injury list has grown since their midweek victory over Hamilton Academical.
Midfielders Michael Gardyne and Martin Woods are both struggling to be fit after going off injured against Accies.
Ryan Dow, Andrew Davies, Paul Quinn, Jay McEveley, Chris Burke and Tony Dingwall all remain out, although Ian McShane could make his first appearance since December after recovering from a long-standing groin complaint.
Both Kilmarnock and Ross County ensured their top-flight status after positive post-split results. Killie will leapfrog the Staggies in seventh place with victory, to finish top of the bottom six.
Kilmarnock winger Jordan Jones: "It's been a good year both personally and as a team. We've all done well, especially since (interim manager) Lee McCulloch's been in charge.
"We've come together and the mentality has really changed. We're all looking to get better and better.
"If we could get seventh place by beating Ross County this weekend it would cap off a good season."
