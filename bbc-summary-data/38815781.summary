The 26-year-old arrived at Villa Park from Crewe in 2012 and has made 161 appearances - 22 coming this season.
Westwood did not appear for Villa in their FA Cup third-round defeat at Tottenham so will be eligible to play for his new club in the competition.
"It's a fresh start and I want to show people what I can really do," he said.
"I'm delighted to be here. It's happened fast but I've been made to feel very welcome and I can't wait to get going."
