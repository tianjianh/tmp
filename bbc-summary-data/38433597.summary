Simon Brotherton: "It has been two years now since Tony Pulis took over at West Brom and things look better at The Hawthorns than they have done for quite some time.
"Albion sit eighth in the table following Saturday's comeback win over Southampton.
"Pulis' first league game in charge was also against Hull in January 2015 and he'll be happy if history repeats itself as Albion were 1-0 winners that day.
"Hull have been on a wretched run of results away from home, losing the last seven in a row.
"I saw them at West Ham just before Christmas and thought they were very unlucky to lose, but it's hard to see a way out of the bottom three for a side who've won only one of the last 17 league matches."

West Brom head coach Tony Pulis on Hal Robson-Kanu: "I keep telling people, with these 25-man squads it's the people outside the 11 that actually determine the spirit and togetherness in the dressing room.
"Hal's willingness to work and join in, even though he's only been almost a bit-part player, because of Salomon, has been fantastic. I can't speak more highly of his character. He's just so wholehearted."
Hull City head coach Mike Phelan: "Credit to all the players at this football club - they're all putting a real shift in. They're training hard, they're listening and they're learning.
"They've got everything to look forward to, which is to progress up this league, and we've got a real battle on our hands in the second half of the season, but I think we're up for it."
