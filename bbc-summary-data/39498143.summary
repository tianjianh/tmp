Paul McCready, a 31-year-old father of two from north Belfast, died in hospital from injuries sustained in the attack in Donegall Street on Sunday.
Police believe he was involved in a row in the Northern Whig pub, which then continued out onto the street.
The 30-year-old man questioned about the attack was arrested at the scene.
Det Ch Insp Geoffrey Boyce said detectives have carried out "extensive enquiries" since the attack, which took place shortly before 01:00 BST.
"CCTV footage has been examined and statements taken from over 20 people in our effort to gather as much information as possible about this tragic incident," he said.
On Monday, police said members of the public may have filmed the altercation on mobile phones and appealed to witnesses to contact them.
A number of videos had already been made available to detectives.
Mr Boyce added: "I would appeal to those people who were in the Donegall Street area at the time of the incident and who haven't yet got in touch with the investigation team to phone now and tell us what they saw."
