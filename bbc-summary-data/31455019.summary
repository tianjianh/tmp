The Northern Irishman, who has won the cup four times as a player, expects an announcement on the new captain to be made next Wednesday, 18 February.
Clarke, 46, is favourite for the coveted role, ahead of Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez.
"If it's Miguel, I would be delighted for him, but I would love to do the job," Clarke told BBC Northern Ireland.
"To be the captain is huge, but he is only there to steer the players. It's not about the captain, it's about the team."
A five-man European Tour selection panel, including 2014-winning captain Paul McGinley, will make the decision.
Europe retained the trophy at the 40th Ryder Cup 16½-11½ against the United States at Gleneagles in September.
It was the eighth win in 10 meetings for Europe.
Clarke added: "I've got very, very special memories of the event and I'm fortunate to have played in many winning teams. Those memories I will cherish for ever."
The United States will host the 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine between 30 September and 2 October.
