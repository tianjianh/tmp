The Board of Control for Cricket in India announced the sanctions after a meeting of its disciplinary committee.
Chandila, 32, faced spot-fixing allegations while playing for Indian Premier League side Rajasthan Royals in May 2013.
Mumbai batsman Shah, 31, had been suspended by the BCCI in July 2015.
A statement from the BCCI said: "Ajit Chandila is banned for life from playing or representing cricket in any form or to be associated in any way with the activities of the board or its affiliates."
Former international umpire Asad Rauf has also been under investigation by the BCCI but did not attend the recent hearing and denies claims of wrongdoing.
A final hearing for Rauf has been scheduled for February 12.
