Dylan Thomas' Welsh Under Milk Wood dropped from Oscars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh film adaptation of poet Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood has dropped out of the running for the Oscars.

Dan y Wenallt, starring Rhys Ifans and Charlotte Church, was chosen by Bafta as the UK's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film award.
The film failed to make it through the first round of voting, with just nine of 80 longlisted films remaining.
Two previous S4C foreign language film submissions have led to nominations - Hedd Wyn and Solomon a Gaenor.
A partnership between fFatti fFilms, Tinopolis, Ffilm Cymru Wales, Goldfinch Pictures and S4C, Under Milk Wood was the first film adaptation of the play since 1972, with both Welsh and English language versions filmed at the same time.
The final five Oscar nominees will be announced in January, ahead of the ceremony in February 2016.
