Fiscal framework: Ministers meeting in Edinburgh for crunch talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crunch talks on the financial arrangements to accompany the Scotland Bill will resume later.

Deputy First Minister John Swinney and UK Treasury minister Greg Hands are meeting in Edinburgh.
Scottish ministers want a fiscal framework deal agreed this week so it can be scrutinised by Holyrood.
A source close to John Swinney said a massive gap remained between the two sides, but the UK government said it was optimistic a deal could be reached.
The breakthrough needed on the fiscal framework will underpin new powers for Holyrood.
Mr Swinney has repeatedly said he would not sign a deal which he believes is bad for Scotland.
It has been claimed the block grant ministers in Edinburgh get from the Treasury could be cut by Â£7bn if certain calculations are used.
But the UK government believes a good deal is on the table.
On Sunday, Mr Swinney pledged that key documents used to agree any new funding deal for Scotland would be published for scrutiny.
He said he was working "flat out" to get a deal, adding: "With time running out, we need to make substantial progress."
A source close to the deputy first minister said the Scottish government would use whatever time was possible to agree a deal.
That leaves open the possibility the deadline could be extended if the Scottish Parliament still has time to look at the framework before it breaks up for the May election.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said there had been significant movement from the UK government to address Scottish government concerns over population growth.
He added the framework would be reviewed after "a few years" to make sure it was fair for Scotland and the rest of the UK.
The UK government has said it would not walk away from the talks.
Scottish Labour has, meanwhile, called for both sides to set out the principles behind their positions on the framework.
MP Ian Murray has written to Mr Hands and Mr Swinney saying the "negotiations are too important to be happening behind closed doors".
Both sides have said they would not provide a running commentary on the talks.
