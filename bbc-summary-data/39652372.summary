[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old super-bantamweight from Belfast will fight at the 9,500-capacity UIC Pavilion.
Conlan, a former world amateur champion and London Olympics bronze medallist, impressed on his professional debut in New York on St Patrick's Day.
He stopped American Tim Ibarra inside three rounds at Madison Square Garden.
More than 5,000 Irish fans were at the famous New York venue to cheer on the highly rated Conlan.
Conlan forced referee Benjy Esteves Jr to step in when a powerful right hand had his American opponent on the ropes.
He was joined on his walk to the ring by UFC champion Conor McGregor.
