The robbery happened at Gordons Chemists on Broad Street, Cowdenbeath, just before 17:00 on Friday.
The man was 5ft 8in tall,  in his late 20s or early 30s and of medium build.
He was wearing a dark grey or black woollen hat pulled over his face with eyeholes cut out and was quietly spoken with a local accent.
He was also wearing a dark ribbed hooded jumper, dark combat style trousers and dark green or blue trainers that had shiny leather on the front.
Det Sgt John Easton, of Dunfermline CID, said: "Thankfully, none of the staff were injured but this was a distressing experience for them and we're continuing to conduct a number of inquiries locally.
"We're asking anyone who may have seen this man in the area, or who recognises his description, to contact us as soon as possible.
"The stolen medication can pose a serious risk to a person's health and should not be taken unless prescribed for you by a medical professional.
"We're also urging anyone with information about the whereabouts of this medication to come forward immediately."
