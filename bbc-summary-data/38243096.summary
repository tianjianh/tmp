A fire at a west Belfast house caused by an unattended candle, has sparked a safety warning from the fire service.

They are appealing to the public to take extra precautions over Christmas, particularly with candles, fairy tree lights and overloaded sockets.
Anne McCann, from Nansen Street, said she only left her home for a short time before returning to find it was on fire.
"I opened the door and the smoke just belched out," she said.
"The fire brigade was phoned, we kind of looked in - there were no flames, but smoke coming out of the roof, the windows, just from everywhere.
"I can't take it in, I'm still just shocked about the whole thing and to think that a small candle has caused this."
Geoff Somerville, group commander of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS), who attended Tuesday night's blaze, said a Christmas decoration had fallen onto the candle which had been left burning on the hearth.
He said the house had been left badly smoke damaged.
"Thankfully there were no injuries as a result of the incident, but NIFRS is highlighting this as an example of how easily and quickly a fire can take hold in the home at this time of year," he said.
"I'm asking people to give priority to fire safety and not to become complacent about it over Christmas.  Check that you have working smoke alarms fitted in your house."
