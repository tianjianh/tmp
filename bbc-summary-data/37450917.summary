Hull City caretaker-manager Mike Phelan says he is "waiting for answers" as he pushes his case for the job on a permanent basis.

Phelan, 54 on Saturday, said last week that he had been offered the job, but there has been no contact or update on his contract since last Sunday.
"I want it resolved, but it's not my decision," he said.
"A lot of it rests on the position of the club. All I keep hearing is 'takeover, takeover, takeover'."
An agreement to sell the club to a Chinese family fell through amid reports that they did not meet the Premier League's owners' test.
"It's difficult for me to comment because I don't know all the issues outside the football," said Phelan.
"Takeovers are confusing, there are rumours. I've tried to stay focused on my players.
"Supporters want answers and they will get them in time, I'm sure. I'm under no illusions. I want it resolved but it's not my decision."
Phelan became caretaker-boss following Steve Bruce's departure in July and was named Premier League manager of the month for August.
His side are 12th in the top flight and beat fellow Premier League side Stoke in the EFL Cup third round on Wednesday.
