[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Gladwell, 38, of Colchester, was detained by staff at Pontins in Pakefield, Suffolk, on 14 February.
He was then arrested by police on suspicion of assault and became ill on his way to custody.
He died two days later in hospital and the police watchdog has served the officers with gross misconduct notices, the Daily Gazette reports.
Following Mr Gladwell's death on 16 February, Suffolk Police referred itself to the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

An investigation was launched "into the contact between Paul Reynolds [also known as Paul Gladwell] and police", the IPCC said.
"Three police officers have now been served with gross misconduct notices and will be investigated criminally for misconduct in public office and health and safety failings."
An IPCC spokesman said: "Serving a notice advises an officer or member of police staff that their conduct is subject to investigation. Such notices are not judgemental in any way.
"At the end of the investigation it will be for an IPCC commissioner to decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider if criminal charges should be brought."
An investigation is also being carried out by Suffolk Police into the actions of the park security staff who were involved in detaining Mr Gladwell before the officers arrived.
