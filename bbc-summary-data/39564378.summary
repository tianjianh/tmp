The 27-year-old has played 160 times for the U's since joining in 2013, helping the club win promotion back into the Football League a year later.
He has featured at full-back and in central midfield this term for a side two points outside the play-off places.
"Reliable players are what managers are always searching for," U's manager Shaun Derry told the club website.
