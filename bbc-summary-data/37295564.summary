Former One Direction singer Zayn Malik is making his first foray into TV with an hour-long drama about a boy band.

Malik is working on the NBC show, titled Boys, with TV producer Dick Wolf, the Hollywood Reporter said.
"Zayn certainly brings an authentic point of view to this world where kids are catapulted into fame at a dizzying speed," NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke said.
Malik, 23, left the globally successful boy band last year to go solo.
Boys will focus on the formation of a boy band which goes on to huge success, but also looks at the pressures it puts on the members.
It may draw on the experiences of One Direction, who formed on X Factor in 2010 and went on to achieve mass popularity and success plus a cluster of awards including six Brits.
Since going solo, Malik has had hits including Pillow Talk and Like I Would but has struggled with performing live, pulling out of a Dubai concert on Tuesday because of what he calls "extreme anxiety".
The singer, who will be one of the show's executive producers, said: "Dick Wolf is a legend and the opportunity to work with him and NBC to create a compelling drama series is awesome."
Writer and producer Wolf is most famous for the hugely successful and Emmy-winning Law & Order TV series.
However Simon Cowell, who signed One Direction after The X Factor, said he was disappointed Malik did not approach him with the idea first.
"I think he should have come to me with it, if I'm being honest with you," Cowell told Entertainment Tonight.
"I do actually believe that when they've got these ideas, bearing in mind where we started, they should actually come to me."
