International anti-spam company Spamhaus approached the States after it found a VisitGuernsey email in a "spam trap" address.
Spamhaus has asked the Channel Islands Data Commissioner to investigate.
New Approach Media, which is responsible for VisitGuernsey's digital marketing, is yet to comment.
Richard Cox, chief information officer for Spamhaus, said the emails had "hit our spam traps" and "without the slightest doubt the lists being mailed were not compiled on an opt-in basis".
"As I am receiving the mailings - and I have not opted in - the law is being broken, regardless of which of the email addresses on their list is reaching me," he said.
A spokesman from Guernsey's marketing and tourism unit said: "VisitGuernsey takes the matter of data protection extremely seriously and has suspended all future electronic direct mailings to purchased lists.
"Our media agency has confirmed that all third party mailing houses used are compliant with Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) guidelines, and that they strictly adhere to the data protection laws.
"VisitGuernsey will not commence its electronic direct emailing activity to purchased lists until we can be fully confident that mailings carried out on our behalf will not breach ICO guidelines and data protection legislation."
