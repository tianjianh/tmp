Lorraine Ridout, from Cardiff, was last seen at the Premier shop on Gabalfa Avenue on 31 January and there have been no confirmed sightings since.
Police said the river was also searched using sonar equipment as it was "where the family believe Lorraine might be".
There was no evidence Ms Ridout had entered the river, police added.
On Tuesday, police dogs were searching the Gabalfa area. To date the police search has involved a specialist search team, house to house inquiries and air support.
Charity Missing People has produced more than 1,000 appeal posters.
South Wales Police asked anyone with information to call 101.
