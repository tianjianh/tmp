[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lt-Gen Kuldeep Singh Brar was stabbed in an attack by four men in Old Quebec Street, near Oxford Street, on Sunday.
The woman and seven men who were arrested are being questioned at police stations in central and west London.
A further two men and one woman, from the West Midlands, were arrested earlier this week.
They were still in police custody on Friday.
Another three people have been arrested on immigration matters unrelated to the attempted murder investigation.
Following the attack, Mr Brar was taken to hospital with a neck wound and has since been discharged.
He led the 1984 raid on Sikhism's holiest shrine, which saw hundreds die when troops flushed Sikh separatist militants out of the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab state.
He is thought still to be a target for extremist Sikhs, but the identity of his attackers is unclear.
