Swansea City need to sign a striker to improve morale among the players, management and supporters, according to coach Alan Curtis.

The Swans have enquired about Leicester forward Leonardo Ulloa and are also keen on Sevilla's Fernando Llorente.
Curtis believes missing out on midfielder Joe Allen, who has joined Stoke, has deepened the frustration.
"I suppose we are all a little impatient, I guess even more so as we didn't bring in Joe Allen," he said.
"I think there is a lot of frustration, with the supporters but also with the players and maybe the board themselves.
"We all know there is a need for us to bring people in now."
Curtis said there was "lots of work happening behind the scenes" to get deals done.
He added: "The squad is getting stronger, but at this time of year there is an impatience to bolster the squad with a big-name signing and we are no different.
"I think the players like to see [other] players coming through the dressing room.
"Hopefully we can strengthen."
Curtis admits additions in attack are a clear priority for the Swans.
Portuguese striker Eder has moved to Lille, Italian Alberto Paloschi has joined Atalanta and Frenchman Bafetimbi Gomis has signed for Marseille on loan.
"There is two weeks to go now before the season starts and hopefully before the start of the season, of the players we are looking to bring in, someone will come through the door," Curtis told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"We are aware of things going on, but not the details, that is with the chairman.
"It is time now to get a big signing in just to give everyone a big lift.
"It has been obvious to everyone and apparent that we need to strengthen up front."
