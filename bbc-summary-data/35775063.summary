Pupils from Perry Beeches V, Pedmore Technology College, Aston Manor Academy and Aldridge School helped broadcast around the UK for two hours.
There were also opportunities to take part in a series of workshops, including learning about how to present the weather and online journalism.
BBC Newsround's Martin Dougan was also on hand to offer advice.
School reporters from Cardinal Newman Catholic School, in Coventry, Birmingham's St Paul's School for Girls, The Westminster School, Sandwell, and the City of Birmingham School also descended on the BBC's West Midlands home at the Mailbox on the 10th annual News Day.
Other workshops - all run by BBC staff volunteers - gave the students the opportunity to try computer coding, football commentary, go behind the scenes at the flagship regional news programme Midlands Today and even to star in a radio drama.
Abdul, from Perry Beeches V, in Small Heath, and Ethan, from Pedmore Technology College, Dudley, were two of the School Reporters who helped present the pop-up radio station alongside BBC WM's Richie Anderson.
Their show was broadcast on the School Report website and via the red button, and included the latest news and sport, as well as interviews with the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, musician Joe Jonas, of the American pop rock group the Jonas Brothers, and former Birmingham and Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba.
"It was nerve-wracking," said Abdul, aged 12. "It was an amazing experience but the nerves were getting me."
Ethan, 13, added: "It was really interesting, especially the part when we crossed over to BBC WM and were speaking to thousands of people.
"Richie was really good. He helped us out beforehand and coached us through it, as well."
BBC WM's Carolle Forde Garcia looked after the pop-up station in Birmingham.
She said: "I loved the idea of creating a 'pop-up' station for the day - and to work with lots of youngsters, who are so excited to be part of a BBC project, is just fab."
School reporters from the Westminster School were among those who took a trip to the Midlands Today studio and were given a quick guide to weather presenting by journalist Rebecca Wood.
Jack, 15, said: "I was amazed how small the studio was because it looks much bigger in person."
Cardinal Newman Catholic School pupil Julia, 13, said: "It was interesting to see all the cameras - how many there were, how many different angles there were and where or who they aimed at.
"I learned that the weather reporter is told by an ear piece how much time they have to present and how it can change last-minute.
"I was also surprised when I found out the weather reporters have to make their own graphics and how the windows behind the presenters are not real and were designed in Los Angeles."
BBC WM's Mike Taylor gave a masterclass in sports commentary and got school reporters to have a go at putting their own commentaries to clips of this month's Premier League match between leaders Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion.
Fifteen-year-old Kaliesse, from the City of Birmingham School, was among those to have a go.
"It was quite scary," he said. "I wasn't sure how to explain what was going on. I could feel my heart beating in my chest.
"It was really hard. Then I got into it, got the hang of it and I just went with the flow.
"It was hard because you had to speak quite fast and know a bit of information about what was going on. The most beneficial thing I found out was how to present and prepare for the game. I was really surprised that Mike spent three or four hours preparing for the match."
Another of the workshops offered an introduction to computer coding using BBC Microbit.
The school reporters had to create a code on a computer to make an LED image of a smiley face.
Lauren, 11, from Aldridge School, said: "Doing the coding was hard when you first started but when you have been told what to do it gets easier. The best bit about it was getting to make my own image on the screen."
