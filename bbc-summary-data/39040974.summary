The defender left last year because of work and studying commitments, plus the need to recover from a back injury.
Manager Jamie Sherwood told the club website: "I am really happy to have brought Natalie back to the club.
"Her experience, leadership and outright ability becomes an excellent addition to our squad for 2017."
Haigh added: "After the injury I sustained to my back almost 15 months ago, I never thought I would play again, let alone at this level.
"It's great to be back in and around the club - there is a real buzz after the success they achieved last year."
