[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man attacked by pack of dogs at Westerham house

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been taken to hospital with serious injuries after he was attacked by up to five dogs at a house in Kent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Firearms officers were called to a house in Vicarage Hill, Westerham, at about 07:10 GMT on Sunday.
The road outside the property was closed temporarily by officers to "ensure public safety", police said.
The BBC understands officers in riot gear contained five dogs, types of bullmastiffs, in one room at the property before they were removed.
Specially-trained animal handlers, assisted by an RSPCA inspector and an independent vet, sedated the animals.
They were taken out of the property one-by-one in individual kennels, and are now in police care.
The air ambulance attended the house in Westerham but the injured man was taken by land ambulance to hospital.
