The event in Perth, from 18-25 February, determines which rink reaches the World Championships, where Olympic qualification points are on offer.
The brothers are on opposing teams seeking to emulate sister Eve, who secured a bronze medal at Sochi 2014.
"We have got used to playing against each other," said Glen.
"We have never had to face off in a final before and that would be an interesting development and a new experience for both of us."
The brothers share a farm near Crieff in Perthshire and with only one spot at the Edmonton World Championships in April up for grabs, should one of them make it then the other can expect to be busy.
"Obviously we will wish each other well but on ice we have to have our own interests at heart and if one of us ends up on that plane to Edmonton then whoever is left behind is prepared to look after the farm," said Glen, who is part of Team Brewster, the defending national champions.
The younger Muirhead brother joked that he is prepared to do what it takes to win as part of Team Smith.
"I have learned how to wind him up over the last year so I have a few tricks up my sleeve," Thomas said.
"And in Team Smith we like being seen as the underdogs. There is less pressure and we will just fight as hard as we can to go as far as we can."
Eve Muirhead, daughter of 1999 world champion Gordon, became the youngest skip to win an Olympic curling medal in Sochi, where fellow Scot David Murdoch's rink won silver.
And Team Murdoch will also be competing at the Scottish Championships at the Dewars Centre this month.
