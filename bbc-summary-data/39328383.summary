Jones, 43, who previously had backroom roles at Yeovil, Charlton and Brighton, has won 34 out of 70 matches since he replaced John Still in January 2016.
Luton are currently fifth in League Two following Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Exeter City.
His contract had been due to expire at the end of next season, but will now run until the summer of 2020.
Luton chief executive Gary Sweet told the club website: "The board are thoroughly delighted to receive Nathan's acceptance to our offer of a longer term contract. It was such an easy and natural progression step for us to take.
"We are very lucky to have a top-class coach rapidly becoming a top class manager and one who lives, breathes and helps develop our culture, our methodologies and one who is passionately intent on helping us achieve our ambitions while he achieves his."
Jones added: "I think we've had a fantastic 14 to 15 months, and to know the club has that much faith in me that they've given me the length of contract and rewarded me in that way is a good feeling.
"I love the club, I love our fans and I love the players I've got. We are in a real good place at the minute, but it's only a start."
Earlier this month, Jones said he had set his sights on becoming "the best manager in the world," but insisted he was not using Luton as a stepping stone.
The Hatters face an away trip to Newport County on Tuesday.
