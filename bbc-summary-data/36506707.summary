The 20-year-old victim was found with a stab wound to the chest in Hope Street, Higher Broughton, at about 19:45 BST on Friday.
He was taken to hospital where he later died.
Three men, aged 26, 26 and 49, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton, of Greater Manchester Police, appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
"This was a brutal attack which occurred on the street in broad daylight and has taken a young man's life," he said.
"We understand there was an altercation which then led to this young man being stabbed.
"What we need to know is who was involved and exactly what happened."
