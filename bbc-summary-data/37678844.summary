Lewis Faulkner, 25, collided with Tereasa Cutler's car on the A31 near Wimborne, Dorset, on 10 June last year.
Ms Cutler died at the scene. Her two children and her nephew, who she had recently adopted following her sister's death, were seriously injured.
Faulkner was jailed for four years and four months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.
He also admitted causing death while uninsured and three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Ms Cutler, 49, from Ringwood, Hampshire, had just been to the funeral of her sister, Patricia, and was driving to the wake with her two children, Daniel, then 16, and Alice, 18, and her nephew, Joe Woodland, aged 19.
According to police, Faulkner's BMW 3 Series hit Ms Cutler's Fiesta head-on at a bend.
Both he and his male passenger, 22, were also seriously injured in the crash.
Appearing at Bournemouth Crown Court, Faulkner was told he would serve half his sentence on licence.
He was also banned from driving for four years and eight months.
Faulkner, of Coburg Road, Dorchester, previously denied the charges but changed his plea to guilty on Monday morning.
Judge Peter Crabtree described it as a tragic case with catastrophic consequences.
A victim impact statement by Ms Cutler's daughter, Alice, said: "I feel vulnerable because I do not have my mum to comfort and guide me. Instead, all I have is a grave which provides me with little comfort. An accident like this changes you - you see the world differently."
Following the hearing, Sgt Lee Savage of Dorset Police said: "Alice and Daniel lost their much-loved mother and Joe lost an auntie who had just taken on parental responsibility for him following his own mother's death.
"This is one of the most heart-breaking cases I have dealt with and I would like to pay tribute to them for the strength they have shown throughout this tragic time."
