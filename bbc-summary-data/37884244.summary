Aberdeen have posted a record turnover and another profit but warned of "significant challenges" in raising funds to complete their move from Pittodrie to a new stadium.

The club's annual accounts show turnover for last season was up by £337,000 to £13.4m.
An operating profit of £448,000 was slightly down on the previous year.
The Scottish Premiership club's wage bill increased by about £150,000 to £6.8m.
According to chief executive Duncan Fraser, that was "as a direct result of our continuing investment in the overall quality of the playing squad" in a season in which they finished second behind Celtic.
But their wages to turnover ratio of 51% compares favourably to many clubs.
The report confirmed that planning application for a new stadium at Kingsford, seven miles west of the city centre, would be submitted before the end of the year.
Chairman Stewart Milne said: "We have now completed the opening round of public consultations and, whilst there are specific issues to be addressed in relation to traffic management, there is also widespread support across various supporters' groups for the Kingsford site.
"Subject to planning consent being obtained, the proposed site layout will feature much-needed training, community and youth academy facilities.
"The final stadium design will incorporate many of the features being proposed in feedback received from supporters and as part of the detailed consultation process that was undertaken in July."
Milne said that the club and project team were visiting stadia in the United Kingdom and northern Europe to collect ideas for the facilities.
However, he added: "There are significant challenges ahead, not least in the raising of the funds that will be required to deliver the project, which would provide the club, the community trust and our youth academy with appropriate facilities and infrastructure to increase their portfolio of activities in the local area.
"The fact that we have continued to make progress, both on and off the field of play, without a permanent training base and with accommodation that is simply not fit for purpose in the 21st century is quite remarkable and demonstrates what great potential there is for this club if we were operating on a level playing field with the competition.
"If we can maintain the momentum on the playing front and build our average home attendances, that will greatly assist in raising the finances that can deliver the much-needed facilities that can take our club to new levels on so many fronts."
