[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crime is the favourite form of fiction for the majority of Scottish book readers, a survey has suggested.

Science fiction and biographies were the next most popular genres, according to the poll to mark the start of Book Week Scotland.
The Ipsos mori poll of 1,000 adults found one in four readers preferred crime fiction.
One in 10 opted for science fiction and biography, while historic fiction was the preferred choice of 9% of readers.
The survey also found that almost 80% of Scots read or listen to books for enjoyment - with nearly half of them doing so every day.
Of those who don't read for enjoyment, three quarters said they had read a newspaper in the past few months.
Hundreds of events organised by Scottish Book Trust will take place across the country as part of Book Week Scotland.
There will be author appearances from writers including Alexander McCall Smith, Chris Brookmyre and Liz Lochhead.
Marc Lambert, chief executive of Scottish Book Trust, said: "It is hardly surprising that the country which gave us Ian Rankin, Denise Mina, Iain Banks, Val McDermid, Christopher Brookmyre and many others has bred a generation of crime enthusiasts.
"It's also very heartening to see that almost half of Scottish people read a book for pleasure most days or every day. Reading has many proven health benefits, not least stress reduction and memory improvement, but above all it is a really enjoyable pastime."
Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Our national Book Week has gone from strength to strength since it was established in 2012.
"Scottish Book Trust is doing some outstanding work to make reading more accessible to those who find it challenging and I believe everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy reading and our literary heritage."
