Ricky Miller, 27, denied attacking cab driver Mohammed Adnan after Luton Town's end of season dinner.
Mr Adnan received a Â£30 fee to take Mr Miller and fellow player Shaun Whalley from Milton Keynes to Dunstable, Luton Crown Court heard.
The taxi driver claimed he had been assaulted by Mr Miller when he stopped his cab after being abused.
Mr Miller, now at Dover in the Conference League, told the court: "I wasn't racist towards him at any point and I did not assault him in any way."
He was found not guilty of causing racially aggravated fear of provocation or violence, racially aggravated assault by beating and an alternative charge of assault by beating.
Prosecutor Paul Fairley said the two footballers had attended Luton Town's end of season dinner and celebrations.
Some players then went on to Pink Punters, a nightclub in Fenny Stratford, Milton Keynes.
At about 03:00, Mr Miller is said to have got into an altercation with Mr Whalley and they were ejected from the club.
The pair were put into Mr Adnan's taxi and a Â£30 fare was paid to take them to the Cookies and Cream nightclub in Dunstable.
