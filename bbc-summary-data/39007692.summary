Keith Lowe, 22, had originally denied the attack, in which Brendan Mason, 23, suffered 99 injuries, in Abbey Park, Leicester, in July 2016.
But just days into the trial at Leicester Crown Court, footage emerged of Lowe landing blows on Mr Mason.
Joshua Hack, 21, admitted murder at an earlier hearing. Both will be sentenced on 20 February.
The court heard Hack, of St Helen's Drive, Leicester and Lowe, of Rockingham Close, Leicester, apparently lured Mr Mason to the park in the early hours of 5 July.
Police said careful examination of phone records showed messages and calls organising the attack.
Officers also confirmed the trial had been stopped when new footage was traced to cloud storage showing Lowe taking a direct part in the beating.
This was presented to the defendant who then changed his plea.
Det Chf Insp Mick Graham, who led the investigation, said: "Brendan was known to the defendants and considered them as friends, and they lured him to the park with the full intention of hurting him.
"Brendan was subjected to a vicious, sustained attack which was filmed by his attackers on their phones. He was left naked and alone in the park having been brutally beaten."
