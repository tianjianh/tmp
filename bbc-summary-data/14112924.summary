Radio is the main source of information. ZNBC is the only broadcaster with national reach.
US-based Freedom House rates Zambia as "Not Free" in its 2014 Freedom of the Press survey. It cites the harassment of privately-owned news outlets, the blocking of critical websites, and politicised decisions over granting national radio licences.
Relays of BBC World Service (98.1 FM in Lusaka and Kitwe) and Radio France Internationale are on the air. There are scores of local radio stations. Multichannel pay-TV is available.
There were more than 2.3 million internet users by 2014 (Internetlivestats.com). News websites Zambian Watchdog and Zambia Reports were blocked by ISPs in 2013, says Freedom House.
