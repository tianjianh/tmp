An accident in Dumfries and Galloway has highlighted the perils of delivering huge wind turbine parts on country roads.
Two such deliveries recently have had very different outcomes.
One driver managed to successfully navigate Bargrennan Bridge, near Newton Stewart, in November.
But a delivery on the A713 on Tuesday saw a lorry and its giant cargo end up in a ditch.
