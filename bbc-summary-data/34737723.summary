[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruud Krol has been sacked as coach of Morocco's Raja Casablanca after only four months in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Netherlands captain, 66, leaves only a day after the club suffered a 2-0 defeat by Fath Union Sport in the Moroccan FA Cup semi-final.
On its website the club said it sacked Krol because of "his poor selection, results and decisions, and strained relationship with the players".
It was a fifth job in north Africa over the last two years for Krol.
In 2013 he took CS Sfaxien of Tunisia to the African Confederation Cup title and was then briefly caretaker coach of Tunisia when they lost in the 2014 World Cup qualifying play-offs to Cameroon.
He followed that with brief spells at Esperance in Tunisia and Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya.
Krol led Egyptian side Zamalek to victory in the Egypt Cup in 2008 and won the South African championship with Orlando Pirates in 2011.
