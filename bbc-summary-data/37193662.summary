[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But the Queensferry centre will remain closed for the rest of the day, before reopening on Saturday as normal.
The caravans left the site on Friday morning following a joint Flintshire county council and North Wales police operation.
The caravans had been parked at the centre since Tuesday, August 23.
Police officers had been present since Wednesday following reports of anti-social behaviour.
Supt Alex Goss said: "North Wales Police officers have been in attendance in recent days to provide reassurance to the public and to ensure there was no breach of the peace as we worked in conjunction with Flintshire county council to resolve the situation."
