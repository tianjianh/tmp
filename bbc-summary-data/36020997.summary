Peter Ebdon and Ali Carter are one win away from qualifying for this year's World Snooker Championship.

Ebdon, winner in 2002, won 10-9 against fellow Englishman Gerard Greene, while Carter - a finalist in 2008 and 2012 - saw off China's Cao Yupeng 10-8.
Players outside the world's top 16 are required to win three qualifying matches to reach the Crucible.
China's Ding Junhui and 1997 world champion Ken Doherty are also through to the final round.
Ebdon, 45, fashioned a remarkable escape against Greene, having been 9-3 down before winning seven successive frames, with the match finishing just after 02:00 BST on Tuesday.
Carter's win was a more fluent affair - from 7-7, the 36-year-old knocked in breaks of 138, 111 and a match-clinching 54 to set up a meeting with Welshman Dominic Dale.
Ding secured comfortable victories over Greg Casey and Ross Muir and will now face Nigel Bond on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Doherty faces Wales' Ryan Day after winning 10-7 against Iran's Hossein Vafaei Ayouri.
Elsewhere in round two of qualifying, Anthony McGill beat Craig Steadman 10-9 and will now face Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh.
Liam Highfield beat Belgium's Luca Brecel 10-8, Jack Lisowski won 10-5 against Rory McLeod while China's Zhang Anda saw off Mark Davis by the same score.
Two-time Crucible finalist Matthew Stevens thrashed Zhang Yong 10-3 while Thailand's Dechawat Poomjaeng secured a 10-5 win over Robin Hill.
