[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen and Dundee outnumber Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic in the PFA Scotland team of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Left-back Kieran Tierney and striker Leigh Griffiths are the only members of Celtic's squad to receive enough votes from their fellow professionals.
Right-back Shay Logan and midfielders Graeme Shinnie, Kenny McLean and Jonny Hayes are from the second-top Dons.
Goalkeeper Scott Bain and strikers Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart are from a Dundee side outside of the top six.
The remaining players, in a 4-3-3 formation, are central defenders Alim Ozturk, of Hearts, and Andrew Davies, of Ross County.
Griffiths, Hayes, Hemmings and Stewart make up the shortlist for PFA Scotland Player of the Year.
Having won the Championship title, Rangers dominate their division's team of the year with five representatives.
Second-top Falkirk and third-placed Hibernian have three each.
Dunfermline Athletic have four players in the League One team of the season, while East Fife have the same number in the League Two list, with both having won their respective titles.
The Fifers' player-manager, Gary Naysmith, the 37-year-old former Scotland left-back, makes the League Two XI.
