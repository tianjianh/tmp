The car-booking phone app firm Uber has requested a meeting with Boris Johnson about his proposals to "take action" against minicabs in London.

Last week he called for action against the threat posed by the "massive increase" of private hire vehicles.
Jo Bertram at Uber said the answer to London's traffic problems was not to "limit licences and jobs", which she said would push up prices.
A spokesperson for the mayor said he was "not on an Uber witch-hunt".
Ms Bertram said that limiting licences and jobs would also "force people back into their own cars, causing more congestion and pollution".
She said: "This is why smart technology like Uber is so important as it ensures modern, clean vehicles can move lots more people around the city efficiently."
Ms Bertram said she wanted to work with the mayor to improve transport and keep the capital moving.
A spokesperson for City Hall said: "This [tackling the number of private hire cabs] is about London being able to provide a high-quality minicab and black cab trade for London, which isn't eroding key objectives such as keeping traffic moving and cleaning up our air.â€Ž"
The spokesperson said it did not matter who the drivers work for, saying: "It just doesn't make sense to have such a large number of minicab drivers in the capital."
