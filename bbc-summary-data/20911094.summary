[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Eco-town' site at Whitehill Bordon is purchased

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An army site in Hampshire has been sold to provide 100 homes and employment space, marking a first step in the creation of a so-called "eco-town".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The empty Quebec Barracks in Whitehill Bordon were released early by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and bought by the Homes and Communities Agency.
It is part of a wider programme to build environmentally sustainable homes and create jobs.
Remaining Army personnel are set to leave the site by the end of 2015.
The land is currently used for training by the Bordon Garrison and about 1,500 jobs will be lost when the MoD relocates to RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire.
But East Hampshire District Council hopes 100 new jobs will be created in this initial step towards building a large "eco-business park", with further employment to follow.
Building work is expected to start in 2014 and be completed by the end of 2015.
Whitehill Bordon was one of six areas selected in 2009 for the government's zero-carbon project intended to meet housing needs and tackle climate change.
Up to three new primary schools, early years centres and a modern public transport system are also among the proposals for the "eco-town".
Col David Ansell said: "These barracks have been empty for several years and it is really exciting that the site is about to be given a new lease of life and be regenerated to provide homes and jobs.
"We feel that it is important to start releasing sites as they become available because it means that the local economy will be more buoyant when we completely leave the town by the end of 2015."
