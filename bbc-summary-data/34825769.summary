They died on Saturday when the light aircraft they were travelling in crashed into a field near the village of Churchinford.
The family members, from Surrey, were a 56-year-old man, a 55-year-old woman, a 23-year-old woman and a man aged 20.
Supt Richard Corrigan said "our thoughts are with [the affected family] at this extremely difficult time".
Dave Manning, who lives at Higher Southey farm in Churchinford, said the plane came down on his land.
"Our next door neighbour came in and said a plane had come down. Then we went out and looked and there was basically nothing we could do."
The aircraft was heading from the Surrey area towards Dunkeswell Aerodrome in east Devon, five miles (8km) from the crash site.
Formal identification has not yet taken place and a joint investigation with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch is under way.
Supt Corrigan added: "The focus of the activity will be to investigative inquiries and then recover the aircraft.
"Road closures remain in place around the crash site."
