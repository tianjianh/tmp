The 18-year-old New Zealander was putting from off the green when the ball shot up and hit the shaft of the club, incurring a one-stroke penalty.
But she made pars at the next five and finished with three straight birdies to beat Korean Inbee Park by four strokes.
England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff shot a closing 75 to fade to a tie for 27th.
The 28-year-old, ranked 215 in the world, had shared the lead after day one in Carlsbad but finished 15 shots behind the winner.
Compatriot Holly Clyburn shot a 69 to finish on six under, tied for 20th.
Ko will seek her second major title at the ANA Inspiration, which begins in California on Thursday, to go with the Evian Championship she won last year.
