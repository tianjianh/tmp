Harbottle Surgery to reopen part time after sudden closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP surgery that closed suddenly last month will reopen part time, NHS England has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harbottle Surgery, situated in a remote part of Northumberland, shut after the doctor running it withdrew from her contract.
Its 800 patients were advised to sign up with other practices up to 30 miles (48km) away.
Residents said they still planned to fight for a return of the service they had previously.
They had campaigned for the surgery to reopen and had accused NHS England of being reluctant to replace the GP and reopen the surgery.
A practice in neighbouring Rothbury will now provide a GP and nurse in Harbottle for two half days a week each from 19 October.
Patients who do not live within its catchment area will need to register with an alternative practice, Northumberland County Council said.
The new service will run for an initial 12 months, while an assessment of local primary care needs is carried out, it said.
