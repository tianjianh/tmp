Figures released by three of the four forces under the Freedom of Information Act showed 29 people under 18 were held between 2013 and January 2016.
North Wales Police had the most suspected offenders.
But South Wales Police said it had not decided if it was in the public interest to release information.
Among the 14 arrests in north Wales, a 13-year-old was held for possession of a firearm or imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
The force also charged a 13-year-old girl under the category "other firearm offences" after police seized a BB gun in 2015.
It said she was summonsed to court for the offence of having an air weapon in a public place but was not arrested.
A 16-year-old boy was also charged with possession of a firearm after he was found with a "Taser-type device" in 2015.
In the Gwent Police force area, 11 arrests were made over three years.
There were also five charges for firearm offences involving children, including a 16-year-old girl who was charged with possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in January 2016.
Two boys aged 17 were also charged with having an imitation firearm with intent to cause an indictable offence in 2015.
Dyfed-Powys Police said three boys were arrested for suspected firearm offences in 2013. No other children have been arrested or charged since.
