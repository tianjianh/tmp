Twelve million commuter journeys could be disrupted when one of London's busiest transport hubs partly closes over Christmas and New Year, rail authorities have warned.

Southern and Thameslink trains will not call at London Bridge station from 20 December to 4 January.
From 22-24 December, some Southeastern Charing Cross services will not call at London Bridge in the morning peak.
The disruption will result from work to open two new platforms.
Construction work has involved the clearing of Victorian arches beneath the station that will become the new passenger concourse.
Plans for the 178-year-old station - London's oldest surviving rail terminus - include the concourse that will be bigger than the pitch at Wembley.
Works will also take place to modernise nearby track and signalling equipment as part of the Â£6.5 billion Thameslink works programme.
Thameslink programme director Simon Blanchflower said: "In the long run our work here will improve the journeys of millions of passengers across the South, but we understand that until we've finished some people may have to change their journey to or from London."
London Bridge Underground station will not be affected by the work.
