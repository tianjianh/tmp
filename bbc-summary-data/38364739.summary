[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Designs for the £20m revitalisation of a historic Aberdeen city centre park have received support from members of the public, the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A survey into the proposals for Union Terrace Gardens (UTG) was launched two weeks ago.
LDA Design said the aim - including new access from surrounding streets - was to make UTG a "lively cultural hub".
Aberdeen City Council said the survey showed 94% of people thought facilities would improve.
It drew more than 1,400 responses,
New access would be from Union Street and Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument. The central lawn space would be retained, and there would be a new café pavilion opposite His Majesty's Theatre (HMT).
Four years ago, councillors rejected plans for a £140m transformation of the gardens.
Businessman Sir Ian Wood had offered £50m towards the cost.
