MK Dons scored two late goals to complete a remarkable late comeback and defeat League Two Leyton Orient in the first round of the League Cup.

Orient had a first-half lead when Dean Lewington mis-kicked Dean Cox's cross and debutant keeper Cody Cropper's slip prevented him keeping the ball out.
MK looked to be going out, but with the game nearing full-time Orient defender Mathieu Baudry headed into his own net.
In the 92nd minute, Simon Church laid off Carl Baker to slot in for victory.
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson had made 10 changes to the side who beat Rotherham 4-1 on Saturday, and struggled to create any clear chances until late on in the game.
Orient should have put the game to bed earlier as Ollie Palmer hit the post, with the ball bouncing to safety off Cropper.
Orient forward Jay Simpson had a great chance with four minutes left, but United States Under-23 goalkeeper Cropper was equal to his effort.
The result means the Dons - who humbled Manchester United in the competition last season - have reached the second round for the sixth year running.
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson told BBC Radio Three Counties:

"I think Leyton Orient deserve an awful lot of credit for what they did and they deserved to get more out of the game than they did. We weren't great but when you make 10 changes you are going to get that in periods of the game.
"The players' grit and determination was the pleasing thing for me and that never-say-die attitude.
"I thought Carl Baker's goal was excellent and I thought Matthew Upson really showed his class."
