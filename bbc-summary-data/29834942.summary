Symons was confirmed as manager at Craven Cottage on Wednesday.
The 43-year-old had been in charge on an interim basis following the sacking of Felix Magath last month.
It was believed that Symons would have to stand down from his role with Wales - who play Belgium on 16 November -  but he is keen to remain as part of Chris Coleman's backroom staff.
Symons has been assistant to Coleman since January 2012, but the Wales manager has previously said he could not do both long term.
Wales top European Championship qualifying Group B ahead of Israel and Belgium after their 2-1 home win over Cyprus on 13 October.
The game in Brussels is followed by a four-month gap until Wales face Israel in Haifa on 28 March, 2015.
Fulham owner Shahid Kahn has given Symons his blessing to continue his work with Coleman in the Welsh set-up.
"He's [Symons] the guy to decide the best use of his time," said Kahn, who also owns NFL American football team, Jacksonville Jaguars .
"I know in my case I have a number of interests business and personal."
Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford is confident Symons wants to stay on.
"Having spoken to him before his appointment [at Fulham] I know that he really wants to see this through," said Ford.
"We're all delighted for him, we'd anticipated because he's been doing such an amazing job there.
"We just hope he can continue his role, he'll certainly be with us away in Belgium, and we hope he can continue his role and see us all the way through to France in 2016."
