A worker was seriously injured when a passenger train hit a conveyor belt hanging over the line, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The East Midlands Trains service was travelling from Leicester to York when it hit part of a conveyor wagon at Barrow upon Soar earlier this month.
A man working on the lorry was taken to hospital but the train did not derail and no passengers were hurt.
The Office of Road and Rail said it is also investigating.
The train had been travelling at 102mph (163 km/h) when it hit the boom of a conveyor wagon, which was sticking out over the line at Mountsorrel sidings, at 10:27 on 14 February.
The maximum speed for that section is 110mph (176 km/h), the RAIB said.
The driver applied the emergency brake and no-one on board the train was injured but the driver was described as being "badly shaken" by the incident.
The train was then taken at low speed to Loughborough where passengers were put on different trains to continue their journeys.
Both the RAIB and the Office of Road and Rail have confirmed they are investigating.
