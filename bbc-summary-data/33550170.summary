The event runs from Friday until 26 July, with its Mardi Gras taking place on Sunday.
The festival will feature more than 150 gigs, with the music ranging from Mexican jazz rock to Mississippi blues, and from Italian super brass to classic Dixieland.
The acts will include George Benson, Curtis Stigers and Jools Holland.
Organisers said they expected to attract another record audience as the event reaches its 38th year.
Producer Fiona Alexander said: "We are looking forward to the biggest ever Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival, with over 1,000 performers and musicians from 16 countries.
"The programme ranges from 1920s jazz to beatboxing and we have stars from New Orleans alongside top musicians from New York's contemporary jazz scene and blues players from both Mississippi and Chicago."
