After 12 weeks of quickstepping, jiving and tangoing four celebrities are preparing for the final showdown in this year's Strictly Come Dancing.

Actresses Kellie Bright and Georgia May Foot, presenter Katie Derham and pop star Jay McGuiness are hoping to dance their way to the Strictly crown, helped by their professional dancer partners.
The winning couple will get to raise the Strictly glitterball trophy.
The contestants told the BBC they were feeling "excited" but "emotional".
In last week's show presenter Anita Rani and her partner Gleb Savchenko failed to survive the dance-off, with the judges voting for Katie Derham and her partner Anton Du Becke to go through to the final.
Presenter and broadcaster Katie said she was celebrating taking Anton to the final for the first time since he joined the show 12 years ago, but she remained realistic about their chances of winning.
"I don't know if anybody has really thought about the trophy much.
"A friend of mine made me this little necklace which is a mini glitterball and said, 'Even if you don't win you have your own little one already.'"
EastEnders star Kellie Bright said she was feeling "slightly more emotional" before the last show, but was "holding onto the thought" of relaxing after the final.
"I'm quite looking forward to not having any make-up on, or brushing my hair, or even getting out of my pyjamas for a few days," she said.
"I'm not thinking about winning, I'm just thinking this is our last chance to do this and to dance together and to go out there.
"Our whole thing has always been to try and entertain everybody, so that's what we want to to do on Saturday."
Meanwhile, former Coronation Street actress Georgia May Foote said she was feeling "more excited than nervous" even though the final performance would have the added pressure of being "everything you have learnt put together".
There will be two live shows on Saturday. One couple will be eliminated at the beginning of the second show, leaving the remaining three finalists to perform their favourite dance of the series before the winner is crowned.
Fans may be expecting to see pop star Jay McGuiness's jive again, but he revealed he would not be repeating the dance in the final.
"I think the jive was so fun and I think everyone loved it. I'm more than happy with what that was [but] I'd rather do something that I think will surprise people," he said.
He added that his experience of the show had left him a big Strictly fan, adding:  "I'm in love with the show, I think its awesome."
Ahead of the final show - which will see all the professional dancers and celebrity participants back together - some of the group have been posting images of the rehearsals online.
Kirsty Gallagher posted on Instagram that she "can't wait for the final", while previous contestants - actress Helen George, former Olympic athlete and sports presenter Iwan Thomas and boxer Anthony Ogogo - posed for selfies on the dance floor.
Strictly Come Dancing is on BBC One at 18:35 GMT and at 21:00 GMT.
