Martin Lewis, 56, caused Â£9,000 worth of damage at the Stag pub in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
He also caused Â£12,000 in damage at his local Jobcentre days later over delays to benefits payments, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court was told.
Lewis, of Treorchy, was jailed for 18 months after admitting criminal damage.
Lewis, who said he had drunk five or six pints, claimed "everything was a blur" after he lost his job driving buses in Coventry.
The court was told he was sacked by bus company bosses for "not knowing the roads well enough".
Regarding the pub attack, prosecutor Rachel Knight said: "He caused damage to just about everything that was not nailed down.
"The bar manager said it was completely out of the blue. He went outside to call 999 and the rampage continued. He said he didn't know what the defendant was going to do next."
Judge Christopher Llewellyn-Jones QC: "You said that you were depressed because of a shortage of money so it is ironic that you were in a pub spending money at that time."
