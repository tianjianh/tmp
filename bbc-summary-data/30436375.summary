M1 bridge fall 'selfless' rescuer hit by car, inquest told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "selfless" man was hit and killed by a car as he tried to help a former postal worker who had fallen off a motorway bridge, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spencer Bell, 71, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, went to the aid of Alan Trethewey, 67, who had fallen on to the M1 near Watford on 30 January.
Both men were then hit by an oncoming car.
Mr Bell's family previously described him as "the most loving, funny and generous person".
The hearing regarding Mr Bell's death has been adjourned due to criminal proceedings involving a car driver, who has been charged with causing death by careless driving.
"Knowing he died in such a selfless way is no comfort. But we would not have expected anything else of him," Mr Bell's family said.
