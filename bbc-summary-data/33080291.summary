[SN]TITLE[SN]
Who were the Waterloo Scots?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Waterloo was one of the bloodiest and most decisive battles in history. In the run-up to the bicentenary, a BBC Scotland docudrama looks at the stories of the Scots who were present at one of European history's biggest events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On 18 June 1815 Wellington, with his British and Allied army, faced Napoleon with his French Imperial Guard in a muddy field in Belgium.
If you fought at Waterloo that day you had a one in four chance of either being killed or wounded.
An estimated 50,000 died in 10 hours.
After the fighting was over the 19th Century public was avid for stories of the great battle that had brought peace to Europe after 20 years of war.
Any man - or woman - who could say "I was there" could bask in reflective glory and acquire social cachet as a Waterloo veteran.
This iconic battle, a turning point in British and European history, is also remarkable for the number of eye-witness accounts.
Private Dixon Vallance, from south Lanarkshire, joined the 79th Cameron Highlanders in 1813 and is typical of many of their recruits.
Due to Highland depopulation, some of these units were forced to recruit Irish, English and Lowland troops and recruiting officers were a common site in the big, densely-populated industrial areas around Glasgow.
In fact, the War Office tried to discourage wearing the kilt in case it put off Lowlanders and Englishmen from joining the Highland regiments.
An account from The Highlanders Museum at Fort George tells how Private Dixon, a cartwright, joined the army because the sight of a regiment with colours flying and martial music awoke "a slumbering instinct in the soul".
He starts his account by claiming he has hardly any education and asks his readers to forgive his lack of grammatical style as he tells "nothing but the sterling truth".
But he is being too modest - his account is full of humour and insight and even flashes of poetry.
After his first terrifying blooding at the battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June, he describes cooking the beef ration in the battered breast plates of the French cuirassiers.
Dixon says: "A party of soldiers went past us when we were cooking. Some of our men said we were frying the French in their iron jackets and we were going to eat them.
"The men looked horrified and ran after their companions and told them that the Scotch Highlanders were cannibals."
He has another more serious side.
He is a Bible reader but hides this from his fellow soldiers in case they laugh at him.
While waiting to go into battle on 18 June, he comments: "Perhaps some of my readers were not aware that the Battle of Waterloo was fought on the Sabbath day.
"It was certainly strange that two of the most powerful and civilised nations, ranked foremost in every department of knowledge, science and art, found no other way of settling their differences than the old and barbarous method of going to war and killing each other."
Dixon's accounts of being in the action and the death and destruction he saw around him are very powerful - men having their brains blown out and face ripped off, blood all over his uniform and musket balls through his feather bonnet.
He writes: "While we continued to fire on each other the French bullets were whizzing about our ears as thick as a shower of hail.
"My face, hands, clothes and belts were bespattered with the blood of my killed and wounded companions."
Dixon, though seriously wounded, was lucky to survive both Quatre Bras and Waterloo - the Camerons lost 62% of their men killed and wounded.
One of his poems says: "The bloody strife is over; And long may Britain weep - For silent now in bloody beds; Her fallen warriors sleep."
Back home in Carluke, Dixon became an inventor, winning prizes for his agricultural machinery.
He married late in life and had nine children.
Many of his descendants still live locally. His grave records that he "was present at the Battle of Waterloo and his latter end was peace."
Sergeant David Robertson was a Perthshire veteran from the 92nd Gordon Highlanders.
His memoirs, published in 1842, are in the rare books collection at the National Library of Scotland.
It is a mystery Robertson has been so forgotten.
He tells his readers that he had initially intended to work with a professional writer as he is not confident about his writing skills.
He says he wishes "to lay before the public in plain and intelligible language the life of a soldier ... Of one who never shrunk to meet danger and death when his country called and duty pointed the way. A plain unvarnished tale, a narrative of the hardships and vicissitudes, the glory and honour that make up the routine of a soldier's life".
Robertson is typical of a shift in British society where the soldier is going from being a figure that's politically and socially dubious - the scum of the earth - to being one which reflects virtue, steadiness and compassion.
Robertson is also unusual in how he joined the army.
He initially was in a militia regiment the Atholl Volunteers.
Militia was extremely important in the Napoleonic Wars - a form of early Dad's Army - and Scots joined it in higher numbers than elsewhere.
But it was relatively rare to do as Robertson does and join the tough regular army.
He is a fascinating man - obviously battle hardened but intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive and with real empathy for the men under his command.
He is proud of his rank and his professional expertise.
You can sense that when Wellington, hiding inside a Gordon Highlanders' square, directly ordered him to drive off some French snipers who attacked him.
At the weary bitter end of Waterloo,  Robertson, now commanding a company as all the officers were killed, is worried about how he and his men will cope if the French break through, as they have never retreated before.
Robertson admits to weeping when ordered to march away from the post battle carnage.
He writes: "Numbers who had fought by our side on the preceding day were now stretched lifeless on an open field; and we were not permitted to give them the common rite of burial, and see them decently interred in the field where they had spent their heart's blood.
"They were calling on us to come back, and not leave them to breathe their last in a land of strangers, with no friendly hand to comfort them and close their eyes in death.
"I confess my feelings overcame me; I wept bitterly, and wished I had not been a witness of such a scene."
David Robertson got his discharge from the army in 1818 and returned home to Perthshire with his wife, who had been on campaign with him, and eight children.
He says: "Having got a pension for my services sufficient to support me, I finally wended my way to the place of my nativity, where I live in peace, far removed from those scenes of bloodshed and misery which it has been my lot to witness."
Corporal John Dickson of the Royal Scots Greys is a very different character - a dashing cavalryman involved in high-profile clashes who left a very colourful, probably exaggerated, account.
Dickson became quite a celebrity in his later years when he had left the army to go to Crail in Fife to command the Fife Light Horse.
His portrait was painted and hangs now in the National War Museum at Edinburgh Castle with his Waterloo medals and the sword he brandished at the battle.
And we know exactly how he told his story.
It was published in Chambers Magazine in 1907 with an introduction telling of how, in 1855, a group of villagers met in a Fife inn to do honour to their veteran host on the anniversary of Waterloo.
And Sergeant Major Dickson was induced to relate his experiences of 40 years ago - yet again.
Dickson's account is a bit over-the-top, but you can tell that he is enjoying telling his tale to the rapt audience.
John Dickson was a weaver from Paisley who joined Scotland's only cavalry regiment, the Royal Scots' Greys, when he was 18 in 1807 and was promoted aged 26 on the eve of Waterloo.
Dickson had never been in action before when, at 2pm on 18 June, he was ordered along with the Union Brigade - Scots, Irish and English heavy cavalry regiments - to charge the massive French infantry attack on the British lines at Waterloo - principally the Highlanders already battered at Quatre Bras.
He left the most vivid account of what Napoleon called "les terribles chevaux gris".
He describes how the 79th and 92nd Highlanders - Vallance and Robertson among them - had to part their ranks to let the Greys through.
Dickson says: "All of us were greatly excited, and began crying, 'Hurrah, Ninety-Second! Scotland for ever!'
"We heard the Highland pipers playing among the smoke and firing below.
"We could make out the feather bonnets of the Highlanders and heard the officers crying out to them to wheel back by sections.
"A moment more and we were among them. Poor fellows. Some of them had not time to get clear of us and were knocked down.
"I remember one lad crying out 'Eh! I didna think you would hurt me sae'.' They were all Gordons, and as we passed through them they shouted, 'Go at them, the Greys! Scotland for ever!'"
Dickson next took part in one of the most famous episodes in the whole battle - the capture of the French Eagle of the 45th Regiment by his comrade Sergeant Ewart.
Dickson went on to lose three horses under him and witness the deaths of the Union Brigade commander General Ponsonby and of his commander Colonel James Inglis Hamilton, last seen with no arms and his reins held in his teeth.
He says: "There were scarcely half a hundred of the Greys left out of the three hundred who rode off half an hour before.
"How I escaped is a miracle, for I was through the thick of it all."
When Dickson died at the age of 90, he was the longest surviving Scottish veteran of Waterloo.
Probably the rarest account of Waterloo we came across was an interview given to a journalist for the Cambrian News in Wales in 1876 by Scots-born Jenny Griffiths.
This is the only account by a woman who was close to the front line and the wife of a private.
She tells the journalist: "I hope you will never see or hear what I have seen. Of course, you can see nothing of a battle except smoke and flashes of fire, but the incidents that attend it are dreadful."
Jenny met her Welsh husband Lewis Griffiths when she was at school in Ireland.
They were determined to marry and given permission by Lewis's colonel.
Then Lewis was sent to Belgium in the 23rd Welsh Fusiliers.
Did Jenny know what she was in for?
There were no married quarters for Jenny - just a tent on campaign, shared with dozens of soldiers.
The army really saw wives as a bit of a nuisance despite their usefulness as unpaid nurses, hairdressers, laundresses and for other auxiliary tasks.
Jenny recalls taking in washing from officers and how they came to collect it.
She says: "Two men came to me and said, 'You will never have to wash for me again'.  And it was true, for they were both killed."
On the eve of the Waterloo campaign, the army tried to prevent the women going to the battlefield but many slipped through - including Jenny and their six-month-old baby.
Why did she want to go to the front carrying an infant?
Was it love or hard-headed realism?
The alternatives were bleak - to make her own way home where she could be on the Poor Law or to her own family - if they would have her - or to beg on the streets.
Feisty Jenny says that she argued with her husband's colonel that she had to go on with Lewis to the battle or go home and beg.
She says: "He then laughed and said, 'In the name of God go with your husband. If there is anybody unlikely to beg it is you. His name was Colonel Ellis and he was killed at Waterloo."
It is astonishing how close Jenny got to the action.
She recalled: "I remained with him until he went down on his knees to load his gun and fire. The colonel said I'd better return to camp. I had not gone far when a volley of musket shots fell around, but did not strike me."
Then it was a matter of going to the rear among the wounded and waiting it out, often under cannon fire.
And then, when it was all over, looking for your husband - was he dead or alive?
"I searched for him all Sunday night. Then, all day on Monday, I went through about 300 rooms where the wounded soldiers lay, but I could not find him.
"Then the little baby said 'da-da', and I saw it was my husband."
Lewis received no pension, just Â£5 blood money and his Waterloo medal, and was killed in a quarry accident.
The journalist who related her story comments that Jenny in her old age is dependent on Dolgelly Union for her weekly support of five shillings.
She lives in a one-room house in the village and speaks Welsh. Her gravestone states that Jenny, born in Scotland, died at Talyllyn on the 11th April 1884 at 94 and that she was at the battle of Waterloo.
The Scots at Waterloo will be shown on Tuesday 16 June at 21:00 on BBC Two Scotland.
