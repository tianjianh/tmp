The Bluebirds beat Brentford 2-1 on Saturday to stay in 14th place in the Championship table.
With five games left in the season, Cardiff are safe from relegation but realistically out of contention for the play-offs.
"It's very difficult for me to get myself up for it when I know we're safe. I need an edge on my game as well," said Warnock.
He continued: "So I said to Blackie [assistant manager Kevin Blackwell], 'Make sure you give me a kick up the backside if you think I'm slacking'.
"Because it's easy to become complacent really and I've never been one for pre-season friendlies because there's nothing at stake.
"So all credit to the lads for taking on board what I said and making a game of it."
Cardiff trailed 1-0 against Brentford at half-time, before recovering with goals from Sean Morrison and Peter Whittingham in a strong second-half display.
Having won only one of their previous seven games, Warnock was pleased with his team's revival.
"It's easy to go through the motions and then the fans are paying their money and not getting their money's worth," he added.
"But I want fans to go home and talk about the goals and the saves. We're in an entertainment business.
"I appreciate the fans staying behind and giving the players applause because it was a hot, draining day."
