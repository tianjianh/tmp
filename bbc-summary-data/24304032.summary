[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It has been confirmed that another person has been infected with a strain of Legionnaires disease associated with compost.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health Protection Scotland said the individual was in the NHS Tayside area.
It brings the total number of people affected by the current outbreak to six - four in Lothian and two in Tayside.
Gardeners have been urged to wash their hands after handling compost and to avoid using it in enclosed unventilated areas such as sheds and greenhouses.
Symptoms of the Legionella longbeachae infection can include headaches, diarrhoea or a dry cough followed by pneumonia.
Public health experts believe the outbreak is linked to commercial gardening compost.
The exact way in which the infection is passed from compost to people is not known, but it assumed to be through breathing in very small dust particles or very small drops of contaminated water.
Most people recover after treatment with antibiotics but those with underlying medical problems are more vulnerable.
Health experts have recommended warning labels be put on bags of compost because of the risk of Legionnaires' disease.
