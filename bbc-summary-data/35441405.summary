Adam Gilmour: Mother banned from driving when son knocked down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother whose son was killed as her children walked to get a school bus had been banned from driving at the time of the incident, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Gilmour, eight, died after he was struck in Cloughmills, County Antrim, in November 2014.
Two months earlier, his mother Sarah Hanna, 34, had been caught driving while banned.
Ms Hanna of Loughill Road, Cloughmills,  said "Adam would still be here" if she had not had a ban.
Ms Hanna made the comments outside Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Friday.
At a previous court hearing, she had admitted driving while disqualified, driving without insurance and taking her mother's car without permission.
On Friday, the judge banned her from driving for one year and imposed a three-month prison sentence, suspended for one year, for driving while disqualified on Main Street, in the village, on 4 September 2014.
He offered Ms Hanna the court's sympathy for her son's death, but added: "I trust that I never see you in court again."
Adam was with his mother and five siblings when they were hit while walking along the Loughill Road near their home.
One month before her son's death, Ms Hanna had asked the education board in the area to provide transport along the road for her children, saying she was concerned they would be hit.
