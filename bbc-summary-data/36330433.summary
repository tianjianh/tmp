Thousands of ceramic poppies from the Tower of London are being delivered to Lincoln Castle where they will go on display.

The Wave, by Derbyshire artist Paul Cummins, was previously installed at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park as part of a national tour.
His full installation, named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, drew more than five million visitors in London.
Each poppy represented one death in the British forces, a total of 888,246.
Mr Cummins said it was daunting to see the artwork being moved, but was looking forward to seeing it in a new location.
He likened the process to putting together a giant Meccano set.
"I'm intrigued to what people are going to think and how it is going to be presented," he said.
"Everyone is different, and will have a different story, and reaction."
The Wave will be on show at Lincoln Castle from 28 May to 4 September 2016.
Another section of the poppy display - known as the cascade - or Weeping Window - will go on display at Black Watch Castle and Museum, in Perth, Scotland, from 30 June - 25 September - and at Caernarfon Castle from 12 October - 20 November 2016.
