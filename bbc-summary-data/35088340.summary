Jones, who began his new role with the national side earlier in December and has begun selecting his backroom staff, has worked with Gustard at Saracens.
"Paul is considering the offer," said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall.
"I'm sure there will be dealings between the Rugby Football Union and ourselves over the next 24-48 hours."
Jones gave Gustard his first coaching role in 2008-09 while at Sarries.
On Saturday, the Independent reported that former head coach Stuart Lancaster's backroom staff of Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt would all leave their roles.
Former England captain Steve Borthwick continues to be linked to a role under head coach Jones, who he assisted at the World Cup with Japan.
However, his current club Bristol maintain their forwards coach will remain with them.
"Steve Borthwick is contracted to Bristol Rugby for two years," said a club statement. "He is committed to helping the club achieve its ambitions of top-flight rugby."
