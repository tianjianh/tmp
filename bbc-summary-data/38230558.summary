Cameron Lawley suffered brain damage after the incident at his home in Rhyl in 2012.
He died in March this year after being transferred to a Leeds hospital from Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan.
A conclusion of accidental death was given at his inquest on Tuesday.
Consultant paediatrician Dr Duncan Cameron praised the "extraordinary devotion" of Cameron's parents in caring for him.
Coroner Nicola Jones told the hearing at Llandudno Town Hall that it had been a "horrible accident at home" and the cause of death was severe sepsis.
She said: "There was no lapse in care which made him die sooner."
