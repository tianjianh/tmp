Charlton Athletic 1-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood extended their unbeaten run to 13 matches after an injury-time equaliser rescued a draw against League One play-off hopefuls Charlton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite Charlton dominating early possession, it was the visitors who had the better of the chances in the first half.
Striker Devante Cole had two efforts kept out by the legs of Addicks stopper Declan Rudd before the Norwich loanee tipped over a Cian Bolger header.
However, it was Charlton who took the lead through a close-range Ricky Holmes finish following superb work from midfielder Jake Forster-Caskey with 37 minutes gone.
After the break Fleetwood searched for an equaliser and went close as Rudd denied Cole again just after the hour.
Uwe Rosler's men continued to press forward, with substitute David Ball clipping an effort onto the roof of the net while Charlton striker Tony Watt blazed over inside the penalty area after 77 minutes.
Ten minutes of added time was given and Fleetwood took advantage, with Amari'i Bell firing home from Kyle Dempsey's corner in the 94th minute.
Moments later, Charlton were reduced to 10 men as Nathan Byrne saw red for a foul on Ball before Fleetwood substitute Ashley Hunter struck the post as neither side managed to find the winner.
