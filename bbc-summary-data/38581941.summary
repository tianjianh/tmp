The 25-year-old spent the first half of this season on loan at Barnsley but has started the Latics' last two games since he was recalled from Oakwell.
Egypt international Morsy began his career at Port Vale and joined Wigan from Chesterfield in January 2016.
"If I am being honest, six months ago I didn't think I would ever play for the club again," he told the club website.
"I had a great time at Barnsley, but as soon as I came back earlier this month, the manager here outlined straight away what he wants, his vision for the club and that's something I want to be a part of."
