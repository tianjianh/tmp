Child radicalisation: NSPCC to advise concerned parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A charity has trained its counsellors to help parents who fear their children are being radicalised.

The NSPCC said its existing support line could now advise parents worried about extremists grooming a child.
It said counsellors had been trained to spot warning signs such as children isolating themselves or "talking as if from a scripted speech".
Recent terror attacks "highlighted the growing problem of individuals being influenced by extremism", it added.
The charity said it had already started getting calls from people worried about the problem.
One caller said: "I'm concerned that someone is trying to force a young boy into having extreme beliefs. He has started acting differently recently and has become more withdrawn."
The training for NSPCC counsellors explained how extremist recruiters "befriend vulnerable targets, feed them ideologies and - in the worst-case scenario - persuade them to commit terrorist attacks".
The charity said potential targets often had low self-esteem, were members of gangs, or were victims of bullying or discrimination.
Radicals tell them they can be "part of something special, and brainwash them into cutting themselves off from their friends and family", it added.
Signs which may "hint at a child being radicalised" include increased anger, becoming disrespectful and asking "inappropriate questions", the charity said.
"I'm worried about a child I know," one caller told counsellors.
"I fear that they may start holding extremist beliefs because I've heard her saying some worrying things.
"She's also showing changes in behaviour and appears to be more aggressive towards her parents.
"I'm not sure how to approach this as I know the family well... I don't think staying silent is an option in the current climate."
NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: "The fact that a young person might hold extreme or radical views is not a safeguarding issue in itself.
"But when young people are groomed for extremist purposes and encouraged to commit acts that could hurt themselves or others, then it becomes abuse.
"That's why we've trained our counsellors to cope with this fresh danger to young people."
The charity's counsellors can also advise parents on how to talk to children who are anxious about terrorism or upset by recent attacks, such as those in France and Germany.
