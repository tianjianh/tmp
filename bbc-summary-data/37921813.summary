Property shortage 'fuelling' Scottish house price rises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish house prices continued to rise last month, driven by a fall in the number of homes available to buy.

The latest survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) also said the number of potential buyers had risen for the second month in a row.
They said activity in the market had recovered following the Brexit vote.
The survey also predicted rent rises for tenants over the next three months as demand outpaced supply.
A slowdown in the housing market in July had been put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, held on 23 June.
However, surveyors found that this was no longer the case.
Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said the lack of housing supply in Scotland was replicated across the UK.
He said: "The dire shortage of available housing across the UK is continuing to push prices upwards, regardless of the uncertainty linked to the ongoing discussions surrounding Brexit."
House sales across Scotland rose, according to Rics, with 13% more chartered surveyors seeing a rise in activity.
Interest from prospective homebuyers also rose, with 14% more surveyors reporting an increase in interest.
Gavin Miller from surveyors Graham and Sibbald, said: "There is a lack of new properties coming on to the market.
"This has resulted in strong prices being achieved, with many of the more desirable properties selling at closing date."
