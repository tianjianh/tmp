Fake Ophelia is a large collage on canvas by Steven Campbell - one of the "new Glasgow Boys" who studied at the school.
Forsyth and his partner Moira Wylie gifted the work made in 1991 by Campbell, who died at the age of 54 in 2007.
It will hang in the art school's library.
Gregory's Girl director Forsyth first met Campbell in the 1980s. The two were fishing buddies.
When Campbell was asked to paint a famous Scot for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, he chose Forsyth, as the only famous person he knew, and a friend.
Fake Ophelia is formed of paint, textiles, string, wallpaper and paper cut work.
Campbell went to the GSA as a mature student, graduating in 1982 with a Fulbright Scholarship which he used to travel to New York.
He returned to live in Glasgow in 1986 and emerged in the group of Scottish figurative painters which also consisted of fellow GSA alumni Ken Currie, Peter Howson and Adrian Wiszniewski.
Alison Stevenson, head of learning resources at the GSA, said: "We are grateful to Bill and Moira for this generous donation to the GSA's archives and collections.
"Steven was an incredibly talented artist whose life was cut tragically short.
"We are delighted to be able to add Fake Ophelia to our rich collection of works by GSA graduates."
