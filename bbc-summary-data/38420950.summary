Singer Angel Flukes, 28, from Saltash, won Supertalent 2016 and 100,000 euros (Â£85,200).
She sang Think Twice by Celine Dion in front of an estimated 5m television viewers in Germany.
Ms Flukes said she did not expect to win and would be spending some of her winnings on a wedding next year.
The singer, who went to Plymouth's City College, lives with her fiancÃ©e Lee, 33, and her three dogs in Calvia on Mallorca.
She moved there when she was 21 to work for a summer season in Magaluf but was talent-spotted while singing in a German bar.
She is the first female winner of the Supertalent show, which has run for 10 years.
Judge Dieter Bohlen told her: "You're not just an angel, you look like you're an angel... world class".
Fellow judge Victoria Swarovski found her "breathtaking".
Ms Flukes said: "I really did not expect to win. I am very happy."
"It's hard to believe but this time last year I was getting up at seven o'clock to flip eggs in a bar," she said.
"But I have always wanted this, it's been my dream since I was a little girl."
"My dream has come true and it's unbelievable," she added.
