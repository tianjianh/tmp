Reclaim Sport is a partnership with Birmingham City Council, Sport Birmingham, BBC WM, BBC Birmingham and BBC Get Inspired.
The teams are working together to collect used sports equipment that can be redistributed to give Birmingham kids a chance to be more active.
Please be aware that the collection period is now over.
Thank you to everyone who generously donated and to the following sports governing bodies who supported the project: England Golf, England Hockey, Basketball England, Badminton England, Lawn Tennis Association and the Football Association.
Throughout October and November 2016 we asked you to collect used sports equipment and clothing so that we can give it to disadvantaged children and adults in Birmingham.
There were collection points  all over the city where the people of Birmingham donated their goods.
Schools all over the city also took taking in Reclaim Sport, encouraging pupils' friends and family to find their unwanted sports goods a new home.
The Reclaim Sport partners will then worked with the local community to make sure the kit and equipment gets to the people who really need them.
The donation drive is building up to this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year, which will take place at Birmingham's Genting Arena on Sunday, 18 December.
