Former England striker Chris Sutton warned Chelsea were "going backwards" after their third defeat of the season.
"This is the first time in his Chelsea career that he has been under real pressure," Sutton told Final Score.
Following the 3-1 defeat by Everton, Mourinho also said many people would be "happy" about his current predicament.
"The results are the worst in my career," said Mourinho. "They are not adapted to my quality, my status, but I am coping well with the situation. I am not feeling pressure.
"I am the man for the job. I don't think there is better man who could come and do my job."
In Short: Mourinho says 'happiness is low' at Chelsea
Mourinho admitted it would be a struggle to retain the Premier League title after Chelsea's third loss of the season, which leaves them with four points from five games.

"It is out of our control," he said. "To win the title, it will depend on us to improve the results but also on other clubs who are above us to lose matches.
"Even if we win every game between now and the end of season, we still depend on other results.
But he added: "Next year people can be sure Chelsea won't be playing in the Championship."
The Chelsea boss said he felt things were going against his side and his players "deserved more" from a game decided by Steven Naismith's hat-trick.
"From the first game of the season until now, they deserve better than what they have got," he said.
"Today the game was completely under control and every mistake we made we were punished. Every shot is a goal, every mistake is a goal.
"The moment is so negative that everything goes against us. At the tactical meeting we had this morning, even the computer broke. But of course it was not because of that that we did not win."
Chelsea play Maccabi Tel Aviv in the group stages of the Champions League in midweek and Mourinho believes it is the perfect opportunity for a response from his players.
He added: "I know that a lot of people are happy that after so many years to see me in a situation like this.
"Fair play. Enjoy. But I will enjoy my day tomorrow, again working hard as always thinking that on Wednesday we can win."
