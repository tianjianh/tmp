The incident happened towards the end of the show at about 17:30 BST, as the restored P51d Mustang was coming in to land.
Witnesses reported seeing the plane suddenly change course to the right, which was followed by a loud bang.
In a statement, a spokesman for IWM Duxford said the pilot was safe and no members of the public were harmed.
Paul Tolliday, an aerial photographer, captured the Mustang in flight during the show, and later after it landed in the field.
He said: "All we heard was a very solid bang, and my son just shouted 'he has crashed'.
"There was a huge dust cloud and looking through my camera I could see the pilot had got out.
"It was very scary."
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed it was investigating.
