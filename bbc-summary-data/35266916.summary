The vehicles are designed to charge wirelessly when parked over a induction plate.
The plates could eventually be installed throughout the city road network, allowing electric buses to charge on the go.
Geo-fencing GPS technology has been fitted to the vehicles, which will switch from diesel to electric mode in areas with poor air quality.
Scott Ellis spoke to James Freeman, managing director of First West of England.
