[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Hoolickin, 27, suffered multiple stab wounds in a fracas between a group of men and women on 14 October in Middleton, Greater Manchester.
Timothy Deakin, 21, of Lever Street, Heywood, denied murder but was found guilty by a jury at Bolton Crown Court.
He was ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years.
Deakin was also sentenced to three years for wounding and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, which he had also denied, and 12 months for assault, which are to be served concurrently.
The 21-year-old admitted the assault charge.
After sentencing Mr Hoolickin's family said: "Michael was much loved by all his family and friends and had his whole life ahead of him."
The family said he was taken away in "completely unnecessary circumstances".
"We cannot express how devastated we are that his life has been stolen from him.
"Today his killer has been sentenced and justice has been served."
His family added: "We can try to repair our heartache although no matter how long the sentence is, it will not bring Michael back or make our loss any easier."
