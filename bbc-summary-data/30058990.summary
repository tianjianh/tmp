Michael Jennings put Australia in front after pouncing on an error but Jason Nightingale hit back for New Zealand.
Manu Vatuvei squeezed over after great work from Johnson for a half-time lead and though Sione Mata'utia crossed, Johnson's magnificent solo effort and Vatuvei's second took the Kiwis clear.
Ben Hunt cut the gap to four points and Mata'utia fumbled a chance to win it.
With time almost up, the 18-year-old might have snatched victory for the defending champions but knocked on close to the try-line in Wellington.
It was half-back Johnson, who scored a last-gasp try against England in last year's World Cup semi-final, who was the catalyst for the hosts with his skill and pace, aided by the brutal running of the forward pack.
"We'd waited quite a while for this and I'm just so proud of the boys," he said. "It's a dream come true.
"We worked so hard this tour. It's been such an awesome tournament for the boys and to finish it off like that has just been unreal."
The triumph enabled Stephen Kearney's side to record back-to-back wins against the Kangaroos for the first time since 1953, following their 30-12 victory in the first game of a high-class competition, which they also won in 2010.
Kearney said: "We've got a great young team and the future's bright. Australia are going to keep coming back at us and the challenge is for us to keep improving."
World champions Australia, decimated by injury before the tournament and disrupted by illness in the build-up to the match, led early on as Jennings was quickest to react to touch down but they were then overrun by a rampant New Zealand team.

They showed their power in the forwards to get back into the match, particularly through Martin Taupau and Tohu Harris, who battered the Australian defensive line.
The ferocious hits were proving too much to handle and Nightingale kept up his record of scoring in every game in the competition.
Johnson showed superb footwork and composure to set up winger Vatuvei for a 14-6 advantage at the interval.
Mata'utia, Australia's youngest international, went over in the corner but Johnson showed his speed by outpacing the opposition backline before running around full-back Greg Inglis for an exceptional score.
Vatuvei powered over for his second and Hunt's try with five minutes remaining set up a tense finish but New Zealand held on.
