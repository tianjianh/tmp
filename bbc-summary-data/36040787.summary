The news comes after confirmation on Wednesday closing Paignton Hospital was "an option" being discussed.
Now the BBC has learned that the future of Ashburton, Bovey Tracey and Dartmouth community hospitals is also being looked at.
Torbay and South Devon CCG said a broader statement would be issued on Friday.
A spokesman said the initial announcement about Paignton had been made via Facebook after details of discussions were leaked.
"We thought it was best to get the facts out there," he said.
Conservative MP for Torbay, Kevin Foster, expressed his concerns about the proposals.
"The Paignton Hospital itself may be an older building, but the needs it serves to the local community are very modern, and I'd be very concerned at the idea that the services will be removed from Paignton rather than replaced in Paignton."
Chief clinical officer for the CCG Dr Nick Roberts, has now confirmed to the BBC that three other community hospitals were also being considered for closure.
