Original cast members Tyger Drew-Honey, Daniel Roche and Ramona Marquez are all set to reprise their roles as the children - Jake, Ben and Karen.
Hugh Dennis and Claire Skinner will return as parents Pete and Sue.
"The first reaction will probably be, 'My God, the kids are huge now!'" creator Andy Hamilton told the Telegraph.
Drew-Honey is now aged 20, while Roche is 16 and Marquez is 15.
Hamilton continued: "The second reaction will be the one the writers have been getting since the series started in 2007: 'I reckon you must have cameras in our house.'"
The last series of Outnumbered aired in 2014.
The BBC sitcom follows the Brockman family, in which the three boisterous children outnumber the parents.
The series is known for its improvisational dialogue and has previously won three British Comedy Awards.
