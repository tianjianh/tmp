The African Champions League holders Mamelodi Sundowns began the defence of their crown with a 2-1 win over Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) of Uganda on Friday, but conceded what could be a costly away goal.

South Africa's Sundowns hosted the first leg in Pretoria as the top-ranked clubs entered the competition at the last-32 stage.
The hosts set off to a blistering start, going 2-0 up inside the first six minutes, before KCCA's second half strike.
KCCA FC's coach Mike Mutebi, who had warned his opponents that his players could cause a shock, could not have predicted a worse start for his side.
Soumahoro Bangaly put Sundowns in front after just 2 minutes with Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento making it 2-0 to the South Africans just four minutes later.
However, the Ugandans frustrated the hosts, and their resilience was rewarded in the second half.
KCCA's goal came from in-form Geoffrey Sserunkuma in the 68th minute which could prove to be vital ahead of the return leg next weekend.
