West Ham defender James Collins has signed a new contract that will keep him at the club until 2018.

The centre-back, 32, who was out of contract in the summer, has agreed a two-year extension.
Collins has made 160 appearances for West Ham across two spells having rejoined the club in 2012, after three years with Aston Villa.
"I can't explain how happy I am to be part of a club that is moving forward and getting bigger," said Collins.
"It was worrying that I'd have to leave again."
The Wales international has only made seven league appearances this season, having seemingly become fourth choice behind Winston Reid, James Tomkins and Angelo Ogbonna.
However, he helped keep clean sheets against Stoke and Swansea in West Ham's last two games.
Collins said that the prospect of West Ham's move from Upton Park to the Olympic Stadium next summer influenced his thinking.
"It's massive and that was the biggest thing in my head," he added. "The thought of not being involved in it was getting me down a little bit."
