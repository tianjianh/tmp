McGovern made a series of superb saves as his side secured a place in the last 16 spot as one of the four best third-placed finishers in the groups.
"I was busy but it was mentally very hard - I'm immensely proud and just hope it is enough," said McGovern.
"We knew every goal was crucial so wanted to keep keep it at one and maybe nick a goal of our own."

Turkey's 2-0 win over the Czech Republic on later on Tuesday confirmed Northern Ireland's progress and they will face hosts France or Wales this weekend.
The players gave McGovern a standing ovation in the dressing room after his magnificent display at the Parc des Princes.

McGovern, who is a free agent after his contract with Scottish Premiership side Hamilton expired at the end of May, ensured Northern Ireland avoided a rout as he thwarted the Germans.
Only a first-half strike from Mario Gomez got past the keeper, while Northern Ireland rarely threatened at the other end.
"Germany had a slow start but they were excellent today, we could not get out," added McGovern.
"I've never had such a busy night and I've never played against such quality opposition.
"The boys in front of me were excellent, gave it everything and threw their bodies in front of everything."

A chant of "we're not going home" at the final whistle from noisy, boisterous, green-clad Northern Irish fans who filled one end of the Parc des Princes suggested they believed there would be at least one more match to see - possibly at the same venue on Saturday against Wales.
"If pushed about the team we are best equipped to get past it would be Wales," said Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill after a place in the last 16 was confirmed.
"We are just delighted we have advanced and we are looking forward to it.
"Michael McGovern was superb, a phenomenal performance and one of the best from a Northern Ireland goalkeeper."
