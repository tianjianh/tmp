Lonely Planet put the West Yorkshire city fifth on its list of best places to visit in Europe - saying it had shrugged off its "industrial past".
Zagreb in Croatia is named in first place, followed by Gotland in Sweden.
Leeds was praised for its "urban regeneration", "flourishing cultural scene", "thriving nightlife and "reputation for food and craft beer".
Lonely Planet's Best in Europe list is published each year, highlighting the most exciting destinations.
James Smart, Lonely Planet UK destination editor, said: "Once defined by its industrial past, Leeds is now a confident, cultural hub in the north of England.
"With major events this year, including the reopening of Leeds Art Gallery and the 50th anniversary of Leeds Carnival, there's never been a better time to head to Yorkshire and join the party."
Mr Smart said all the destinations offer "something new, exciting or undiscovered that make them worth exploring right now."
1. Zagreb, Croatia :: 2. Gotland, Sweden :: 3. Galicia, Spain :: 4. Northern Montenegro :: 5. Leeds, UK :: 6. Alentejo, Portugal :: 7. Northern Germany :: 8. Moldova :: 9. Paphos, Cyprus :: 10. Le Havre, France
Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said it was a "fabulous endorsement" for the city.
"To be recognised as one of the top places in Europe, we can all be incredibly proud of," she said.
"It's particularly encouraging to see the quality of our city's impressive cultural, leisure and nightlife scenes acknowledged and I hope this recognition means we will soon be welcoming even more visitors from across Europe and beyond."
At number one, Lonely Planet said Zagreb was "often overlooked" in favour of Croatia's extensive Adriatic coastline.
"This booming inland capital is both cosmopolitan and edgy, combining sun-splashed Austro-Hungarian squares brimming with coffee drinkers with a heady mix of Brutalist architecture, thriving street art and urban regeneration."
