[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 2-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage made it four home wins in a row by defeating relegation-threatened Cheltenham 2-1 in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Godden opened the scoring from the penalty spot against the run of play in the 18th minute.
Cheltenham had made the brighter start, but Emmanuel Onariase tripped Godden on the edge of the box and referee Trevor Kettle pointed to the penalty spot.
Godden stepped up to convert his 16th goal of the season and Stevenage took control, with Jobi McAnuff denied by a fine Scott Brown block in the 27th minute.
The lead was doubled five minutes into the second half when Steven Schumacher's free-kick was nodded down by Charlie Lee and Luke Wilkinson forced it over the line from close range.
Lee was sent off for a second yellow card in the 56th minute after bringing down Alex Pike.
Cheltenham failed to make their extra man count until 10 minutes from the end when a flying volley from Kyle Wootton gave them hope, but only two more saves from Brown denied Stevenage a third.
