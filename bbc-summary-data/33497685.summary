[SN]TITLE[SN]
Call for debate on lack of statues of notable women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Not enough women who have contributed to Welsh culture have been immortalised with statues, according to an author.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Jasmine Donahaye called for a national debate on why women are not represented as widely as men such as Sir Gareth Edwards, Aneurin Bevan and Tommy Cooper.
She became interested after writing a biography of author Lily Tobias.
There are statues of Queen Victoria in Wrexham and Boudicca in Cardiff City Hall.
Dr Donahaye told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement there are lots of generic women and angel statues in Welsh towns and cities, but few individuals.
"People who read (Lily Tobias' biography) are taken aback. They ask 'how come we have never heard of her? Why was she lost and fell from view?'"
Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan said the contributions of many women "have been submerged".
She said there is a health board named after "the Welsh Florence Nightingale" Betsi Cadwaladr, but no statue.
Mrs Morgan also said she would like to see statues of the Davies sisters, Gwendoline and Margaret, who contributed their vast art collection to the National Museum of Wales.
