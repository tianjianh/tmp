Alan Drennan: New post-mortem finds injuries, solicitor says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bruising found during a fresh post-mortem examination of the body of a County Antrim man who died in Ibiza contradict the findings of an autopsy by Spanish authorities, his family's solicitor has said.

Alan Drennan, 21, was found dead in his hotel room on 19 July.
The circumstances of the Newtownabbey man's death are unclear, but friends claim he was beaten by police.
A second post-mortem examination took place in Dublin on Wednesday.
Mr Drennan, a mechanic and doorman from Newtownabbey, had gone to Ibiza on holiday with 10 friends.
They have alleged he was beaten by Spanish police when he was taken into custody at Ibiza airport after an incident on the flight to the Mediterranean island.
He died less than 24 hours after arriving in Ibiza.
The Irish state pathologist Prof Marie Cassidy carried out the new autopsy.
"What Prof Cassidy has been able to confirm for me is that there were injuries to his face and to his scalp," said Michael Madden, the solicitor advising the Drennan family.
"I've seen those injuries and they are very consistent with the statements that are given by Alan's friends, which contradict what the Spanish police originally told us."
Spanish police had said there were no visible signs of violence on Mr Drennan's body.
In her preliminary findings, Ms Cassidy said she cannot yet determine the cause of death, Mr Madden added.
He said it may take months before the results of further tests are revealed.
The family had requested that a new autopsy be conducted in the Republic of Ireland after the first one, carried out in Spain, raised "more questions than answers".
