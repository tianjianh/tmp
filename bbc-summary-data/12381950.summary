[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a Welsh dragon tower on the English border have been approved by Wrexham councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A decision on the Waking the Dragon tower was deferred last month amid concerns, including that the bronze statue would lose its colour over time.
But the businessman behind the plans, Simon Wingett, said he did not want to paint it "toytown" red.
Ahead of the meeting, councillors requested more information about traffic around the Chirk Park site.
The plans are for a 23.5m (77ft) high dragon which will stand atop a 41.5m (147ft) high tower, and were approved with a condition about road modifications at the site.
Councillor Paul Pemberton said: "It was approved with some highway conditions. It's for minor road modifications."
At the foot of the glass tower would be a two-storey curved visitor centre with a floor space of 2,150sq m.
Mainly glass sided, this would include a reception area, cafe and kitchen, a retail area, an education/gallery area, and a restaurant and multi-use area.
