Among those appearing for the first time are Patricia Hodge, Celia Imrie, Andrew Marr, Jonathan Miller, Dom Joly, Michelle Mone and Terry Waite.
Politicians Alex Salmond and Gordon Brown are also included in the line-up, as well as regulars like James Naughtie, Peter Snow and Rory Bremner.
In addition, there is a culinary theme with the Year of Food and Drink in 2015 being celebrated with the launch of a new venue "Eat Your Words".
To mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, the festival will be "embracing all things Alice".
Events for adults include an exclusive one-off performance featuring Rory Bremner, John Sessions, John Bird and Patricia Hodge.
Alistair Moffat, festival director, said: "We're looking forward to a busy, entertaining, fun-packed weekend.
"The marquees are up and Harmony Gardens is set to welcome our authors and visitors.
"Whether it's opera, politics, adventure, history or simply superb storytelling, there really is something for everyone.
"And we are delighted to have extended the site this year to include our new Eat Your Words venue and Born in The Borders Street Market in celebration of The Year of Food and Drink Scotland."
