Every cake, biscuit and baked good featured in the latest Great British Bake Off series, is being recreated by a cafe owner in Bristol.

Lily Grist, from At the Well, is a massive fan of the show and has been making every one of the show's challenges and show-stoppers.
"You don't know what you're going to get every week, so I watch it with a bit of trepidation," she said.
But, she added her bakes were "going down really well" with customers.
The cafe and launderette was set up by Ms Grist and her two sisters in 2012.
Offering tea, coffee and snacks while people wait for their washing, it now also serves up all the "technical challenges" featured each week on the Great British Bake Off.
"They are horrendously difficult - my Jaffa cakes were a bit of a disaster, the jelly didn't set for hours and hours," said Ms Grist.
"All the things that could go wrong, did go wrong but they sold out - so that was a success."
But being "bound by whatever they do" on the show has also meant taking on showstopper challenges, such as the glazed mirror cake.
"Watching the show first really helps, you get to see all their mistakes and know not to do the same thing," she said.
"But cake week was a real, real challenge - the mirror glaze was a bit of a nightmare - I'll be honest - it just ran off my cake."
With several bakes down - including a drizzle cake, Viennese whirls, iced shortbread knickers and lacy pancakes - Ms Grist said it was "so far, so good" but she "might be on the floor" by the end of series seven.
