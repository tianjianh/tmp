[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sewage treatment firm fined for Richhill river pollution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company which treats sewage for NI Water under a public private partnership contract has been fined £2,500 for polluting a County Armagh river.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glen Water Limited also paid costs of £1,600 to restore fish stocks in the Tall River near Richhill.
About 250 metres of the river was affected when untreated sewage was discharged into it.
It caused what was described as a "moderate" fish kill.
Inspectors found a plume of untreated sewage coming from a discharge pipe at Richhill waste water treatment works in 2014.
An investigation found that an "uninterruptable power source" at the plant had failed.
In addition, a power cut to the alarm system meant staff were unaware of the problem.
Glen Water Limited is based at Dartford in Kent.
Under a 25-year public private partnership it has the contract for 25% of Northern Ireland's waste water treatment capacity.
It operates and maintains nine treatment works or pumping stations up to 2032 in return for monthly payments.
