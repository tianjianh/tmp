The whale, thought be about 20m (65ft) long, was washed up on Wanson Beach near Bude.
It was discovered by Ado Shorland, who was walking his dog.
Marine biologists are examining the carcass of the whale.  They believe it could be a fin whale although due to decay that has not been confirmed.
Mr Shorland said: "I found it yesterday morning.  It measures around 20m and the lower jaw has been detached and alone it is about 5m.  It is a very large whale.
"From a distance I thought it to be a large tarp or mesh netting.  When I realised it was a whale I was excited and saddened at the same time.
"I felt humbled to be honest, the sheer size suggests it to be an adult, and alive it would have been such a majestic mammal."
He also found a malnourished seal pup, which was taken to the Gweek Seal Sanctuary.
