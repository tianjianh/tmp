Scotland boss Strachan getting most from modest group - Graeme Souness

Graeme Souness has backed Gordon Strachan to continue as Scotland manager despite a poor start to the World Cup qualifying campaign.

Strachan is expected to have talks about his future next week after Friday's 3-0 loss to England left the Scots in fifth place in Group F.
"Is there someone out there who could make us better? I don't believe there is," said former captain Souness.
"I think Gordon is getting the most from a very modest group."
With two defeats and a home draw against Lithuania in their opening four matches, Scotland's chances of reaching a first major finals since the 1998 World Cup appear slim.
"Will they qualify out of this group? No they won't, but right now Scotland are in a cycle where they don't have a great deal to pick from," Souness told BBC 5 Live.
"The question of whether he [Strachan] should stay or go is not important."
Souness, 63, featured at three World Cups, playing alongside Strachan at the 1982 and 1986 finals.
Strachan refused to be drawn on his future following the Wembley defeat, saying the result was "cruel" on his players given the level of their performance.
The Scots squandered several good opportunities at 1-0 down, with Souness saying: "They were not humiliated.
"They were beaten by a better team with better players than them, and that's generally what happens.
"Making mistakes and not being able to score goals at the other end is a dangerous combination, but right now that is what Scotland have, and what Gordon has to work with.
"So far this year the results have not been great, but you've got to believe that results will get better."
