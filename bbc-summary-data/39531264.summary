Adnan Januzaj: Manchester United boss has made a decision on winger's future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says he has made a decision on winger Adnan Januzaj's future, but declined to say whether he is staying or going.

Belgium international Januzaj, 22, has spent the season on loan at the Premier League's bottom club Sunderland, who United are away to on Sunday.
He is under contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2018.
"I have decided but I am not telling you," said Mourinho on Friday when asked about Januzaj's future.
He has scored five goals in 63 appearances for United and is under contract until the summer of 2018.
Januzaj spent four months on loan to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund last season, but played only 12 games before returning to his parent club.
He had asked to leave United permanently last August.
Mourinho said United's home form is still 'strong' despite failing to win any of their past three Premier League games at Old Trafford.
Bournemouth, West Brom and Everton have all secured a point at United, who are unbeaten in their past 20 league games.
"I still think we are strong at home," added Mourinho. "That is my feeling. Good to know we don't lose many matches."
"20 unbeaten. I know 10 draws are 10 points. Five wins and five defeats is fifteen points and that is better, but in terms of looking to future, I prefer the 10 draws.
"It shows you are quite mentally solid, difficult to be beaten."

The strong likelihood is Adnan Januzaj's future lies away from Manchester United.
Given a five-year contract extension in 2013, United know Januzaj will be able to leave for nothing if he is still employed by the club in 12 months' time.
And the truth is, the 22-year-old has done little in two loan spells - with Borussia Dortmund last season and Sunderland this - to suggest he is capable of making a significant impact at a club with the expectations Mourinho has for them.
The last time he started a game for United was 11 February 2015. His final five appearances in 2014-15 and the three he made in the second-half of last term after his spell at Dortmund was cut short, were all off the bench.
