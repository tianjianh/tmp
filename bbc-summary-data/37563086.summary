She added: "That is all a mother is asking for, justice for her child."
The post, which is entitled "A message from Asad's mum",  was on a Facebook page called Stop Bullying Asad Khan's official page.
Asad's mother also said in the post her eldest child was "harmless" and the pain of losing him could not be described.
She also said there were no videos of Asad being bullied, nor did he tell her he had been.
However, "a number" of Asad's school friends had mentioned it, she said.
Asad had started school at Beckfoot Upper Heaton in September.
The school has expressed its sympathy and said: "Asad was a lovely boy who had made a great impression... in the few weeks since term began."
The school said it was aware of speculation about the circumstances of his death but reassured parents "this school community is a happy one".
Det Insp Paula Bickerdike said: "We are continuing to investigate what was happening in his life prior to his death on behalf of the coroner and are appealing for anyone with information which may assist this inquiry to come forward."
A meeting is due to be held at Girlington Community Centre, Bradford on Thursday evening to offer support to people affected by bullying and the death of Asad.
It has been arranged by a "small group of like-minded" people from the city.
