Leigh Griffiths given suspended ban and fine for offensive song

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic's Leigh Griffiths has been given a suspended two-match ban and fined Â£2,500 after admitting singing an offensive song about Rudi Skacel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Scottish FA disciplinary tribunal found that the striker was guilty of "not acting in the best interests of association football".
The 25-year-old was last week admonished by a sheriff after confessing to the incident in court.
The singing about the former Hearts player took place in March 2014.
The incident happened as fans gathered before a Hearts-Hibs derby game at Tynecastle and led to Celtic fining the player four weeks' wages.
Following his brief court appearance in Edinburgh, Griffiths released a statement, saying: "I made a mistake, I wrongly became involved in this incident and did not fully consider my actions.
"I apologise unreservedly for this."
The SFA says the fine is payable within 30 days and that the suspension will be triggered if there is a further breach of disciplinary rule 77 before the end of the season.
