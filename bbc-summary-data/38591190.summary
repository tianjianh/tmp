Ballymena Showgrounds to host County Antrim Shield final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year's County Antrim Shield final between Crusaders and Linfield will be staged at Ballymena Showgrounds on Tuesday 7 February (19:45 GMT).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Crues were to have home advantage for the decider on 24 January, but Linfield objected to Seaview as the choice of venue.
The club won an appeal to the County Antrim FA and the game was rescheduled.
Linfield hammered Ards in the semi-finals while league champions Crusaders progressed after beating PSNI.
