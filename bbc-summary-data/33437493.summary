A ticker-tape parade in Lower Manhattan on Friday will honour the USA's World Cup-winning women's football team.

The players, who thrashed Japan 5-2 on Sunday in Vancouver, will ride an open-topped bus down a stretch of Broadway commonly known as the Canyon of Heroes.
It's a rare honour for athletes that do not come from New York, but pressure has been building in recent days to honour their achievement.
The game was the most-watched football match in US history.
A 13-minute hat-trick by Carli Lloyd blew Japan away early in the match, watched by an average of 25.4 million viewers, peaking at 30.4 million.
President Barack Obama was among those to pay tribute to their success, which was the third time the USA women's team had won the World Cup.
A rally was held in Los Angeles for the team on Tuesday, and hours later the parade was announced by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The last time the city honoured a team of national athletes was in 1984 after the Los Angeles Olympics.
