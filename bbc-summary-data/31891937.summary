Why education matters in this election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Who should be in charge of England's state schools, including academies and free schools? Should protecting school budgets be a funding priority? And how much should students have to pay in tuition fees? These are some of the big questions for education in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Education is a devolved power in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Tuition fees in England have been a turbulent topic and this election will decide how much students, or government, will pay for an expanding university system.
Universities have warned that such plans need to be clearly funded if more people are going to be able to get a degree.
For schools, the choice will be whether the next government rolls back the changes to how schools are run and major reforms to qualifications and exams. Or else whether this process of more academies, free schools and autonomy is accelerated.
Who oversees schools, in a more fragmented system with less local authority oversight, has been ticking away as a challenge for any incoming government.
The scrutiny of schools in an autonomous academy system was one of the big questions that emerged from the Trojan Horse claims about radicalisation in schools in Birmingham.
The Liberal Democrats are unlikely to want to be reminded of their big promise at the last election, that they oppose any increase in tuition fees. This ditching of a pledge is going to be particularly difficult with student voters.
The Conservatives are likely to be accused of cutting school funding - as their commitment is to maintain funding in cash terms, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats are offering to protect budgets against rises in inflation.
Labour might face difficulties in explaining their support for academies and opposition to free schools, when the two types of school are so similar. Former education secretary Michael Gove said Labour's policy on free schools was so "tortured they should send in the UN to end the suffering".
And whatever the competing ideological ambitions, in practice much of any extra spending on schools is going to be consumed by coping with the population boom and the need for more school places and teachers.
"We call on this and future governments to stop using education as a political football" - Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL teachers' union.
"Improving standards to match the best in Europe could add one percentage point onto growth in the UK each year" - Katja Hall, CBI deputy director general
"The debate over structures has, frankly, become sterile. What's important is what happens in a school or college to make it successful or what doesn't happen to prevent it being so." - Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted chief inspector
