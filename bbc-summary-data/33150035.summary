The service personnel were collected by cabbies who then drove in convoy from South Holmwood, near Dorking, Surrey, to Worthing, West Sussex.
More than 110 cabs parked up on the promenade once they arrived.
The annual trip has been organised by the London Taxi Benevolent Association for War Disabled since 1948.
During the day, the veterans were treated to a fish and chip lunch at Worthing Civic Centre.
Chelsea Pensioner Trevor Thomson, 76, who is originally from Hollingworth, Cheshire, said: "We enjoy it very much, just getting out of London and seeing green fields again, which is wonderful. It's a really nice day."
"It's nice that we have got so many cab drivers who appreciate us. I think they deserve a medal," said Roy Nash, 84, from Chingford, north-east London.
It was a "time-honoured tradition" for the people of Worthing to welcome these "brave men and women" to the town each year, according to council leader Daniel Humphreys.
Paul Davis, of the London Taxi Benevolent Association for War Disabled, said: "The drivers give up their time for nothing, they don't get paid for it, but they make friends over the years."
