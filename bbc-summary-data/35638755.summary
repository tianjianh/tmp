The Derry GAA star was shown a straight red card by referee Raymond Hetherington at Seaview following his clash with Crues skipper Colin Coates.
The lengthy absence of their top scorer will be a massive blow to Glenavon who are fourth in the league table.
The 32-year-old has scored 17 goals in the current Irish Premiership campaign.
"Eoin is a big player for us. There is no denying it," said Glenavon player-manager Gary Hamilton.
"We do not really have a player who runs behind defences like he does.
"Any team would miss a striker who has scored the number of goals he has.
"But we just have to get on with it and keep trying to win games of football."
