A seal that was rescued as a pup and released back into the wild has been found living on Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire, 11 years later.

The grey seal was raised at the Welsh Mountain Zoo in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, until 2002 after becoming lost.
Skomer researcher Dave Boyle confirmed the now full-grown bull was the same seal after identifying its orange tag.
He said: "He's the first north Wales seal known to have been seen on Skomer."
Mr Boyle added: "I've been researching grey seals on Skomer on and off since 2001.
"The research undertaken shows that generally the seals sighted on Skomer often come over from Cornwall."
The seal was still a pup weighing in at around 40kg (90lbs) when it came into the care of the Seal Rescue Centre at the Welsh Mountain Zoo.
He was taught to eat whole fish in preparation for his release and now weighs an estimated 250kg (550lbs).
Head keeper Michelle Pywell said: "This is fantastic news.
"It gives us a great sense of achievement to know that our hard work pays off and also shows just how important the work we do is in assisting in the conservation of our native seals. "
