"The student has died. I'm very, very sorry for the family," said Troutdale police chief Scott Anderson.
Officers did not say how the suspect died, nor whether he was also a student at Reynolds High School in Troutdale.
Police arrived after shots were reported as classes started on Tuesday morning, when the suspect opened fire with a rifle.
The victim, killed in the boys' locker room in a detached building holding the school's gymnasium, was identified by authorities as Emilio Hoffman.
An athletics instructor was also grazed by a bullet but was able to initiate a school lockdown, which police say may have saved lives.
The person with the gun was found dead in a separate bathroom, police said.
Students were seen being led from the high school with their hands on their heads, and there were emotional reunions with parents outside.
During the evacuation another person was found to be armed with a gun and taken into custody. Mr Anderson said that was unrelated to the shooting.
Mr Anderson said investigators had tentatively identified the gunman but were not prepared to reveal his identity.
The shooting follows a spate of recent attacks at or near school campuses.
Last week, a teenager was killed and two other people wounded when a gunman opened fire in a building at Seattle Pacific University.
