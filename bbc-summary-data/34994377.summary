Heyneke Meyer has resigned as the head coach of South Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 48-year-old's contract was due to expire at the end of the month but he has decided to stand down immediately.
Meyer oversaw the Springboks' shock World Cup group-stage defeat by Japan, before they recovered to reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual winners New Zealand.
"I have realised that, as much as I still have a lot to offer, the time has come for change," said Meyer.
"My integrity has always been very important and I feel I can leave with my head held high."
The former Leicester Tigers coach apologised to the South African nation after the 34-32 reverse at the hands of Japan in Brighton in October.
Meyer had named the most experienced Springbok Test side ever, with 851 caps in the starting XV, but they still suffered one the biggest upsets in rugby union history.
After that opening defeat, they recorded group-stage victories over Samoa, Scotland and the United States before beating Wales 23-19 in the quarter-finals.
They ended the World Cup in third place after overcoming Argentina 24-13 in the third-place play-off.
