Continental Cup: Liverpool Ladies 0-2 Notts County Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two first-half goals by Ellen White ensured Notts County beat Liverpool 2-0 to set up a Continental Cup final with Arsenal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England striker put the visitors ahead after two minutes, heading home Alex Greenwood's free-kick.
She netted her second after connecting with Danielle Buet's impressive cross and was denied a hat-trick when another effort was ruled out for offside.
Liverpool's best chances fell to Rosie White and Natasha Dowie.
The Lady Magpies will face Arsenal in the final at Rotherham on 1 November, having already finished FA Cup runners-up in August.
Rachel Williams looked a constant threat for County and the midfielder forced the Liverpool defence into two last-ditch clearances following a couple of powerful headers.
The defeat marked the return of Liverpool midfielder Fara Williams, who came on for the last 10 minutes following three months out with a hamstring injury.
Notts County striker Ellen White:
"This is another milestone, obviously we wanted to do a bit better in the league but this is a massive cup for us.
"We want to go to the final and put in a big performance and do it for our coaches more than anything. Rotherham's an incredible stadium and we'll look forward to facing Arsenal."
Liverpool Ladies manager Matt Beard:
"I felt we gave a good account of ourselves but Notts County deserved to win it.
"I thought especially in the second half we were good and created some chances but we've got 10 players who have come through our centre of excellence and nine players out injured.
"All nine of them probably would be in the starting XI and you can't legislate for that."
