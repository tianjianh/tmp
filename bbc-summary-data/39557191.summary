Tony Adams: Granada name ex-Arsenal and England captain head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams has been appointed head coach of Granada until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adams replaces Lucas Alcaraz, who was sacked on Monday after a 3-1 home defeat by Valencia that leaves them 19th in La Liga.
The 50-year-old had been working at the Spanish club since November and is vice president of the company owned by Granada's club president.
His first game will be at home to Celta Vigo on Sunday.
Adams left Azerbaijan side Gabala in 2011 and previously managed Wycombe Wanderers and Portsmouth.
He has worked alongside Granada's president John Jiang in his role as vice president of the Chinese businessman's DDMC company and has been sporting director for Chinese Super League club Chongqing Dangdai Lifan.
Adams played 669 times for Arsenal between 1983 and 2002, spending 14 years as captain, and won 66 England caps.

"It would make much more sense for Adams' new role to be a temporary one, buying some time while the club makes longer-term plans for next season and beyond.
"Certainly, Adams being named permanent manager would not fit very well with the 'Spanish structure' he spoke about in his interview last month.
"And until today, everything Adams had said about his role at Granada suggested that he was happy to take a backroom director's role rather than holding ambitions to become first-team manager, and that remains the most likely scenario beyond the current season.
"But considering his strong relationship with the club's owner, of course he could end up getting the job on a permanent basis."
