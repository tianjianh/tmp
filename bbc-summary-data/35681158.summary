[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial remembering the British military personnel who died in the first Gulf War has been unveiled 25 years after the conflict ended.

The monument, which has 47 paving stones bearing the names of those killed, was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum.
About 1,000 people were at the memorial as a list of the dead was read out.
The conflict began in 1990 and ended when Iraqi forces were driven from Kuwait in February 1991.
A US-led coalition fought the Iraqi army during the war after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait was declared illegal by the UN.
The new memorial, at the arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, has three pillars to represent each of Britain's armed forces.
Its centre stone carries the image of the reverse of the Gulf Medal engraved in black granite.
The Â£70,000 memorial was commissioned, designed and built by The Gulf War Memorial Trust Appeal (GWMTA), a small committee comprising Gulf War Veterans and three family members of the 47 fallen.
The money was raised through charity events and sponsorship, with Â£35,000 coming from the Kuwaiti government.
Kerry Fuller, from GWMTA, who served in the conflict in the helicopter force, said veterans and families now have somewhere to go and remember their family and friends.
He also said he was pleased with the friendships forged in Kuwait, as the memorial could not have been constructed without them.
