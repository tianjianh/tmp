[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain missed out on a bronze medal at the Archery World Cup event in Shanghai after a 6-0 defeat by India.

Britain's recurve team had already exceeded expectations, beating Australia and number one seeds USA.
They then narrowly missed out on a chance to shoot for gold following a one-point loss to Korea's cadet team.
But Patrick Huston, Larry Godfrey and Kieran Slater were unable to make the medals on Sunday, finishing fourth behind third seeds India.
Atanu Das, Jayanta Talukdar and Mangal Singh Champia enjoyed an almost flawless start, dropping only two points in the first set before edging the second.
At the halfway point in the third Huston, Godfrey and Slater were leading 28-26, but India's final three arrows saw them take the set by a single point.
