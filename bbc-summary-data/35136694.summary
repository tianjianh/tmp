The victim said: "After a seven month battle with cancer I said goodbye to my husband, the man I love so much. To find our home broken into, a home that we had built together, there are just no words.
"I haven't been able to grieve for my husband. I've not only lost him, but I've lost so much of 'us' in everything they've taken."
Police are appealing for information about the break-in, which happened in Avon Road in Oldswinford, at some point between 10:00 GMT on Wednesday and 01:15 on Thursday.
West Midlands Police have released CCTV images taken from the area which show a young man and a van they want to trace in connection with the burglary.
Det Con Shelley Punshon said: "I can't even begin to understand how painful it must be to return home to a burglary just hours after the death of your husband.
"Someone is going to know who did this, but they may not know the full circumstances of what the home owner was going through. I'd urge them to do search their conscience and do the right thing."
