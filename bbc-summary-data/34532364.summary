The Irish National Assets Management Agency (Nama) sold its entire Northern Ireland property loan portfolio last year but the deal has been the subject of several allegations, including that some involved in the transaction stood to gain financially.
Giving evidence to a Stormont committee which is investigating the Â£1.24bn deal, Mr Robinson said it was "outrageous" to allege he was to benefit personally.
He also defended those involved in the deal, describing them as pillars of the establishment.
BBC News NI's business correspondent Julian O'Neill reports.
