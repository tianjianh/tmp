Officials have told US media that an airman shot his commander in an apparent murder-suicide.
Police responded to reports of a shooting at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland around 09:00 local time (15:00 BST), a spokesman said.
Two bodies were found in a room at the base, and authorities believe the gunman is one of the dead.
The Bexar County Sheriff's Office said they continued to search the buildings after finding the people who were killed.
"There are no indications that this was a terrorist attack," an Air Force statement said.
Joint Base San-Antonio Lackland is the military's largest joint base, where airmen do basic training.
