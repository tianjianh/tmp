Developer Signature Living opened the doors of the Grade II*-listed building to showcase its vision.
Opened as a coal trading centre in 1883, it had many uses, such as a concert venue, before closing in 2013.
In July, Cardiff council's planning committee approved plans to turn it into a 200-suite hotel.
Work is expected to take 18 months and the venue will also be used for weddings and conferences.
Signature Living's Lawrence Kenwright outlined regeneration work to areas of the Coal Exchange, some of which have not been used for decades, at the event.
He said it would "give the building a fantastic future while celebrating its illustrious past".
