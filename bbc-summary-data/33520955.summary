Yorkshire: Glenn Maxwell set to replace injured Aaron Finch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire have extended their deal with Glenn Maxwell after Aaron Finch was ruled out for the rest of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All-rounder Maxwell was set to join the Australia A squad in India but he will instead remain at Yorkshire.
The 26-year-old was originally signed for the T20 Blast, but will now be available for the One-Day Cup and County Championship as well.
However, New Zealand's Kane Williamson will join the club for the final four games of the Championship season.
Finch's foot injury ended a poor run at Yorkshire, in which he averaged 12.66 in the T20 Blast.
It is the latest in a series of injury problems for the batsman, who bruised a lung during a second XI game, shortly after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered while playing in the Indian Premier League.
"That's the end of the season for Aaron, as far as Yorkshire is concerned," director of cricket Martyn Moxon told the club website:
"It is a great disappointment for Aaron and the club and we wish him a speedy recovery."
