Steven Corbet was reported missing after last being seen getting off a bus at Guernsey's Portelet Bay on 27 June.
Guernsey Police said formal identification would take a few weeks but evidence at the scene suggested it was Mr Corbet.
The "severely decomposed" body was found in thick undergrowth at Pleinmont, an area police had searched.
In June, officers revealed he had been detained for being drunk and held overnight on 26 June. He was released on 27 June, the day he was reported missing.
When he went missing, officers carried out a "methodical examination" of the area where he was eventually found including the use of dogs and drones.
Police went on to say that "no search technique offers 100% chance of success" and that the winter conditions had reduced the vegetation making it more accessible.
A cause of death is yet to be determined.
A force spokesman said officers are working with both Mr Corbet's family and the family that found the body.
