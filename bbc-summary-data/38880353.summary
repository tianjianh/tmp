Led by 20-year-old  Sima Azimi,  the Shaolin Wushu club practises on a snow-covered mountaintop to the west of Kabul.
Developed from ancient Chinese martial arts, the sport of wushu sees these young women moving fluidly, slicing the air with silver swords.
After learning the sport in Iran, Sima won medals in competition and says: "My ambition is to see my students take part in international matches and win medals for their country."
Despite the popularity of martial arts in Afghanistan, women's sport is severely restricted.
All of the women in the club are Hazara, a Dari-speaking, mainly Shia group. They have generally more liberal social traditions that allow them to practise sports outside the home.
In addition to the regular dangers of life in Kabul, these women face intimidation and abuse.  One member, Shakila Muradi, says: "There are many people harassing us, but we ignore them and follow our goals."
Sima has been teaching in Kabul for about a year, training at the club's gym with her father.
This gym has a large poster of stuntman Hussain Sadiqi, a Hazara martial arts champion who fled to Australia to work in film.
Her father declares his pride in his daughter.  "I am really happy that I helped, encouraged and supported Sima," he says.
