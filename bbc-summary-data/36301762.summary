The ex-Birmingham City trainee, 20, who was on loan at Kidderminster Harriers in 2014-15, was used as a non-contract player in Marcus Bignot's National League North title-winning side.
"He impressed us enough to be offered his first contract with ourselves for next season," Bignot told BBC Sport.
"It's a real opportunity for him to play National League football."
Kelly is one of several ex-Harriers players at Damson Park as the promoted club prepare for life at the fifth tier of English football for the first time.
Manager Bignot, who played at Aggborough in his non-league playing days, signed goalkeeper Danny Lewis, 33, and midfielders Callum Gittings, 30, and Jack Byrne, 26, last summer.
And he has now also brought in former Harriers manager Gary Whild to join his backroom team, following former Aston Villa and Walsall striker Darren Byfield's departure to take up a managerial role at Redditch.
Gittings, 30, who ended last season on loan at Leamington, is expected to stay in National League North by joining AFC Telford.
Defender Michael Nottingham has already left, having agreed terms with Northern Premier League side Salford City.
But the Moors have made two signings - Worcester City goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan, 34, and Redditch midfielder Jamey Osborne.
Solihull's first season in the National League is likely to kick off on Saturday, 6 August, with fixtures due to be released on Wednesday, 6 July.
