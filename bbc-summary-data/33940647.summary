Royal Victoria Hospital: Does new emergency department cure health service ills?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is tremendous expectation around the opening of Northern Ireland's new emergency department at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

But it is crucial to remember this is, after all, just a building. Bricks and mortar do not make a health service.
Instead, it requires adequate staffing and facilities right across the health and social care system.
Last year, the BBC reported that local emergency waiting times were the worst in the UK.
While those statistics were not helped by the fact that the region's biggest emergency department was actually a makeshift building, many other factors came into play as well.
Sadly, some of those factors still remain.
Too few staff, including emergency consultants and ambulance crews, for example, and the BMA is also warning that a shortage of GPs is now critical causing the public to turn to their local hospitals instead.
So, for the new emergency department to be allowed to work these other issues must be addressed by Health Minister Simon Hamilton.
Also, the public must stop using the emergency department as the first point of contact when they have a health problem.
But can they be blamed when the alternatives, including GPs, pharmacies and out of hours services, are clearly not working to their full potential?
The emergency department also becomes congested as staff are unable to move patients to hospital wards as there are too few beds.
In turn, patients are staying longer on hospital wards unnecessarily as there is insufficient care in the community.
It is a vicious circle.
Unfortunately it becomes too easy to blame the emergency department and those who work in it.
Instead it is the responsibility of all five health trusts, the health board and ultimately the health minister to ensure all the pieces of the health jigsaw are in place.
Responsibility also rests with the public to choose wisely.
To prevent the new emergency department resembling a pressure cooker it needs the support of the entire health care system.
While its opening is welcomed it is not the cure the local health and social care system requires.
