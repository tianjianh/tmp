Oliver Gobat murder: UK police could help St Lucia investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British police may be sent to St Lucia to investigate the death of a luxury hotel owner after an inquest found he was unlawfully killed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Oliver Gobat, 38, was found in a burnt-out car on the Caribbean island in April last year.
He was reportedly shot and then set alight.
After the inquest in Woking delivered its verdict, The Foreign Office said it had been agreed in principle UK police could assist investigators in St Lucia.
Surrey Police said no request for assistance had yet been made.
Mr Gobat, known as Ollie, was born on the island but grew up in Surrey, where he played junior cricket at county level.
He and his two older brothers ran a five-star boutique hotel at an exclusive resort in St Lucia.
The Foreign Office said any assistance from UK forces would have to be funded by Caribbean authorities.
But, it said, no decision had been made to deploy police to St Lucia and it could not comment on cost details.
Surrey Police said it was aware of Mrs May's decision and would "carefully" consider any requests from St Lucia.
