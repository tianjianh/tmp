A man has been jailed for ramming a police motorcyclist and trying to run him over during a 130mph pursuit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Galbraith, 18, of Grays, drove at speeds up to 130mph (209km/h) on the A13 outside the Essex town in January.
As he was escorted off the road, he pushed the police bike in front of him into a roundabout and tried to run the officer over, Essex Police said.
The force said the officer was "lucky to be alive". Southend Crown Court jailed Galbraith for six years.
The defendant, of Boscombe Avenue, had admitted attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, aggravated vehicle taking, driving without insurance and having no driving licence.
He also received a five-year driving ban.
Essex Police said officer Paul Hills was on his bike when he spotted Galbraith speeding in a BMW in the outside lane of the A13.
He followed him as he accelerated to speeds of up to 130mph.
When Galbraith braked hard and moved into the inside lane, Mr Hills pulled in front and indicated to the 18-year-old to follow him.
As he was escorted off the road, Galbraith pushed Mr Hills' bike 35 yards (32m) into the oncoming roundabout. The BMW was then hit by a van.
Police said they believed Galbraith then attempted to run over Mr Hills as he was lying on the ground, but he was blocked by another vehicle.
He then drove off, but crashed soon afterwards and was caught in an industrial estate.
Mr Hills suffered severe back injuries in the crash.
Investigations revealed Galbraith had knowingly bought the BMW, which had been stolen.
Insp Scott Egerton said: "PC Hills is lucky to be alive.
"As Galbraith sped away from the scene witnesses saw him laughing, but that soon stopped when he lost control on the next roundabout and crashed into a wall."
