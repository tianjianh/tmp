Fire at 16th Century thatched pub in Chideock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 16th Century thatched pub in a Dorset village has been extensively damaged in a fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Clockhouse Inn in Chideock was "showing signs of collapse", Dorset Fire and Rescue said.
Fourteen crews have been tackling the blaze, which started at about 12:00 BST, but the fire service said it was scaling down its operation.
The A35 through Chideock has been shut in both directions causing severe congestion for bank holiday traffic.
No-one was injured in the fire.
