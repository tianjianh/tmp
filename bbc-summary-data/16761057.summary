President: Donald Trump
Republican candidate Donald Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the presidency in the 2016 election. Mr Trump's victory was one of the biggest upsets in US political history, confounding the opinion polls and putting an end to eight years of Democratic control of the White House. 
A billionaire businessman, reality TV star and political outsider, Mr Trump campaigned on a vow to "make America great again". He presented himself as an agent of change who would bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, tear up unfavourable trade deals, and curb illegal immigration. 
During an election campaign generally regarded as the most acrimonious in living memory, Mr Trump drew accusations of racism and misogyny, and managed even to alienate many senior members of his own party.
Yet despite poll predictions that America would elect its first female president in Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump emerged victorious, claiming key swing states amid an enormous wave of support especially among white working-class voters.
