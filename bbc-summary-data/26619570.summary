'Bristoland' sign removed after change to 'It's Bland'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 8ft (2.4m) high Bristoland sign which appeared in the Avon Gorge has been taken down by the land owner after it was changed to read "It's Bland".

The first version of the sign appeared opposite a main route into the city, the Portway, in January.
It was thought to pay tribute to the sign in the Hollywood hills which had originally spelt out Hollywoodland.
The National Trust said the change was "not appropriate" and the sign had been removed.
"We can see the funny side of Bristoland, but we always said the sign had a finite life and the change to It's Bland was the point to remove it," said Bill Morris, National Trust head warden for the site.
It is not known whether its creator, who remains anonymous, had anything to do with the recent change.
"I certainly wouldn't have liked to have put them up - it's a pretty steep slope so it would have been a difficult job," said Mr Morris.
"It was fun while it lasted and I hope they can come up with something new."
The organisers of arts festival Upfest first brought the sign to public attention.
Spokesman Stephen Hayles said there were plans to make it a "more permanent" feature.
