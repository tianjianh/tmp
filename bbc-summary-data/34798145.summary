Planners back new housing plan at former Visteon factory site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planners have backed a redevelopment scheme for the former Visteon factory site in west Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fold Housing Association wants to build 244 homes, a community centre and business units on the site.
The development is opposed by some local residents who object to the loss of a site that was previously used for employment purposes.
Belfast City Council's planning committee will decide on the proposals next week.
Fold had been required to revise the scheme after planners said it did not include enough new space for economic or business use.
The plan now includes more space for business units.
The Visteon factory closed in 2009 with the loss of more than 200 jobs.
