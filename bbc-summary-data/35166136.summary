Afghanistan Taliban: 'Reinforcements arrive' in Sangin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Military reinforcements have arrived in the Afghan town of Sangin to support police and soldiers besieged by Taliban militants, the Helmand district governor has told the BBC.

Mohammad Jan Rasoulyar also said that military planes had dropped food supplies for government positions in Sangin.
He said the army was "now taking the fight to the Taliban".
Civilians have been fleeing the town amid continuing bitter fighting.
The Taliban insist that their siege of the town is not over "and the government will soon announce their defeat".
BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus says that the struggle for Sangin is just part of a wider battle for control in Helmand province.
Our correspondent says that if it were to fall into Taliban hands it would be a serious reverse for the government in a province that has been a major centre of the Taliban insurgency with important supply routes for the opium trade. Its proximity to Pakistan also serves to give the area a broader strategic significance.
Prior to the withdrawal of the bulk of Nato troops from Afghanistan last year, Sangin was a major centre of the military alliance's involvement in Afghanistan.
A BBC Pashto correspondent says anyone controlling it can get access to taxes on the illicit local trade in opium.
In fighting throughout Tuesday, Afghan forces struggled to hold the police HQ in the town amid conflicting reports about the fate of the whole district.
The Helmand governor and police dismissed as "totally false" Taliban reports that they now controlled it.
Sangin district has fallen to Taliban control several times and the fighting has caused significant casualties among Afghan and international forces.
Why Sangin matters
Who are the Taliban?
Some 12,000 foreign soldiers are deployed in the country as part of the Nato-led Resolute Support international coalition, which is meant to underpin Afghan security forces.
Britain has announced that a small number of UK personnel have been deployed to Camp Shorabak in Helmand province in an advisory role. The BBC understands there are 10 such personnel.
Resolute Support replaced the 13-year Operation Enduring Freedom, which saw more than 900 international coalition deaths in Helmand province. More than 100 of them were British soldiers.
The head of Helmand's provincial council, Muhammad Kareem Atal, said 2,000 Afghan security forces personnel had been killed in the province this year.
Sangin district police commander Mohammad Dawood told the BBC earlier that food and weapons supplies were running low.
Mr Dawood said that, over the past month, security forces in the district had sustained 365 casualties, both dead and injured.
Sangin was once the centre of operations for international forces in Afghanistan.
Regaining full control of it would increase the Taliban's mobility in parts of northern Helmand and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade.
Keeping control of the centre of Sangin will not be easy for the Taliban, but resentment of government troops is high following military operations which locals say wrought unwarranted destruction.
If the government wants to control the area, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces here.
In September, the Taliban briefly overran the northern city of Kunduz in one of their biggest victories in 14 years of war.
At least 10 Taliban insurgents have been killed in recent clashes with the security forces in the northern province of Sar-e-Pul province, local officials quoted by Tolo News on Wednesday.
