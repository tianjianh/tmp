The Nigerian, 25, initially moved to Vicarage Road on a season-long loan in July but has now agreed a contract until the summer of 2017.
Ighalo has scored in each of his last three Championship appearances for the Hornets, having failed to find the net in his first seven outings.
Watford lie second in the table and face Middlesbrough on Saturday.
