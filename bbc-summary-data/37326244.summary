[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood managed just a second win in nine games as they overcome Torquay United at Meadow Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Garrard's men were 2-0 ahead after just 12 minutes as Tony Jeffrey opened the scoring when he took a long ball forward in his stride and beat Brendan Moore skilfully.
Morgan Ferrier showed strength and determination to hold off defender Giancarlo Gallifuoco as he turned well and shot in to double the lead.
Torquay had a great chance to get back into the game when Femi Ilesanmi handballed in the area, but Nathan Blissett had his penalty saved by Grant Smith before the hosts held on comfortably in a drab second half.
