He spoke to Michael O'Connor, who laid on top of his girlfriend to protect her from gunmen at the Bataclan music venue in November 2015.
The award for outstanding broadcast interviews is named after the late BBC Radio 4 broadcaster and presenter.
Nolan won in 2014 for an interview with a controversial Belfast pastor.
Judges said Nolan's interview with Mr O'Connor had been "a compelling listen" that drew the listener into "a world of almost unimaginable fear and bravery".
Following the announcement, the broadcaster said:  "I cannot tell you how much this award means to me.
"I have vivid memories of listening to Nick Clarke and being in awe of his effortless command of broadcasting. I want to tell Nick's familyâ€¦ I am deeply humbled to be associated with this award."
