Norovirus forces Ninewells Hospital ward closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ward at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital has been closed to new admissions after a suspected norovirus outbreak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Tayside said several cases of vomiting and diarrhoea had been reported in ward six, which treats elderly female patients.
It said it took the decision as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the virus, which is also known as the winter vomiting bug.
The board asked anyone with symptoms of the bug not to visit the hospital.
