The award, from the government's Single Homeless Fund, will be used to introduce a "no second night out" policy for rough sleepers.
The policy aims to ensure no-one has to sleep rough for more than one night.
Some of the funding will specifically help people being released from prison or discharged from hospital at risk of becoming homeless, Worcester City Council said.
It will see extra staff taken on at a number of organisations.
St Paul's Hostel in Worcester, local clinical commissioning groups and the Worcester Housing and Benefit Advice Centre are among the groups set to benefit.
Last year 47 people were found to be sleeping rough in Worcestershire, according to the city council.
