A father of 21 has been jailed for acting as a loan shark by taking benefit money from vulnerable relatives and lending it back with interest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Harvey, who was unemployed, charged up to 400,000% on loans, leaving people without food.
The 53-year-old, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, admitted a string of offences, including theft and fraud.
He was jailed for three years and four months at Cardiff Crown Court.
Judge Michael Fitton QC told him: "You have an arrogant and controlling personality.
"You spoke about these adults being fragile and vulnerable and what you have done is exploited them."
Harvey, who has had children with nine different women, spent ten years taking benefits from eight "disadvantaged" family members and friends, including his brother.
Prosecutor Timothy Evans said he took control of post office and bank cards and helped himself to more than Â£22,000 of their money - giving the victims smaller amounts to live on.
"It was deliberate and sustained abuse of vulnerable members of his own family," he said.
"He acted in a truly predatory way and was seen by these people as a friend.
Harvey's offences were uncovered by an investigation by the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit.
When interviewed by police, he told officers "he was the patriarch of the family" who was carrying on what his father taught him.
Harvey has been unemployed for the last 16 years and claims Disability Support Allowance for epilepsy, diabetes, asthma and depression.
He pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud, three of theft and two of unlicensed money lending.
