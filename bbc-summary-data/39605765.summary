Boreham Wood 0-4 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead ended their run of four consecutive losses as they thrashed Boreham Wood 4-0 in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two brilliant early goals stunned Boreham Wood and they never recovered as Gateshead recorded their first win in seven league games.
Wes York's sweet half-volley flew into the top corner after just 13 minutes and it was 2-0 moments later as Luke Hannant struck into the bottom corner from 25 yards.
Manny Smith appeared to get the final touch in a goalmouth scramble as Gateshead went three goals to the good five minutes from time.
And Jamal Fyfield put the finishing touch on the rout by delightfully curling into the far corner deep into added-on time as Boreham Wood crashed to a third successive defeat.
