[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home worker who told an elderly woman to "hurry up and die" and threatened to drop a kettle on her head has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Wilton said he "hoped there was a bomb" under the woman's chair and laughed and joked about her, a disciplinary panel heard.
The Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) found he had committed a "serious abuse" of his position.
Wilton also verbally abused two other residents at the Dundee care home.
The disciplinary hearing ruled that Wilton behaved in a verbally abusive and disrespectful manner towards service users at Balhousie St Ronan's Care Home between November and December 2014.
He was suspended when the allegations came to light and resigned ahead of a disciplinary hearing in January 2015.
The SSSC ruling stated that a removal order from the register of support workers in a care home service for adults was the "appropriate sanction".
It said: "The misconduct found constitutes a serious abuse of your privileged position and is fundamentally incompatible with being a social service worker.
"Your deliberate behaviour posed a risk of potentially significant harm to vulnerable service users.
"You had on numerous occasions abused your position of trust."
