Two binmen have been suspended amid claims they were drinking while out on their round in South Tyneside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A third man, the driver of the wagon, has also been suspended in relation to his job as a supervisor.
But a South Tyneside Council spokesman confirmed there was no suggestion he was under the influence of alcohol during the round on 27 December.
All three men have been suspended pending the outcome of an internal probe, the spokesman said.
He added: "We are aware of the alleged incident and the matter is subject to an internal investigation. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.
"However, our ongoing investigations do not relate to any driving offences."
