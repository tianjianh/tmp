Cardiff council has been criticised for having no tree up for its Christmas lights switch on.

Last year insurance company Admiral sponsored the main tree outside Cardiff Castle and it was up in time for the city's Step Into Christmas event.
But there will be no tree for the event on Thursday night.
Cardiff council said there will be a tree, but it will not be up until 25 November as it is being shipped from China.
David Hughes-Lewis, an independent retailer in Cardiff, said: "It seems a bit daft - turning all the Christmas lights on and there's no tree."
Cardiff councillor Jayne Cowan said: "Our residents and visitors want to embrace the Christmas atmosphere, and the lack of a tree will do nothing to enhance this."
A council spokesman said they have secured a 40m (131ft) tree which will be the "centrepiece of our festive decorations" outside Cardiff Castle.
The Step into Christmas event includes a street parade, the opening of Winter Wonderland and market stalls.
