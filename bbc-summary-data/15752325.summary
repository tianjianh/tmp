The force has already said the number of police officers is to reduce from 1,230 to 1,150.
A review has concluded a further 56 staff posts are also to be axed. The force employs 741 civilian staff.
Additional measures including departmental mergers and the introduction of new technology, is expected to save about £1.6m a year.
Chief Constable Craig Mackey said: "Our challenge is to continue providing an excellent policing service to the people of Cumbria on a reduced budget, so we are making some difficult choices.
"I am very conscious that when we talk about making savings we are often talking about people's jobs, but we have got to make these savings, and we have got to deliver the best possible police service that we can with the amount of money available.
"To achieve this, we have had to prioritise our frontline services, and streamline our support functions, by being more innovative and creative and by using new technology.
"There is no doubt we will be a smaller organisation after we implement these changes, but we are firmly committed to providing frontline policing in local neighbourhoods and maintaining a good performance with low levels of crime and antisocial behaviour across Cumbria."
