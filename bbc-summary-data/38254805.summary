An amputee who was caught in the door of a train in Cornwall said it was a "frightening experience".

Bob Walker was struck by the sliding doors when his crutch was trapped after he tried to get off the train when support he had booked did not turn up.
In a statement, Great Western Railway said it was investigating why the help he had arranged did not arrive.
Mr Walker said he suffered a loss of dignity and did not want others to suffer in the same way.
Disability charity Scope said families were facing significant barriers when using public transport across the country.
Head of communications Richard Lane said problems are often caused by poor attitudes of staff, inaccessible infrastructure or a lack of information.
Mr Walker was returning from Bristol after a medical assessment on injuries, including the loss of his leg, following a motorbike accident fifteen months earlier.
All his travel arrangements had been pre-booked by an insurance company including assistance at stations.
When he arrived at Bodmin Parkway staff initially refused to provide a ramp because of their own medical problems. It later arrived when they saw he was in trouble.
He said: "It was just a horrible and frightening experience. Being stuck in a train door is quite frightening to begin with.
"Apart from one leg missing I am fit and active and can get around quite well. There will be people worse off than I am and wouldn't want them to suffer the same indignity."
The Office of Road and Rail said they were working to find out how widespread the issue is.
A survey of 100 wheelchair users by Muscular Dystrophy UK found having to book help in advance was a barrier.
