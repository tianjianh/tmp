[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prince Philip Hospital, Llanelli, gets minor injuries unit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new minor injuries unit and acute medical assessment unit are opening at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Senior doctors and nurses will be able to see people for conditions like stroke and chest conditions, while GPs and emergency nurses will treat patients in the minor injuries unit.
The work is part of the hospital's Â£1.4m Front of House project.
Patients will get into the minor injuries unit via the old accident and emergency entrance.
The new assessment unit has been built at the back of the hospital and patients can be brought there by ambulance, referred by their GP or referred from the minor injuries unit if they need to see a senior doctor.
There was strong opposition to the plans to make changes to the accident and emergency department at the hospital when Hywel Dda Local Health Board announced it, including an unsuccessful legal challenge.
