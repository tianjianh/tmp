A scheme to protect rural churches from thieves has been extended after a spate of thefts in Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said 14 crimes were recorded in recent weeks, including the theft of tens of thousands of pounds of lead from churches near Ashbourne.
The Church Watch scheme, which covers Bakewell, will now cover Ashbourne, Matlock and surrounding villages.
Rev Canon David Truby said St Mary's Church, Wirksworth, had been "desecrated" after silver was stolen.
"Some of that silver is 250 years old so it's a part of the town's heritage," he said.
"We feel in some way as though the church has been desecrated."
People living near churches and chapels in the Church Watch area are asked by Derbyshire Police to report anything suspicious.
Rev Jane Harris, from the scheme, said she was "saddened" by the recent thefts but extending the scheme would make communities feel safer.
