Mark Warburton: Rangers boss offered one-match ban over 'language'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Warburton has been issued with a Scottish FA notice of complaint alleging he "used offensive, abusing and insulting language" at officials.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rangers boss was unhappy with the award of a free-kick that led to Aberdeen's late winner last Sunday.
Warburton, 54, was seen speaking to officials on the pitch after the final whistle at Pittodrie.
The Englishman has been offered a one-match touchline ban and has until Monday, 3 October, to respond.
A principal hearing date has been set for 13 October, should Warburton choose to challenge the suspension.

Referee John Beaton blew for a foul following a tackle by Rangers' James Tavernier on Aberdeen's Jonny Hayes in the final minute of game, when the score was 1-1.
James Maddison scored direct from the free-kick to secure the three points for the Dons.
Warburton later said: "I will be careful what I say about the free-kick. Everyone saw the ball move. The fourth official on the sidelines saw the ball move and made a comment. And yet a free-kick is given.
"You have got to be, I think, 100% sure in these type of games, in those areas of the park.
"Late in the game, when your players are fatigued, I thought 'Tav' made an excellent tackle there. I don't think their player moaned about it and it is a huge decision to give."
