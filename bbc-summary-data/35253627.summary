The 30-year-old, who has also featured at open-side flanker this season, has made 73 appearances for the club since joining from Cornish Pirates in 2012.
"Some of the performances he has put in at open-side for us this year show what a brilliant athlete he is," said director of rugby Conor O'Shea.
"He is a bundle of energy and his best years are still to come."
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Ward's new contract at the Twickenham Stoop.
Ward is the latest player to sign a new deal with Quins, with Nick Evans, Adam Jones, Charlie Matthews and Sam Twomey also all extending their contracts in recent weeks.
