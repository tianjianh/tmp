Pope Francis approves Irish priest for beatification

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pope Francis has approved the beatification of a Jesuit priest from Dublin for his work with the sick and dying in the early 20th century.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fr John Sullivan  (1861 - 1933) was one of 39 to be named in a decree signed by Pope Francis to be beatified - officially recognised as 'Blessed'.
He was declared a 'Servant of God' in 1960 and in 2014 he was made a 'Venerable' by Pope Francis.
In certain circumstances beatification can later lead to sainthood.
Fr Sullivan was brought up by a wealthy protestant family and was a later teacher at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare.
Since the 1940s Fr Sullivan's supporters have been campaigning for him to be made a saint.
The attribution of a miracle is given to those who have died for the faith, while receiving a sainthood requires a miracle.
Those named on the decree include Albanian Bishop, Vincens Prenushi, who died in prison in 1949 after being tortured for demanding the formation of a breakaway Albanian church under the country's former communist regime.
Albania was declared as the world's first atheist state in 1967.
Pope Francis also recognised a further 37 Albanian clerics and aspiring clerics, who were killed between 1945 and 1974, as martyrs.
During a visit to Albania in 2014, Pope Francis paid tribute to all those who died.
