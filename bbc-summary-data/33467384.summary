In one of the images by Mario Testino, the princess is pictured with her mother and father, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brother George.
The pictures were taken immediately after the fourth in line to the throne was christened at a church on the Sandringham estate on Sunday.
Among the photos is a group picture of Charlotte's immediate family.
That image was taken in the drawing room of the Queen's private Norfolk residence.
A Kensington Palace spokesman said: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their whole family had a wonderful day on Sunday and were delighted to share the special occasion with the thousands of people who came to Sandringham.
"They are very happy to share these photographs and hope that everyone enjoys them as much as they do."
Also among the images are separate shots of the princess with her mother, and George with his father.
BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said it was the first time the Queen had been pictured by celebrity photographer Testino, who also famously captured the late Diana, Princess of Wales.
The main photograph represents the people around William and Catherine, said our correspondent.
Testino has previously taken pictures of princes William and Harry with their father, the Prince of Wales, and he took the Cambridges' engagement pictures.
Several thousand well wishers turned out to greet the royals ahead of the private christening at the Church of St Mary Magdalene on Sunday.
