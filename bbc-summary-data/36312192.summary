Championship side Fulham have had their transfer embargo lifted by the Football League and are now free to trade in the transfer window.

The ban was imposed in December after the club breached the League's Financial Fair Play regulations.
The Whites exceeded the permitted loss of Â£6m in 2014-15 following their relegation from the Premier League.
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic was able to make three loan signings in January despite the embargo.
"With the embargo now lifted, the club will continue to pursue its targets in an effort to ensure it has a squad capable of competing successfully in the 2016-17 Championship," said a statement on the club website.
Midfielder Scott Parker and goalkeeper Jesse Joronen have signed new one-year deals at Craven Cottage since the end of the season.
Fulham finished the campaign 20th in the Championship table, 11 points above the relegation zone.
