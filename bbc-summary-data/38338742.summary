[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nice 2-1 Dijon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mario Balotelli scored twice to send Nice four points clear at the top of Ligue 1 - as they beat Dijon while Monaco lost 3-1 at home to Lyon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Liverpool striker converted a 32nd-minute penalty after Alassane Plea was brought down.
Julian Tavares equalised from the spot for the visitors before half-time, but Balotelli turned in Arnaud Souquet's cross soon after the interval.
Dijon had captain Cedric Varrault sent off late on.
Lyon climbed to fourth with victory at Stade Louis II, going ahead through Rachid Ghezzal's goal before Monaco defender Benjamin Mendy was sent off for kicking out at Corentin Tolisso.
Anthony Lacazatte then saw a weak penalty for the visitors saved by keeper Danijel Subasic, but they went 2-0 up when Ghezzal set up Mathieu Valbuena.
Tiemoue Bakayoko pulled a goal back for the 10 men with a deflected shot, but Lacazette sealed Lyon's victory with three minutes left with a turn and volley after Subasic had palmed out a corner.
