The versatile O'Connor spent his entire career at Griffin Park, making 501 appearances for the Bees.
The popular 33-year-old was given a coaching role last year when he also signed what proved to be his final contract as a player.
He has now been installed as Brentford's development squad coach, assisting Under-21 boss Lee Carsley.
O'Connor, who made his debut in 2000, started as a striker, established himself at right-back and also played in midfield and as a centre-back.
"There may have been clubs that would have taken me [as a player] but it is not something I every really looked in to," he said.
"I always wanted to stay at Brentford. I don't think I could ever have played for another team.
"When I got the offer to stay I was happy and my decision was always going to be to stay at Brentford.
"I will miss playing but I am very happy with the role I have."
Brentford have released out-of-contract forwards Tommy Smith, 35, and Nick Proschwitz, 28, while O'Connor joins goalkeeper Richard Lee, 32, in retirement.
