New Top Gear host Chris Evans has hinted he won't have co-hosts when he takes over the motoring show next year.

The presenter said he may not follow the old three-presenter format pioneered by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.
"They're the Three Stooges. They are the Bee Gees. They are that and I'm not. I'm me," he said at the Mipcom TV trade fair in Cannes, France.
"I'm a solo artist at the moment, I'm on my own. So do I form a band or not?"
The star had been expected to recruit two sidekicks, with Zoe Ball, Guy Martin and Dermot O'Leary among those previously rumoured to be in the running.
Evans also appealed to fans to send in their own audition tapes, and has given screen tests to some of those who did.
Speaking in Cannes, he told the Press Association: "We are going to do things differently, because we have to, we want to.
"And also, the second you wander off into the, 'Well, I'm the main host, and this is my mate over here and my mate over here', if there's three of you and you go and make a film together, suddenly you're doing what they did.
"Why would you do that? Because they were brilliant at it. I'm not going to do that.
"So, one thing is for sure, there's not going to be me and one guy there, and one guy there, that's not going to happen."
Evans also gave notice that he would shake up the format of the show, which he said previously consisted of four links and three pre-recorded items.
"We're going to change that," he said. "I can't tell you into what. I know, by the way, but I can't say at the moment.
"We are going to keep some things that I like, and my kids like, and my friends like, and that I liked anyway, but we are not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater."
The Stig - who joined Evans in Cannes - will appear in the new series, which begins next May.
Taking over the show was "formidable", Evans said, adding that it was "the biggest job I've ever had in my life".
