Rio 2016: Peter Sagan to race mountain bike event at Olympics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Slovakia's Peter Sagan will compete in the mountain bike event at Rio 2016, rather than the road race event where he is world champion.

The 26-year-old, who will ride the Tour de France for Tinkoff, is a former junior world mountain bike champion.
"Peter will do some special training for four weeks. He will go to Rio to aim for a good position," said Slovak Cycling Association head Peter Privara.
The hilly Rio road-race course is not best suited to Sagan's strengths.
Sagan won the rainbow road-race world champion's jersey in Richmond, Virginia in September.
