On the inheritance trail with an heir hunter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heir hunters spend their working lives trying to find people who may be entitled to an unclaimed inheritance. But with millions of pounds potentially at stake, just how do they go about their business in Scotland?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Every few weeks, Gordon Graham-Cameron travels from Guernsey to New Register House in Edinburgh.
His mission is to comb through official records to track down people who may be entitled to some or all of a deceased's estate which has remained unclaimed.
He's a probate researcher, better known as an heir hunter, and he operates on both sides of the border.
There's plenty of potential business.
At the moment he is handling 70 active cases involving people either born or domiciled in Scotland who died without leaving a will.
Mr Graham-Cameron's usual starting point is a little-known body called The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR). Put simply, it's the Crown's representative in Scotland which deals with ownerless property, including treasure trove.
QLTR regularly updates its website with a list of people who have died intestate and either have no spouse, civil partner or blood relative - or none who can be easily traced.
In most cases, people have up to 10 years in Scotland to make a claim under ultimus haeres - a Latin phrase meaning "last" or "ultimate" heir.
Currently more than 400 estates, worth millions of pounds in total, remain unclaimed in Scotland.
They range in net value from as little as Â£63, in the case of one Edinburgh man, to small fortunes.
The biggest as yet unclaimed is that of Italian-born Gina Parenti, who died at her home in Glasgow aged 82 in July 2013, leaving a net Â£298,000.
Mr Graham-Cameron, who works for Essex-headquartered Fleetwood Heir Hunting Services, says there are significant differences between Scotland and England in terms of accessing records in order to compile family trees.
"The records in Scotland are much more easily accessible - everything is there and you can see everything you need," he explains.
"If you need to do the same thing in England, and you are unsure, you have to order and pay for documents in advance, and they might not be the right person, depending on the name.
"If you are looking for a John Smith or something like that, there would be hundreds of them - whereas in Scotland you can actually go to the records office, look through all the John Smiths if you had the inclination, and find the one you want."
Unlike in England, estate values are published north of the border, allowing heir hunters to establish whether it is worth investing time and money on tracing potential estate beneficiaries.
But Mr Graham-Cameron says that isn't necessarily an advantage. "In Scotland, on the basis that there are more than a handful of companies offering the same service, if a high-value estate is published, there is more than a very strong likelihood that everybody will jump on that case and start researching it," he explains.
If he succeeds in finding one or more beneficiaries through documents such as birth, death and marriage certificates, Mr Graham-Cameron will approach them and offer information and documents in return for a commission.
He says his job can often be gratifying.
He adds: "There are more than a handful of cases where we have found missing relatives of people who didn't know where their nieces or nephews or brothers or even parents who might have split up were, and we have reunited these people.
"We've had a couple who didn't know that a half-brother or half-sister existed and, even if there were no children coming forward, it filled a gap in their knowledge of their family."
What is the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer?
It is the Crown's representative in Scotland which deals with ownerless property, including treasure trove.
When someone dies and is not thought to have left a will, QLTR may launch an inquiry to check whether there is a will or known spouse, civil partner or blood relatives.
If no family links to the deceased can be found, their estate is claimed for the Crown by QLTR.
QLTR advertises pending estates and estates undergoing administration on its website. Those available for claim after administration are also advertised.
Once an estate's debts, including funeral costs, have been paid, the remainder falls to QLTR.
Since devolution QLTR's net receipts have been paid to the Scottish government, rather than being transferred to the Treasury in London as used to be the case.
In 2013/14, QLTR paid Â£7.6m into the Scottish Consolidation Fund, much of it coming from the assets of dissolved companies.
Mr Graham-Cameron's company normally charges clients a commission of between 20% and 25% on the net proceeds of an estate.
But he and other heir hunters are concerned that some companies are overcharging for their services - adding on sundry costs which can lead to 50% or more being taken off the net value of an estate.
"To us, disbursement costs are purely the cost of purchasing birth, marriage and death certificates linking the deceased person to the applicant.
"There are companies whose disbursement costs include a lot more, such as travelling costs.
"With regards to another company signing up a beneficiary saying 'we will handle this on your behalf at this cost', there is not necessarily any written evidence of how much the whole procedure of offering the service is going to cost."
At the moment, the industry is self-regulated through the Heir Hunters Association, which has 500 members, most of whom are based in the UK.
It set up a watchdog called the Federation of Probate and Asset Researchers (FPAR) in 2011, but it lacks any legal powers.
Chairman Maurice Clark accepts that there are "dubious researchers" who charge excessive fees which could drain an estate but adds: "FPAR attempts to regulate the industry and whilst they can achieve that formal regulation will not be needed.
"I question the size of the problem. It is small and does not really warrant any formal regulation which would take many years to bring about."
Meanwhile, lawyers make the point that heir hunters would be less in demand if more people were to make a will.
Tim Weir, private client head at Thompsons Solicitors, says: "Although people now live longer and have more complicated lives, there remains a general reluctance to plan for the future.
"The most dangerous misconception is that things will take care of themselves.
"Life is uncertain, and circumstances can change in a heartbeat. Why work your entire life to create a future for you and your loved-ones, only to leave it to chance?
"A will and a power of attorney are the most important legal arrangements you can make in your lifetime."
