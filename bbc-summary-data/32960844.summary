[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Haroon Ahmed, 26, from Derby, has been on the run since leaving HMP Dovegate in Staffordshire on Wednesday.
Ahmed, who was serving a sentence for a robbery he committed in 2008, reportedly fled to Spain.
Serco, which runs the prison, said it had commissioned an "urgent investigation" into the circumstances of Ahmed's escape.
Staffordshire Police said it could not confirm or deny he had left the UK after the Sunday Mirror claimed to have tracked Ahmed down in Marbella.
His brother, Majeed Ahmed, 25, of Clarence Road in Derby, has been charged with assisting a prisoner in escaping from prison.
Michael Guy, Serco's director at HMP Dovegate, said: "I have commissioned an urgent investigation into the circumstances of the escape.
"We are working closely with the police to identify what went wrong and to address any failings."
