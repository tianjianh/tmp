Australian GP: Impossible to police radio messages - Jenson Button

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world champion Jenson Button fears regulations limiting radio communications this season will be "impossible to police".

As part of a number of changes for 2016, Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has limited the radio messages allowed between drivers and their team.
It is hoped that it will make things more challenging for drivers, who will be more reliant on their own intuition.
"They won't be able to listen to every message," said McLaren driver Button.
"Hopefully they can listen to as much as possible, to make it as fair as possible."

Despite Button's uncertainty over how it will work, he has welcomed the rule and is confident it will add to the excitement.
The Briton's team-mate, Fernando Alonso, is a little more apprehensive.
"Instead of instinct from the driver, we will follow what we agreed two hours before the race," said the Spaniard two-time world champion.
"It's strange the direction that they are going in the era of communication and technology. Formula 1 try to restrict it, which is probably not the normal way to go."
