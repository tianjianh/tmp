Cycle superhighway plan for London's A40 Westway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London's A40 Westway could feature a segregated bike route according to detailed consultation plans for the capital's "cycle superhighways".

Two more cycle routes have also been proposed linking Bloomsbury to the West End and Farringdon to King's Cross.
Other proposals include banning rush-hour traffic from Regent's Park in support of cyclists.
Mayor Boris Johnson said the plans would ensure London's "cycling revolution" continues.
Further details have also been released on existing plans for two cycle-superhighways approved in February last year - one running 18 miles from Barking to Acton and the other between Kings Cross and Elephant and Castle.
The new cycle track on the Westway would take up one of six existing traffic lanes on the flyover between Westbourne Bridge and Wood Lane, White City.
It would be separated from traffic by a concrete barrier topped with a glass panel, which the Mayor said would also reduce traffic noise and pollution for residents on the north side of the flyover.
Once the links are complete, cyclists would be able to ride from Swiss Cottage and Camden Town to Canary Wharf, Barking or Elephant & Castle entirely on separated cycle tracks or low-traffic streets, according to the Mayor's office.
The mayor's vision for cycling in London has met with opposition from some quarters.
In January the London Taxi Drivers Association launched a judicial review opposing the mayor's plans for a Â£47m Westbourne Grove to Tower Hill cycle route.
Responding to the proposed Westway cycle route, the association tweeted: "Awaiting the judgement on our Judicial Review on CSH [Cycle Super Highway]. We will challenge this scheme in every way possible incl(uding) through the court."
The consultation by Transport for London will close on 20 March.
