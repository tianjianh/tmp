The boys, all aged 16 or under, are still under observation at Borders General Hospital after apparently consuming as yet unidentified pills.
Police Scotland said a 19-year-old man from Hawick had been arrested in connection with the matter.
He is expected to appear at Jedburgh Sheriff Court on Monday.
Insp John Reid warned of the dangers of taking non-prescribed medication and said the pink-coloured tablets appeared to be very potent.
He added: "I would again ask anyone who may have taken one of these tablets and who feels unwell, or indeed knows of anyone becoming unwell as a result of taking one, to seek medical assistance as soon as possible."
