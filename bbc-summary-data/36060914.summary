Mansfield's slim hopes of reaching the League Two play-offs were ended as they were held by Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A win would have kept the Stags mathematically in the hunt but they went behind when John Akine nodded over the on-rushing Scott Shearer.
Emmanuel Dieseruvwe levelled when he hammered in Matty Blair's pull-back on 30 minutes.
Matt Green could have won it for the hosts but steered a close-range header wide.
