Williams joins compatriots, scrum-half Richie Rees and prop Duncan Jones, in the Baa-Baas line-up.
Former South Africa captain John Smit will skipper the invitational side from tight-head prop.
Mike Tindall and Casey Laulala are again paired together in midfield with 35-year-old Williams forging a powerful back-three alongside Mils Muliaina and Isa Nacewa.
The Barbarians lost 57-26 to England at Twickenham last weekend, but they recovered to beat Ireland by a point in Gloucester on Tuesday.
The invitational side beat Wales, who award caps for the fixture, in last year's corresponding game.
Wales give debuts to wing Harry Robinson, full-back Liam Williams and prop Rhodri Jones.
Barbarians: M Muliaina; I Nacewa, C Laulala, M Tindall, S Williams; S Donald, R Rees; D Jones, B August, J Smit (capt), M O'Driscoll, M Chisholm, F Louw, M Gorgodze, J Beattie.
