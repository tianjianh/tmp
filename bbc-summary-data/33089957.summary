Nicole Dempsey, 37 and the mother of two children, suffered 80% burns in the fire on Tuesday.
The crash caused a gas bottle to explode at the Serves You Right Cafe in Ravenshoe, south of Cairns.
Seven people remain in critical condition in hospitals in the region, say Australian health officials.
At least 20 people were hurt in the explosion and fire in the small farming town, in what Queensland authorities described as the state's biggest burns event.
CCTV footage showed the explosion flinging customers out of the cafe and across the pavement.
Some people staggered from the building, their clothing on fire, as others rushed to put out the flames.
The explosion blew out both sides of the building and the fire took an hour to bring under control.
It is not known what caused the vehicle to veer off the road into the cafe. Police are investigating whether the driver - who remains in hospital - may have had a medical episode and lost control.
Ravenshoe Community Centre chairperson Priscilla Clare said it was amazing anyone survived the explosion.
Ms Clare said a group of about eight local senior citizens were inside the cafe at the time, having just been briefed by local firemen about fire safety.
"People have witnessed horrific things," Ms Clare told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
"I was talking to people and I did not recognise them" because of their burnt hair and faces, she said.
