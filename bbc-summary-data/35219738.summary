A peregrine nesting box has been put up on the roof of Bristol Cathedral.

Two pairs of the birds have nested on city centre buildings for the past few years, and experts say the new box could attract another pair to breed.
The Avon Wildlife Trust said it hopes the new box will offer "a safe and long-term nesting site" and if successful, eggs could be laid in it as early in the middle of March.
The trust has teamed up with the cathedral for the project.
Joe McSorley, from the trust, said: "Bristol is home to two very successful breeding pairs (of an estimated 50 using city centres across the UK) and they've become an integral part of the Bristol sky.
"Peregrines are drawn to urban settings, due to the abundance of food and the absence of other predators. The patches of green space in the city provide hunting ground, whilst the high rise buildings mimic cliff habitat."
