Scotland's Scott Jamieson is in a three-way tie for the lead on seven under par after his second round of the PGA Championship at Wentworth.

Jamieson's two-under-par 70 leaves him alongside Italy's Francesco Molinari and Belgium's Thomas Pieters, one shot ahead of Germany's Maximilian Kieffer.
England's Lee Westwood and Sweden's Henrik Stenson are two shots back.
Olympic champion Justin Rose scored an eagle on the par five 18th to salvage his round and finish two over.
Two other Englishmen, Graeme Storm and Oliver Fisher, are on four under after carding a 72 and a 70 respectively.
Andrew Johnston is on three under after his 68, alongside Tyrell Hatton and Ross Fisher, while Danny Willett and Ian Poulter are at one over.
On another hot day at Wentworth, in which the players had to combat winds of up to 20mph, Jamieson held his nerve after a jittery bogey-par-double bogey run.
A run of six birdies in seven holes either side of the turn helped set him up nicely going into the weekend.
"It's a tough stretch of the golf course especially the way the wind was blowing today," said the 33-year-old.
"The last thing you need to do in that situation is panic. Just try and take a wee minute to yourself and start again.
"I'm not in any of the majors this year so this is as big as it gets. This is the pinnacle of my season."
