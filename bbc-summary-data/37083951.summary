Man who threatened Dundee restaurant staff 'came back for breakfast'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who threatened McDonald's workers who refused to serve him was arrested after returning to the same restaurant for breakfast, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Stewart had shouted homophobic abuse at a manager at the fast food outlet in Dundee's Reform Street.
Police officers reviewed CCTV of the incident but could not trace the 55-year-old.
However, when Stewart returned a few days later, staff recognised him and called the police.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told that Stewart had entered the restaurant at about 22:40 on 1 December last year and told staff: "Get me something to eat, I'm starving."
Stewart then swore at staff before directing homophobic abuse at a manager who intervened.
He said: "You're lucky I haven't punched you - you're lucky I don't jump over there and break all your bones."
Stewart then told the manager he "better watch out" before leaving after being told police had been called.
Stewart, 55, of Perth Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner.
Sheriff Tom Hughes admonished him after hearing he had been of good behaviour since the incident.
