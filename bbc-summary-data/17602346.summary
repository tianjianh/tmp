Moldova profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Television is the most popular medium. The leading station is Prime, which rebroadcasts Russia's Channel One alongside its own output.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Moldova One TV broadcasts nationally.
Russian TV is popular, but officials have taken steps to curb "propaganda" by suspending rebroadcasts of some stations.
Most private FM radio networks rebroadcast output from Russian and Romanian stations.
Many outlets are loss-making and rely on funding from oligarchs and politicians who tend to use them to promote their interests.
The press divides along party political lines. Moldovan editions of Russian papers are popular, but the overall reach of the press is low and in decline.
The internet is the second most important source of news after TV. More than 1.9 million Moldovans were online by 2016 - around 48% of the population (Internetlivestats.com).
The top social network is Russia's Odnoklassniki (more than 800,000 accounts) followed by Facebook (570,000 accounts).
Breakaway Trans-Dniester region operates its own media.
