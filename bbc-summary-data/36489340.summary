Sylvia and Peter Stuart, aged 69 and 75, were reported missing on Friday. The same day Mr Stuart's body was found near his Suffolk home.
Ali Qazimaj, 42, of Tilbury, is wanted over the murder and disappearance.
Police hope the image of his abandoned Citroen C3 will yield fresh information about his whereabouts.
Suffolk Police has warned the chances of finding Mrs Stuart alive "is becoming less and less likely" as time passes.

Police say Mr Qazimaj probably boarded a passenger ferry as an unaccompanied foot passenger to Calais in France.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "We are gradually building a picture as we continue to make enquiries to trace Ali Qazimaj.
"We still need anyone who knows him, who may have spent time with him over the last few weeks or before this to get in touch and tell us more about his background so that we can trace his movements."
Mr Stuart was found dead in woodland surrounding their home on Friday evening.
Det Ch Insp Parkes said efforts to find Mrs Stuart were concentrated on the UK and there was no suggestion she was involved in her husband's murder.
The couple's son-in-law, Steve Paxman, 61, of Leicester, was arrested on Sunday and released on bail on Monday night.
