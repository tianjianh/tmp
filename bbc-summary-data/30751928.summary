The 21-year-old has been linked with a move to Liverpool or Tottenham.
"Everyone is available in every shape and form," said Pulis when asked about the possibility of a large bid being made for the England under-21 forward.
While insisting he wanted to keep Berahino, Pulis cited Liverpool's decision to sell Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75m in July, saying "it was the right deal for the club".
"We've had no offers for Saido, he is scoring goals and has been a pleasure to work with," the Welshman added.

In December, West Brom dismissed reports of a £23m move to Liverpool for Berahino as an "entire fabrication".
Berahino, has scored 13 goals in 24 games this season, but refused to celebrate any of his four goals in the 7-0 win over Gateshead in the FA Cup on Saturday.
He later claimed that his reaction was because he was "acting professionally" and "handling business".
Berahino signed a new three-and-half year deal, worth around £20,000 a week, with West Brom in November 2013. Talks over an improved and extended deal began in November, but have not produced an agreement.
He is due to appear before magistrates on 19 January on charges of drink-driving, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison, a £5,000 fine and a driving ban of at least one year.
