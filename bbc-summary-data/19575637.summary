[SN]TITLE[SN]
In quotes: Reaction to US Libya deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World leaders and other international figures have been reacting to the killing of the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"I strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Right now, the American people have the families of those we lost in our thoughts and prayers."
"We apologise to the United States of America and to the American people and to the whole world for what happened, and at the same time we expect the rest of the world to help us face these cowardly criminal acts."
"I am deeply shocked by the despicable attack. I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms. I call on Libya to take all necessary measures without delay to protect the lives of all diplomats and foreign staff."
"I strongly condemn the attack on the US mission in Benghazi. Such violence can never be justified. I welcome the Libyan president's condemnation and condolences and his pledge of his government's full cooperation."
"The UK condemns the brutal and senseless attack. We send our condolences to the people and government of the United States and stand with them in this. These diplomats were serving not only their own country but the people of Libya and were working for the peace and stability of Libya in the future."
"France demands that the Libyan authorities shed all possible light on these odious and unacceptable crimes, identify the culprits and bring them to justice."
"We will continue to support the government of the new democratic Libya, which we are sure will spare no effort in preventing Libya's new course from being hijacked. We condemn with maximum firmness this brutal act."
"The federal government condemns in the strongest terms the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt. Such violence against diplomatic facilities can, and may, never be a means of political debate, of political action."
"We strongly condemn any attacks on foreign diplomatic posts and their staff as terrorist acts which can have no justification."
