[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Henry Candy's 9-2 favourite Limato claimed the coveted July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket.

The four-year-old gelding, ridden by Harry Bentley, surged clear and despite veering right late on, won by two lengths for a first Group One success.
Suedois (25-1) finished second, beating 7-1 shot Quiet Reflection into third by a head.
Frankie Dettori, bidding for his first July Cup, was seventh of 18 runners on Magical Memory on good to firm ground.
Limato won his first five races over six furlongs but was only fourth of 12 over a mile in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May, though Candy suggested there could be a return to that longer distance for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood this month.
"It would be rather fun if he ran in the Sussex," the trainer said." I wouldn't rule it out totally - it's a thought.
"I thought he ran a cracking race in the Lockinge and I thought he settled very well.
"My horses weren't right at the time and I thought he got the mile that day. I've been training him pretty much to stay."
BBC Racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
"The 2016 July Cup was billed as an outstanding staging of the historic Group One sprint with no horse absent that you would have wanted to see, so for Limato to drop down from a mile to win by two lengths in a very fast time - one minute, 9.97 seconds - and despite drifting off a straight line late on, is outstanding.
"The horse's veteran trainer Henry Candy famously keeps his feet on the ground, and it's quite a compliment that he indicated a crack at Guineas winners Galileo Gold and The Gurkha in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood is now a possibility."
