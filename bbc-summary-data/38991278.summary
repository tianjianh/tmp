Business rates - what do they pay?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A revaluation of the value of Scotland's non-domestic properties has led to concerns that some businesses will end up paying much more in rates this year. Hotels, tourist attractions and leisure facilities are reporting large rises in the rateable value on which their rates are based. However, some other businesses have seen their rateable value reduced.

Hotelier in business rates boycott call
Why are business rates causing concern?
The owner of the Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen, Stewart Spence, says his rateable value has risen from £497,000 to £575,000, while his turnover has slumped over the past three years from £7.5m to £4.5m.
Search for a rateable value for a business
The rateable value is not what the business pays but it is a substantial element in setting the rate. The rate in the pound, set by the Scottish government, is 46.6p, with larger businesses paying a supplement. There are also a range of rate reliefs, especially for small businesses.
Here are the rateable values of some of Scotland's prominent businesses:
