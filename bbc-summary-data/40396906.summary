It's a big sporting event which takes place place every two years on a different island.
People from 24 islands with small populations like Bermuda and Greenland take part in 14 different sporting events to see which country is the best.
The games were first started in 1985, and people as young as 13 can compete in them!
This year's games are being held in Gotland, a Swedish Island in the Baltic Sea.
