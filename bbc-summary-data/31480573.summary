The woman in her 80s was in one of two vehicles involved in the crash at about 12:15 GMT.
The Great North Air Ambulance said paramedics treated her at the scene but she died before she could be taken to hospital. It is not yet known if anyone else was injured in the crash.
The northbound A1 at the Newton on the Moor and Longframlington junction was closed for four hours.
A spokesman for the air ambulance said: "The crew from the helicopter transfused blood and performed surgical procedures at the roadside but sadly her injuries were too severe and she died a short time later.
"Our thoughts are with her family."
