A musical relay along the length of Hadrian's Wall began at sunrise, a gala concert is being held at Glasgow's City Halls and Manic Street Preachers are playing in Cardiff.
Jamie Cullum, Deacon Blue and Lulu are performing in Glasgow, while Belfast's Crumlin Road Gaol is hosting a concert.
A world record for the longest distance between singers of a duet was also set.
Accompanied by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, classical singer Shan Cothi in Cardiff sang the Welsh hymn Calon Lan with Andres Evans, a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia - 12,120 kilometres away.
Events and performances are being broadcast across the BBC, with BBC One's The One Show broadcasting live from the Music Day event in Glasgow.
BBC Music director Bob Shennan said the day was "a unique opportunity for people to celebrate music and musical talent, whether attending one of the many events taking place or tuning in at home".
Highlights in each location include:
The Hadrian's Wall of Sound began with saxophonist Roz Sluman greeting the day at 06:00 BST at Bowness-on-Solway. A BBC live page has been covering the event throughout the day.
The BBC Music initiative officially launched in October 2014 with an all-star reworking of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows.
