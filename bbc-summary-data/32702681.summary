Residents in North East Lincolnshire face £30 garden bin charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Householders in North East Lincolnshire are to be charged £30 to keep their garden waste recycling bins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents will have to dispose of their own garden waste from next month unless they pay the annual fee.
The council blamed government funding cuts for the move but said 2,500 households had already applied to keep their bins.
Grimsby and Cleethorpes Civic Society feared the council would have to spend money picking up fly-tipped waste.
Chris Shaw, former Labour leader of North East Lincolnshire Council, said: "The council has no choice but to charge for brown bins because of government spending cuts."
"Neighbouring East Lindsey in Lincolnshire has been charging for brown bins for 12 months without any detrimental effects on recycling.
"The letters to households outlining the charge have been out a week and there is a month for people to apply. So far, more than 2,500 have applied.
"Let's not jump to conclusions about how many bins the council will have to take away."
Anne Turner from the Civic Society said: "We think it was a misguided introduction.
"We care very much about the environment. We think it's going to lead to a lot more fly-tipping throughout the borough and beyond - it's already a problem.
"We do wonder whether our local council has factored in the matter that they are going to have to spend a lot more on gathering up people's tipped materials here, there and everywhere."
