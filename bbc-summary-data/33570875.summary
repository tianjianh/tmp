Ex-Stoke player claims abuse 'over serving cold tea'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Stoke City trainee has told a court he was abused by then-goalkeeper Peter Fox for "serving cold tea" and "calling a bad decision on the pitch".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Blackstock said he was held down and assaulted with a goalkeeper's glove smeared with Deep Heat - a type of muscular pain relief ointment.
Mr Blackstock, 44, is seeking damages for loss of earnings of nearly Â£170,000 against the footballer and the club.
Mr Fox and Stoke City deny all the allegations.
Preston County Court heard Mr Blackstock's claim that he was twice given the punishment - known as "the glove" - during the 1980s.
He said that after the alleged assaults Mr Fox said: "That will teach you a lesson."
Mr Fox told the court he "could not remember" Mr Blackstock, who left his Belfast home after scouts spotted his talent at the age of 15.
The court had heard that at least three other apprentices described the practice happening to them for such infringements as wearing someone else's boots or putting on the wrong studs.
But Mr Fox denied that the glove abuse had taken place, saying: "That's what story they have come up with."
He said if he had seen the practice taking place, he would have "stopped it and said something".
Mr Fox's representative has said Mr Blackstock was "willing to lie for financial gain".
Mr Blackstock's claim of Â£170,000 is on the basis that he would have played at least at Conference level for five years after leaving the club but for the alleged assaults.
He says he suffers from post-traumatic stress because of what happened.
