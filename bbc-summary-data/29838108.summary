[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £1.5m development to upgrade the Manx crematorium will improve facilities for mourners, Douglas council said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12-month project gets under way on 10 November and will create a separate area for arrivals and departures.
Councillor Stephen Pitts said that the work will be handled sensitively to ensure that "dignity and respect are maintained at all times".
Cremations will continue to operate throughout the development although the chapel will close on 7 November.
Services will be conducted at St Andrew's United Reformed Church on Glencrutchery Road in the meantime.
