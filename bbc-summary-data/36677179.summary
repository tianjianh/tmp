Euro 2016: Lille fan zone fears for Wales fans facing Belgium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fears have been raised that Wales fans in France without tickets for Friday's Euro 2016 tie with Belgium may also struggle to get into Lille's fan zone.

Reports suggest up to 150,000 Belgians could descend on Lille with its fan zone holding just 30,000.
Paul Corkery, of the Football Supporters' Federation Cymru, warned: "Once it's full it's shut."
The quarter final match at the Stade Pierre Mauroy is 10 miles (16km) from the French/Belgium border.
Up to 20,000 Wales fans are also expected to make the trip, according to Mr Corkery.
Wales fans with Follow My Team vouchers have been allocated about 6,000 tickets from the stadium's 50,000 capacity.
About the same amount has been earmarked for the Belgian contingent, with about 30,000 having already been sold on general release in December, with the rest for officials and corporate spectators.
Mr Corkery said too many tickets for the stadium had been available to neutrals and corporate guests.
He said: "They should have kept back 3,000 tickets for each association.
"It's crazy. Everybody wants a ticket."
He said he had spoken with a fan on Thursday who was duped by a bogus tout into paying Â£825 (1,000 euros) for the wrong tickets.
Mr Corkery said some general release tickets were being sold for up to Â£412 (500 euros) by touts or people who had bought them as "an investment" at the time of release.
"Be very careful of touts," he warned fans. "Come and enjoy the atmosphere in the fan zone or the local pubs."
However, he said there was "absolutely" a worry supporters might struggle to get into the fan zone with so many Belgians in town.
He advised them to be inside by 17:00 BST (18:00 local time).
A drinking restriction remains in place in Lille, with pubs and bars closing at midnight after the game.
