Thomas 'Slab' Murphy: Tax evasion trial verdict 'possible next week'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of the prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard the court may deliver judgement on the case next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old, of Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, faces nine tax charges at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court.
Prosecutors claim he had significant dealings in cattle and land and received farming grants but failed to submit tax returns for nine years.
Mr Murphy denies the offences.
His defence lawyers claim that their client's brother, Patrick Murphy, managed his cattle herd and farming activities.
The prosecution at the three-judge, non-jury court was brought after an investigation by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).
One of the judges indicated that the verdict may be delivered next Thursday, 17 December, but added it is "by no means certain".
Mr Murphy was remanded on continuing bail until 17 December.
