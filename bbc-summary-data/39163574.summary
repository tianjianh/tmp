[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster maintained their unbeaten home league record with a victory which ended Cheltenham's recent resurgence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Club captain Andy Butler netted a rare goal in the first half of what proved to be a fairly uncomfortable game for the League Two leaders.
That was until Cheltenham defender Will Boyle was sent off for two bookable offences midway through the second period.
And John Marquis made sure of the points nine minutes from time with his 21st goal of the season.
Cheltenham, who had claimed 10 points from their previous four games, made an encouraging start and forced plenty of errors from the hosts.
But Rovers went ahead in the 23rd minute when Butler lashed home from close range after a Marquis effort was blocked.
Rovers had chances to make their afternoon more comfortable with Alfie May, Conor Grant and James Coppinger in particular missing good opportunities.
But in the 81st minute - 10 minutes after Boyle's dismissal - they made sure of the points as Marquis added a second goal.
