Rivaldo: World Cup winner and son score in same Brazilian match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a case of like father, like son when World Cup winner Rivaldo and his son Rivaldinho both scored in a Brazilian second division match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rivaldo was involved in all three Mogi Mirim goals as they beat Macae 3-1, his pass leading to his 20-year-old son's headed goal after three minutes.
Former Barcelona and AC Milan forward Rivaldo, who won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil, later scored a penalty.
The 43-year-old retired in March 2014, but decided to return this month.
There have been several famous football fathers and sons, including the Cloughs and the Maldinis, but few have played together.
In English football, European Cup winner Ian Bowyer and son Gary played together for Hereford United, while ex-Manchester City forward Alec Herd featured alongside son David - who went on to play for Manchester United - for Stockport County in the 1950s.
In 1996, Eidur Gudjohnsen, then 17, came on as substitute for 34-year-old father Arnor during Iceland's 3-0 win over Estonia. The duo never played together in a professional match.
