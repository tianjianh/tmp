Gwydion Rhys, from Bethesda, made such an impression at a workshop earlier this year, he has been invited back for the main event.
It is the first time Proms in the Park has been held in north Wales.
Tony Hadley, Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Amy Wadge, and opera singer Wynne Evans will all perform.
"I am feeling a little nervous but I hope I'll be all right on the night," said Gwydion, who also plays the cello and piano.
"I'll be having a rehearsal with the orchestra beforehand, and I'm really looking forward to that.
"I hope I'll get lots of support from the orchestra members - and I hope they're also looking forward to the experience."
Gwydion will take the conductor's podium for a special performance of Richard Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries", but for the rest of the evening, the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales will be under the baton of American conductor Edwin Outwater.
Highlights will be shown on BBC Two Wales on Sunday, 11 September.
