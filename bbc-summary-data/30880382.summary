A top Scots alpine skier who broke her back in training in November has been selected for February's world championships.

Charlie Guest has been picked for the British team for the Alpine World Skiing Championships in Beaver Creek, in the US, despite her recent injury.
The 21-year-old, from Perth, fractured vertebrae in her spine after hitting a boulder while training in Sweden.
The championships run from 2 to 15 February in Colorado.
Ms Guest has been selected alongside fellow Scot Alex Tilley in the slalom and giant slalom events.
She said it was a "great feeling" to be included in the team just two months after such a serious injury.
She said: "This is what I was working towards before the accident, so to still be selected has given me such a boost.
"It's only a few weeks away, but I'm more determined than ever to be there and competing.
"There's no way I'm ruling it out yet."
Ms Guest spent eight hours strapped to a backboard on her 250km (155 mile) journey to hospital following the crash on a remote slope in Sweden.
However, she was back in rehabilitation at the Sport Scotland Institute of Sport in Stirling in December, and was back on the slops before Christmas.
She credits the back protector her coach insisted she wear on the day of the crash with the fact her injury did not prove career-ending.
She said: "I'm very lucky to even be walking let along considering competing at the World Skiing Championships next month after my accident.
"The back protector is an absolute must for me now. It should be compulsory ski-wear for everyone, regardless of level and ability."
