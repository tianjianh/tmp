Police want to speak to Aaron Alexander Tavares-Gaiete over the stabbing of Munashe Charles Kutyauripo, 16, at Ashton Playing Fields, Woodford.
A post-mortem examination found the victim, known as Charlie, had died from a stab wound to the chest.
Police said they were "reaching out to Aaron's family and friends".
"We want to trace him and speak to him about what he knows about Charlie's murder," Det Ch Insp Mark Lawson said.
Charlie had been attending a female friend's 16th birthday party at a social club when a confrontation started between him and four boys, police believe.
He was attacked at about 21:40 GMT and taken by ambulance to Whipps Cross Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
Det Ch Insp Lawson said Aaron had not been seen since the murder and urged him to contact Scotland Yard.
"Charlie's family have been left devastated by his death, they want and deserve answers about what happened", he said.
In a statement the victim's family said anybody who had information "should come forward and help find whoever did this".
"To the world he was just a 16-year-old boy, but to us, that was our son taken," they said.
