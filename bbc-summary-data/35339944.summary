The two 33-year-olds were last seen alive on the night of 20 November in the Mexican town of Topolobampo.
Their bodies were later found in a burnt-out camper van in north-western Sinaloa state.
They were planning to travel to the city of Guadalajara when they disappeared.
Mexican police have arrested three men in connection with their murder.
Police officials said the three confessed to killing the two surfers when they fought back during an attempted robbery.
Large swathes of Sinaloa are under the control of a drug cartel of the same name.
