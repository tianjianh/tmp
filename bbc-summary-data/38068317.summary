The man, who was stopped in Manchester Road, Hyde, was one of four people reprimanded for not being in proper control of a vehicle.
He was given six points on his licence and an on-the-spot fine.
A further 142 people were stopped for using a phone while driving in the first week of the campaign.
The campaign to educate drivers on road safety will continue up to Christmas.
Supt Craig Thompson said: "You wouldn't drink and drive so why is it OK to use a phone when in control of a vehicle?
"We can all make a difference by urging people to think about their actions."
From next year, new penalties will be in place with motorists caught using a mobile phone receiving six points on their licence rather than the current three.
The fine will also double, to Â£200.
More than 5,000 drivers in Greater Manchester have been given fixed penalty notices or sent on a mobile phone awareness course in the past two years, the force said.
