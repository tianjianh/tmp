The loss, the Robins' heaviest in a competitive game since 2011, left the club one point above the Championship relegation zone with six games to play.
The 386-mile round trip from Bristol to Deepdale was made by 312 Bristol City supporters.
The Ashton Gate club are 21st in the table, having lost 18 and won just four of their past 29 league games.
Midfielder Korey Smith, who captained the side on Tuesday, told BBC Radio Bristol: "We had been on a high lately with some good, positive results but it's been a tough few days.
"The performance wasn't good enough and we appreciate the fans who made the trip so the players came together and decided to refund the fans.
"They were absolutely brilliant and they still clapped us off at the end of the game even though we probably didn't deserve it. Hopefully they'll stick behind us on Saturday and we can put it right."
Lee Johnson's side face Wolves on Saturday.
