[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester City v Watford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester captain Wes Morgan remains unavailable because of a hamstring injury, although he could be fit for next week's trip to Manchester City.

Nampalys Mendy and on-loan defender Molla Wague are long-term absentees.
Watford will be without Miguel Britos, who was substituted with a leg muscle problem during the first half against Liverpool on Monday night.
Fellow defender Jose Holebas missed that game with a foot injury and will be assessed.
Simon Brotherton: "It has been quite a turnaround for Leicester over the last two-and-a-half months as they've finally sorted themselves out.
"Only Tottenham and Liverpool have collected more points than their total of 19 since Craig Shakespeare took over, though it remains to be seen whether he's still in charge next season.
"Walter Mazzari's position at Watford is also unclear, even if he is making the right noises about wanting to stay.
"Both teams sit on the much-talked about safety benchmark of 40 points and look set for a mid-table finish, but could still theoretically end up anywhere from eighth to 18th."

Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: "With Watford being near us, we have to try and beat them on Saturday.
"I'm a big believer in momentum. We've got three home games left at King Power Stadium.
"We'd like to finish on a high and that will be the message."
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri on whether his job is safe: "I think it even more than before if I look at my team, how we play, my contract.
"I am sure that after watching how we did last year, we can have a great Premier League next season.
"We knew it would be more difficult this year than last year. It is harder to consolidate in the Premier League."
Neither Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare nor Watford boss Walter Mazzarri knows if they will be in charge next season.
Nobody knows what Mazzarri's remit was at Watford - just survival, a top-half finish or something else?
A Foxes win would not improve his chances of staying in the job.
Prediction: 2-0
