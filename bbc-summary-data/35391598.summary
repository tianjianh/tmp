The New Saints: Welsh champions 'shocked' by winding-up order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Premier League champions The New Saints have been issued with a winding-up order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Oswestry-based club appears on a winding-up list due to be heard at the High Court in London on Monday.
But Saints, who also won the Welsh Cup and Word Cup during the 2014-15 season, say they know nothing about the order.
"Nobody at the club has been made aware of this and are shocked by such news," the club said in a statement.
"A further statement will be released once more information is forthcoming."
Nine times Welsh champions Saints are top of the Welsh Premier League.
The only full-time side in the Welsh Premier League face Denbigh Town in the Word Cup final on Saturday at Llandudno's Maesdu Park.
