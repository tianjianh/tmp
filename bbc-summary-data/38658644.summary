Josh Davey took four wickets as the Scots prevented the Dutch reaching their target of 149.
Davey ended a 53-run opening partnership between Ben Cooper and Michael Rippon and Con de Lange's two for 17 also proved crucial.
Earlier, all-rounder Richie Berrington top-scored for Grant Bradburn's side with 38 runs as they reached 148-7.
The Scots beat opening Group B opponents Hong Kong on Saturday and the top two from the two four-team sections will progress to the semi-finals.
In Group A, Ireland recovered from an opening loss to Afghanistan by beating Namibia.
