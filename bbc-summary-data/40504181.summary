[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old from the Isle of Man collided with the world champion Peter Sagan before hitting the barriers in a sprint finish.
Cavendish, who is just five stage wins away from a Tour record for the most victories, said he was "massively disappointed".
The race doctor says Mark, who won a silver medal at the Rio2016 Olympic Games, needs rest but won't need an operation.
Peter Sagan has been disqualified from the race for dangerous riding.
