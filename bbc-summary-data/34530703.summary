The death of a popular Jersey teacher who fell from cliffs has been described at a inquest as a tragic accident.

John Renouf, 63, went missing on 3 July after leaving his home to take photographs.
Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Deputy Viscount Mark Harrison said it was likely Mr Renouf lost his footing and fell from the cliffs at Portelet.
He said this led to massive injuries which killed him immediately.
The inquest heard the former English teacher retired three years ago and had taken a keen interest in walking and photography.
On Friday 3 July he went out to take photos at Portelet Common, saying he would be home by 16:30 BST.
His wife Naomi said Mr Renouf was a punctual man and when he had not returned by 18:30 BST she called the police.
In a statement, Mrs Renouf told the hearing: "We were both teachers until recently. John retired three years ago and I retired a year ago. Our last year together was wonderful.
"He felt life was precious and you don't know what's going to happen next, so make the most of it."
The discovery of Mr Renouf's rucksack on the clifftops sparked an air, land and sea search involving a French coastguard helicopter.
The search had to be called off overnight but the next day, a French pleasure craft found Mr Renouf's body in waters to the south east of the island.
