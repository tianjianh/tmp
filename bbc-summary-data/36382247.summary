Ten stamps will be on sale on 7 July, marking five decades since the band turned professional.
The collection include the band's most famous album covers as well as live performance shots.
Pink Floyd became known for its innovative album covers, which were made in collaboration with leading graphic designers and photographers.
The album covers that have been made into stamps include The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, Atom Heart Mother, The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Endless River.
A further four stamps show the band performing live on tour, including one photograph from a concert at London's UFO Club in 1966.
Pink Floyd were among the first groups to make extensive use of light shows and projection of films for their live concerts, which increased in ambition over the decades.
The band was formed in 1965 by Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Rick Wright, later joined by guitarist Syd Barrett.
In 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band shortly before Barrett's departure.
The stamps are available to pre-order on the Post Office website and will be physically available in 8,000 post offices from 7 July 2016.
