The left-hander will remain available for Sussex as injury cover for the remainder of the season.
"County cricket has been a huge part of my life for the last 18 years," the 38-year-old former Middlesex player said.
"It is with a tinge of sadness that I've decided not to play on for Sussex this season or beyond."
Joyce, a former captain of Sussex, joined from Middlesex in 2009 and has scored more than 8,000 first-class runs for the county.
"I fully intended on playing at least some cricket for Sussex in 2017," he added. "But the realities of my various injuries, alongside my playing commitments here in Ireland have meant that this isn't possible."
Joyce will play for provincial side Leinster as well as Ireland, having recently appeared for them in the one-day international series against England.
