Singer Laura Mvula has said she will not attend the Brit Awards because of "the diversity issue" and because she is not sure what going "would achieve".

The soul singer, 29, said black children were growing up feeling they were "not acknowledged in society, in media and in mainstream music".
But she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she may go to the awards next year if she releases an album.
The Brit Awards takes place at the O2 Arena on 24 February.
The performers at the Brit Awards, for the year's best music acts, will include Justin Bieber, Coldplay, James Bay, Little Mix, The Weeknd and Jess Glynne.
Mvula, who is from Birmingham, said of her decision not to attend the event: "Growing up my black identity is something that is hugely important to me and something that as I'm now going in to my 30s I'm thinking lots and lots more about.
"I guess the problem for me is knowing that there are young black kids growing up feeling that they're not acknowledged in society, in media and in mainstream music."
She added: "Maybe next year when I have my album out it makes sense for me to be there".
Adele is among those with the most nominations at this year's Brit Awards after being nominated for four trophies.
