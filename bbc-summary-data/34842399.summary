The 23-year-old won the Shanghai Masters in September by beating world number six Judd Trump in the final, and he also reached the Champions semi-finals this month.
Wilson's form means he feels well set for a good run at the UK Championship.
"I go very high in confidence," the Kettering potter told BBC Sport.
"Winning in Shanghai has definitely been a lift, but I have always believed I could win tournaments. But until you prove it, saying it is worthless.
"And playing in the Champion of Champions is a high standard and a prestigious event. It didn't go according to plan in the semi-finals, but reaching that stage is not be sniffed at."
World number 22 Wilson also beat Trump at the Champions of Champions in Coventry, but lost to Mark Allen in the final four.
He wants to make the most of impressive form when faces Paul Davison in the first round of the UK Championship on Thursday.
"I'm really looking forward to York," Wilson added.
"It's the second biggest tournament in the season, it's a great place and I love this time of year building up to Christmas.
"Judd is a class player and then beat him and then Zhou Yuelong. I was really pleased with how I handled both games. Against Judd I was a big underdog and then I was the favourite; it's a contrast and all wonderful experience.
"I always believed I would make that breakthrough but it's mad how it has happened so quickly. I am still quite young in snooker terms.
"I love to play and in front of the television cameras. You can't be too confident and I like to think I am pretty grounded and nice and relaxed when I play, but also full of belief."
