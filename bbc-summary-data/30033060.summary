Announcing the tour with Zane Lowe on Radio 1, frontman Dave Grohl said: "Now we get to go out and do the thing that we really love to do.
"I can't wait. It's pretty awesome."
A string of five dates will start at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on 25 May, before a show at Old Trafford in Manchester two days later.
The band will then play at Wembley Stadium on 19 and 20 June, with a final show at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium on 23 June.
Talking about their shows at Wembley, Grohl said: "You get a little nervous excitement about two minutes before you go on.  It's great."
Iggy Pop and Royal Blood will support the band at Wembley -  with the Little Monster duo also performing at the Edinburgh gig.
With the UK tour ending the day before the Glastonbury festival kicks off - and with no other shows in the band's schedule before 4 July - the UK tour announcement has added to speculation that Foo Fighters will be performing at the festival.
But speaking to Nick Grimshaw on the Radio 1 Breakfast show, Dave Grohl said the organisers hadn't been in touch.
He said: "Michael [Eavis] hasn't called me."
When asked about rumours about Prince and Oasis also being on the line-up for next year, the singer said: "If Prince does it and Oasis do it - you've got Foo Fighters."
Foo Fighters UK 2015 tour dates are as follows:
Sunderland, Stadium of Light - 25 May
Manchester, Emirates Old Trafford - 27
London, Wembley Stadium - 19 June
London, Wembley Stadium - 20
Edinburgh, Murrayfield Stadium - 23
