Englishman Trump, 27, won five frames in a row to beat Thailand's James Wattana 6-2 in the first round at the York Barbican on Tuesday.
Trump, the 2011 champion, told BBC Sport: "There is no real atmosphere so it's very hard.
"It's not really enjoyable out there, but you just have to get through."
Bristolian Trump plays Oliver Lines or Martin O'Donnell in the last 64, the stage when the BBC TV cameras arrive.
"Until the TV kicks in, it doesn't really feel like a tournament, so everyone is just battling to get through. It's the same for everyone," said Trump.
"Getting James was a tough draw. I didn't play great but it is probably a good thing that I didn't because it will make me go away and practise harder."
