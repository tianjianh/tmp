The 23-year-old left-hander was injured during the Championship match against Lancashire at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
It came only hours after he was named in the England senior Test squad to play Pakistan next month.
Meanwhile, key batsman Kumar Sangakkara believes handling the occasion will be key for Surrey at Lord's.
The Brown Caps are aiming to win their first one-day trophy since lifting the CB40 title at Lord's in 2011.
"The key for us is to enjoy the day; forget that it is a final, forget that it is Lord's and not to get overawed," Sangakkara told BBC London 94.9.
"We need to appreciate what has brought us there and be able to repeat it."
Sri Lanka legend Sangakkara has been crucial to Surrey's progress to the final, hitting 166 in the semi-final win over Nottinghamshire and scoring 429 runs at an average of 61.28 throughout the tournament.
However, he was keen to stress that Surrey's young side, which has also secured promotion from Division Two of the County Championship, has made solid progress this year.
"Whatever the result is, the journey has been wonderful. If we can top it off with a win then it is even better," the 37-year-old said.
"The result will not take anything away from the season we have had and the way the players have grown, individuals have blossomed and the team has shown its character.
"We are all looking forward to it. Excitement will heighten but I hope we keep our eyes on the ball and our minds on what we are there to do; execute the basics, execute our skill and trust in each other.
"We need to focus on the task at hand and keep our thoughts simple."
It may be Sangakkara's final game at the home of cricket where he made 147 in a Test match and 112 in a one-day international against England last year.
