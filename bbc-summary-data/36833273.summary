Sam Cross is also in the men's 12-strong squad with Luke Treharne a travelling reserve.
Jasmine Joyce is the only Welsh player to make the GB Women's line-up.
"To have rugby sevens on that stage is only going to help grow the game," Davies told BBC Sport.
"For the audiences who don't get to watch rugby as often as some of us do, it is really going to catch the eye.
"The more people that know about rugby the better, and in terms of a worldwide spectacle, the Olympics is the best event for it.
"It goes without saying that winning Olympic gold, silver or bronze would be special.
"I am looking forward to the whole experience, being part of Team GB, it is nice to join the boxing team, the athletics team, I am looking forward to that."
Wing Luke Morgan suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of contention for rugby's return to the Olympics.
Wales and Cardiff Blues centre Cory Allen also misses out.
Megan Jones, an England Sevens player who attended a Welsh language school, is a travelling back-up for the women's team.
Great Britain sevens men: Mark Bennett (Glasgow), Dan Bibby (Putney), Phil Burgess (Farnborough), Sam Cross (Newport), Alex Davis (Bristol), James Davies, (Carmarthen), Ollie Lindsay Hague (London), Tom Mitchell (Wandsworth), Dan Norton (Bristol), James Rodwell (Cotteridge), Mark Robertson (Galashiels), Marcus Watson (Weybridge).
