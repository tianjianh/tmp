[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Trotman, 45, of Wetherell Road, Hackney, and Reynold Dyett, 56, from Elderfield Road, Clapton, drove regularly to Southend to prey on girls.
Police described the pair as "hideous, perverse and dangerous", Basildon Crown Court heard.
Trotman was jailed for 14 years for crimes including rape and Dyett for six years for sexual activity with a child.
Both were also found guilty of conspiracy to meet a child following sexual grooming.
Judge John Lodge said the men had ensnared the girls and paid no regard to their ages.
Trotman was convicted of five offences and Dyett of four all relating to underage girls.
They bought the youngsters alcohol before getting them to perform sexual acts, the court heard.
Nick Alston, Essex Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "The lengthy sentences for both defendants is reflective of not just the gravity of the crime but the seriousness with which the criminal justice system treats the sexual exploitation of young children.
"I must applaud the bravery of the three teenage victims who had the great courage to come forward to police and see the perpetrators face justice.
"Judge Lodge rightly commended the hard work of Det Sgt Shirley Cole and it is thanks to the tenacity of her and her team that these two extremely predatory and dangerous individuals have been brought to justice."
