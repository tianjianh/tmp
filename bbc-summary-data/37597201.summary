[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Slovenia recorded a deserved win over their more illustrious visitors to set up Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against group leaders England.

The group's fourth seeds had the better of the game throughout and saw their pressure pay off when Rok Kronaveter came off the bench to score.
The result moves them on to four points, level with Scotland and two points behind Gareth Southgate's side.
Slovakia, seeded second, have no points from their opening two games.
Their meeting with Scotland in Trnava on Tuesday is one they cannot afford to lose, with the Scots also needing to make up for dropped points at home to Lithuania, as both countries cling on to hopes of a play-off place.
Having missed out on Euro 2016 after finishing third in England's qualifying group and losing a play-off to Ukraine, Srecko Katanec's side came into this match on the back of a 2-2 draw in Lithuania.
That could yet be a precious point as they proved that, at home, they will be stiff opposition.
In a match of few clear-cut opportunities, Roman Bezjak had a first-half shot pushed onto the bar brilliantly by Kozacik.
But as a goal-less draw looked the likeliest outcome, Josip Ilicic found Kronaveter with a precise pass and the player who plies his trade in Ljubljana with Olimpija guided the ball past the keeper.
After the agony of losing an injury-time goal in the first match to England, the Euro 2016 finalists rarely looked like troubling Jan Oblak in the Slovenian goal.
Only once was the Atletico Madrid keeper called into action, saving a Robert Mak effort with his legs.
Playmaker Marek Hamsik was subdued, marshalled well by Rene Krhin, and failed to influence the game.
Scotland must ensure the same happens on Tuesday, with both teams knowing the loser can forget Russia 2018.
