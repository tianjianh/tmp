The woman, who was in her mid 20s, had been playing the gaming app alone in Linacre Woods in Derbyshire on Wednesday afternoon.
She managed to call 999 using her telephone, and was later taken to hospital.
She had suspected injuries to her ankle, back, neck and elbow.
Edale Mountain Rescue Team helped the ambulance service with the rescue, assisted by members of Buxton Mountain Rescue Team.
"She told us and the ambulance service she had been playing Pokemon," said Ed Proudfoot from Edale Mountain Rescue Team.
"She suffered a slip and fall and was lying on the wet surface. That's going to cause you to get cold pretty quickly."
The woman was taken by ambulance to the major trauma centre at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield for assessment and treatment.
Mr Proudfoot warned people enjoying the outdoors to be "mindful of the terrain and weather conditions they might encounter", especially this time of year.
He said they should wear proper footwear and waterproof clothing.
