Mobile phone footage of the Toffees boss showing off a series of slick moves at the Jason Derulo gig has been shared thousands of times on Twitter.
Martinez later confirmed he was at the event and said he was a "big fan" of the American pop star.
And he said: "I have better moves, believe me. Probably that [seen on the video] was the worst move."
