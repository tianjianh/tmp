Violence flared following the Hammers' 1-1 Premier League draw against Middlesbrough on 1 October.
Four people have been arrested over the disorder while a fifth man has been charged with ticket touting at the game.
Scotland Yard said it would "do our utmost to identify those responsible".
Supt Jonathan Williams said the violent scenes have "absolutely no place at football matches" and called on witnesses to contact police.
Details of the people previously arrested over the disorder:
The three men and one teenager were all bailed until November.
There have been several crowd disturbances since West Ham moved to the former Olympic Stadium.
It was recently announced supporters will face enhanced security checks, an alcohol ban and a "robust policing plan" when Slaven Bilic's side host Chelsea in the EFL Cup.
