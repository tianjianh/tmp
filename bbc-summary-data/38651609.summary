The 20-year old centre-half, who has previously spent two loan spells at Derby's Championship rivals Rotherham, is yet to make his Rams debut.
But he has played three times for Derby's under-23 side this season.
"Farrend's signing completes our recruitment in the defensive department," said boss Russell Slade.
"He is a very mature player. It allows us to now turn our attention to recruiting in other areas of the pitch."
Rawson is Coventry's second January loan signing following the arrival of Burton Albion midfielder Callum Reilly, while striker Stuart Beavon has arrived on an 18-month deal.
The Sky Blues, who are four points adrift of safety, having so far failed to win in four league games under Slade, also last week signed experienced former Wolves full-back Kevin Foley.
