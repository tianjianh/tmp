Holloway Prison, which famously housed members of the suffragettes and Diana Mosley, has been branded "inadequate" by inspectors.
George Osborne announced the jail would close and female prisoners would serve their sentences in "more humane" conditions in future.
The Prison Governors Association (PGA) said it was surprised and had "major concerns" about the move.
A number of other Victorian jails will be sold in order to help fund nine new prisons.
In a written statement, Justice Secretary Michael Gove said Holloway's "design and physical state" did not provide the best environment for the rehabilitation of offenders.
Mr Gove's statement echoed the latest inspection of the prison, which found it was "a very difficult establishment to run".
He described the jail as "inadequate and antiquated", and said the more humane surroundings of the new prisons would help to keep prisoners away from crime.
Holloway is expected to close by next summer.
In response to the announcement, a PGA spokesperson said the association had "major concerns".
"The PGA has not been consulted on this decision and it leaves us with some major concerns as to the capacity within the female estate," the spokesperson said.
The Government has said investment in prisons would reduce running costs across the estate by Â£80m a year when its reforms were complete.
