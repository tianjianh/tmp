[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Ham United v Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham captain Mark Noble has been ruled out of Saturday's game against Leicester because of a dead leg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His absence could prompt a recall for Sam Byram, while Andre Ayew is expected to start in attack after scoring as a substitute at Bournemouth last weekend.
Leicester midfielder Nampalys Mendy remains a doubt with a knee injury.
Danny Drinkwater is available despite ruling himself out of England duty because of a minor ongoing injury, believed to be a groin problem.
Alistair Mann: "Thoughts of Atletico Madrid will somehow have to be discarded as Leicester have four demanding league fixtures before they can once again indulge in a little fantasy football.
"If the Foxes aren't careful, they could find themselves remembered as the first Champions League quarter-finalists (and, who knows, maybe further than that!) to be relegated in the same campaign.
"It's away from home where their season has particularly imploded, winless on their travels in more than a year and with just three points accumulated on the road.
"Hosts West Ham are by no means completely clear of trouble yet either, with results in their inaugural season in the London Stadium of particular concern.  It all points to a fixture that's simply brimming with possibilities."

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "Leicester is a different team from four weeks ago. They really played extremely well, especially against Sevilla, when they got a great result for them and for English football in general.
"In all those three games, against Liverpool, against Hull and against Sevilla, they looked lively - and of course those kind of results, three wins on the spin including qualifying for the quarter-final of the Champions League, has given them a massive boost."
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare: "I haven't banned talk of the Champions League but after the [Sevilla] game the focus, what I wanted, has been on West Ham.
"The talk straight after the game was to improve the away record. We want to move away from (the relegation zone) because it is tight down there but we can't look too far ahead."
West Ham are on a poor run of four games without a win and I think Leicester's revival will continue.
