Northern Ireland's next Victims' Commissioner has been chosen and the name of the successful candidate is expected to be announced within days.

The post has been vacant since Kathryn Stone stepped down last year.
A spokesman for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister said a candidate was "selected and agreed" after interviews were held last week.
The statement was released after victims' groups expressed concern over the delay in replacing Ms Stone.
The chair of the Victims and Survivors Service (VSS) had said it was essential that a new commissioner is appointed soon.
Oliver Wilkinson told the Belfast Telegraph that many of the groups who represent victims were starting to go off "in different directions".
Several people have resigned in recent months from the Victims Forum.
Only a new commissioner can replace them.
The VSS is reportedly dealing with an average of 1,000 calls from victims and survivors of the Troubles every week.
Mr Wilkinson said the longer the period without an appointment, "the more fractured the victims' community is becoming".
"Victims need the opportunity to put their fears, concerns, anxieties and hopes forward and they need a strong champion who can do that and bring their message to politicians," he said.
"Without that, there are groups who are heading off in different directions.
"The difficulty is that she (Kathryn Stone) built up a very good reputation and there were huge expectations among people which fell when she left.
"I can understand there is a process to be gone through and it is important to get the right person.
"But, for example, the Victims Forum has had people leave it and we need a Victims Commissioner to appoint new people to it. Some people have left who cannot be very easily replaced."
Mr Wilkinson said there had been an expectation with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, that the needs and issues of victims would be addressed.
He said many victims were struggling on a daily basis.
"There is no getting away from that," he said
"And they are part of our overall community, we can't avoid them, we can't put them in a box."
A spokesperson  for the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister said: " A number of people were interviewed for the Victims Commissioner post last week and a candidate was selected and agreed.
"An official announcement will be made in the coming days when all the relevant people have been informed and the necessary processes complete."
