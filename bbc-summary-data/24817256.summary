Lennox accepted the award for her "outstanding contribution to British music" and her charity work.
The former Eurythmics frontwoman is one of the UK's most successful solo artists, selling in excess of 80 million records and winning eight Brit awards.
Paying tribute, singer Adele called her "an example of a brilliant talent".
"So many of her songs have been the soundtrack to my life," she added.
More than 1200 guests attended the charity event in Aid of Nordoff Robbins and The BRIT Performing Arts & Technology School.
Lennox, 58, said she was "very touched and honoured" to receive the award.
"Music has given me a lifetime of experiences and opportunities that I would never have dreamed possible, and I feel very privileged to have been able to become an artist and communicator, especially as a woman."
She performed a number of her hit singles including There Must Be An Angel, No More I Love You's and Here Comes The Rain Again.
Born in Aberdeen, Lennox trained at the Royal Academy of Music before becoming lead singer of the band The Tourists. Along with her fellow band member Dave Stewart, she went on to form the Eurythmics, who enjoyed a string of hits throughout the 80s.
Lennox released her acclaimed debut solo album Diva in 1992 and went on to record Medusa in 1995, both of which topped the UK album chart.
In 2004, she won an Oscar for her song Into the West which appeared in the Lord of the Rings film sequel, The Return of the King.
Lennox's charity work includes her support of Greenpeace and Amnesty International but she is best known for her work fighting Aids. In 2007 she established the SING campaign, dedicated to raising funds and awareness for women and children affected by HIV and Aids.
In 2010, Lennox was named as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Aids.
In another recorded tribute, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called her "one of those exemplary human beings who chose to put her success in her chosen career to work in order to benefit others", adding "she is a true friend of Africa and of South Africa."
Sir Elton John called the award "well deserved" while actor Stephen Fry added: "She shines, that's what she does, she has her lustre and gleam. As a humanitarian, Annie stands alone."
Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde said: "The world is a better place when you sing."
The Music Industry Trusts Award has raised over Â£4.5 million for Nordoff Robbins and the BRIT Trust. Past recipients include Sir George Martin, Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Tom Jones.
