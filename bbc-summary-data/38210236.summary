A rescue dog which needs a facelift to save its sight has become the centre of an online appeal.

The Shar-Pei, named Hector, was found in Bradford and was in danger of being put down but was taken in by a privately run dog shelter.
But due to his wrinkles, a feature of the breed, his eyesight is in danger of being permanently damaged.
Now Halfway Home Dog Rescue, near Newark, is raising Â£1,500 so he can be restored to health and re-homed.
Hector was found as a stray and was in poor shape, being severely underweight and missing fur.
He was taken to a council pound but unclaimed animals are in danger of being destroyed after seven days.
Luckily he was taken in by Halfway Home, which was prepared to deal with his complex needs.
The centre's founder, Val Hosegood, said: "We have got him to eat and he has started to wag his tail again.
"But the skin is the main problem. Shar-Pei are bred to have these wrinkly faces but in Hector's case the folds are rubbing on his eyes and if not fixed, he will go blind."
She said as they relied entirely on donations the cost of Hector's treatment, which could be as high as Â£3,000, needed a special appeal.
Shar-Peis are also prone to breathing problems and kidney failure.
The breed was one of those featured in an RSPCA campaign intended to make owners think twice about buying dogs which are bred with such extreme physical characteristics it can damage their health.
