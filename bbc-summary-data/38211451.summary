It will be the first time the US comedian and talk show host has fronted the ceremony, which takes place on 26 February.
He confirmed on Twitter: "Yes, I am hosting the Oscars. This is not a prank. And if it is, my revenge on @TheAcademy will be terrible & sweet."
Kimmel has previously hosted the American Music Awards and has twice fronted the Emmys - in 2012 and 2016.
This year's ceremony, presented by Chris Rock, suffered an eight-year low in US television ratings, with an average of 34.5 million viewers.
Previous presenters of the Oscars include Ellen DeGeneres, Seth MacFarlane, Whoopi Goldberg and Neil Patrick Harris.
Kimmel has hosted his own nightly hour-long talk show - called Jimmy Kimmel Live! - since 2003.
Regular features on his talk show include celebrity guests reading out insulting tweets about themselves and parents filming their children's reaction to being told all of their Halloween chocolate has been eaten.
He has also made cameo appearances in films such as Pitch Perfect 2 and Ted 2, as well as TV shows including Sesame Street and Entourage.
The 2017 Academy Awards show is being produced by Michael De Luca, producer of films including American History X and The Social Network, and Jennifer Todd, president of Ben Affleck's and Matt Damon's Pearl Street Films production company.
