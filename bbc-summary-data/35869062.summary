[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously injured after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in east Belfast on 4 March.
He was said to be recovering well, but died in hospital last Tuesday.
A group widely known as  the new IRA admitted the attack. A man has appeared in court charged with murder.
Speaking at Mr Ismay's funeral, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland Brian Anderson, said "in the darkest part of night - probably dressed in dark clothes, dark men did a dark, dark deed, leading to the loss of Izzy."
Sinn FÃ©in confirmed that the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness offered to attend the funeral, however the family did not want him to be there.
A strict security presence was maintained around the church with nearby roads cordoned off and a police helicopter circling overhead during the service.
Mr Ismay's brother-in-law, Ron Abrahams, told the congregation: "Izzy was generous with his time."
He added: "Whether it was the scouts, St. John's Ambulance or the Community Rescue Service - if he could help, he would.
"He never distinguished people by race, religion or colour. He expected nothing of anyone that he didn't expect of himself."
Those in attendance at the service included Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, First Minister Arlene Foster, Justice Minister David Ford, Chief Constable George Hamilton and Chairperson of the Policing Board Ann Connolly.
The head of the Prison Service - Sue McAllister - was also at the funeral as well as the Secretary General from the Department of Justice in the Republic of Ireland - Noel Waters.
Representatives from all prison services in Ireland and the UK were also there.
