Paul and Susan Dockerty had just got married and were travelling in a car with Derek and Joy Green, who were guests at the wedding in July.
The head-on crash with a lorry on the A64 at Scampston Bridge, between Malton and Scarborough, killed all four.
The 26-year-old driver of the lorry was uninjured, police said at the time.

The driver of the car, Mr Green, did not apply the brakes before colliding with the lorry, the Scarborough inquest heard.
Mr Green crossed over into the other carriageway, and this may have happened because of some form of distraction in the car, the inquest heard.
"What that distraction was we will never know", said the coroner.
He described the damage to the car as "catastrophic".
Mr Dockerty, 58, and his new wife Susan, 57, were from Leeds . Mr Green, 63, and Mrs Green, 60, were from Scarborough.
Joy Green was a well-known artist from the Scarborough area.
Mr and Mrs Green's family said after the crash: "Mum and dad were amazing, enthusiastic people who did so much in their lives and were always busy doing the things they loved."
