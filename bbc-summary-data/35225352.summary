[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle have confirmed that striker Robbie Muirhead has returned to Dundee United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old moved to Firhill on a short-term loan deal in September.
He scored two goals in eight appearances while on loan in Glasgow, both coming in a 5-2 win at Kilmarnock.
Muirhead moved to Tannadice from Kilmarnock in January 2015 but made only nine first team appearances before being loaned to Thistle.
Half of his eight appearances for United's Scottish Premiership rivals have come as a substitute.
However, after two consecutive starts against Killie and Ross County, he was an unused substitute against Aberdeen and Celtic.
Meanwhile, winger Jordan Leyden has returned to Thistle after the 24-year-old's loan period with East Fife, while 21-year-old Chris Duggan is back after the striker's four-goal spell with Queen's Park.
Heading in the other direction to League Two is 18-year-old defender Michael McMullin, who has joined East Stirlingshire for the rest of the season.
