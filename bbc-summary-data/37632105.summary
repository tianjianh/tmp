[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mark Jones murder accused 'seen running from Audi'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver saw two men running off, with one holding a handgun, moments before a drug dealer was found shot in a Rhondda Cynon Taff lay-by, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Jones, 43, was found at Llety Bends, Mountain Ash, on 26 July 2015.
Stephen Bennett, 53, and Edward Bennett, 48, deny murdering Mr Jones as he sat in his Audi A3.
Cardiff Crown Court was told James McCallister was driving past when three men ran in front of his car, with one falling "face down on the floor".
Prosecutor Chris Clee said Mr Jones, a HMRC valuation officer, was involved with drug dealing with Edward Bennett and alleged the brothers shot him twice.
In the weeks before the incident, the prosecutor said Edward Bennett was trying to raise a large sum of money, asking the jury: "Was Edward Bennett in significant debt to Mark Jones? Was he under pressure to pay that debt?"
Mr McCallister described how he watched the three men "running circles in the road".
"One of them then fell flat on his face. I turned to see him face down on the floor," he said.
Mr McCallister then watched the two others try and "drag" him onto the pavement before "making off into a gulley way", with one of the men holding a handgun.
He said his partner dialled 999 before other cars began stopping.
The court also heard how breakdown repair man Christopher Gale was parked in front of a white Audi A3 - that belonged to Mr Jones - when he heard "two very deep bangs".
He turned and saw the driver and passenger doors open and "some blue smoke come out of the driver's side", before two people began running.
He then saw the driver lying on the road and the passenger trying to push him off on to the path.
Mr Gale said cars with hazard lights on were stopping and he thought somebody may have been knocked over.
He watched the passenger run off into bushes, adding: "There were quite a few people scattered around. A lady was trying to look after him and said 'I think he's been stabbed'.
"I said 'I don't think he's been stabbed, he's been shot'."
Mr Jones was taken to hospital but died on 26 September 2015 after 15 operations.
The trial continues.
