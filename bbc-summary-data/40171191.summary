Photographs taken by University of Aberdeen scientists chart a dolphin's recovery from horrific looking sunburn injuries.
The bottlenose dolphin known as Spirtle was stranded out of the water on mudflats for 24 hours last May in the Cromarty Firth.
She was spotted by chance by a couple who had got lost trying to drive to a dolphin-watching spot at the Moray Firth.
Rescuers refloated the dolphin but did think she would survive.
The University of Aberdeen has been monitoring Spirtle's recovery from its Lighthouse Field Station at Cromarty.
Scientists and conservationists hope Spirtle might eventually breed and raise young.
She is part of a group of dolphins that include her mother Porridge, and are usually found in the Moray Firth.
Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer and wildlife photographer Charlie Phillips has also been helping to document Spirtle's recovery.
