Unemployment has changed little in Wales between February and April, compared with the previous quarter.

The jobless rate in Wales remains at 4.8%, higher than the UK rate of 4.6%.
A thousand more people are out of work in Wales than the same period last year and 7,000 more than between November and January.
Official figures show 4,000 fewer people working in Wales than in November to January but 8,000 more than this time last year.
When comparing the growth of employment between February to April 2016 to the same quarter this year, Wales saw a 1% rise, higher than the UK rate of 0.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
But this is lower than the north east, north west and south west regions of England.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: "My priority is ensuring the UK government continues to engage with businesses and industry to ensure that we are creating the best possible conditions for economic growth in all sectors across Wales."
First Minister Carwyn Jones said improvement in economic inactivity in Wales had outperformed the UK average and fallen by 1.1% over the year.
"As a pro-business government, we have been working hard to create the right economic conditions to support business in order to create and safeguard jobs right across Wales," he said.
He also pointed to Caerphilly-based aerospace company AerFin, which was this week named the fastest growing privately-owned firm for international sales in the UK.
