Gareth Hutch, 35, was shot dead on North Cumberland Street on 24 May.
His killing is thought to be linked to a violent feud between the Hutch and Kinahan gangs.
At his funeral on Friday, the priest said ending the feud required "courage, restraint, goodwill and right reason and a desire for peace".
Fr Paddy Madden told mourners that "every tragedy has a human face" and the victim's parents were numbed by grief and sadness.
"Beyond analysis, comment and speculation we have pain and tears," the priest added.
Mr Hutch was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.
The victim was a nephew of Gerard Hutch, a notorious Dublin criminal known as 'The Monk'.
The feud escalated into murder in September last year when another nephew of 'The Monk' - Gary Hutch - was shot dead in Spain.
This year, six other people have died in the greater Dublin area in gun attacks linked to the feud.
The killings including a gun attack at Dublin's Regency Hotel, during a boxing weigh-in event in February.
