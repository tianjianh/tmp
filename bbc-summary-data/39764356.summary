Stop fighting war that's over says Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill

Michelle O'Neill spoke on Sunday evening at a memorial event marking 30 years since the ambush, in which an innocent civilian was also killed.
Earlier, unionists and victims had reacted angrily to the move.
However, Ms O'Neill said everyone had a legitimate right to remember their dead.
She told people gathered for the commemoration at Cappagh, County Tyrone, that victims and survivors of the Troubles in Northern Ireland who sought justice and truth, must be given the strongest possible support and assistance.
"While much of our history has been marked by sadness and tragedy, we now have a unique opportunity to be the authors of a new, peaceful, and democratic future," she said.
"This does not mean we forget our past. Everyone has a legitimate right to remember their dead, tell their side of the story and share their experiences, and hurt, of that time, without being demonised.
"I challenge our opponents to stop fighting a war which is now over. There is an onus on all of us to move forward to create a free, just and equal society - together."
Ms O'Neill said she had been criticised by unionists and the media for commemorating IRA volunteers, but she was an Irish republican.
"I see no contradiction whatsoever in commemorating our republican dead while reaching out to our unionist neighbours to build the future - Orange and Green together on the basis of full equality and mutual respect," she said.
Undercover soldiers killed eight members of the Provisional IRA's East Tyrone unit at Loughgall in May 1987.
It happened as they approached Loughgall RUC station in County Armagh with a bomb in a hijacked digger.
The IRA men shot were: Jim Lynagh, Padraig McKearney, Gerard O'Callaghan, Tony Gormley, Eugene Kelly, Patrick Kelly, Seamus Donnelly and Declan Arthurs.
The SAS also shot Anthony Hughes and his brother was badly wounded.
In 2014, Mr Hughes' family received a fully government apology confirming he was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing.
In 2001, the European Court of Human Rights found the rights of those killed at Loughgall had been violated.
Earlier this week, during a visit to a Catholic grammar school to meet Irish language students, DUP leader Arlene Foster criticised Ms O'Neill's decision to attend the commemoration.
"It is disappointing that when I am trying to make this a shared place for everybody in Northern Ireland that other leaders are doing things that frankly are wrong and backward looking," Mrs Foster said.
"I am thinking of what is happening in Loughgall on Sunday and I think that is something that Sinn Féin needs to reflect on.
"We have heard a lot during the election about respect and they need to understand what that means in terms of the past and in terms of the future, as people look to the future here in Northern Ireland."
