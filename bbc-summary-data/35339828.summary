Sadie Hartley, a 60-year-old mother of three, was found with multiple stab wounds at a house in the Rossendale Valley in Lancashire on Friday night.
Lancashire Police detectives said they did not believe the motive for the attack was robbery.
A 34-year-old woman from Chester has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody.
Police said Ms Hartley was alone at the property in Sunny Bank Road, Helmshore, before she was killed.
The businesswoman spoke to a colleague at about 19:30 GMT on Thursday but there was no further contact before she was found dead in the hallway of the property at 22:40 on Friday.
Det Supt Paul Withers said: "She's a thoroughly decent lady, successful businesswoman who works very, very hard and she certainly didn't deserve to end her life in this manner.
"I don't feel this is a random attack, I think Sadie has been targeted by an individual who clearly had some issues with her for whatever reason and it is imperative we find out why this has happened.
"It was quite a ferocious attack on a lady at home alone. We are absolutely determined to identify who has done it so hopefully they will face the courts and a lengthy, lengthy custodial sentence."
Officers want to trace an "old style" Renault Clio car and three other people seen in CCTV footage of the area at about 20:00 on Thursday.
A man was seen walking out of the cul-de-sac towards the village store on Holcombe Road and passing another person. A jogger is also seen in the footage running in the opposite direction, police said.
Mr Withers said: "We believe that this could be around the time that [Ms Hartley] was murdered and we want to trace these people as soon as possible.
"We also know that this area is regularly used by dog walkers so we are keen to speak to anyone who frequently uses the route along Sunny Bank Road and may have seen anything out of the ordinary in the days and weeks preceding the murder."
