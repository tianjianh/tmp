Explosions have been heard coming from the Remondis site on Carr Lane, Prescot, Merseyside, since the fire started at about 06:00 GMT.
Fire crews have not yet confirmed what materials are handled at the site but have advised residents nearby to keep doors and windows closed.
Forty business premises at Prescot Business Park have been evacuated.
Half of the building is alight and part of the building is beginning to collapse, the fire service said. No injuries have been reported.
The fire service said up to 80 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height.
It said the site which was built in 2012 could "burn for days".
"We have made good progress. The smoke has reduced and we are receiving advice from the Environment Agency on any risks to health," said the fire service.
It added any residents with pre-existing medical issues or residents with concerns about the smoke's impact on their health should contact the NHS 111 service or their GP surgery.
Earlier, police tweeted pictures showing a plume of dark-coloured smoke arching over the M57 near junction 2.
Twitter user Ubik said: "Audible explosions still being heard in surrounding area".
North West Motorway Police said visibility on the motorway was not affected but was being monitored.
Some roads close to the site have been closed.
The site holds an environmental permit for the treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of hazardous waste.
The Environment Agency said in a statement: "We are working with partner agencies including Merseyside Police, Public Health England and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service to ensure the risk to people and the environment is minimised."
Remondis UK was unavailable for comment.
