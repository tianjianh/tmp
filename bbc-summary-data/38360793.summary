[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 0-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Laird scored the only goal of the game as Walsall saw off Port Vale at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender coolly slotted home midway through the first half to give the Saddlers all three points and leave the Valiants with just one win in their last 10 League One matches.
Walsall started the game well and took a deserved lead after 27 minutes when Isaiah Osbourne played the ball back in following a corner and found Laird unmarked at the far post to fire past Jak Alnwick.
The visitors could have gone ahead just four minutes in when Joe Edwards met Simeon Jackson's cross from the byline, but he couldn't connect with his volley properly and Alnwick made a comfortable save.
Midfielder Florent Cuvelier almost doubled the Saddlers' advantage in the 52nd minute, but a fine save from Alnwick denied his swerving 25-yard effort.
The hosts almost netted an equaliser only for Neil Etheridge to tip over Ryan Taylor's last-gasp free-kick.
