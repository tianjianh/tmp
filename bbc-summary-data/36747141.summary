Quigley, 19, had loan spells at Woking and Wrexham last term and has also previously spent time at Torquay.
"I've come here to help the team get into the Championship while scoring as many goals as I can," Quigley told the Gills' website.
"I gained a lot from the physical side of non-league football while on loan at Wrexham and Woking."
Quigley is Gillingham's fourth summer signing this week, following the arrivals of Lee Martin and  Scott Wagstaff on two-year deals and defender Deji Oshilaja on loan from Cardiff City.
