An investigation has begun after the sensitive documents were found at the building in Liverpool, which is being turned into flats.
The BBC understands the files include details of murder and rape cases, alongside names and addresses.
The Ministry of Justice said the matter was being taken "extremely seriously".
The documents belong to the Probation Service, which took over the building in Derby Lane, Old Swan, from the police back in 1993.
Workers found the documents as they were clearing the rooms.
The Ministry of Justice said the files in question contained data from crimes that happened before 2003, and had been stored in a secure room.
A spokesman said: "We take all issues in relation to data handling extremely seriously and have launched an investigation."
