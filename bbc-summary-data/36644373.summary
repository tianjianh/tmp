Figurines representing each of the 19,240 British soldiers who died on the first day of the Battle of the Somme have been laid out.

The figurines, each clad in a hand-made calico shroud, mark the anniversary of the start of the battle 100 years ago.
They were placed on the grass next to the World War One memorial in Exeter, by artist Rob Heard.
The artwork was opened at 07:30 BST, the exact time the whistle was blown 100 years ago for the battle's start.
Mr Heard, 50 and from Somerset, said he wanted to make physical the number of soldiers who died.

The 19240 Shrouds of the Somme - in the town's Northernhay Gardens - forms part of events around the UK marking the battle.
Mr Heard, with help from volunteers and serving soldiers, laid out each of the figurines, which will be on display until next Thursday.
Mr Heard began creating the work while recuperating from a car crash.
"I was in a dark place," said Mr Heard, whose injuries ended his career building adventure playgrounds.
"Then I heard a story on the radio about soldiers who had died in the Somme.
"We talk too often about the large numbers of the losses in war.
"We have had the poppies at the Tower of London, which was a great thing, but the individual was lost in that sea of colour.
"I wanted to make people understand the number is made up of individual people."
He found the names of each man in military archives and used them for each figurine as he clad it in the shroud.
The project began last December and Mr Heard has spent more than 5,500 hours making the display.
"I feel this is a real privilege to have had a relationship with these men," he said.
"It's not a comfortable image, but when you associate it with a name it's very powerful and denotes the individual in each number."
