The "weeping window" poppy sculpture at a Northumberland museum has contributed almost £1.8m to the local economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woodhorn was the first venue to host a tour of the ceramic flowers, originally displayed at the Tower of London, to mark the centenary of World War One.
The seven-week exhibition between September and November 2015 attracted 125,505 visitors to the mining museum - almost double the same period in 2014.
Figures showed the benefit to the economy amounted to £1,799,370.
Researchers found that at least 12% of visitors were from outside the region, stayed overnight, and accounted for £726,670 in spending.
