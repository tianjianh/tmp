[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kilmarnock 0-0 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Clark had to be content with a draw as he tasted top-flight football in Scotland for the first time as Kilmarnock manager.

Two goal-line clearances frustrated the hosts' Josh Magennis in the first half.
Dundee had the better of the second half and saves by Jamie MacDonald denied Paul McGowan and Kane Hemmings.
A point may well prove vital in Killie's quest to avoid the relegation play-off spot, which they currently occupy.
The Rugby Park side have taken four points from the last six available, leaving them level with Partick Thistle and 11 points ahead of Dundee United, while Dundee's fine run extends to five games unbeaten.
The Ayrshire side almost got their new manager's Premiership stewardship off to the perfect start.
Craig Slater and Greg Kiltie combined to release Magennis, who turned Darren O'Dea before slotting the ball beyond goalkeeper Scott Bain only for Kevin Holt to clear off the line.
Magennis was proving a handful for the Dundee defence and he brought out a fine save from Bain with a driven shot.
Greg Stewart had the visitors' first real effort after getting beyond Kevin McHattie but his angled shot was deflected wide by the outstretched leg of Conrad Balatoni.
It was a fast tempo affair but the home side came close from two corner kicks.
Gary Dicker volleyed McHattie's cross just over and Magennis then had a header blocked on the line by Nick Ross.
In between those chances a Slater free-kick from wide on the left almost caught out Bain but the keeper managed to readjust and flick the ball away.
On the half-hour mark after withstanding some Killie pressure Stewart robbed Slater in the middle of the park before setting up Rory Loy, a former Killie youth player, who turned a first-time effort over the bar.

Paul Hartley's team started the second period sprightly and Hemmings blasted wide from 20 yards within seconds of the restart.
The big striker then turned provider, setting up Paul McGowan for a powerful left-foot shot from 12 yards that was superbly turned round the post by MacDonald.
Hemmings, who had scored 14 goals in his previous 14 appearances, looked again to add to his tally with another sweet strike that MacDonald blocked well diving to his left.
The visitors came close to clinching the winner right at the end when Thomas Konrad nodded just wide of MacDonald's left-hand post.
