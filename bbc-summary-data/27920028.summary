People trying to log on to the site were faced with a message saying: "Something went wrong. We're working to get it fixed as soon as we can."
The short shutdown drew attention across the web with many taking to Twitter to ask what all the fuss was about.
Facebook apologised for the problem but did not say what caused it.
"Earlier this morning, we experienced an issue that prevented people from posting to Facebook for a brief period of time. We resolved the issue quickly, and we are now back to 100%.  We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused."
It is not yet clear how many countries were affected.
