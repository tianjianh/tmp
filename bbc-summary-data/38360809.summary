[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 3-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Simon Cox bagged a brace as Southend saw off AFC Wimbledon at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cox scored in each half and was joined on the scoresheet by Will Atkinson as the Shrimpers made it 11 matches in League One without defeat.
The Dons had striker Lyle Taylor sent off midway through the second half and visiting manager Neal Ardley was also ordered from the dug-out for protesting.
Wimbledon could have taken an early lead had Ted Smith not impressively denied Dominic Poleon when the striker was clean through on goal.
Southend hit back to go ahead in the 10th minute when Cox slammed the ball home from close range after a long throw from Ryan Leonard.
Cox then struck another effort against the crossbar before Atkinson slotted home after great approach play from Marc-Antoine Fortune.
After the break, Smith did well to deny Tom Elliott before Taylor was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Anton Ferdinand in the 72nd minute.
Cox completed the scoring with a brilliant long-range chip six minutes from time.
