Video gamers are being invited to shoot TV writer and satirist Charlie Brooker when he appears as a character in World War II computer game Sniper Elite 3.

Brooker, who presents BBC Two's Weekly Wipe, appears in the game as a German field officer in Hitler's entourage.
A long-time fan of the game, he also appears as a British radio operator.
Brooker donned a motion capture suit to film the footage in April, which forms part of the bonus material for games ordered ahead of Friday's release.
Creators Rebellion are understood to have included an incentive to encourage gamers to assassinate Brooker's character as creatively as possible.
"At one stage it seemed like Charlie mentioned Sniper Elite every few weeks in his Guardian columns and we're incredibly grateful for his support," said Rebellion founder Jason Kingsley.
"So this seemed like the perfect way to say thanks.
"We had a fun time doing his motion capture scenes and in return have promised to give him one of the first copies of the game so he can shoot his character with a sniper rifle to his heart's content."
