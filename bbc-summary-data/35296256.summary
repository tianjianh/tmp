[SN]TITLE[SN]
Arriva Trains Wales drivers to strike on 1 February

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arriva Trains Wales drivers are set to go on strike for the second time this year, the Aslef union has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-hour strike, on 1 February, comes as part of a row over conditions.
Members of the RMT and Aslef unions walked out on 4 January this year, the day many returned to work after the Christmas break.
The pay side of the dispute has been accepted, but Aslef previously claimed Arriva was trying to "railroad through" changes to terms and conditions.
A union statement read: "Aslef today announced that, in the light of Arriva Trains Wales' failure to offer a satisfactory resolution to the long and ongoing dispute with its drivers, our members will withdraw their labour for 24 hours."
Arriva said it "regretted" the disruption January's strike caused to more than 1,000 services it runs each day, when people complained of queues for tickets, long delays and overcrowding.
