MSPs call for better quality coffee at Holyrood committee meetings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pleas have been made by members of the Scottish Parliament for better quality coffee to be served to them during committee meetings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The call was made by Scottish Conservative Mary Scanlon and backed by SNP MSP Mike MacKenzie.
The state of Holyrood's coffee was raised during questions about staff and services at the Edinburgh building.
Linda Fabiani suggested the complainers could use "very good coffee bags" and "some really hot water".
She was answering on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body which runs the parliament.
After taking a question about food waste disposal, Ms Fabiani was informed by Ms Scanlon that she would like to "increase the amount of food disposal" in some areas, namely the coffee for committee meetings.
Ms Scanlon, the MSP for the Highlands and Islands, told the chamber: "On behalf of my colleague on the audit and education committee, Colin Beattie, and colleagues across this parliament from all parties can I ask if the corporate body will ensure that new and existing MSPs get a decent cup of coffee in committee in session five [after the next Holyrood election]."
Ms Scanlon was backed by Mr MacKenzie who said he "shared the concerns".
He had also observed that the quality of the coffee diminished the longer it sat in their flasks.
Ms Fabiani responded by saying: "I guess it is all a matter of taste I quite like the coffee that we get in committee."
However, she added that it was a complaint she had heard "over the last couple of years".
Ms Fabiani said the fact the coffee urns were being emptied each day suggested that most people were "quite happy" with what was being offered.
