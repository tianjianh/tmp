The building, on Carlisle's Warwick Street, has performance spaces for music, comedy, theatre and exhibitions as well as a cafe-bar.
It also has studios for workshops and conferences. Construction work began in October 2014.
Carlisle City Council said the "ambitious" development would "bring people here and keep people here".
Stephen Dunn, arts officer for Carlisle City Council, said: "I think the million pounds is an investment. Over the next two or three years that money will be seed money.
"It's public money and it has to be invested right and it has to come back in and that's why the Old Fire Station has to be a business and stand on its own two feet."
