[SN]TITLE[SN]
The Archers or Brecon and Radnor?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I've been covering the latest developments within the ranks of the Brecon and Radnorshire Conservatives this week which, at times, has had the feel of an episode of the Archers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new candidate, a postman called Gary Price, beat among others, Harry Legge-Bourke, a member of a major land-owning family, in an open primary event where there was an allegation that Mr Price was receiving texts during a detailed question and answer session.
But the adjudicator, a local vicar, saw nothing wrong and the complainants have been accused of mischief-making.
In the middle of all of this, we revealed that Mr Price is the subject of a second investigation by the public services Ombudsman in two years.
The latest inquiry relates to a complaint that he brought Powys Council, of which he's an elected member, into disrepute.
One complaint from a senior member of the local association has warned that the campaign next year could be in tatters if the decision goes against him, while Jonathan Reeves, the local president, told me: "I do not think he is a suitable candidate but having been elected by an adopted procedure, which I cannot really grumble about, we have got to proceed with him."
Hardly a ringing endorsement.
But a lengthy statement from the Welsh Conservatives has given the clear impression that the party is sticking by its man.
In relation to the Ombudsman's investigation, the statement said: "The minutes of Powys Standards Committee reveal that since January 2014, fourteen unidentified Powys councillors have been referred to the Public Service Ombudsman for investigation of alleged conduct breaches, the majority of which led to no action."
So Tory HQ believes the complaint against its candidate is not serious enough to worry about, and barring anything unforeseen, it will be Gary Price heading up the campaign.
But behind the colourful Archers-esque feel of this story there are a number of issues of wider significance.
One of the big questions for the Conservative party in the assembly election is whether it can repeat its success in Wales in the general election.
Brecon and Radnorshire is a perfect example.
The party trounced the Liberal Democrats in May with Chris Davies achieving a majority of more than 5,000 over Roger Williams.
Party members will obviously be looking to repeat that next year. Throw into the mix the fact that Gary Price will be up against the leader of the Welsh Lib Dems Kirsty Williams and it's shaping up to be a high-profile contest.
Brecon and Radnorshire is in that category of seats like the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardiff North which were won by the Tories comfortably in the general election, and yet they don't hold the seats at the Senedd.
The question is whether Gary Price's campaign has been harmed before getting off the ground, or whether the momentum generated by the Tories, and the current weakness of the Lib Dems, mean it will turn blue at the assembly.
Another element to this week's story is also a reflection of the open primary selection process which a number of local Tory associations have adopted.
Open primaries are different because they allow any registered voters in an area who turns up, and not just a party member, to have a say in the selection of the candidate.
They have been used to select candidates in Brecon and Radnorshire, Cardiff North, where a high-profile former independent councillor Jayne Cowan has been selected, the Vale of Glamorgan, where a young candidate Ross England will take on the veteran Labour minister Jane Hutt, and the Vale of Clwyd, where a local councillor Sam Rowlands will be challenging for the seat.
It's probably too early to tell but it'll be interesting to see whether this process leads to a greater range of candidates being offered up to the electorate by the party across Wales next May.
I haven't looked in-depth but I doubt if there are many postmen to have been selected as Conservative candidates in the past.
It will be something that the party will inevitably look to trade on as it tries to move into the centre ground with a message that it's a party for all sections of society.
So a greater range of candidates may be the result of open primaries, whether they are more appealing to voters of course is another matter.
