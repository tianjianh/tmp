Amanda Walker, 48, from Knaresborough, was admitted to Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust Hospital in December 2010 after miscarrying twins.
Her injuries were caused by a medical mask designed to keep her airway open during an operation.
The hospital apologised to Ms Walker, who said the pain was debilitating.
When she woke up from the procedure she had severe pain in her jaw and struggled to open her mouth.

Her dentist later told her that her jaw was misaligned and there was significant damage to the muscles, tendons and ligaments around it, she said.
"My first MRI scan showed that my injuries were similar to that of a car crash victim they were that severe," Ms Walker said.
She has needed a series of operations to repair the damage, including a partial jaw replacement.
"It changed my diet, left me relying on my family more than ever," she said.
Ms Walker received a written apology from the hospital as well as financial compensation, the exact amount of which has not been revealed.
Dr David Scullion, medical director at Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We have apologised to Ms Walker for the impact this injury has had on her, and I would like to reiterate that apology now.
"We conducted an investigation into Ms Walker's care with us in 2010 and want to give assurance that we have learned all we can from this incident."
