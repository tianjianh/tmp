Kirsty Williams said the party had helped bring "order" to the UK's economic chaos by going into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010.
She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme that this did not stop her opposing policies "detrimental" to Wales such as regional pay.
"No man in London tells me what to do," she said.
