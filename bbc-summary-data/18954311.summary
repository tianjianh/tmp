Honduras country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Honduras has a long history of military rule, corruption, poverty and crime which have rendered it one of the least developed and most unstable countries in Central America.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Until the mid-1980s Honduras was dominated by the military, which enthusiastically supported US efforts to stem revolutionary movements in the region. Since then, civilian leaders have sought to curb the power of the military, with varying degrees of success.
Gang violence, drug wars and extortion are commonplace and the country is notorious for having the world's highest murder rate per capita.
Inequalities in wealth remain high, with nearly half of the population living below the poverty line. Thousands of Hondurans leave to go to the US each year and the remittances they send home are a crucial source of income for many families.
Once dominated by foreign-owned banana companies, the country remains a major fruit exporter. It is also Central America's second largest coffee producer.
Population 7.9 million
Area 112,492 sq km (43,433 sq miles)
Major languages Spanish, indigenous languages, English
Major religion Christianity
Life expectancy 71 years (men), 76 years (women)

President: Juan Orlando Hernandez
Juan Orlando Hernandez took office in January 2014, promising a zero tolerance approach towards organized crime and pledging to bring down the high levels of drug-related violence.
He won elections in the previous November, beating off challenger Xiomara Castro, the wife of former president Manuel Zelaya - whose ouster in a 2009 coup triggered a deep political crisis.
During his four-year term due to end in January 2018, Mr Hernandez is also facing deep economic challenges, including high unemployment and poverty levels.
Since the 2009 coup, Honduras has been one of the western hemisphere's most dangerous countries for journalists.
Twenty-eight journalists and media workers have been killed since 2000, Reporters Without Borders reported in 2015.
Harassment against broadcasting outlets has included assaults, threats, blocked transmissions and power outages, says Freedom House.
Media freedom is restricted by punitive defamation laws, and reporters tend to exercise self-censorship. Ownership of media outlets is concentrated in the hands of a few powerful business interests, US-based Freedom House notes.
There were 2.4 million internet users by November 2015, about 24% of the population (Internetworldstats). Facebook is the leading social network.
