[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool Ladies have signed Wales winger Natasha Harding after her release by Manchester City Women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Cardiff City and Bristol Academy forward moved to City last March after a switch to Washington Spirit in the United States fell through when she was denied a visa.
The 26-year-old's exit comes after City signed Sweden striker Kosovare Asllani.
"This is a great move for me and I cannot wait to get started," she told the club website.
"The squad at Liverpool Ladies is a really young and ambitious one with huge potential."
