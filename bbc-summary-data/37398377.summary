Warburton would not talk about the midfielder, who has been told to stay away from the club following a training ground row.
The Rangers manager ended the post-match press conference after being asked questions about Barton.
"It's an internal matter that is being dealt with," he said. "We won't make any comment on any internal matter."
Following a frustrating result at home, Warburton insisted the headlines it has generated by Barton's absence had not hindered his team.
"It didn't affect our preparations," he said. "It's just another matter that you deal with, it's part of the challenge of day-to-day working life.
"We did very well, we trained well and we gave a good performance but didn't get the rewards that I felt we deserved."
Andy Halliday, who was involved in an argument with Barton in training following last weekend's 5-1 loss to Celtic, returned to the starting line-up against Ross County and was cheered by the home support.
Rangers dominated possession and created more chances than the visitors, but could not make the breakthrough.
Despite the scoreline, which leaves Rangers three points behind Premiership leaders Celtic, who have two games in hand, Warburton was positive about his side's display.
"I'm never happy about dropping two points at home but I'm very pleased with the performance," he said. "That's our best 90-minute performance of the season.
"We wanted to go back to basics. I always go back to the money markets. If you lose a bunch of money you don't try to win it back the following day. You build slowly.
"We said come in and move the ball quickly, show an energy and desire. Get bodies forward and create chances. We did that. I'm sure you'll agree we created more than enough chances to win two or three games. We just hit every part of the goalkeeper's body.
"It was one of those days but we've got to be much happier with the quality of performance. Nine times out of 10 that will be enough to win games."
