[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newport striker Lenell John-Lewis had the best chance of the first half but shot wide from an acute angle.
Veteran Dagenham & Redbridge forward Jamie Cureton had an injury-time shot tipped over the bar by Joe Day.
The draw sees Newport stay at the foot of League Two with just two points from eight games, while the Daggers drop to second bottom.
Dagenham assistant coach Darren Currie told BBC London 94.9:

"With the chances we created, certainly in the second half, we're disappointed to have not scored a goal.
"There were words said at half-time, there was no real urgency in the first half.
"We just played at too slow a tempo and didn't really warrant anything out of the first half."
Newport County manager Terry Butcher told BBC Radio Wales:
"It felt good to get the clean sheet and good to come away and get an away point.  We played far better last week and lost so we know we can play better.
"Joe Day made some good saves and they missed some opportunities. We had some reasonable chances in the first half and still looked a threat when we went forward in the second half as the game become stretched.
"It is a good point for us. We put in a gritty performance to grind out a point and that feels good."
