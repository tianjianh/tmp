[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Footage showing Shrien Dewani and his wife shortly before she was murdered has been shown in court in South Africa.

The CCTV shows the couple walking into a budget restaurant in the final moments before Anni Dewani was killed.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who claimed he discussed the murder on the phone with Mr Dewani while in the restaurant, is seen leading them inside.
Mr Dewani denies arranging his wife's murder.
Tongo claims Mr Dewani paid him to arrange his wife's killing which took place in the back of his taxi later that evening.
He said businessman Mr Dewani, from Bristol, offered him about $2,100 (Â£1,340) to set up the carjacking in Gugulethu township near Cape town in November 2010.
Tongo was sentenced to 18 years following a plea bargain for his part in the murder, while accomplices Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe were also jailed. Mngeni has since died.
In the latest footage shown to the court on Wednesday, Mr Dewani can be seen on his own outside the restaurant talking on his mobile phone. Phone records show he was talking to Tongo.
The taxi driver told the court Mngeni and Qwabe "wanted to know where would the money be".
"He [Mr Dewani] said he has put the money in the pouch behind the seat," Tongo said.
Mr Dewani has claimed the money was not to pay for his wife's murder but to pay for a helicopter ride for the pair.
Tongo told the court how he tried to sell himself as a tour guide to the Dewanis and claimed they never told him they were on their honeymoon.
He admitted he had made several mistakes in statements given to police after Mrs Dewani's death.
Shrien Dewani's defence team highlighted inconsistencies in Tongo's account of events on both the day before and on the day of Anni Dewani's murder.
Discrepancies included Tongo's account of when the alleged conversation between him and Mr Dewani to "arrange" the killing had actually taken place.
The defence also questioned why Tongo said Mr Dewani told him he would pay him for the killing in South African Rand, having claimed Mr Dewani only had US dollars.
On Tuesday, Western Cape High Court was shown CCTV footage of Mr Dewani and Tongo meeting to exchange a package.
The court heard Tongo could be released after serving nine years of his 18-year sentence.
