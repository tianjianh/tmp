Rovers keeper Steve Mildenhall kept it goalless on the half-hour mark when he pushed Joe Jacobson's free kick wide.
The visitors had their own chances and needed Ryan Allsop to stop Lee Mansell and Ollie Clarke finding the net.
But O'Nien gave Wycombe a valuable win when he latched on to Jacobson's free-kick to head past Mildenhall.
The result means the Chairboys leapfrogged Bristol Rovers and move up to sixth in League Two, whilst Rovers slip to 10th.
Wycombe Wanderers manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"It's a huge three points. The best team won as well. I really do believe that today. I think we reduced Bristol into a long-ball team. They play some good stuff, they do knock it about well. We restricted that today.
"It was ironic that a set play determined this game, because there was plenty of good football out there. We worked really hard this week on what we were going to do.
"I have to give major to credit to Richard Dobson and Barry Richardson, and my staff and my two coaches. Without them I'd be nothing and they've been fantastic this week."
