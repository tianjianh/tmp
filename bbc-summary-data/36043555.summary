[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five Sussex Police officers could face criminal charges following the death of a man who died after he was arrested.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duncan Tomlin, 32, from Oxfordshire, was restrained on 26 July 2014 and put in a police van in Ryecroft, Haywards Heath, where he became unresponsive.
He was taken out of the van and given CPR, but died later in hospital.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had passed files on the sergeant and four PCs to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
It added that there may also be a case to answer for gross misconduct against the five officers.
IPCC commissioner Jennifer Izekor said it would await a CPS decision and would in the meantime "engage in discussions with Sussex Police about the gross misconduct recommendations".
The father of Mr Tomlin, who was living in Burgess Hill at the time, welcomed the decision to refer the case and said the five officers should now be suspended.
"We consider that it is vital for ensuring continuing public trust in the police that these officers are not allowed to remain on any form of active duty whilst the CPS consider if charges should be brought,"  Paul Tomlin said.
"We call on the chief constable of Sussex Police to now suspend all five officers concerned."
A Sussex Police spokesman said: "This remains an ongoing IPCC investigation and we are unable to comment on the specifics of the incident in Haywards Heath.
"Our thoughts and condolences remain with Mr Tomlin's family and friends.
"We are working closely with the IPCC in support of their investigation and we await the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service as to whether any charges will be brought against the officers."
