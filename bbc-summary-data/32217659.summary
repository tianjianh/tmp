The 16-year-old girl was raped on Saturday 20 December 2014 at an unknown address in the Bolton area.
It was reported to police at about 03:00 the next morning.
The victim has worked with specialist officers from Greater Manchester Police since the attack to create the e-fit images of the men.
Detectives want to hear from anyone who recognises them.
Det Insp Damian Simpson said: "We have been working closely with the victim to help create the image of the offender and finding who is responsible.
"As the investigation continues we are now seeking assistance from the public to identify the men, who we believe were driving a red car.
"The victim does not know where the offence has taken place but believes it was in a house in the Bolton area. I would appeal to anyone who may recognise the men in the image to contact us as soon as possible."
Anyone with any information is asked to contact Greater Manchester Police or Crimestoppers.
