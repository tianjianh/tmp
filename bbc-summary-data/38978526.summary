What do you do if you're a seal swimming out to sea and you get tired ? Hitch a ride on a kayak of course!

That's exactly what happened in Scotland recently when a seal surprised a group of kayakers by hopping aboard one of them!
Apparently the mammal had been following the the kayakers for about a mile before it got tired. Although they were a bit worried to begin with, they said it was an "amazing experience".
There are two different types of seal found around the British coastlines: the common and the grey seal.
