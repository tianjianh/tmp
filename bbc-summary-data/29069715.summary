Nicola Sturgeon has said that independence offers an "opportunity for all sectors of Scottish society".

The deputy first minister also suggested people were "waking up" to independence being a chance to build a fairer society.
She was speaking on a visit to Glasgow Central Mosque.
Labour spokeswoman Jackie Baillie argued that the nationalists were making claims on welfare which simply do "not add up".
However, Ms Sturgeon said independence was an inclusive offer which could benefit all sectors of society.
She said: "It is about the people of Scotland, all of us, taking our future into our own hands.
"Here at Glasgow Central Mosque and across all of Scotland's communities, people are waking up to the opportunity of independence to build a fairer society, to support our young people with greater job opportunities and to protect our public services like the NHS.
"Scotland's success on the world stage is built on innovation and a rich and diverse cultural heritage - that outward-looking and inclusive approach will blossom on the world stage with a Yes vote and independence.
"In Scotland there are families from Pakistan and Poland, India and Ireland, England and Italy, and people from many other parts of the world living, working and making a positive contribution to modern Scotland - this is something worth celebrating."
Labour and the Better Together campaign have claimed an independent Scotland would face spending cuts which would place a strain on welfare budgets.
Ms Baillie said: "The welfare state is one of the UK's proudest achievements. It was founded on the basis of need, not nationality, so that those who fall on hard times get the support they need.
"To make that founding principle a reality we need to be able to fund our welfare state. Independence puts that at risk. The experts at the impartial Institute for Fiscal Studies are clear that leaving the UK would mean an extra Â£6bn of cuts.
"The SNP's welfare claims simply don't add up. Alex Salmond needs to tell people in Scotland how his welfare promises would be paid for when independence would bring about austerity plus."
