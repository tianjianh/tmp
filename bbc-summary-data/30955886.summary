Hamilton Academical say they have turned down a bid of £300,000 for right-back Ziggy Gordon from Polish top-flight club Jagiellonia Bialystok.

They also say two top-flight English clubs have joined West Ham United in making enquiries about 20-year-old left-back Stephen Hendrie.
Accies on Thursday revealed that a £2m transfer to Upton Park had collapsed.
Meanwhile, defender Michael Devlin, 21, has signed a three-year contract extension to remain with Hamilton.
The news came as Accies revealed that defender Martin Canning had been appointed player-manager after a short spell as caretaker, with Chris Swailes joining as assistant and another former Hamilton player, Guillaume Beuzelin, as head coach.
But Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald refused to comment on a reported offer for 26-year-old Falkirk striker Rory Loy.
Loy, who began his career with Rangers, has been with the Scottish Championship club since 2013 after leaving Carlisle United.
MacDonald did reveal that a Chinese club had been in touch about 26-year-old midfielder Tony Andreu but that nothing had come of that interest.
Frenchman Andreu joined Accies in 2013 having previously been with Stade Nyonnais and Livingston.
The 21-year-old Gordon, along with Hendrie and Devlin, is a product of the New Douglas Park youth system.
