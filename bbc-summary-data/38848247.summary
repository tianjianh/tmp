The France right-back, 33, made the remark after his side's 2-1 Premier League win over Burnley on 2 January.
City were reduced to 10 men in the 32nd minute of the match, when referee Lee Mason sent off midfielder Fernandinho.
The Football Association said the post "questioned the integrity of the match official".
Sagna has also been warned about his future conduct.

It is fair to say some senior figures at Manchester City feel Bacary Sagna was pretty harshly dealt with.
The feeling was Sagna has been given no credit for admitting he was wrong to post what he did on social media, nor has any account been taken for the fact he took down the "10 against 12" Instagram post down within an hour of putting it up.
Players and managers are allowed, within reason, to criticise a referee's performance or their decisions provided they do not imply bias, question the official's integrity or make offensive personal comments.
