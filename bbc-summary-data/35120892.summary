Dogfish Menswear was criticised by Levi Jed Murphy on his Facebook page, followed by nearly 416,000 people.
But fellow businesses rallied around the Norwich store and responded with a succession of positive reviews.
Mr Murphy, who said he received "faulty clothing", claimed the store should not have shared details of the incident.

Store manager Levi de Belgeonne, based in The Lanes, said the store had been targeted by a "social media bully".
He said he did not want to speak about Mr Murphy's online criticism, but thanked local businesses for their support.
"The Lanes did just unite and share posts and shine a lot of positive light on the business," he said.
"It would have been a shame if due to a social media bully - in a word - that we would have had that light changed."
The group of independent traders encouraged their followers to help restore Dogfish's star rating after it dived to a one-star average.
The shop received 275 reviews over 24 hours this week.
Mr Murphy, 19, of Norwich, has gained a huge online following for his video posts on observations about life.
On Wednesday, he published a Facebook status encouraging fans to give the shop a "bad review as they sold me faulty clothing and won't refund the money" and said he would then add them as a friend.
Minutes later the store started to receive dozens of one-star reviews and disparaging comments.
In a statement, Mr Murphy said he had not aimed his comments at a "particular person" and denied "bullying".
He said the business "told many people about the situation, which they shouldn't have".
Mr Murphy, who claimed he got a refund on the clothing from the manufacturer, said he had since received "abuse" on his Instagram profile and had deleted his original Facebook status.
