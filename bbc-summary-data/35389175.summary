Souleymane Doukara's left-footed shot and Toumani Diagouraga's swept finish gave Leeds a 2-0 lead their first-half dominance deserved.
Bolton looked out of it until Darren Pratley fired high into the net with 10 minutes to go.
Gary Madine hit a post as the hosts pressed for a late equaliser.
Madine had earlier fired over from inside the six-yard box, shortly after Doukara put Leeds ahead.
That was as close as Bolton came in the first half as Leeds kept their Championship rivals at arms' length.
Wanderers, who are second bottom of the table and beset by financial problems, improved too late to force a replay.
Bolton manager Neil Lennon: "We were way too passive in the first half.

"It was a goalkeeping error for the first goal but our reaction wasn't good after that and I am looking at our senior players.
"It was a good opportunity for us; a great cup tie, a good atmosphere, but you can't give teams 2-0 leads and expect to go through. We nearly resurrected but we didn't work hard enough in the first half."
Leeds boss Steve Evans: "When I arrived Souleymane Doukara felt discarded, didn't feel loved. And that's harsh. I told him he was going to get the biggest opportunity of his life and he is enjoying every minute of it.
"He is going to get fitter and sharper and I don't think there will be many teams who will look forward to playing against the big fella.
"His power and purpose all afternoon was great. He has got a heart the size of Big Ben and I am pleased he is getting these rewards."
