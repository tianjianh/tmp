[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey petrol price increase proposed for transport plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Petrol could increase by 5.5p a litre to pay for changes to Guernsey's transport infrastructure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A year ago the States approved the Environment Department's Integrated Transport Strategy but rejected the main methods for funding it.
The department had suggested introducing paid parking and a vehicle width and emissions tax, but they were rejected after opposition.
The petrol increase will fund bus, cycle and pedestrian infrastructure.
It will also pay for an improved bus service and disability transport measures.
The current average price for a litre of unleaded petrol in Guernsey is about Â£1.08.
Dave Beausire, from the Guernsey motor traders association, said the whole transport strategy should be scrapped and started again.
He said: "We don't have a plan, we don't know what we are getting for our money. This is proof it is all about raising money and is about paying for the bus service.
"Half of what it costs for a litre of petrol in Guernsey is now in taxes and they want to put more on it.
"This is nothing to do with emissions, it is nothing to do with anything but making money."
If States members approve the plans they will be funded by the rises in duty on fuel, bus fares and a banded First Registration Duty based on CO2 emissions.
Politicians will debate the plans in July.
