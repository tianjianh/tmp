[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A union has warned that plans by an airports operator to stop bag and body searches at three of it sites could become a threat to security.

The searches are to end at Highlands and Islands Airports Limited's (Hial) Barra, Tiree and Campbeltown airports from 1 February.
Prospect, which has members among Hial's workforce, wants a delay to allow for a "full consultation".
Hial said it had carried out a thorough review of security procedures.
Prospect negotiator David Avery said: "Prospect believes this change is unreasonable and disproportionate and puts staff and passengers at risk.
"The current regime of security checks was introduced more than ten years ago and has been largely successful.
"But despite the long-standing rules, security staff regularly find passengers carrying prohibited liquids, small knives and in extreme cases, firearms ammunition."
Hial said the move followed a thorough review of security procedures at each of its sites.
It said the new regime would help improve the general passenger experience travelling from the airports to Glasgow, while maintaining appropriate security standards.
