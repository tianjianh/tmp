Election 2015: Leaders in last-ditch bid for votes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Party leaders and candidates are making a last-ditch grab for votes on the final day of campaigning before the general election polls open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron will promise to keep Britain "on the road to a brighter future", while Labour's Ed Miliband will pledge "a government that will put working people first".
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will offer "stability and decency".
Polls suggest no party will win enough seats for an outright majority.
BBC deputy political editor James Landale said politicians, pollsters and the media were struggling to read the election, leading many to focus on what might happen if there is an uncertain result.
"As such, Thursday might not be the end of the process," he said.
"It might just be the calling of the half-time whistle."
In other general election news:
The leaders have been criss-crossing the country in their battle buses as they attempt to drum up support ahead of Thursday's poll.
Mr Cameron is heading to north west England, Scotland and the Midlands, while Mr Miliband is visiting Conservative-held marginal seats in the north of England.
Mr Clegg, who set off from Land's End on Tuesday, is heading to John O'Groats through Scottish constituencies his party is hoping to retain.
The prime minister, whose Conservative Party won 307 seats in 2010, will renew his attack on the possibility of a minority Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party (SNP) and try to dissuade voters tempted by the Liberal Democrats or UKIP.
The British people will make "their most important decision for a generation", he will say.
"When you go into the polling booth tomorrow - know this: your vote really can make a difference.
"You can deliver a stable government and have a secure future, but only if you vote Conservative and for me as your prime minister."
What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Mr Miliband is looking to improve on the 258 seats Labour won in 2010 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
He will say voters face a "clear choice" between "a government that puts working people first, or one that works for the privileged few".
He will accuse the Conservatives of having run a "desperate, negative campaign", saying Labour are "the ones with the momentum as we enter the final straight".
Mr Clegg, whose Liberal Democrats are battling to keep hold of the 57 seats they won five years ago, will visit marginal Scottish seats under threat from the SNP, telling voters: "You face the biggest political decision of your life."
He has sought to position his party as keeping any future coalition government "anchored" in the centre ground.
Without the Lib Dems, he will say, "Labour or the Conservatives will be left to run a messy and unstable minority government, dependent on the SNP on the one hand or UKIP and the DUP on the other".
The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, who has dominated many of the headlines of this campaign and is forecast to take a number of seats from Labour in Scotland, will make her final speech in Edinburgh later.
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, UKIP's Mark Reckless, one of two former Conservative MPs to defect to Nigel Farage's party in the last parliament, said he would be disappointed if UKIP did not win "four or five" seats.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, whose party is looking to add to the one seat it won in 2010, will make a speech in Bristol where she will stress her determination to "keep the Tories out of government and keep Labour in line".
