Police in Edinburgh have released CCTV of men they wish to identify in connection with an assault and robbery on York Place.

It happened at about 03:05 on 7 December when a 22-year-old man and a 21-year-old man were walking on York Place, just west of Conan Doyle pub.
The men were both punched to the ground and the attackers took the 22-year-old victim's jacket.
They then made off on foot, heading east along York Place.
Police are now looking to speak to the men in the images.
One of the men in the CCTV images is white, in his mid 20s, 5ft 10ins tall, of stocky build, with short light brown hair and was wearing a bright pink jumper and dark trousers.
Another man is white, of slim build, 5ft 9ins, 20 to 25 years old, with short dark gelled hair. He was wearing a black jacket.
A third man is white, of medium build, 5ft 10ins, 20 to 30 years old, with short dark hair, wearing a brown blazer, black t-shirt and dark trousers.
Det Con Stevie Herd, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a completely unprovoked assault and robbery and anyone who recognises the men in these images is asked to contact police."
