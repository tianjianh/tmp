Panasonic has revealed the capabilities of its revived Technics turntables at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.

Two Technics SL-1200 models were unveiled - one of which is limited to a run of 1,200 units - marking the first update in years to the brand.
Panasonic has said the launch was inspired by a resurgence in vinyl record sales.
The production of Technics turntables had ceased in 2010.
At the time, some audiophiles and DJs had expressed disappointment over the well known brand's discontinuation.
But in September last year, Panasonic said that Technics would return.
The decision to halt the production of Technics turntables five years ago was a "strange" one, according to Andy Clough, editor of What Hi-Fi magazine.
"They had a fantastic brand with a huge heritage," he said. "From our point of view [the re-launch is] really exciting, it's a sort of update if you like on an iconic turntable - something of a legend amongst DJs and hi-fi people."
Mr Clough commented that while there was a resurgence in vinyl sales, the boom should be viewed in context.
"It's still very much a niche thing - albeit a growing niche," he said.
The refreshed models boast a number of mechanical improvements.
Panasonic has included a new motor in the updated turntable, which is designed to be quieter and less prone to vibrations than previous models. The result is, the firm claims, better sound quality.
Both editions will be released later in 2016 with the 50th Anniversary model, the Grand Class SL-1200GAE, being made available this summer in a limited edition run.
Retro audio formats aren't the only nostalgic tech featuring at CES this year.
Kodak has also announced an initiative to revive the Super 8 film format and is presenting a prototype of a new Kodak Super 8 camera.
It features digital functionality - including an LCD screen allowing users to frame and view recorded scenes live.
The company's initiative has already garnered support from top Hollywood directors including Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and Steve McQueen - all of whom have praised the qualities of Super 8 film.
There are no details on when Kodak's new camera might be released - or what it would cost - but the company has said it has developed a roadmap for eventually producing a new range of Super 8 devices as well as film development services.
