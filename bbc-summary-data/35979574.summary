PC Amar Tasaddiq Hussain, 29, is one of three men accused of conspiring to make a bogus call to West Midlands Police.
He denies two counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Adil Bashir, 26,  and Muhammad Ali Sheikh, 31, have also denied the charges at Stafford Crown Court.
Opening the trial, prosecutor Simon Davis said West Midlands Police put "unprecedented measures" in place following the call on 8 December 2014.
All police staff were forced to report they had got home safely, which Mr Davis likened to a roll call at a school.
He told the jury: "The police listened to that call. They took it extremely seriously."
"They saw the content of the call as a credible threat to the security and safety of a police officer who may be kidnapped that evening - they had six hours to put procedures in place to minimise the threat and maximise the security and safety of all police staff," he added.
The court was played the call in which a man can be heard saying: "I have been asked to drive the car which they are going to kidnap the police officer in and put him in the back, I have been told to drive off because I am a very good driver."
The caller refuses to give his personal details to the call handler when asked for fear he will "possibly be killed".
The prosecution claim Mr Hussain, from Yardley, plotted with Mr Bashir of Small Heath and Mr Sheikh from Bordesley Green, to incriminate members of Dawat-E-Islami, a peaceful Muslim prayer group, who he held a grudge against.
The trial continues.
