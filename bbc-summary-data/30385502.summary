[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macaw parrot found on Caerphilly Mountain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a macaw parrot found on Caerphilly Mountain is being urged to come forward by the RSPCA.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animal welfare charity said it was unusual that nobody had come forward to claim the bird since it was found on Friday.
The RSPCA has not issued a photograph of the bird as it wants the owner to describe its striking colours before it will be handed over.
A spokesperson said the birds can be worth a lot of money.
Anyone who may have information can contact the RSPCA appeal line on 0300 123 8018.
