[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Lowe scored his fifth goal of the season as Crewe battled back to draw 1-1 with Blackpool.

The Railwaymen extended their unbeaten run to four league games after the striker's header cancelled out Jon Guthrie's early own goal.
Blackpool were given a helping hand when the defender headed Andy Taylor's cross into the top corner of his net in the 10th minute.
Crewe's response saw Zoumana Bakayogo fire past the far post and George Cooper force Sam Slocombe into a good save to keep out his free kick.
Crewe keeper Ben Garratt was fortunate when he miscued his clearance under pressure from Kyle Vassell, whose header was cleared off the line by Harry Davis.
Steve Davis' side survived another goal-line clearance, this time from Ollie Turton, who kept out Armand Gnanduillet's header from a corner.
Lowe had a 39th-minute effort ruled out for offside, but was not to be denied after Blackpool keeper Slocombe had gone off with a groin injury at the break.
Stand-in stopper Dean Lyness' first meaningful action was to pick the ball out of the net after Lowe's bullet header connected with Cooper's cross and crashed into the far corner for Crewe's 71st-minute leveller.
Lowe curled a right-footed shot onto the far post and Lyness blocked Cooper's shot as Crewe finished the strongest.
