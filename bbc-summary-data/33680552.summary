Four workers at Wood Treatment Ltd in Bosley, Cheshire, were unaccounted for after the 17 July blast. It caused the collapse of a four-storey building.
Cheshire Police said the remains were removed and taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital for a post-mortem examination.
Derek Moore, 62, has been identified as one of the victims.
Two other bodies recovered last week are thought to be those of William Barks, 51, and Dorothy Bailey, 62. Formal identification is yet to take place.
The search for their colleague, Jason Shingler, 38, continued over the weekend.
Temperatures reached 1,000C in the blast and it was described by rescuers as the "worst incident of its kind" in a decade.
An investigation into the cause of the explosion continues.
Wood is processed at the plant into a fine powder and the resulting "wood flour", with a consistency like sand, is used to make laminate flooring.
