Sex exploitation course: Taxi drivers 'could lose licence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eleven taxi drivers in Denbighshire face being suspended or losing their licences for failing to attend a sexual exploitation course.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All drivers in the county were ordered to attend the training after the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal inquiry found taxi drivers had played a "prominent role" in the abuse.
More than 300, about 97%, attended.
Denbighshire council will decide on Tuesday whether to take action against those who did not.
A report to the council said five current taxi drivers were not licensed at the time.
Of the six others, one was not able to attend as he had another day job, and another was out of the country.
Councillors' options include revoking or suspending their licences, considering their renewal applications or convening a special hearing.
