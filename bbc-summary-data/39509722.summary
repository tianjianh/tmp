Paul Clement: Swansea City boss says time running out to avoid the drop

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement says his side are running out of time in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation.

The Swans dropped back into the bottom three after losing to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday - their third defeat in their last four games.
Clement's side were leading 1-0 after 88 minutes but a remarkable late turnaround saw Spurs triumph 3-1.
"The fact we've come out with nothing is heart-breaking," said Clement.
He continued: "The players know the situation. We're in the bottom three and there are seven games to go, and West Ham [Swansea's next opponents] are a team who've had their own troubles recently so we have to go there believing we can get a result.
"We need to get a result, especially in the next two games because the games are running out now."
While Tottenham's stunning victory kept alive their title challenge, defeat at the Liberty Stadium was a damaging blow to Swansea's hopes of survival.
Their misery was compounded by a win for relegation rivals Hull over Middlesbrough, which leaves the Swans 18th in the Premier League table and two points adrift of safety.
They are five points behind West Ham, who are in 15th place, and Clement is hopeful of having top scorer Fernando Llorente back from an ankle injury in time for Saturday's game against the Hammers.
"Things are very tight still. There are seven games to go and a lot of points to play for," Clement added.
"We have to be encouraged by our performance for long periods of that game. The players put in a good physical effort and we have to dust ourselves off and go again - we have to be professional.
"We have to know how to deal with defeat and go again on Saturday."
