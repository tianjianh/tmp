Tom Youngs: Leicester hooker banned for punching

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester hooker Tom Youngs has been banned for one week for punching Stade Francais' Rabah Slimani during last weekend's European Champions Cup match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Youngs, 28, will miss the trip to Gloucester on Saturday.
The suspension was reduced from two weeks to one in light of his previously clean disciplinary record.
Director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "Tom understands he needs to be a little more disciplined in that scenario."
