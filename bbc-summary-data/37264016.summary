[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny Rowe scored the game's only goal after 21 minutes when he unleashed a superb left-footed strike when he was given time to shoot.
Bromley came close to cancelling out Rowe's goal - his second in as many games - as Tobi Sho-Silva headed against the crossbar before Rob Swaine hit a post shortly after half-time.
Macc defender John McCombe was also needed to clear a Blair Turgott shot off the line as the visitors claimed a win to move them three points behind new leaders Lincoln.
