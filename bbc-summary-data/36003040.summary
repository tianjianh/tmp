Peterborough earned a comfortable win at Colchester United to increase the hosts' League One relegation worries.

Jon Taylor fired the visitors ahead early on, before Colchester's George Moncur had a penalty saved by Ben Alnwick following Ricardo Santos' foul on Elliot Lee.
Lee hit the post after the break, but goals from Andrew Fox and Shaquile Coulthirst extended Posh's lead.
Moncur reduced the arrears before Marcus Maddison added Posh's fourth.
The U's are now nine points adrift of safety with four games left to play, while Graham Westley's Peterborough are mathematically assured of safety in 14th place.
