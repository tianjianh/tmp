The "severe" blaze ripped through the office area of a car parts warehouse by The Fort shopping centre off the M6 and was tackled by 100 firefighters.
The fire in Wingfoot Way broke out at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday and was put out at about 23:45. About 20 firefighters remain at the scene.
Nobody was injured in the fire and it did not spread to a tyre storage area.
West Midlands Fire Service had warned people living nearby to close windows and doors.
Dean Stubbins turned up for his nightshift at the nearby DHL warehouse and saw the flames.
He said: "There was heavy traffic around the area due to road closures. The cause is unknown but it started above the offices on the rooftop.
"I saw a major incidents truck from the fire service. I was meant to be on a night shift but no-one got a message to say don't turn up.
"The site is one of the sequence centres for Jaguar Land Rover. The offices are used by Dunlop tyres."
