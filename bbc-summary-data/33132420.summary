Seven Saints of St Pauls: Murals honour black Bristolians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Key people who shaped Bristol's black community are to be immortalised in seven murals on prominent walls around the St Pauls area of the city.

It is the idea of local artist Michele Curtis who plans to first stage an exhibition featuring the people she calls the Seven Saints of St Pauls.
Portraits include the St Pauls Carnival founders and those who led the 1963 Bristol bus boycott.
Ms Curtis said the idea was to celebrate their legacy.
"Black history in Bristol stretches far beyond its roots in the slave trade, although we are constantly reminded of the merchants and slave owners of Bristol through the prominent naming of streets, (Guinea Street) buildings (Colston Tower) and statues (Edward Colston)," she said.
The approaching 50th anniversary of the St Pauls Carnival in 2018 inspired Ms Curtis to come up with the idea.
"St Pauls has such a bad reputation - I want to change the perception that nobody and nothing good has come out of here," said Ms Curtis.
Positive initial discussions have been held with Bristol City Council and housing associations to paint the murals on houses or prominent buildings along the route of the carnival procession.
"Having these murals up in the air is a conversation with your child on the way to school - it's knowledge, history, fun," said Ms Curtis.
"People will ask who they are and why their portrait is on the wall."
