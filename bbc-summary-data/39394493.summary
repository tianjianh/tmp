Misconduct hearings for Sheffield train protest officers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five police officers are facing misconduct hearings over their handling of a demonstration by pensioners at a South Yorkshire train station.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Protesters angry at cuts to free travel for the elderly staged a demonstration at Sheffield station in June 2014.
Following an investigation, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said four officers had cases to answer for misconduct.
It said a fifth officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct.
A spokesperson for the IPCC said: "The IPCC received a number of appeals following a British Transport Police investigation into complaints about officers' actions during and following a protest at Sheffield Railway Station in June 2014.
"The IPCC reviewed the force's investigation and found there was evidence to indicate that three police officers and a police community support officer had cases to answer for misconduct, and a fifth officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct.
"The IPCC directed the force to hold appropriate disciplinary proceedings for these individuals, which will take place in due course."
The misconduct hearings are expected to take place in May and June.
Two protesters were charged with obstructing the police following the demonstration but they were later dropped.
