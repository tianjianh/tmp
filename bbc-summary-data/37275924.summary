In a coffee shop in Brodie, a small community a few miles from Forres, are sat two people who made different selections in the referendum.
Bob Hellyer, 72, served with the RAF and now runs a computer business.
"I voted for Leave and the main reason was politics," he says.
"I am old enough to remember when we joined the Common Market. The Common Market was very simply a method of common trade between countries.
"While I was away in Canada some years ago we decided to join each other politically.
"That was a mistake. I am not in favour of being in the same political union as Germany, France etc."
Mr Hellyer adds: "We did have a Common Market as is described and then went into a political union and it became what it is today."
Housewife Rachel Miller voted to stay in the EU, saying that she trusted the arguments of Scottish political leaders who said that was the best option.
She says Leave voters who want a single market, but also border control "want to have their cake and eat it, and then another cake as well".
"It is the height of arrogance," she says of this argument.
"It will be interesting to see what does actually happen now," says Mrs Miller, though she does not believe Brexit will create new opportunities.
"In the three weeks up to the vote I thought 'yes, I'll vote to stay in' then started to think maybe I should be thinking more about this."
On why she made her final choice, she says: "I voted for what the girls were saying - Nicola (Sturgeon), Ruth (Davidson) and Kezia Dugdale."
