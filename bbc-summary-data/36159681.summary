India's government is drawing up plans to publish a register of convicted sex offenders, a minister has said.

Junior minister of home affairs Kiren Rijiju said "guidelines are under preparation in consultation with various ministries".
The move comes amid widespread demands for tougher action on sexual violence, more than three years since the fatal rape of a student in Delhi.
The incident led to protests and the introduction of tough anti-rape laws.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported from across the country.
The planned register includes a wide range of details about convicted sex offenders, including names, addresses, telephone numbers and current photographs.
Relevant crimes range from stalking and voyeurism to rape and aggravated sexual assault. Child offenders will also be included.
"It will instil fear in the minds of repeat sexual offenders and the public would be benefited from it," another junior minister for home affairs Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhury said.
Officials say the plans are at an early stage and will be offered for public consultation.
