Martyn Hett, 29, from Stockport, was at the Ariana Grande gig with a friend when they became separated.
His brother Dan said on Twitter: "They found my brother last night. We are heartbroken."
Pop superstar Mariah Carey, whom Mr Hett was a fan of, has paid tribute to him saying: "We will cherish your memory forever."
The US singer posted a photo of Mr Hett wearing a fan T-shirt to her Instagram account, saying: "Devastated to learn that one of the victims in Manchester was part of the #Lambily. RIP Martyn Hett.
"We will cherish your memory forever. His family and all the families affected are in my thoughts and prayers. MC"
Mr Hett was a Coronation Street superfan and was interviewed on television about his tattoo of the character Deirdre Barlow.
Jennie McAlpine, who plays Fiz Brown in the soap, described him as a "beautiful soul".
She told BBC 5 live: "He was an extremely fun-loving, unique person... he was a delight."
She said the Coronation Street cast "wanted to send all our love to his family and the families of all the people that have died and that are in hospital".
Mr Hett attended Priestnall High School in Heaton Mersey, Stockport, graduating in 2005.
Paying tribute, his family said: "Martyn was the icon of all our lives. His infectious laugh and his niche sense of humour will stay with us forever.
"He lived for every moment of every day and fitted an entire lifetime of memories into his 29 years.
"Whilst they have taken the life out of Martyn, no one can, and ever will, take Martyn out of our lives."
His partner Russell Hayward said on Twitter: "We got the news last night that our wonderful iconic and beautiful Martyn didn't survive.
"He left this world exactly how he lived, centre of attention."
He left his role at a PR firm in Altrincham last week to take two months off to travel around the US.
His colleagues said he loved life, celebrated it every day and "packed it to the brim with his passions".
In 2016 he was featured in a Buzzfeed interview when he took to Twitter to promote his mother's handmade items at a craft fair, after she told him nobody was buying anything.
Mr Hett, from the Heaton Moor area of Stockport, was among 22 people who were killed in the explosion at Manchester Arena on Monday night.
A further 59 people, including children, were injured and taken to hospital after the concert.
