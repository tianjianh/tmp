However, Adlene Guedioura is close to a first-team return after recovering from a groin strain.
Southampton boss Claude Puel may include striker Charlie Austin, who has been out since December with a dislocated shoulder.
Defender Matt Targett could also make his return after a long-term absence.
John Roder: "Back in August, I was at the Riverside for Match of the Day for Middlesbrough's return to the Premier League. Following the 1-1 draw with Stoke there was an optimistic view that Boro could avoid an immediate return to the Championship, where they had spent the previous seven seasons.
"Nine months later relegation was confirmed at Chelsea on Monday, with Middlesbrough having won only five times in 36 league matches.
"Sofiane Boufal scored a wonderful goal for Saints when these teams met at St Mary's in December.
"However, goals have been at a premium for Boro all season and just recently for Southampton, who have to regain their scoring touch to ensure a top-10 finish. "

Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "After the disappointment of the other night, it has been an emotional time and understandably so, and I am no different. I feel responsibility for what has happened.
"But it's not about my future, it's not about my situation, it's about Middlesbrough Football Club.
"It's about us understanding where we are, it's about how we finish strongly in these last couple of games and then we regroup, have a good summer and make sure that we're in the fight to bounce back to the Premier League as quickly as we possibly can."
Southampton manager Claude Puel: "There's the possibility to finish in the first part of the table and that is very important to us.
"If we can have a good result against Middlesbrough, we can prepare for our last two games at home with good possibilities, good intensity."
Let's give Claude Puel some credit for what he has done in his first season at Southampton, because he has been without some key players for long periods, on top of the talent that left the club in the summer and then in January too.
Saints have still always been comfortable in mid-table, and reached the final of the League Cup.
Middlesbrough, meanwhile, went down with a whimper.
