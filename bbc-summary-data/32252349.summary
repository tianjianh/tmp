Music mogul Pete Waterman has re-launched a steam engine which first worked in a north Wales quarry in 1885.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Winifred engine, which began its working life at the Penrhyn Quarry in Bethesda, has been restored by Bala Lake Railway.
Railway enthusiast Mr Waterman performed the re-launch at Llanuwchllyn Station on what is the engine's 130th anniversary.
Winifred will now be used to pull people in carriages rather than slate.
