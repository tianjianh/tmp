Lazio 0-2 Napoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Napoli remain two points clear at the top of Serie A after beating Lazio in a game suspended due to racist chanting.

Play was stopped for about three minutes in the second half after home fans aimed racist abuse at Napoli's Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly.
Referee Massimiliano Irrati opted to play on after consulting with players, coaches and officials.
Two first-half goals from Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon ensured Napoli remain ahead of Juventus.
"I would not have stopped the match," said Lazio manager Stefano Pioli. "It was chanting from the minority, but I don't think they were racist."
In 2013, AC Milan players Kevin-Prince Boateng and Mario Balotelli were the victims of offensive chanting in two separate matches.
Elsewhere on Wednesday, Juventus secured their 13th consecutive league win with a 1-0 home victory over Genoa.
Juan Cuadrado scored the only goal of the game.
Match ends, Lazio 0, Napoli 2.
Second Half ends, Lazio 0, Napoli 2.
