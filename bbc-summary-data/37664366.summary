[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-2 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers showed their promotion credentials with a hard-fought victory at Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pirates, who are now unbeaten in four games, sealed the points with goals from on-loan Chelsea duo Charlie Colkett and Jake Clarke-Salter.
Rovers full-back Lee Brown almost made the breakthrough when his skimming drive forced a low save from Oldham goalkeeper Connor Ripley.
The visitors deservedly went ahead on 25 minutes as Oldham only half-cleared a corner and, from 16 yards, Colkett smashed a powerful drive just inside the post.
Oldham were being outplayed in all areas, with their defence again pulled apart when Colkett wasted a first-half chance to double the lead.
It was a more even contest after the break, though Rovers goalkeeper Kelle Roos was not tested until the 65th minute when he beat away Lee Erwin's free-kick.
Roos also saved a 30-yard strike from Ryan Flynn as Oldham enjoyed their brightest spell.
But Rovers secured the win in the 87th minute when Clarke-Salter headed in from six yards.
