Scherzinger has held the role since 2013, and met some of Britain's athletes at an event at Lee Valley in north London last week.
"It's such an inspiration when I watch the athletes compete because they are so proud of their medals," she told BBC Sport. "They give it their all and take great pride in what they do."
More than 7,000 athletes from 160 different countries took part in the last Special Olympics, in Los Angeles in 2015.
Scherzinger is also an X Factor judge, and is going to Sunday's north London derby with the show's host Dermot O'Leary, an Arsenal fan. She is predicting a close game.
"In the United Kingdom, you are obsessed with football," the American told BBC Sport. "It is the same in the United States, just a different kind of football. I had the honour recently to sing the national anthem for one of the NFL games held in London.
"I love soccer, as we call it. I think it is awesome. I love how it brings people together and is all about spirit and the fight, but I don't really know much about it."
