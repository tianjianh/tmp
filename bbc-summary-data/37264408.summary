[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Mayor's second-half brace handed Bury a last-gasp victory at home to Shrewsbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Each side finished with 10 men as Bury striker James Vaughan and Shrewsbury centre-half Adam El-Abd were sent off either side of the break with the score still goalless.
Mayor then broke the deadlock with a 65th minute strike and although Ivan Toney levelled with a quarter of an hour remaining, Mayor struck again at the start of stoppage time to make it back-to-back home wins for the Shakers.
Bury had the better of the opening stages, with Zeli Ismail jinking down the right before cutting back for Mayor, who sidefooted just wide.
Ismail then played a one-two with Jacob Mellis and cut back for Vaughan, whose goalbound effort was blocked by Jack Grimmer.
Vaughan and El-Abd then clashed on 39 minutes, with both players being booked, and just two minutes later Vaughan caught El-Abd late, resulting in a second yellow card.
El-Abd followed him off on 52 minutes after bundling over Mayor for a second yellow, and shortly after the latter cut in from the left before firing into the top corner.
Shrewsbury replied as Joe Riley crossed for Toney to beat goalkeeper Ben Williams in the air and head home, but Mayor pounced from close range to seal victory at the death.
