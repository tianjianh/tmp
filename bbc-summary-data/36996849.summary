County Championship: Somerset race to win over Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset took five wickets in 22 balls on the third morning to complete an astonishing 39-run win over Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham began day three at Taunton on 130-5, needing 46 runs to win with five wickets in hand - but they collapsed to 136 all out in just 17 minutes.
Jack Leach (4-46) struck twice in the first over, dismissing Graham Onions and Paul Coughlin in consecutive balls.
Stuart Poynter fell in Leach's next over, before Roelof van der Merwe removed Mark Wood and Chris Rushworth.
The spinner's two wickets in two balls to wrap up the win gave him figures of 4-45.
Somerset are up to second in Division One as it stands, three points behind leaders Middlesex, and have leapfrogged Durham, who slip to third.
BBC Newcastle's Martin Emmerson
"As capitulations go this was right up there from Durham and was dreadful to see.
"Durham coach Jon Lewis says he can't blame his players for what happened, but on a pitch which offered excessive turn from the first morning they should have had an idea of what was likely to come.
"Chris Rogers, the Somerset captain, says the pitch was too dry and the groundsman didn't quite get it right. Ironically, it is now getting a drenching as I write this - but it offered plenty for Durham's seam bowlers too.
"Whether the umpires feel the need to report it is another matter. It was a bizarre match that featured 13 ducks and no score above 200. Make of that what you will."
