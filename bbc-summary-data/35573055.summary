Top seed Williams, 35, overcame the Japanese player to claim the 49th title of her 21-year professional career.
The American, who exited the Australian Open at the first-round stage in January, did not drop a set during the tournament in Kaohsiung.
Williams broke her second-seeded opponent three times in each set to win the final in one hour and 26 minutes.
Williams' latest victory leaves her seventh on the all-time list of tournament wins in women's singles.
Martina Navratilova leads the way on 167 titles, while Venus' younger sister, world number one Serena Williams, has 69 career tournament victories.
