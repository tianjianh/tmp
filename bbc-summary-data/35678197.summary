Inquest into Donegal crash deaths returns verdict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the deaths of eight men killed in a crash in County Donegal in 2010 has returned a verdict of unlawful death as a result of dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven friends in a car being driven by Shaun Kelly died in the crash at Meenaduff on 11 July 2010.
Hugh Friel, 66, a pensioner returning from bingo died in the other vehicle when Kelly crashed into him.
Coroner Dr John Madden said the tragedy had shocked the whole country and news of it even travelled across the globe.
He said the inquest would not solve anything for the families, but he hoped it would be one less hurdle to help them get on with the rest of their lives.
The families of some of the eight men killed expressed their frustration with the remit of the Coroner's Court after the verdict.
The inquest was beset by legal arguments throughout over the involvement of a third vehicle on the night of the incident.
The inquest heard that Kelly's car had earlier collided with a Renault Megane being driven by a 62-year-old woman.
There were a number of legal arguments over which side of the road the woman's car was on.
The passengers in Kelly's car were 21-year-old Mark McLaughlin, from Fahan; Paul Doherty and Ciaran Sweeney who were 19 and from Ballyliffin; Patrick McLaughlin, 21, from Burnfoot; 22-year-old Eamonn McDaid and 21-year-old Damien McLaughlin, both from Buncrana, and James McEleney, 23, from Clonmany.
Last December, Kelly, 25, of Hill Road in Buncrana had his sentence for causing the deaths doubled to eight years.
