People living close to the tip at Long Lane, Great Heck, North Yorkshire, have said their health is being affected.
Sarah Webster has three children, aged three, six and eight, and said they had all been "really poorly" due to the smell.
The tip was run by Wagstaff TWM Ltd which has gone into liquidation, the Environment Agency said.
The agency said it was investigating alleged waste offences and monitoring the odour from the site, near the M62 motorway, that stockpiled mixed recyclable waste.
It said any health concerns should be discussed with a general practitioner.
It is thought there could be more than 10,000 tonnes of rotting rubbish that could cost Â£1m in landfill tax to dispose of.
Graham Brocklesby, the owner of the site, said: "We need some help... whoever can lighten the impact of the cost that is going to be incurred here."
Laura Watkinson-Teo, a campaigner, said the smell was "awful, pungent and it lingers - you get a sensation at the back of your throat and it's nauseating."
During a visit to the site Nigel Adams, Conservative MP for Selby, said the smell was "absolutely rancid".
It was "altogether unacceptable as well as unpleasant", he added.
No one from the business was available for comment.
According to its website the company is a "responsible and professional total waste management company".
