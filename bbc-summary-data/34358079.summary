A wooden statue created with the help of school children in Wrexham has been stolen hours before it was to be unveiled on Friday.

The 2m-high (6ft 6in) oak sculpture of a scarecrow, carved from a tree trunk, was taken from Caia Woods after it was put in place in Thursday.
The artwork, by tree carver Simon O'Rourke, was funded by environment body Natural Resources Wales.
Wrexham councillor David Bithell described the theft as disappointing.
Mr O'Rouke, who carved the statue over two-and-a-half days, said the theft was "very sad".
"The children had been very involved in choosing the design and it's a real shame that they haven't been able to see it," he said.
"I just don't understand how it can be of any value to anyone other than those it was meant for.
"It's not the sort of thing that you could take down to pub and sell it on the side.  It's completely mindless."
