The parade through the city centre was part of the International Association of Women Police (IAWP) conference, which also celebrates its centenary.
Ahead of the event, South Wales Police launched an appeal to find the family of one of its first women officers, WPC1 Elsie Joan Baldwin.
Her relatives were among those to attend the event on Sunday.
South Wales Police's Ass Chf Cons Nikki Holland said the conference recognised the "huge contribution that women make towards policing" and was a place to discuss local and international issues and share best practice.
As well as tracing WPC1 Elsie Baldwin's family, the force has discovered more information about her fellow female colleagues.
ACC Holland added: "I believe that these women whose families we have met were incredible, not only having served in World War Two but also were among the first women to police south Wales leading the way for women, including myself, to forge a career in the police."
South Wales Police - formed after the Glamorgan Constabulary merged with Cardiff, Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil police forces - is hosting the International Association of Women in Policing training conference from 23-27 August.
