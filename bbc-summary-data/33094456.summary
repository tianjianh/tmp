A mother who has vanished with her young son to avoid a custody ruling "can't keep hiding away", the police chief leading the search has said.

Rebecca Minnock, 35, and three-year-old Ethan, from Somerset, have been missing for more than two weeks.
Det Ch Insp Marie Wright appealed to Miss Minnock to contact her directly and told the BBC staying in hiding "isn't in Ethan's best interests".
Miss Minnock contacted The Sun to say both she and Ethan are "safe and well".
She told the newspaper she had "lost all trust and faith in the system completely" following a custody ruling that Ethan should live with his father.
The pair have since been seen in Cheltenham and Birmingham where the police effort is now believed to be focused.
Det Ch Insp Wright, of Avon and Somerset Police, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she believed Ethan was safe and that Miss Minnock was a "good mother".
In a direct appeal to the mother she said: "It isn't in Ethan's best interests to carry on hiding like this and I'm more than happy to have some personal conversations with her about how we can bring this matter to a close."
"She can't keep hiding from this process - where is it going to end?"
Meanwhile a statement issued on behalf of Ethan's father has been released, requesting privacy.  It adds: "This is a very difficult time for Roger Williams and his family.
"The welfare and safe return of his only child, Ethan, is understandably his priority."
Police believe Miss Minnock and Ethan, from Highbridge, are staying with family or friends, some of whom have already been brought before a judge accused of withholding information.
Andrew Butt - the former partner of Miss Minnock's mother Louise - was earlier served with a "collection order" for Ethan at Bristol Crown Court - requiring him to bring the boy to the court or pass on any information that might help find him.
At a previous court hearing, Louise Minnock confirmed Mr Butt owned a black Ford Focus and said that neither she nor her daughter drove.
Rebecca Minnock was seen withdrawing cash in Highbridge on the morning of her disappearance before getting into a black Ford Focus which is believed to have been driven to Cheltenham, where she has family.
Judge Stephen Wildblood QC told Mr Butt: "I require absolute truthfulness as to what has been going on. My powers are to imprison you, fine you or seize your assets for contempt of court."
The judge told the court that Ethan's father was not present because he had run out of money.
"He has been legally represented at his own cost through these proceedings which have gone on for a long time," he said.
"He has left the immediate area because of the reaction that there has been to these proceedings."
Ethan has lived with his mother since his parents separated in February 2013.
On 27 May, a district judge ruled Ethan should live with Mr Williams after finding Miss Minnock had made false allegations and obstructed contact between the father and son. He had been spending four nights a week with his father and three with Miss Minnock following a court hearing in February.
A child psychiatrist had recommended that Ethan should live with his father and have supervised contact with his mother - a view shared by a social worker and a guardian.
Judge Wildblood stressed on Thursday:  "I think it is important to put right, so the public can understand, the seriousness with which the court takes in approaching the task of ensuring that both parents, if at all possible, maintain an effective relationship with the child."
