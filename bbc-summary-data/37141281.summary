McKeon, who won four medals in Rio, was disciplined after failing to return to the Olympic Village on Tuesday following a night out with team-mates.
The 22-year-old had chosen to stay with swimming friends in the Copa district without informing team management.
Fellow Australian swimmer Josh Palmer is still banned.
Palmer, who was fifth in his 100m breaststroke heat, headed to a beach kiosk with a friend and continued drinking. He claimed he was approached by a man who forced him to withdraw $1,000 in cash from a nearby machine.
McKeon, who won 4x100m freestyle relay gold, had sent Australia's chef de mission Kitty Chiller a hand-written letter requesting her ban be lifted.
Chiller told a news conference: "The tone and content of her letter, and her conversation with me, proved to me that she now very much understands the seriousness of our safety protocols.
McKeon's brother, David, who was fifth in the men's 400m freestyle in Rio, later tweeted: "Get to walk with my sister Emma McKeon at the closing."
McKeon and Palmer had been banned by the Australia Olympic Committee from participating in the closing ceremony on Sunday and subjected to a curfew between 8pm and 8am.
They had apologised for their behaviour.
The swimmers were in a group that left a nightclub in Copacabana in the early hours of the morning, with their team-mates heading back to the village and not breaking any rules.
Australian officials have imposed a 2am curfew on all their athletes for the remainder of the Games.
