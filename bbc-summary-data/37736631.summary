[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ash Hunter scored a late volley to help Fleetwood overcome Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sides cancelled each other out in the opening exchanges before a dazzling run from Kyle Dempsey opened up a slumbering Gills defence.
The on-loan Huddersfield midfielder's shot looked to be heading for the far corner, with David Ball sticking out a leg in a crowded box to see it home.
It was the only real chance for either side in a drab and occasionally ugly first 45 minutes - which threatened to boil over when Chris Herd was booked on the stroke of half time after an elbow on Ball.
Gillingham's only opportunity came when Frank Nouble battered his way into the box, a low blast held comfortably by Chris Neal.
The visitors did find a way through early in the second half. Fleetwood struggled to clear their lines from a corner with Jake Hessenthaler firing home from the edge of the area.
Chris Long very nearly put the hosts back in front, timing his run perfectly to race onto speculative punt by keeper Neal, but his shot dragged across the face and was tipped wide.
Fleetwood had a better chance still when substitute Hunter sprang Jimmy Ryan on a breakaway, the return ball too heavy for Hunter to be able to take advantage.
Hunter was rewarded with eight minutes left after Conor McLaughlin fed him at the near post to volley home his fifth of the campaign.
