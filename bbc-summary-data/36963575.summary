The 18-year-old helped the Brewers win automatic promotion from League One last season during a three-month loan.
"We've agreed a deal in principal but it's not signed. The bones are there. We hope it will be done by Saturday," boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby.
"He is still only 18 years old so he'll have the advantage of enthusiasm."
