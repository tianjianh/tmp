Cornwall Council backs a sky lantern ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornwall Council has supported a proposal to ban sky lanterns from being released.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members backed a motion put forward by Mevagissey councillor James Mustoe against the small wire and paper balloons.
Countryside campaigners say the items present a fire risk and are a danger to wildlife and livestock, as well as being mistaken for distress flares.
Plymouth City Council has also banned the practice.
