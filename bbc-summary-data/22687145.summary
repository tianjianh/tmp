Bristol petition against parking zones sparks debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 4,000 people have signed a petition against plans to expand residents' parking zones in Bristol, sparking a full council debate.

The petition, set-up by Michael Owen, is calling for Bristol City Council to halt the controversial proposals.
Mayor Ferguson has said he wants to roll out 18 residents' parking zones (RPZ) within the next 18 months.
The authority said the debate could take place during the next full council meeting on 18 June.
Petition author Mr Owen said he was delighted with the widespread attention his petition had received across the city.
"The reason I set the petition up is that I felt there was a lack of clarity over the price of residents' parking and the spaces available - we just don't know what it's going to mean," he said.
"I would prefer to see it completely scrapped."
At present the scheme operates in the Cotham, Kingsdown, and central areas of the city.
Last week Mayor George Ferguson deferred the final decision until the end of June, saying he was prepared to adjust the scheme following further consultation with residents and businesses.
The plans went before a scrutiny panel on Tuesday as a body of councillors was tasked with looking over the proposals and commenting on whether further work was needed.
