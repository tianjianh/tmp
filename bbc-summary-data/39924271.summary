David Murphy: Northants wicketkeeper faces layoff after back surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northants wicketkeeper David Murphy will miss what the club describe as "a large chunk" of the season because of a lower back injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotland international, 27, had an operation last week to repair a disc.
It is hoped that Murphy may be able to return to action in August.
"Despite putting a lot of work in over pre-season, once the season started, things began to deteriorate slightly and I've just not been able to play", he told the club website.
