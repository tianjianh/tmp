[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health and safety standards in the oil and gas sector have dropped in the past six months, according to Unite.

The union surveyed more than 700 offshore workers, and more than 58% claimed standards had fallen, with 38% saying it had stayed the same. Just over 3% reported an improvement.
The union said 38.5% of respondents felt unable to report an incident because of fear of victimisation.
Industry body Oil and Gas UK said safety was its highest priority.
Unite called for a whistleblowing helpline to be set up.
Regional officer William Wallace: "This survey shows a very worrying picture
"Companies should never - ever - make cuts that threaten health and safety and put the lives of our members at risk.
"The lessons of Piper Alpha should never be forgotten.
"We will be calling on the industry to work with health and safety bodies, with the trade unions, and with government so that we can get a confidential helpline created.
"No worker should feel victimised for raising these issues. The consequences could be catastrophic."
Trish Sentance, health and safety manager at Oil and Gas UK, said: "Just under 50% of those who responded felt health and safety offshore had stayed the same or improved, but we do acknowledge that  concerns have been raised.
"Safe operations has to be at the heart of everything we do and there is always more work to be done. However, it is good to see that the majority responding have felt able to report an incident.
"Industry takes the issue of health and safety very seriously and we would always encourage those with concerns to come forward to report these.
"For those wishing to make an anonymous report there is an industry wide confidential Health and Safety Executive phone-line already in place."
The industry body said senior in senior industry representatives meet regularly with the offshore unions, through the Offshore Co-ordinating Group, and health and safety is "always central to the discussion".
Offshore workers can contact the HSE via a raising concerns section on its website or by calling 0300 003 1647.
