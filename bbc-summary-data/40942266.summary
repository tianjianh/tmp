The 61-year-old joined the Canaries from Atlanta United in December 2016.
Money managed Walsall, Luton Town and Cambridge United between 2006 and 2015 before working for MLS side Atlanta.
"Watching [head coach] Daniel Farke over the past six weeks has rekindled my appetite for management and it's something I'd like to be considered for once more," Money said.
