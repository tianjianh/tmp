[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cleethorpes Pier, which dates back to 1873 and was built at a cost of Â£8,000, has recently undergone a Â£5m renovation.
It now features a restaurant, tea-room and wedding venue.
Earlier this year, the 335ft (100m) pier, one of the shortest in the UK, was voted Pier of the Year by the National Piers Society.
Current owner Bryan Huxford, who bought it three years ago, said he wanted to return the pier to the community and see it develop under new owners.
Tim Mickleburgh, honorary vice-president of the National Piers Society, said its current owners had widened its appeal.
He said: "In the past it was a nightclub and only had the evening clientele."
The venue is advertised as being open to offers.
