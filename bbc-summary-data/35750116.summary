Officers captured the bright orange reptile, believed to be a corn snake, after it was spotted by a walker at Rozelle estate.
The breed, which is not dangerous, is well-known for escaping from homes.
Local birdwatcher and amateur photographer John Rogers had his camera on hand when police arrived to retrieve the snake.
He said: "A walker had spotted the snake and called the police. The officers came with a cardboard box.
"We didn't know what type of snake it was. The female constable took a photo and sent it back to headquarters, where someone identified it as a corn snake."
The Scottish SPCA advises anyone who finds a stray corn snake to contact their animal helpline, as they cannot survive for long outside in the cold.
Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: "Corn snakes make popular pets as they are typically quite docile and easy to handle.
"They are notorious for being great escape artists and we are regularly called to rescue strays."
A Police Scotland spokesman added: "The reptile has been uplifted while attempts are made to trace the owner."
