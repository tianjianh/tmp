[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More insurance claims are made for stolen bicycles than any other item taken by burglars, an insurer has said.

Bikes account for 17% of all theft claims dealt with by Direct Line.
These are followed by mobile phones (11%), which was the biggest riser in the top 10, power tools (10%) and laptops (10%).
Televisions account for just 3% of claims, 10th on the list, as their increasing size have made them more difficult to steal, the insurer said.
"With the nights drawing in, it is perhaps unsurprising that thefts increase, as there are more opportunities for burglars to strike without being seen," said Kate Lomas, head of Direct Line home insurance.
"Items such as bicycles, gardening tools and golf equipment are amongst the most sought-after items, so if items must be stowed away outside the home, homeowners should make sure they are safe and secure."
Aviva, one of the UK's largest insurers, recently said that customers taking out additional cycle insurance rose by 75% from 2009 to 2015.
The sharpest rise was seen in 2012, when cycling was prominent in the London 2012 Olympics.

A total of £77m is paid out in insurance claims overall every day in the UK, according to industry data.
The highest proportion is the £27m paid out to motorists to repair vehicles and cover injury claims, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) figures show.
This is followed by £13m in property claims, of which £8.2m was paid to homeowners, and £4.7m to business owners, it said.
Huw Evans, ABI director general, said the UK insurance market was the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world.
"There is some work to be done to build confidence in products, tackle underinsurance and help more people understand the value of protecting themselves," he said.
