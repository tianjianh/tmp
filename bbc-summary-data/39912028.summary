[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burnley v West Ham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley could welcome back Michael Keane, who has missed their last two games because of a calf injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fellow centre-back Ben Mee is again set to miss out with a shin problem.
West Ham are without centre-back Winston Reid, who has undergone surgery to treat a knee injury, so 18-year-old Declan Rice may deputise.
Fellow defender Angelo Ogbonna, who returned to the match-day squad last weekend after three months out, is also available but lacks match fitness.
The Hammers' lengthy injury list also includes Mark Noble, Cheikhou Kouyate, Andy Carroll, Michail Antonio, Pedro Obiang, Diafra Sakho and Arthur Masuaku.
Alistair Man: "There is little doubt which of these sides has achieved their pre-season target.
"Having booked a second successive campaign amongst the game's elite for the first time since the 1970s, the mood at Turf Moor will rightly be jubilant.
"An impressive 11th home win in front of their own supporters could see Burnley finish as high as 11th, leapfrogging West Ham in the process.
"Even a victory won't propel the Hammers into the top half of the table - a position which seemed a minimum expectation after their seventh-place finish a year ago.
"Messrs Dyche and Bilic are certain to feel contrasting emotions as they reflect upon the rigours of the last 12 months."

Burnley manager Sean Dyche on interest in defender Michael Keane: "We're not under any financial pressure that's for sure. The club's in amazing shape.
"Although the market is tough for us going outside to bring players in, it's very strong for us if people want to come and take our players."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "[It has been a] very difficult season for us and the teams around us. We plan to do better but considering everything we have achieved the minimum goal and I have to praise the players for that.
"We have had our ups and downs, bad moments at the beginning of the season [and in] March, when we lost five games. Basically every time we have been one game away from trouble we have reacted well."
West Ham are not a bad side when everyone is fit but, if they want a repeat of their seventh-place finish in 2015-16, they definitely need to sign some better players.
Burnley's target this season was to stay up and they have done it. It is mission accomplished and they can build again, which is great.
