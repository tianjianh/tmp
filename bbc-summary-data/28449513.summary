[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Davies, 52, who was an experienced rider and a keen runner who competed for Wales, was killed in the crash on 4 August, 2013.
Mold Crown Court heard the crash happened when Gareth Ifan Ritchie, 23, lost control of his vehicle and crossed onto the wrong side of the road.
Ritchie, of Caerwys, was also banned from driving for two-and-a-half years.
The court heard Ritchie's car span out of control on the A5026 at Holway Road, Carmel, and Mr Davies had no chance to avoid him.
Judge Niclas Parry told Ritchie that it did him no credit whatsoever that his immediate reaction at the roadside was to blame the motorcyclist, which he maintained in interview and in his pre-sentence report.
However, the judge said Ritchie has now shown remorse.
In a victim impact statement read to the court, widow Jacqueline Davies said: "My life will never be the same without Chris in it."
Mr Davies's son Ben, who was home on leave from the army, drove past the scene of the crash and saw his father unconscious in the road.
Daniel Oscroft, defending, said: "He [Ritchie] remains desperately sorry for causing the death of Mr Davies. He does not seek to blame him in any way".
