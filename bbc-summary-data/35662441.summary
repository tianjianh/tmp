Dundee will host a jobs summit later, aimed at tackling high levels of unemployment in the city.

The city has an above average number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, despite rising employment in Scotland.
UK and Scottish government ministers will meet representatives from Dundee City Council, businesses and universities.
Scotland Office Minister Andrew Dunlop and Deputy First Minister John Swinney will attend the event at Malmaison.
Official figures show that in Dundee the proportion of the working-age population claiming out of work benefits was 3.2% in January, compared with a Scotland-wide figure of 2.2%.
Dundee City Council's director of city development Mike Galloway told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme:  "We need to stimulate investment that grows and diversifies our job space.
"On the supply side, we need to prepare our citizens to take advantage of the emerging work opportunities when they arise."
Mr Galloway said the opening of the V&A Museum of Design in Dundee in 2018 would attract a "huge number" of new tourists.
He said: "We need to develop the hotels and restaurants and hospitality side that will support that.
"Also, the offshore renewable market, we believe, offers a fantastic opportunity to bring properly-paid engineering jobs back into Dundee."
The city's employment rate was 63.3% between October 2014 and September 2015, below the average rate for Scotland of 73.1%.
Lord Dunlop said: "Dundee is a city with huge potential and promise, but unemployment is a significant issue which needs to be tackled.
"The best way of doing that is if Scotland's two governments work with the local authorities, businesses, entrepreneurs and other organisations with the city's best interests at heart."
