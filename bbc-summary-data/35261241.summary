[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lecht and CairnGorm Mountain open some runs for snowsports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two of Scotland's five mountain snowsports centres have opened some runs following snowfalls and freezing temperatures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
CairnGorm Mountain and the Lecht in Aberdeenshire have made runs available to skiers and snowboarders.
Glencoe Mountain said it has plenty of snow for sledging, but needs more before it could open fully to snowsports enthusiasts.
Nevis Range and Glenshee also require further snowfalls to open fully.
