Cammy Smith fired the Buddies ahead before half-time but Chris Duggan's penalty levelled matters in the second half.
A brace of strikes from Lewis Morgan put the visitors in command.
And though Duggan scored another spot-kick late on, St Mirren did enough to reach the last eight, the draw for which will be made on Sunday.
Jack Ross' St Mirren had caused an upset in the previous round - beating Premiership Dundee - and the Championship side were now seeking to avoid a cup shock against League One East Fife.
The Fifers, on an unbeaten 11-game run, began well and thought they had taken the lead when Nicky Paterson bundled a corner over the line only for referee Don Robertson to blow for a free-kick in St Mirren's favour.
And the visitors took full advantage when they went ahead. The home defence failed to clear a deep cross into the box and Smith calmly clipped the ball over the outstretched arms of Ryan Goodfellow in the home goal.
East Fife came out the traps quickly in the second half and Scott Robinson was denied an equaliser when a last-gasp lunge by Harry Smith cleared the ball off the line.
However, the Methil side did not have long to wait before they drew level.
Ross Brown was bundled to the ground inside the box by Davis and Duggan duly made no mistake from the spot.
Ross brought on Morgan for Rory Loy and his impact on the game was instantaneous.
Stevie Mallan played a through ball to Morgan inside the East Fife box and the substitute showed great composure to fire the ball beyond Goodfellow into the left corner of the net.
And Morgan secured the Paisley side's place in the last eight when he fired a magnificent 25-yard shot around a ruck of home defenders into the bottom corner.
East Fife continued to push forward and deep into stoppage time referee Robertson awarded the home side their second penalty of the day after Davis was judged to have handled.
Duggan was again on target but this was to be the final kick of the game with St Mirren safely through.
East Fife manager Barry Smith: "The players gave me everything. That's all I can ask for.
"We were against a team from a higher division and they should have more quality but I didn't think there was much between the teams.
"The boys kept fighting and when we got the equaliser in the second half we looked like the team that was going to push on. Unfortunately, we conceded a disappointing goal and we struggled to get back into it after that."
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "When you go into any cup tie, getting through is ultimately the most important thing.
"It was a very difficult match played in very difficult conditions. East Fife made it very difficult so we are delighted to be through.
"East Fife started the game better than us and adapted well to the conditions. But once we got ahead I thought we were better and in the second half the game became much more open."
