[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jury warned of Bradford terror suspect's 'repugnant' views

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has warned a jury at the trial of a teenager accused of preparing acts of terrorism they are likely to find his views "abhorrent or repugnant".

The 17-year-old, from Bradford, who cannot be named because of his age, denies the charge and an alternative count of making a pipe bomb.
Mr Justice Goss issued the warning at the start of the teenager's trial at Leeds Crown Court.
He urged jurors to remain "objective and dispassionate" during the case.
He said: "When you hear some of the details of the evidence of the case, it is likely you will find some of the views expressed by the defendant, and those with whom he sympathised or communicated, abhorrent or repugnant.
"The holding of such views, it will become clear to you during the case, is not of itself a crime."
The jury of six men and six women was sent home for the day ahead of the prosecution's opening of the case on Tuesday.
The trial is expected to last about three weeks.
