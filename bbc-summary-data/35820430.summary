[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reliving student days in Hamburg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's not often that you walk around wondering if you're going to bump into your younger self.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But when I went to Hamburg to work with a group of students for BBC News School Report, I expected to meet the 21-year old version of me round every corner.
From 1984-1985 I was the English language assistant at Helene Lange Gymnasium in Hamburg, a state secondary school. It was the third year of my German undergraduate degree.
In many ways it was a difficult time.  I seemed to get told off a lot in Hamburg, either for walking in the cycle lane half of the pavement, or that old clichÃ©, crossing the road at a red man.
"Nicht gestattet", as we say in German.  Not permitted.
I was also a fairly chaotic student who'd enjoyed two years of university life back in the good old days. Now I was suddenly expected to be in school five days a week at the outrageously early time of 08:00.
Those early starts were a challenge I didn't entirely rise to.
But when it came to choosing a school in Germany to be part of the global content of BBC School Report, a return to Helene Lange seemed obvious.
When I was there in the 1980s, there was a big focus on English and the school now officially describes itself as bi-lingual.
This made my job much easier.
On the first morning of my assignment I walked in with the same feeling of trepidation I had known so well at the age of 21.  Luckily it didn't last long.
The migrant crisis is the topic of conversation in the city - which has 39,000 refugees living in and around it, with that figure expected to double by the end of the year.  So the school was quite happy for the students to report on how the city was welcoming its new residents.
The recruits to School Report had already set up interviews with refugees and politicians, including the chairman of the local branch of Alternative for Germany (AfD), the new party that's perceived by the press and the people as being anti-immigration.
They had also lined up the local member of the city's governing SPD/Green coalition, plus a teacher - herself the child of Turkish immigrants - who had taught German to refugees for nearly 20 years.
So far, so good.  I was in for a few surprises though.
Hamburg has a proud tradition of being an outward-looking port city.  Its past as a member of the medieval free-trade association, the Hanseatic League, has given it deep-rooted international links.
So far, from talking to friends and reading the local paper, I had the feeling, that Hansestadt Hamburg had rallied round to welcome the migrants - even if they did have reservations about the numbers.
And this feeling was confirmed when a group of the students keenly went off to the local market on the first morning to try their hand at vox pops.  Most of the people they interviewed (in English by the way) were generally supportive of the refugees being in their city.
We expected the AfD chairman, Christoph Barthe, to introduce a note of scepticism.  He did, but not quite in the way I expected.  When we were fixing up the interview Mr Barthe, who's retired from a career in the oil industry, told me he had a commitment every Wednesday from 10:00-12:00 and that he'd meet us afterwards.
It turned out that commitment was teaching German to a group of Eritrean asylum seekers.
And not only that - he also helps them overcome the bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining refugee status.
When the students put it to him that this was all a bit of a contradiction, Mr Barthe told us emphatically that he saw no contradiction, that these people were entitled to help, but (yes, finally a "but") capacity was limited.
His party, he said, was not against refugees but simply against uncontrolled, mass immigration.  He did concede that the party had attracted people who were anti-immigrant but was adamant that this was not the core of the membership.
That was political surprise number one.
Political surprise number two came from our SPD member of the Hamburg parliament, Uwe Gfffei.
When School Reporter Sophie asked him if he understood the concerns of ordinary Germans, he replied that of course he did.  And he admitted that there had been a time last autumn when immigration had been out of control.
I was struck by his honesty.  I wondered whether a British politician - in government - would have been so open.
The School Reporters themselves surprised me. I'd expected them to be enthusiastic and frighteningly proficient at English, but I hadn't expected them to show me how to do my own job.
After each interview, we discussed what the best bits of it had been. I found myself picking out the extracts that might help make a coherent argument, but they unerringly went for the most striking thing the interviewee had said.
In the case of Mohamad, a young systems analyst from Syria, it was the description of his difficult journey to Hamburg.
And when we talked to the teacher Eylem Cetinoez, it was the story of her expensive British short-haired cat and an Afghan boy's passport - or lack of it.
The three days working in Helene Lange put us all through our paces, the reporters - all aged between 12 and 16 - their teachers, and me.  It was intense.
"There are no easy solutions," was one thing SPD politician Uwe Giffei said and that was more or less the conclusion the students came to.  Goodwill isn't enough, there has to be a long-term plan.
Perhaps part two of the Helene Lange School Report will be what that plan could be.   Experience shows we could rely on the students for some creative suggestions.
And, just for the record, there's nothing like being told off - this time by a passer-by who felt I should have asked a busker I was recording for permission - to make the decades roll away and catapult you back to being 21 again.
