David Beckham said the prospect of setting up and owning a Major League Soccer team in Miami was "exciting" during a visit to Florida on Saturday.

The retired midfielder met political leaders, visited two potential stadiums and had a meeting with a fans group.
Part of his LA Galaxy contract included an option to create a new MLS team by buying an "expansion franchise".
"I think Miami fans are very passionate about their sports and very passionate about winning," he said.
"It's definitely exciting."
Ex-England captain Beckham's representatives have held talks with the league over the purchase of the new club and although there is no MLS franchise in Miami, the 38-year-old is understood to have other locations in mind as well.
Former LA Galaxy player Beckham visited the Sun Life stadium, home to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, which holds around 75,000 fans, and a 20,000-capacity stadium at Florida International University (FIU).
Jose Sotolongo, the executive director of the Miami-Dade Sports Commission, was among those who met with the ex-Manchester United midfielder and said there was plenty of support for a top-flight team in Miami.
"We know that our community can support not only the international soccer (friendlies) that have been coming to Miami for a while now, but that it would support an MLS franchise," he said.
"The city of Miami has a very international fan base and a very soccer savvy fan base. This is the kind of ownership group that would electrify the community and hopefully we will get good news."
