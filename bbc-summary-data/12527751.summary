Strathclyde Police has reported another rise in domestic abuse incidents following an Old Firm match day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force said it responded to 157 domestic abuse incidents and arrested 51 people on Sunday, when Celtic played Rangers at Celtic Park.
Throughout the policing area, a total of 230 arrests were made for violence, anti-social behaviour and disorder incidents compared to an average 182.
Police blamed excessive match day drinking for the spike in violence.
Assistant Chief Constable Campbell Corrigan said: "Let's be perfectly clear - we are not blaming the fans and the clubs for the levels of violence and disorder. The vast majority of people enjoyed the match and were able to enjoy their day without being affected by any violence.
"However, with around 230 arrests yesterday for violence, anti-social behaviour and disorder incidents, it's clear that we are left to mop up the consequences of people drinking to excess. People were behaving outrageously and the general public shouldn't tolerate it.
"Far too many people are drinking too much and are doing so over a sustained period of time. As a result, they get drunk, become full of aggression, and inevitably end up getting into bother - accident and emergency's were full across the force area."
Police said 23 people were arrested at the Old Firm match, which Celtic won 3-0, with 16 of these for sectarian breach of the peace.
