The Royal Navy said it has launched an immediate investigation after HMS Ambush was involved in the "glancing collision" while submerged off the coast of the British territory.
There is "some external damage" but no crew members were injured, it added.
The Astute-class attack submarine's nuclear reactor was undamaged.
In a statement on the Ministry of Defence website, the Navy said the incident took place at approximately 13:30 local time on Tuesday.
"We are in contact with the merchant vessel and initial indications are that it has not sustained damage.
"The submarine suffered some external damage but there is absolutely no damage to her nuclear plant and no member of the ship's company was injured in the incident."
Further checks would be carried out but there are no safety concerns, said the Navy.
Photographs of HMS Ambush arriving in Gibraltar appear to show damage to the front section of its conning tower.
The submarine is reported to be a regular visitor to Gibraltar, having last stopped in the  territory in June and March.
One of the Royal Navy's three Astute-class submarines - Britain's largest and most advanced attack submarines - HMS Ambush is 97m (318ft) in length, cost more than Â£1bn and carries torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
It joined the fleet at the Faslane naval base in 2013 after two years of sea trials. The Royal Navy is due to take delivery of three further Astute-class submarines.
