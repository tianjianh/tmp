Officers said a post-match inquiry was ongoing into the use of flares, smoke bombs, offensive singing and banners, which could result in more arrests.
They said there were also a number of inquiries being carried out into incidents of violence across Scotland.
They were investigating whether these incidents were football-related.
Police Scotland said of the 18 people arrested on Sunday, eight men had appeared in court for offences including sectarian threatening or abusive behaviour, assault and running on to the pitch.
Three men, aged 18, 52 and 27, were arrested and released on an undertaking over offences under the Offensive Behaviour at Football Scotland Act.
Seven men were reported to the procurator fiscal for street drinking, possession of drugs and threatening or abusive behaviour.
Ch Supt Brian McInulty praised the majority of fans who behaved well during and after the match.
Rangers won the match 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 2-2 after extra time.
