The two sides, who had both already won promotion, began the day level on points, but with Yeovil top thanks to a superior goal difference of six.
Bristol City won 5-0 at Oxford United Women but Yeovil's 3-0 home win over Sheffield Ladies gave them the title.
"It's incredible for everyone," said Yeovil captain Ellie Curson.
Bristol City's hopes were very much alive at the break as they led 4-0 through two goals from Claire Emslie, a Madi Lee own goal and Millie Farrow's curler, while Yeovil were only 1-0 ahead courtesy of Lucy Quinn.
But second-half goals from Annie Heatherson and Nicola Cousins eased any nerves the Lady Glovers and their record home crowd of 1,483 had, as City could only add one more to their tally through Farrow.
Yeovil captain Ellie Curson:
"These guys in the crowd have made our dream come true today for us. They were absolutely incredible, I can't thank them enough.
"We had a little talk at half-time. We did know the Bristol score - we knew there was a little bit of pressure on our shoulders and we had to go out there and make sure that was ours.
"It's been a long time coming. It's been ours since May and no-one was taking that off us.
"I'd like to thank everyone, mainly the fans, you could just hear it today - 1,400 people have come out to watch little old Yeovil Town Ladies play."
Bristol City midfielder Claire Emslie:
"It was good for us to celebrate promotion with a 5-0 win. We knew we had to score a lot of goals today, but Yeovil did their job so well done to them.
"It is slightly disappointing to get so close to winning the league, but that will all be forgotten when we start next season in WSL 1.
"The odds were against us today but we gave it our best shot and I think we can be really proud of how we did today and we'll still celebrate getting promoted."
