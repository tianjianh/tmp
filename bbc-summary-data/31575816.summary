A group of young Muslims has gathered more than 1,000 people to form a "ring of peace" around Oslo's main synagogue.

The event in Norway's capital follows attacks against Jews in Europe, including in Paris in January and in Denmark last week.
There was a large crowd of onlookers, from a number of religions.
"We want to demonstrate that Jews and Muslims do not hate each other," co-organiser Zeeshan Abdullah told crowds in front of the synagogue on Saturday.
"We do not want individuals to define what Islam is for the rest of us. There are many more peace-mongers than warmongers."
Norway's Chief Rabbi Michael Melchior sang the traditional Jewish end of Sabbath song outside the synagogue.
It was the first time co-organiser Hassan Raja had heard the song, he said.
Ervin Kohn, head of Oslo's Jewish community, described the event as "unique".
Hajrah Arshad, another of the eight organisers of the event, said it showed "that Islam is about love and unity".
In Paris, three Muslim gunmen killed 17 people at a kosher grocery, the offices of weekly Charlie Hebdo and elsewhere in early January.
A Jewish security guard at a synagogue and a Danish filmmaker attending a free speech were killed in Copenhagen last week.
