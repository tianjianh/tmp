Daisy Evans, 23, was watched by four-year-old springer poodle Boris as she picked up her degree at the University of Reading on Friday.
Her 19-year-old sister Hollie suffers with anxiety, which eases in the presence of her pet.
The university said it was "delighted" Boris could attend.
Hollie was unable to speak for two years at the height of her anxiety, a problem she said improved after Boris's arrival in her life.
She said the university allowing Boris to attend the graduation resulted in her family's first outing together in five years.
The teenager added: "It's lovely to have Boris here. I get very nervous but he helps as he's a bit of a distraction.
"He's part of the family so he should be here. Boris comes with me everywhere - he rescued me."
A university spokesman said they were "delighted to hear the family enjoyed their day and that bringing Boris made such a difference."
