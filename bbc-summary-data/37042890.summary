The 23-year-old Exeter Chiefs player featured in all three of England's wins over Australia in June.
Nowell will miss Exeter's three pre-season games and their opening Premiership fixtures against semi-finalists Wasps and champions Saracens.
"It is potentially something like an eight-to-10-week injury," Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told the club website.
