An annual Boxing Day swimming event has seen its biggest ever turnout thanks to the mild December weather.

More than 50 people took part in the River Thames swim between Oxfordshire and Berkshire.
The event, which is in its sixth year, sees participants swim 70m (230ft) from the Red Lion Hotel at Henley to the Leander Club at Remenham, Wokingham.
Organiser Beatrice Heller said the milder weather had attracted more swimmers than ever before.
"Five of us did it the first year when it was about minus eight and there was ice floating on the river," she said.
This year the "totally for fun" event saw a water temperature of 10C (50F), said Ms Heller.
"It was the biggest turn-out by far, the most we've had before is 23" she said.
"I think the warm weather made people think, 'oh yeah I'll give that a go'."
