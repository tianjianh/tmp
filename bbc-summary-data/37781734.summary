Alex Kiwomya: Crewe Alexandra boss Steve Davis on the hunt for another fast winger

Crewe want to sign another fast winger to give them the option of playing in-form Alex Kiwomya in a central striking role, says boss Steve Davis.

Kiwomya, 20, is on loan from Premier League side Chelsea until January and is the Alex's top scorer with five goals in 10 league appearances.
"Pace is important in any league - especially this one," Davis told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Another quick one would be a great advantage to us."
Kiwomya scored on his return to action after a month out with a shoulder injury to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw at Notts County on 15 October.
"We're hoping to keep Alex beyond January but we'd like another quick winger to enable us to play Alex up front if we need to, to give us that threat," Davis said.
"Alex is enjoying himself and his football and I've had a word with him about the rest of the season but it might not be his decision."
