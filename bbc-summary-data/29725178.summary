[SN]TITLE[SN]
Superdry founder replaced as CEO role by ex-Co-op boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The founder of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton, has stepped aside as CEO at SuperGroup to focus on the brand's image and its product range.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Euan Sutherland, already a non-executive director at the firm for two years, has been announced as new CEO.
Mr Dunkerton said the decision was due to the "increasing complexity of the business" and it was "the right time to bring someone in of Euan's calibre".
Mr Sutherland quit his job as boss of the Co-Operative Group in March.
He has previously worked at B&Q, Dixons and Coca-Cola.
Mr Dunkerton will now have the role of Founder and Product and Brand Director.
Superdry products are sold in over 100 countries via 135 UK stores, concessions and online.
The business was set up by Mr Dunkerton 30 years ago from a market stall in Cheltenham.
