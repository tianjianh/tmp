Championship side Reading face Crystal Palace at home, while Watford will travel to Arsenal, who beat Hull 4-0 in a replay.
Manchester United earned a routine 3-0 win at Shrewsbury to set up a home tie against West Ham.
Matches will take place across the weekend of 11-14 March.
Chelsea beat Everton in the FA Cup final in 2009 when interim boss Guus Hiddink was in his first spell in charge of the Blues.
"It was a long time ago," said the Dutchman, after his side's 5-1 win over Manchester City in the fifth round on Sunday.
"They are longing for revenge. We hope to maintain the flow we are in in the FA Cup."
