Stoke City 0-0 Southampton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke held Southampton to a goalless draw despite having Marko Arnautovic sent off in Mark Hughes' 400th match as a Premier League manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side had plenty of possession but struggled to create chances in a poor game, with Arnautovic seeing red for a studs-up challenge in the 23rd minute.
Saints substitute Jay Rodriguez missed the game's best opening when he failed to make contact with Sofiane Boufal's second-half low cross.
James Ward-Prowse had a chance to strike the winner from close range after a Glen Johnson error, but his shot was deflected wide.
The point moves Southampton up to ninth, while Hughes' Stoke stay in 12th.
After the red card, Southampton dominated possession but they failed to make the numerical advantage tell.
Claude Puel's side were tidy on the ball and there was some lovely build-up play, but at the end of every well-constructed move the final delivery was lacking.
Ryan Bertrand tested Lee Grant with a powerful drive from the edge of the box in one of the few times Southampton went direct, but Rodriguez's miss was the crucial moment.
After Joe Allen was robbed by Steven Davis, Boufal's cross only needed a simple finish, but the 27-year-old forward failed to connect, seemingly caught in two minds over which foot to go in with.
Arnautovic's red card was greeted with jeers by the home crowd, but his studs were up high on Boufal's thigh and his challenge was late.
Hughes will argue that his side were hamstrung by the sending off, but Stoke did not threaten at all after Allen's low prod at the near post was put behind by Fraser Forster's boot inside six minutes.
Xherdan Shaqiri put in a disappointing performance and pummelled one of the seats in the Stoke dugout with his fist after being replaced by Mame Biram Diouf in the second half, having contributed very little.
In truth, Stoke were fortunate to hold on, and the draw owed more to Southampton's poor finishing than their own defending.
Johnson's heavy touch in his own box should have been punished with a better finish from Ward-Prowse, and Allen's hesitancy led to the game's only true clear-cut opportunity.
It was not a happy occasion for Hughes on a landmark night.
The former Blackburn, Manchester City, Fulham and QPR boss' 400th match in charge in the English top flight will not live long in the memory.
Hughes' win percentage is 36%. That puts him level with Alan Pardew but below Harry Redknapp (37%) and David Moyes (41%).
Stoke manager Mark Hughes on Arnautovic's red card: "It's unfortunate because he obviously caught him high on the thigh but the ball was bouncing around and it wasn't a violent movement to take the player out.
"The ref wasn't great on the night, he missed a number of decisions and clearly missed an elbow from Shane Long on Bruno Martins Indi - that needs looking at again.
"Overall the ref put us in a situation and we had to show real work ethic and understanding of what was required. Given the circumstances, the point we gained was magnificent."
Southampton manager Claude Puel: "We're disappointed. Eleven against 10 you have to do better. In the first half we were too nervous, in the second half we were better and created a few possibilities, but it was not enough.
"There were good crosses and good combinations, but our play was too slow and not effective in the final third. It was two points lost and it's a shame."
On Arnautovic's red card: "I think it's a important foul, it was very dangerous, he does not play the ball."
Stoke next play on Saturday at home to Leicester in a 15:00 GMT kick-off. Southampton are away to Bournemouth on Sunday at 13:30.
