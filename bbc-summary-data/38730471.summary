The 4 All Games aims to introduce tournaments featuring fencing, archery, visually impaired football and goalball to PE lessons and sports clubs.
Danielle Brown, two-time Paralympic archery gold winner, said the format creates a "level playing field".
The scheme will initially focus on schools in South and West Yorkshire.
Those behind the 4 All Games want to find coaches to help the tournaments spread across the country.
Competitions will be held at local, regional and national level for primary and secondary schools, with a variant of the games for colleges and universities.

Ms Brown, from Lothersdale in North Yorkshire, said: "Disability sport is something that's very close to my heart, I was very lucky as an athlete to compete on the able-bodied team too so I know the barriers that are there for people with disabilities.
"We're hoping to deliver through schools and community groups to start with and we're wanting it to grow organically."
Organisers said the four sports were selected because of their "mentally challenging nature" and are easily adapted for all skill levels and abilities.
