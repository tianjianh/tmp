He left his slot on the evening show on BBC Radio 1 last Thursday, to take up a position with Apple in Los Angeles.
Despite being the network's dance music champion Mac says that genre won't be the focus of her show.
"Anyone who knows me from Sunday nights on Radio 1 will know that I do love all different types of music," she explains.
Listen to the full interview including how Annie started out as an assistant producer on Zane's show.
"I love hip-hop. I love R&B, I love guitar music and all of those will be completely reflected.
"I can't go in there and be like, 'Right, we're not going to play this any more' because that show has a responsibility to reflect all the late night shows."
As for features on the show, new music will carry over from Lowe's era.
Each night at 7.30pm, a new and often first play of a track is declared the 'Hottest Record in the World' right now.
"We're going to change the way we do it a little bit, but we're going to keep it. It's an institution on Radio 1 now," she says.
Mac is also going to bring some of the features she's developed on her other shows on the network.
"The Sunday show was called the musical hot water bottle. We're going to bring elements of that in one night," she explains.
"We'll have a chunk of music that is just reflective of the mellower side of stuff; all genres, put my mic down, talk less and just let people get lost in the music a little bit."
Also on a Thursday night, an artist will come in and play tracks, creating a "house party vibe."
But Mac is keen to let listeners know the "music is still what they want it to be - new and exciting and fresh."
As for her predecessor, she says Zane Lowe was very happy to hand over a show to the woman who was his assistant producer when he first started.
"Zane called me the night before the news came out and was really, really lovely and complimentary," she said.
"What he said about this situation was, that it is very rare in these scenarios that everybody is happy.
"When someone leaves it is not normally quite such a positive thing. He's leaving to go and do something exciting. I'm going to do an exciting thing in his job, so we're both happy and it's a lovely scenario.
"The advice he gave me was to be yourself."
She is keen to get her teeth into big interviews, but realises that might take a bit of time.
"Zane has been on air for 12 years and he has gained the trust of these people over the years," she says.
"What I have to do is get stuck in and start interviewing people, and let people know that hopefully I know my stuff and they will want to do more with me."
As for Annie Mac, the DJ, she won't be slowing down on that front.
"The way it works with DJ'ing is that you really have your schedule mapped out. You confirm gigs six months before, or even more.
"I've got my whole year mapped out. I've got all my festivals mapped out, I've got my autumn tour mapped out. But I won't be taking on any more gigs.
"It's going to be a lot of seven day weeks, so we're going to have to make sure I make time to live."
