The family of a 13-year-old boy stabbed to death at school 30 years ago have said race relations have taken a post-Brexit "backwards step".

Ahmed Iqbal Ullah was killed at the hands of a fellow school pupil in the playground of Burnage High School, Manchester, on 17 September 1986.
An inquiry concluded race was a key factor in the Bangladeshi's murder.
His sister, Selina Ullah, said she was troubled by a reported rise in race crime following the EU referendum.
Greater Manchester Police recorded a 50% rise in the number of hate crimes reported to the force following the June 23 vote.
Speaking on the 30th anniversary of her brother's death, Ms Ullah said:  "I think we made a lot of progress; however, I think following Brexit we have taken a major step backwards.
"The level of overt racism. The level of overt intimidation. It's both visible and invisible.
"The number of people I've known who have been racially abused, including my own daughter, is staggering. To have that now, in 2016, is quite shocking."
A Manchester City Council-commissioned inquiry into Ahmed's death resulted in the 1988 publication of the Macdonald Report.
It was critical of Burnage High, concluded race had been a key factor in the murder of Ahmed and, as part of a wider inquiry into racism and violence in Manchester schools, suggested a murder could have happened elsewhere.
Ms Ullah said the family want Ahmed's legacy to be a force for good.
She said: "While we had a major loss within our family, we wanted something very positive to come out that would enable others to lead very enriching lives."
The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre, opened in memory of the schoolboy, will launch a special exhibition on what would have been Ahmed's birthday on 14 October.
