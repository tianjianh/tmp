[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ulster SFC: Tyrone without defenders Cathal McCarron and Justin McMahon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyrone will be without experienced defenders Cathal McCarron and Justin McMahon for Sunday's Ulster SFC game against Derry at Celtic Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McCarron has a hamstring injury, while McMahon has a quad muscle problem.
Defender Padraig Hampsey, midfielder Conal McCann and attacker Kieran McGeary are handed first championship starts by Tyrone manager Mickey Harte.
Rory Brennan comes in at centre back, while Peter Harte drops back to the half back line for the first round tie.
Harte is deployed in that position by the Red Hands to offset the absence of McCarron and McMahon.
McCann, younger brother of Tiernan, is a surprise choice as midfield partner for Colm Cavanagh, having seen little game time during the National League.
All-Star midfielder Mattie Donnelly is named at corner forward, with skipper Sean Cavanagh at full forward.
Eight of those who will line out for Tyrone started last year's 11-point win over the Oak Leafers at the same venue.
Tyrone: N Morgan; A McCrory, R McNamee, P Hampsey; T McCann, R Brennan, P Harte; C Cavanagh, C McCann; K McGeary, N Sludden, C Meyler; M Bradley, S Cavanagh, M Donnelly.
