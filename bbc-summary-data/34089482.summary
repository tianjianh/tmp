Banned off-spinner Saeed Ajmal says he is confident of playing for Pakistan again despite his struggles since returning with a remodelled action.

Ajmal took 178 Test and 183 one-day wickets before he was banned in September 2014 for an illegal action.
But after being cleared to play again and recalled to the Pakistan squad in April, he has since been dropped.
"I'm confident that I can make a comeback for my country and prove my critics wrong," he said.
"I feel that I'm not a spent force when it comes to international cricket and as a bowler I still have something to offer my country."
Ajmal, who re-signed for Worcestershire in February as he began his comeback, was picked for the two-Test series against Bangladesh in April.
But having played only two ODIs and a T20, he produced one wicket in 22.3 overs and conceded runs at 6.57 per over.
Ajmal told PakPassion.net that despite rumours that he had been sacked by Worcestershire, his contract would run out on 4 September allowing him to return to play in Pakistan.
"There was no sacking or early termination of my contract as some media are reporting. My contract with Worcestershire is until 4th September as I will be leaving for Hajj the day after I return to Pakistan next week," he added.
"Worcestershire had wanted me to play for them for the whole season but I had decided and agreed with Worcestershire prior to signing the contract this season that I wouldn't be able to play the whole season and would return to Pakistan prior to the end of the season."
