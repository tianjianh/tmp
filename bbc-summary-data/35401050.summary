Bournemouth University announces £100m redevelopment plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth University (BU) has announced plans for a £100m redevelopment of its two campuses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals include new faculty buildings and facilities as well as a new student accommodation block.
The development at the Lansdowne and Talbot sites will bring "significant investment" into Bournemouth and Poole, the university said.
A four-week public consultation period is open until 19 February, with public exhibitions on 8 and 10 February.
The plans for Talbot include a new building for the media and communication, management and science and technology faculties.
There will also a bus hub on the campus and a new link road off the Boundary roundabout.
One of the proposals for the Lansdowne campus is to bring the health and social sciences department under one roof in a new building and for a 550-bed student building.
BU vice-chancellor, Prof John Vinney, said: "Bournemouth University has recently been recognised in the top 200 most international universities in the world.
"Our proposed new developments are key to helping us achieve our vision of providing world class facilities for a world class university so that we can continue to develop global talent."
If approved, construction is scheduled to begin in 2017 for both sites, with the buildings opening in September 2019.
