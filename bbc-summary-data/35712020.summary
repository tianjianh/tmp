The images by amateur photographer Phyllis Nicklin were found last year when University of Birmingham staff were clearing out a building.
Ms Nicklin, a lecturer from Aston, took the photos between 1953 and 1969.
A selection are on display at the city's Reuben Colley gallery and artists have been invited to interpret the photos.
David Oram, from the university, published Ms Nicklin's photos on his local history website, Brumpic.
He said: "She's captured a time of change in Birmingham where new buildings [were] going up, the [old ones] coming down. This is exactly what happened in the 1950s and 1960s in Birmingham."
The photos were discovered by staff last year.
