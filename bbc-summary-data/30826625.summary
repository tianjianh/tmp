Stores of timber were destroyed in the fire at Breeze House, which makes wooden gazebos and garden furniture at its plant in Leek, Staffordshire.
At the height of the fire, more than 30 firefighters were at the scene on the Barnfield Road Industrial Estate.
Managing director Andy Peck said nobody was injured.
The cause of the fire, which started at about 04:00 GMT, is being investigated by Staffordshire Fire and Rescue.
Dave Steele, from the fire service, said it was "amazing" crews managed to contain what was essentially "a bonfire".
"As I arrived there were flames billowing from the roof of the warehouse - it was quite an established fire," he said.
Mr Peck said the alarm had been raised by a passing council worker, who was assessing roads in the area.
"Had the fire taken hold, there are timber products throughout the premises and it's a 44,000 square foot factory," he said.
"We've probably had about 4,000 square foot affected. Had it taken hold it would have moved through quite quickly, then it would have been a completely different case."
Mr Peck said most of the finished stock had survived, although stores of timber had been destroyed and part of the factory would need to be rebuilt.
