Set mainly in a black neighbourhood of Miami, it chronicles the life of Chiron - from being a gentle child bullied at school to a young adult trying to come to terms with his sexuality.
It mixes macho brutality, with genuine tenderness.
The film is directed by Barry Jenkins and is based on a story by Tarell Alvin McCraney called In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. They are both up for an Oscar for adapted screenplay. Evan Davis met up with Tarell Alvin McCraney.
