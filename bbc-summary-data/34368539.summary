Views from members of the public on how best to solve congestion problems on the A40 in Oxfordshire are being sought by the county council.

In July, the authority earmarked £38m to the scheme as part of a package of works totalling more than £100m.
Proposals include creating a dual carriageway, designated bus lane, as well as Witney to Oxford train and tram services.
Up to 30,000 vehicles use the route between Oxford and Witney each day.
Joe O'Connor, from Stanton Harcourt, said his commute to Oxford takes about 20 minutes "on a good day", but an accident on the A40 can lead to delays of up to two hours.
"You have to give so much time to extra travelling which is horrendous," he said.
"You should be able to regiment your time a little bit."
Witney MP David Cameron described the A40 as "a bit of a foot on the windpipe of west Oxfordshire economy".
He added he wanted to see a dual carriageway created along the route.
As part of the strategy, Oxfordshire County Council said it wanted to improve travel times an "journey reliability" between Witney and Oxford, as well as "stimulate economic growth" and improve safety.
Council leader Ian Hudspeth said long-term solutions would require "ambition and creativity".
The public consultation closes on 8 November.
