Defying repeated predictions of his political demise, he marched through the primary contests, and has won a decisive victory in the general election.
But he has also been a hugely controversial candidate, accused of divisiveness for his hardline attitude to immigration and national security.
Throughout the campaign, his supporters told the BBC why they are so attracted to him and his message.
Here is what they said.
"Donald Trump is very real and very sincere. We're tired of being cheated. The more they try to attack him, the more we love him." - Sandra Stone, Florida, March 2016
"The other politicians are controlled by their handlers. He's not." - Vern Engel, Kansas City, August 2015
"He's brought energy back to the people. They want somebody that's not connected with the government." Linda Callahan, Florida, November 2015
"I backed Trump from the beginning. Because he calls things out. He does not allow lies to live. He just exposes things. Pastors sometimes need to be politically correct, and Donald Trump is not politically correct, and I love that about him" - Crystal Myers, California, May 2016
"He's outspoken. Other candidates wouldn't tell you how it is, but he does." - Betty Tully, August 2015
"I like that he's over the top. My president needs bravado... somebody who is big and loud, strong and powerful." - Victoria Wilen, Orlando, Florida, November 2015
"He doesn't hold back. You get what he really believes in, even if everything that he says isn't what is the right thing exactly." - Nicholas Poucher, Florida, December 2015
"Passionate, driven, confident, motivatedâ€¦.I think I've seen him really successful as a businessman, so I'd like to see how he'd be as a leader of the United States." Taylar Martin, a 19-year-old student at American University in Washington DC.
"I think he's really someone who understands economics and international finance on a global level in many ways beyond just theory but real first-hand experience " -  Issac Eves, Florida, March 2016

"We need to close the borders... It has to be done the right way and they can't just come into our country and expect us to take care of them, take our jobs, and then for us to have to support them, and all the things America has to do to help them out.
"That's not being ugly about anybody or not liking people or not wanting to help people. It's just that it needs to be done the right way. We have so many people in our country that we need to help as well." - Peggy Smith Shortt, South Carolina, May 2016
"My ancestors were immigrants from Ireland in the 1700s, and I support legal immigration in the way our forefathers intended it to be.
