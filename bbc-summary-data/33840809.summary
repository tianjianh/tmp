The owners of Bosley mill, where four people are thought to have died in a fire, have said it was a "difficult decision" to make staff redundant.

Wood Treatment Limited announced 20 redundancies in a letter to staff on Friday.
The blast at the Cheshire mill caused a four-storey building collapse on 17 July.
A council leader said he was "appalled" at the treatment of staff by the mill owners.
In a statement, the company said: "Following the fire at our site in Bosley, we have had to take the difficult decision to consult our staff on redundancy.
"Unfortunately, the devastation at the factory and the ongoing joint police and HSE investigation into the cause of the fire mean that we cannot predict when the factory will be operational again."
The firm said it would support employees "as best we can".
The GMB union has called a meeting on Monday afternoon in Bosley to discuss the plans.
Temperatures reached 1,000C in the blast and it was described by rescuers as the "worst incident of its kind" in a decade.
Four people unaccounted for after the blast were Derek Moore, 62, from Stoke-on-Trent, William Barks, 51, from Leek, Jason Shingler, 38, from North Rode, and Dorothy Bailey, 62.
Will Barks, Derek Moore and Dorothy Bailey  have been identified as victims. Other remains have been found. Jason Shingler, 38, is still missing.
Michael Jones, leader of Cheshire East Council, said: "I'm appalled at the treatment of these people by the mill owners. Whatever business is done by them from the site should deliver local benefit."
The council has established a drop-in centre in the village providing advice about employment and benefits.
An investigation is under way into the cause of the explosion.
