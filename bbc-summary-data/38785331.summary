The 24-year-old has been offered a new contract, was left out of Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup fourth round defeat at Burnley.
Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "He didn't feel he was mentally right to play and that tells a story in itself."
Freeman has made 121 appearances for City and has been linked with QPR.
"He's made it clear he wants to move on and that one is still pending so we'll have to see what happens between now and Tuesday."
