Crystal Palace defender Luke Croll has extended his loan at League Two Exeter City until the end of the season.

The 22-year-old centre-back has made 12 appearances for the Grecians this season, with the side keeping four clean sheets in those games.
But Croll, who has yet to make a first team appearance for Palace, has not featured since Troy Brown returned to fitness in November.
Croll's loan runs until 6 May but can be extended if City make the play-offs.
City are three places and four points off the play-off places with a game in hand on some of the sides above them in the table.
Manager Paul Tisdale says he and his players are now starting to look at the possibility of making the play-offs after their 3-0 win at Grimsby Town to move up to 10th in League Two.
City were bottom of the table less than two months ago but have won six games in a current eight-game unbeaten run.
"It's probably brought up in training every two or three days, there has to be a continual focus," he added.
"We had a challenge through the autumn to get ourselves to get out of the bottom two and off the bottom of the league. Now we've got a different challenge, we're mid-table, we're healthy and we've got to look up.
"It's a different type of challenge and it brings a different type of focus and a different type of discipline when you're winning.
"I don't know how far we can go, you just play the next game and see where it takes us."
