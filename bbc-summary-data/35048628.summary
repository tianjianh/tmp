Catriona Lilley, 22, was taking part in filming for a TV crime programme when it happened.
She suffered a fractured jaw and lost teeth in the collision. Five other people were also hurt.
It happened near Boucher Road last month. A 24-year-old man was arrested but was later released on bail.
Ms Lilley said: "The first night that I came home I woke up in the night having flashbacks of the car just coming at me.
"I started to feel really ill because I could imagine it hitting my stomach over and over again."
She described how the crash had affected her.
"I have not gone near my car," she said.
"I know I wasn't driving, but the thought of being on the road with cars all around me is making me quite anxious.
"I have found myself slightly more nervous about crossing roads, even though I wasn't on a road when it happened, thinking that this is where a car could be driving and hit me."
Ms Lilley said took comfort from the "fact that everyone else is doing OK".
She described the immediate aftermath of the collision as confusing and shocking.
"I couldn't stop screaming," she said.
"It was just really horrifying and really traumatic seeing everything around me. I was just thinking 'God I hope is everyone is OK' and what on earth was that. What happened?
"It just seemed so surreal."
A television crew was filming a reconstruction for an RTÃ‰ crime show in the area at the time of the crash.
It is thought about 20 people were taking part.
It is understood the car involved in the incident was not part of the filming for the crime reconstruction.
