[SN]TITLE[SN]
Memorial to be held for Aberdeen baby ashes scandal families

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service for families affected by the baby ashes scandal at Aberdeen's Hazlehead Crematorium is to be held in November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together and given back to relatives of the adult, while the parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
The service will be on 6 November.
The non-denominational event will take place at the city's Mither Kirk.
The Aberdeen situation followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
