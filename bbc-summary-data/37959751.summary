Joe Dodoo crossed for his fellow substitute to apply the finishing touch as the hosts laid siege to the visitors' penalty area.
Rangers squandered several good chances, while Jason Holt was denied by a good Scott Bain save.
Dundee defended bravely and Tom Hateley threatened twice from free kicks.
Mark Warburton's side looked on course for a frustrating fourth home draw of the season before Forrester made Rangers' 17th attempt on goal count.
Dundee, who were looking for a third consecutive win, were reduced to a meagre 30% of possession and the loss of such a late goal will have hurt even more given Ross County's success at St Johnstone - the Dingwall side leaping from last place to eighth in a congested bottom half of the table.
Rangers, who stay third in Premiership, took the initiative right from the start, with some sharp passing creating a series of openings.
Joe Garner was at the centre of the action, shooting wide on the turn and going close from long-range before his clever diagonal pass just eluded strike partner Kenny Miller.
Bain, returning from injury, saved from Holt and Windass, while Dundee defender Kevin Gomis did well to clear Holt's dangerous ball across the six-yard box before blocking Garner's unconvincing attempt from a Windass cutback.
Dundee, again playing with a three-man central defence, restricted the Rangers chances as the half progressed and they threatened twice themselves in quick succession. Hateley had a free-kick pushed wide before his corner found Marcus Haber completely unmarked only for the Canada striker to miscue his header.
The visitors' best spell came after the interval when Foderingham did well to tip over Hateley's free-kick before Gomis failed to hit the target with a free header. Holt then slid in to prevent James Vincent converting Haber's low cross.
But Rangers found an added edge in the final 15 minutes. Bain denied Holt with a brilliant diving save after Dundee lost the ball on the edge of their box, Garner was inches away from connecting with Dodoo's cross, and the goalkeeper gathered Andy Halliday's free-kick.
Dundee appeared to have done enough for a vital point before Forrester had the final say.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton: "I thought we were good first half and didn't get the rewards. You sense a frustration, but we have to keep doing what we do.
"I was pleased with the fitness levels, we worked them really hard and they tired. It came late, but it's three points and we deserved the victory.
"We had a strong bench attacking-wise and they made a difference, they added some energy and pace. I had no problems with the boys coming off, they were excellent. It's just a case of variety."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "We were a minute away from getting a good point and probably a deserved point.
"It was just that concentration for the full game that cost us, one ball into the box, which we defended brilliantly for the majority of the game. It's a real killer blow for the players because I thought they were terrific.
"We had good chances, Vincent just had to get a nick on it and put it in, and Gomis and Hateley, but the way the team performed over the majority of the game, and over the last three or four weeks, has been great."
