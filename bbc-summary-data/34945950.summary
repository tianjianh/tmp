Klitschko, 39, is defending his WBA, IBF and WBO belts against Fury, 27, at the 50,000-capacity Esprit Arena.
At Friday's weigh-in, Klitschko scaled 17st 7lb and the challenger 17st 8lb.
"If you asked 10 boxers to build their nightmare opponent, you'd end up with Tyson Fury," said the unbeaten Englishman.
"I'm everybody's nightmare opponent - tall, rangy, a counter-puncher, can switch from orthodox to southpaw.

"You can't achieve more than Wlad's already achieved. To come back from three knockout defeats and reign for nine years, you've got to admire him. But every dog has its day and it's got to come to an end at some point."
Ukraine's Klitschko has won 64 of his 67 professional fights, 53 by knockout, and has not been beaten since 2004.
However, former British, European and Commonwealth champion Fury said he had not fallen under the champion's spell or succumbed to any of his mind games.
Klitschko and his older brother Vitali, a former heavyweight world champion himself, are renowned for making life difficult for opponents before a fight.
For example, before Vitali's world title defence against Britain's Dereck Chisora in 2012, Wladimir visited the challenger's dressing room and requested he have his hands completely rebandaged.
"If they want me to put the bandages on 15 times and give me 15 sets of gloves, not a problem," said Fury, who is unbeaten in 24 professional fights.

"If there have been any mind games from Wladimir, I'm yet to see them, let alone fall for them. Maybe they'll send a couple of women into my changing room with no clothes on."
At the weigh-in, in the city of Essen, Fury initially refused to shake hands with his rival but did so after a minute-long stare-down.
Fury weighed in a stone lighter than he did for his last fight, against Christian Hammer in February, and almost as light as he has ever been.
"I'm happy with my weight," he said. "I feel fantastic and strong. It's going to be speed versus speed, speed equals power and power equals an explosive fight."
