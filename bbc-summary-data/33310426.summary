Brides-to-be have been left out of pocket after a wedding dress shop in Gloucester ceased trading.

Mystia Bridal Boutique in St Aldate Street has gone into liquidation and is being managed by Findlay James Insolvency Practitioners.
At least 12 customers told the BBC they had paid out up to Â£1,600 each for dresses they have not received.
The BBC has tried to contact owner, Louise Betts-Masters, but she was unavailable for comment.
Paula Smith, who is due to be married in August and paid Â£1,600, said her dress-fitting was cancelled at short notice.
"I had an appointment on Saturday morning to try on my dress with my bridesmaids, and I got a call on Friday night from the insolvency company saying they'd gone bust and I wasn't to turn up for my appointment."
She said the order was still with the designer in Australia.
Sophie, who did not wish to give her surname, said she was due to get married next month and had paid more than Â£1,500 for her dress.
"It's put a real dark shadow over things. I visited the venue on Saturday and I'm not excited at all now."
A spokesman for the British Bridal Retail Association said the news was "very sad".
They said the exact number of customers affected was not known and they had been unable to contact the owner.
It has been reported that poor sales left the owner with "no choice" but to go into liquidation.
