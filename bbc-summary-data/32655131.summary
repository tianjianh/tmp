Scot scoops £210,000 from election bet on Tory majority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Glasgow man who bet £30,000 on the Conservatives winning a majority in the general election has pocketed £210,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pensioner made the bet at a city branch of Ladbrokes 10 days before the vote, at odds of seven to one.
Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said the "well-groomed gentleman" was "the biggest winner of the general election".
He said many punters had backed a hung parliament, and lost out when the Conservatives won a slim majority.
