With his team eliminated from the World Cup, Hodgson made nine changes to the starting XI for the final game against Costa Rica, which England drew 0-0.
That gave them their only point of the campaign in Brazil, as they finished bottom of Group D.
"I take positives - this was a banana skin. To get that display was great since for many it was new," he said.
"I am pleased at least to have given the fans something to cheer about in terms of our performance."
Six players aged 24 and under started against Costa Rica, whose surprise wins over Uruguay and Italy saw them top the group.
"This is a very different team to the one at Euro 2012. We play different football. We pass the ball much more. We ask a lot more in terms of receiving the ball, turning with the ball," Hodgson told BBC Radio 5 live.
"And in the final third we try things and take risks. The type of players we are choosing - Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge - it's clear that's our aim and hope."
Hodgson reiterated he hoped captain Steven Gerrard, 34, and fellow midfielder Frank Lampard, 36, would continue to make themselves available for England. Both have said they will consider their international futures after the tournament.
"I hope they don't make a bold statement that [former captain and defender] John Terry did after Euro 2012 when he said 'I am retiring from international football'," said Hodgson.
"I'd like them to keep a dialogue between us. They know I'm never going to push them or put under pressure if it's not right, but it's nice to know they're available."
The England coach added: "We had nine players without any World Cup experience. There was only James Milner and Lampard [with experience], until Wayne Rooney and Gerrard came on.
"The back four were completely new to this and our keeper [Ben Foster] hadn't played for a long time. We limited Costa Rica to almost no chances."
England's best opportunities of the match fell to Liverpool striker Sturridge, who headed over from close range and then curled fractionally wide of the far post.
"We created good goal chances, but we didn't take them," said Hodgson. "Another day we could have won the game by one or two goals because we did have a clear dominance in the play after the first 15 to 20 minutes."
Lampard, who won his 106th cap, also thought England should have taken all three points.
"It was the end of a disappointing tournament, obviously," he said.
"We should have won the game as we had the chances. We played some nice stuff, in bits.
"It was a difficult game for us to approach and I thought we did as well as we could but it was a shame not to get the win to take home."
