Stephen Carson, 28, was shot in front of his family in a house at Walmer Street in the Ormeau Road area at about 22:45 GMT.
Three men aged 32, 37 and 39 were arrested following searches in west Belfast on Friday evening.
A gun was found and has been sent for forensic tests.
Mr Carson was shot in the head through a bathroom door
Police said they believe he was murdered as part of a "criminal feud".
He was having a meal with his partner and nine-year-old son when "at least three men carrying a hammer and a shotgun burst into the house".
After a confrontation, Mr Carson ran into a downstairs bathroom.
He was shot through the door of the bathroom.
Following the attack, Mr Carson was taken to hospital, where he died from a fatal head wound.
The officer leading the investigation, Det Supt Kevin Geddes, said the murder was "brutal and cold-blooded".
"Our main line of enquiry, but not our only line of enquiry, is that Stephen was shot as part of a criminal feud," he said.
"We do not believe at this stage there was any paramilitary involvement nor do we believe this was sectarian."
He said Mr Carson was known to police but had been trying to get his life together.
