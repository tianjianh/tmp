[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Gwen Louden in the court's foyer in January.
The girl had been told to leave the court by PC Louden but returned and assaulted her.
The court was told that the police officer was still off work as a result of the incident.
Depute fiscal Stewart Duncan told Dundee Sheriff Court: "The accused was informed she was under arrest for another matter no longer before the court.
"PC Louden took the girl's hand and she pulled away, before PC Louden took her by the wrist.
"A struggle ensued and she then punched PC Louden in the face with her right fist then headbutted the officer to the left side of her face and repeatedly punched her on the head several more times."
PC Louden and a colleague struggled with the girl and pulled her into the main reception area.
Mr Duncan said: "She continued to repeatedly punch and headbutt the officer to the head and face.
"The accused was eventually forced face down on the ground and handcuffed to the rear."
The court was told PC Louden attended Ninewells Hospital with swelling and pain to her left forehead and severe swelling to her left cheekbone
The 16-year-old, of Dundee, admitted a charge of assault to injury on 28 January.
She also admitted breaching a community payback order previously imposed for another offence.
David Duncan, defending, said: "In terms of the offence there's no mitigation that could be properly attached to it.
"It is only the circumstances of this offence that has really opened her up to realise that her conduct could result in imprisonment."
Sheriff Elizabeth Munro deferred sentence until March for a psychiatric report and remanded the girl in custody.
Sheriff Munro said: "She spends Â£180 a fortnight on cannabis with her partner and then says she doesn't have the money to pay her bus fare to engage with her current community payback order.
"On the basis of her repeated failures to attend I'm having difficulty seeing I can trust her."
