UK and Wales Green Party leaders Natalie Bennett and Pippa Bartolotti joined about 200 people on the march from the Guildhall at 12.30 BST.
It was organised by The People's Assembly - a group opposing public sector spending cuts by the UK government.
Campaigners, including Plaid Cymru AM Bethan Jenkins, ended the march with a rally in Castle Gardens.
