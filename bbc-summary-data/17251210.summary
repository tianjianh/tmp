[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Derbyshire council is seeking to boost recycling rates with personal calls to residents.

Two advisors, appointed by South Derbyshire District Council, will call at houses during the next five weeks to discuss recycling face to face.
Officials said they hoped this would help residents find out more about how this and the composting scheme work.
The advisors will also be gathering views on a new cardboard and plastics collection initiative.
The council said it hoped being able to talk to someone face to face would help both novices and existing recyclers.
Peter Watson, chairman of Environmental and Development Services at the council, said: "This campaign provides the perfect opportunity for residents to find out more about recycling and ask questions about all aspects of our schemes.
"Our households have consistently shown their commitment to helping the environment and we want to encourage them to continue their efforts.
"Our experts will clear up any uncertainties and help more people to recycle and compost more of their household waste."
