Net income for the three months to June rose 24% to $1.83bn (Â£1.17bn) from the previous year.
"We had a phenomenal third quarter, delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company," said Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive.
Revenue at its parks and resorts increased 9% to $3.4bn.
At its film studio, operating income increased more than six-fold to $313m.
"Higher worldwide theatrical results reflected the performance of the current quarter releases including Marvel's The Avengers and Brave compared to Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Cars 2 in the prior-year quarter," the media giant said.
In May, superhero movie The Avengers smashed the record for the biggest US opening weekend, taking $200m.
Operating income at Cable Networks increased due to growth at the Disney and ABC Family channels in the US, offsetting a drop at sports channel ESPN.
Its theme park in Paris, Euro Disney, is also celebrating its 20-year anniversary.
