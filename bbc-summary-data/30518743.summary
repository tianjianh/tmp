[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man breached curfew by answering the door for shopping

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man breached his curfew by answering his front door to collect his shopping.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prestatyn Magistrates' Court heard Michael Jones, 59, was confined to his Rhyl flat between 17:00 GMT and 0700.
He admitted breaching a condition of his bail, imposed pending a forthcoming trial, when his shopping was delivered.
His bail was altered to include the whole property, which is divided into four flats, after his electronic tag recorded him as 'absent' for going downstairs to answer the door.
