Andrew Hamilton, from Newton, Chester, was on holiday in Miami with friends when he was hit by a car in the early hours of Tuesday.
Miami Beach Police Department confirmed an investigation was under way.
Mr Hamilton's former teacher Michelle Ford, who is deputy head at St David's High School in Chester, said: "It was a great shock to hear the awful news."
"He was very friendly and popular with students and staff," she told BBC Radio Merseyside.
A fundraising page set up by friends has raised more than Â£6,000 to help Mr Hamilton's family.
Writing on the page, Amber Dower said: "Truly heartbreaking. Andrew was such a genuine and sincere person. RIP Andrew xx"
