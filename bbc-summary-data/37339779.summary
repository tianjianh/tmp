The event, which was held for the first time last year, involves challenging scrambles on Aonach Eagach and Curved Ridge.
It is the third and final event of the 2016 Skyrunner World Series Extreme competition.
The two previous races in the series were held in Norway and Italy in August.
Among those preparing to compete on Sunday are Fort William runner Finlay Wild, Glasgow-based Tom Owens and Edinburgh-based Jasmin Paris.
Joe Symonds, of Glasgow, won the men's race and was first overall in last year's inaugural event. He finished the course in a time of seven hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds.
Sweden's Emelie Forsberg won the women's event and was placed second overall with her time of seven hours, 44 minutes and 19 seconds.
