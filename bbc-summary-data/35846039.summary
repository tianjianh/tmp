Jim Robertson, 61, from the Glasgow area, disappeared on a trip to the Cairngorms.
Police said the searches planned for the weekend would focus on the area of Derry Lodge on the Mar Lodge Estate in Aberdeenshire.
Mr Robertson was thought to have stayed in the Bob Scott Bothy on the estate.
Insp Matt Smith, Police Mountain Rescue Team Leader, said: "Vast areas of the Cairngorms have been searched and we remain indebted to the commitment shown by the volunteers from Braemar, Aberdeen and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Teams as well as the Search and Rescue Dogs Association and air support from the coastguard.
"However, despite this effort Jim is still missing and we are still encouraging hill goers to contact us if they have any information which could assist with the search."
Braemar Mountain Rescue said on their Facebook page: "Over the weekend further searches by Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Team and ourselves will continue and we urge hill users to report anything which may help.
"Jim's family have shown enormous strength and we are hugely grateful to them for starting a fundraising page for us on Just Giving. Stay strong."
The appeal was set with a target of raising Â£1,000 but by Sunday the total stood at more than Â£9,400.
