Coach Vladimir Weiss believes Georgia have to shock Wales to keep their World Cup qualification dreams alive.

Following their 1-0 defeat at the hands of the Republic of Ireland, in Dublin, Georgia are winless after two matches in Group D.
Weiss admitted the match at the Cardiff City Stadium could be the final hope for his side.
"This maybe the last chance to do it, to dream. This is very true," said Weiss.
''I hope we can take points from any team. We have quality, but we must show it, score goals and play with balance between attack and defence.''
Georgia will be without captain Jaba Kankave while defender Solomon Kverkveliya will play with protective head gear after an injury in the Ireland game.
Wales lead Group D on goal difference from Serbia, Austria and Ireland, who are all on four points.
Georgia, who lost despite encouraging showings against Austria and Ireland, are pointless and have only Moldova below them on goal difference.
Defender Zourab Tsiskaridze backed his coach and he too has been heartened by the form of his side.
''You open up the papers in Dublin and you could see the disappointment," said Tsiskaridze.
"Actually it said in big letters - ''Big Escape'' - that was the headline because we dominated that game, its a shame we did not get a point.
''We deserved three. It was the same thing with Austria, maybe not as fantastic a game, but we had three or four chances, but we were not able to capitalise on those chances.''
In the absence of injured Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey, Georgia say they will attempt to plan for the presence of Gareth Bale as they look to build on their record of having won all three previous encounters with Wales.
Tsiskaridze added: ''He has unbelievable quality. With the coach we will make some plan toward that, but it will be an honour to play against him if it happens.''
