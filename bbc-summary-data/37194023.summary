Olympic gold medallist Chris Mears has visited a fake golden postbox installed in his honour in his home village.

The cardboard postbox was put up in Burghfield Common by local postmaster Raj Odedra after Royal Mail refused to paint the actual postbox gold.
Dozens of villagers gathered to pose for photographs with the diving champion on Thursday.
Mears and his diving partner Jack Laugher won the men's synchronised 3m springboard event.
Resident David Gregory said he was "really excited" to have Mears visit.
"We were so impressed with how kind he was with the children. A real gentleman and a role model.
"He was handed cards, flowers and a huge signed Rio gold medal - signed by hundreds of the villagers."
