Security company Arbor Networks said the attack is the biggest they have ever seen.
It is having an impact on popular services like Netflix.
The massive number of computers involved in the attack has slowed down the entire internet.
Security expert Professor Alan Woodward said: "Imagine the internet as a motorway."
"With this attack, there's so much traffic it's clogging up the motorway itself."
