Marine Harry Robinson was recognised for his response to the incident in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province which left one British soldier dead and six injured.
The 24-year-old helped the injured despite being shot at by the gunman.
He received the award from the Princess Royal at Buckingham Palace.
Marine Robinson said: "We were under fire for most of it. I have no idea how I didn't get shot because I wasn't being tactical in any way.
"I was on my knee just treating and then standing up and running to the next bloke."
Marine Robinson, of Taunton-based 40 Commando, said it was "almost pitch black" at the time and he was mostly "feeling for injuries" in the dark because using his torch attracted more gunfire.
After all the casualties had been assessed he remained with a survivor who had been shot six times.
The medic added: "The simple fact is you're the medic and you've got to treat him and you want to do the best job you can for that lad, everything else goes out of the window."
Sapper Richard Walker, a member of 28 Engineer Regiment attached to 21 Engineer Regiment, was killed in the incident on January 7 last year.
The 23-year-old was working on a construction task as part of preparations to hand the camp over to Afghan security forces.
The Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attack.
The Military Cross is awarded to all ranks of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army and Royal Air Force in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land.
