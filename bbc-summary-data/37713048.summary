The owner and founder of Herbert of Liverpool died in the early hours after a long battle with cancer.
Mr Howe also flirted with politics and briefly stood for Mayor of Liverpool in 2012.
Comedian Ricky Tomlinson and Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson led the tributes. Mr Anderson said: "He always wanted to help others."
Tomlinson said of his lifelong friend: "He brought some big acts to Liverpool to perform at his charity dos.
"He absolutely loved showbusiness. He was Mr Bling; that was the name of his building, Bling Bling."
The Royle Family star said he wanted to organise a cabaret show in Mr Howe's memory and donate the money raised to his chosen charities.
Mr Howe, who set up Queenie's Christmas charity in memory of his mother, also featured on ITV docu-soap Shampoo and Channel 5's Celebrity Super Spa.
He put his name forward as an independent candidate for the Mayor of Liverpool in 2012 but withdrew because of what he described as the "viperous attitude" of local politics.
Friend Bernie Buxton from Liverpool Taxi Drivers Children In Care Outing Fund said he was Liverpool's Father Christmas.
"His legacy in the city is the fundraising he has done...  [for] the children and pensioners of Merseyside.
"He will never be forgotten."
Actress Jennifer Ellison and Claire Sweeney were among the celebrities who had their hair cut by Mr Howe.
Ellison tweeted: "Heartbroken. This morning we lost one of the most generous men I have ever met. My friend Herbert of Liverpool."
