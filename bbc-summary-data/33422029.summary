[SN]TITLE[SN]
Betsi maternity judicial review formally ended by judge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has issued an order for a health board to consult on whether to downgrade maternity services at a Denbighshire hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The order formalises a decision by Betsi Cadwaladr health board last week not to contest a judicial review of its proposed changes to services at Ysbyty Glan Glwyd in Bodelwyddan.
Mrs Justice Davies said the board had "lost or eroded the trust" of some employees and people in the community.
The board had to "regain that trust".
The process brings to a close the legal procedure started when campaigners sought a judicial review over the board's plans.
Last week, Betsi's interim chief executive Simon Dean said they had advised the court the board no longer wanted to contest the judicial review, and would now be consulting on the future of services.
The hospital had originally planned to end consultant-led services in April but the bid for judicial review put the plan on hold.
The complainants were awarded their legal costs at the end of the hearing.
