Jordan Miers, who is from the city, was reported missing on Sunday afternoon and police said they are becoming concerned for his safety.
A stretch of the River Tawe has been searched.
Children's football coach Mr Miers is described as 6ft 2ins, of very slim build and with short brown hair.
He was last seen wearing light blue jeans, a blue shirt under a burgundy jumper and tan leather shoes.
A South Wales Police spokeswoman said the force wanted to hear from anyone who might have seen him from 22:30 GMT onwards on Saturday.
"He was reported missing this afternoon but we have received unconfirmed reports he was last seen in the car park of Toys R Us, close to Wind Street, on Saturday night," she said.
"It is thought that Jordan may have walked home, which would have taken him from Parc Tawe car park, along the River Tawe past the Ship Inn towards the Liberty Stadium."
Friends of Mr Miers, who coaches Talycopa FC's under-10s side, have also launched a campaign via social media urging him to make contact.
Darren James tweeted: "My boy's footy coach is missing after being out last night.
"There's police boats going up and down the river. I hope he's ok."
Chloe Bradford added: "If anyone has seen Jordan Miers please message me or ring the police."
