Sarah Lowndes, from Derby, tied the knot with fianc√© David Moore at Makeney Hall in Milford, Derbyshire.
She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, and the disease later spread.
The couple, who met driving buses, were unable to pay for the wedding due to her illness, but were inundated with help to fund the event.
Mother-of-two Ms Lowndes, who met Mr Moore two years after her first diagnosis, said the ceremony went "smoothly", despite forgetting her words at one point. She thanked charity Wish for a Wedding for their help in putting on the ceremony.
"If it wasn't for the charity we wouldn't be where we are today," she said.
Mr Moore said he felt "absolutely brilliant" after the wedding.
"It's the best day of my life," he said.
Wish for a Wedding's Alison Walker, who first met David and Sarah nine weeks ago, said it was a "very, very emotional" event.
"[The ceremony] was beautiful. I didn't expect David to be quite as emotional as he was - I thought Sarah was going to be the one who would be full of tears - but it was lovely seeing them up there," she said.
