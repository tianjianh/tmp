The parcel was "quickly intercepted by vigilant staff" who found the aircraft at HMP Bedford on 6 March, a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said.
Although attempts to smuggle items into prison are "not new", the MoJ said it was "not aware of another incident like this".
Bedfordshire Police said officers had been informed and were investigating.
Farat Erdogan, who runs a nearby convenience store, said he had seen two men with what looked like a drone by traffic lights at the junction of Tavistock St and Harpur St, about two months ago.
"They put it on the ground, [it] took off, it went quite high, quite rapidly, it stayed up there for a little bit then they brought it back down again and at that point I had to go back into my shop."
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Any prisoner who is caught for or suspected of smuggling prohibited items will face tough consequences.
"[This] could include prosecution and a further sentence, closed visits, up to 42 days added to their time in prison or confinement to their cell for up to 21 days with no association time."
