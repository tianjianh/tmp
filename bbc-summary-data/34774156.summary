Pakistan v England: Jos Buttler can rediscover form - Eoin Morgan

England wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler can put his struggles in the Test arena behind him when the one-day series starts against Pakistan, according to captain Eoin Morgan.

ODI vice-captain Buttler was dropped for the third Test in Sharjah after scoring 156 runs in his past 12 innings at an average of 13.
"I am confident he can recapture his form," Morgan told the BBC.
The first ODI of the four-match series takes place on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi.
Pakistan won the three-Test series 2-0.
Buttler, who averages 32.60 in 61 ODIs, made 38 off 37 balls in England's 169-run warm-up victory over Hong Kong on Sunday.
"In the last four years, he's been outstanding and has shown glimpses of world-class ability," said Morgan.
"He plays a formidable role within our squad, he holds some fantastic records, and he's keen to come out and express himself in this series."
With Test opening bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad not in the one-day squad and Mark Wood and Steven Finn ruled out with injury, the series will test the depth of England's seam options.
Reece Topley, who has only one ODI cap, is among the bowlers in the squad, along with fellow left-armer David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes.
"Not having the senior of our bowlers here presents opportunities for our younger guys," Morgan said.
"We have two left-armers in our squad and Liam Plunkett and Chris Jordan, who have different aspects to their game that might come into use out here, where the ball doesn't move that much off the straight and you have to come up with different ideas."
Willey says he and other players who did not play in the Test series could be "undercooked" after having only one warm-up game to adjust to the conditions in the United Arab Emirates.
The Yorkshire all-rounder clamed 4-43 from 10 overs against Hong Kong, but Topley and Woakes only bowled seven apiece.
Plunkett and Jordan, who were unused members of the Test squad, did not play in the warm-up match.
"We could have probably done with a couple of extra days out here, just to get adjusted to the heat, coming from the cold back in England," Willey said.
"A few extra days in the warm to bowl would have been handy."
Morgan will be playing his first international match since being hit on the head by a Mitchell Starc bouncer in the fifth ODI against Australia at Old Trafford in September.
The 29-year-old said: "It was probably about 10 days before I was completely right.
"I had feelings of off-balance, grogginess, a little bit of blurred vision. I was worried - it was a weird feeling that I've never had before.
"I've worked on the short ball quite a lot so hopefully it will put me in good stead for this series."
Pakistan batsman Shoaib Malik, who retired from Test cricket despite making a double century in the first Test and claiming Test-best figures in the third, could play after returning to form in Pakistan's warm-up match.
The all-rounder hit 63 from 49 balls in the win over Nepal, while captain Azhar Ali made a run-a-ball 73 and 21-year-old batsman Babar Azam, who has played only three ODIs, 43 off 29 balls.
Seven-foot paceman Mohammad Irfan is likely to be part of the hosts' bowling attack.
