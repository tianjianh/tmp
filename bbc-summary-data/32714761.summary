The 16-year-old's body parts were found about two weeks after she went missing from her home in Bristol in February.
The city's Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) has confirmed a serious case review will take place.
Chair Sally Lewis said it would analyse "what happened and how agencies worked together".
She said: "Whilst it is understood we can never eliminate risk completely, we will be thorough in establishing what can be learnt from this very sad event to identify if there is anything that services can do differently to prevent a future tragedy."
Becky Watts' stepbrother Nathan Matthews, 28, from Warmley, has been charged with her murder.
He has yet to enter a plea and a provisional trial date has been set for October.
His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, is charged with perverting the course of justice.
Four other defendants, Jaydene Parsons, 23; James Ireland, 23; and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, were charged with assisting an offender.
