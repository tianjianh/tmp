Asylum patients' artwork goes on display in Dumfries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collection of artwork by patients at a notorious Scottish asylum has gone on display in Dumfries.

The works were created by at least 46 patients at the the town's Crichton Royal Hospital in the late 1800s.
Each of them were treated by Dr William Browne, a pioneering physician who believed that art, music and literature could be therapeutic activities for people with mental illnesses.
A Hidden Gem will be on show at Gracefield Arts Centre until 22 August.
It is believed to be the earliest surviving collection of art by a group of psychiatric patients anywhere in the world.
Dr Browne gave an account of his work in an 1880 edition of The Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology.
In the article, entitled "Mad Artists", he describes a collection of "three gigantic volumes" produced by "lunatics in different forms and phases of derangement".
Just over 100 years later, in 1983, a large leather bound volume of 134 works of art was found at the hospital. It was called "Art in Madness" by WAF Browne.
It is these works which have been specially mounted and framed for the Gracefield exhibition.
Gracefield's arts officer Dawn Henderby said: "The artwork is delightful in so many ways - fresh and lively with none of the constraints of preconception of what art should be.
"The idea of 'outsider art' has become more common place today, but in the 1880s, Browne's ideas were ground-breaking."
Councillor Tom McAughtrie said: "It's a unique opportunity to see an important collection of work, and see the value that art practice can bring to everyone's lives, irrespective of circumstance, age or ability."
