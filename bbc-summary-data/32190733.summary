The man is described as white, in his 20s or 30s, about 6ft tall with a slim build.
He has short or shaved hair and was wearing a white T-shirt and light grey jogging bottoms.
Det Sgt Kelly McEwan said: "Understandably, the victims were extremely shaken and upset by this man's actions. Police will not tolerate such behaviour and are we keen to identify him as quickly as possible."
