[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 35-year-old man was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital from the scene in Southampton Street on Tuesday, and died the next day.
A 24-year-old man was treated by ambulance staff on Wednesday but died at the property.
A man aged 41 and a woman aged 36 were arrested on suspicion of class A drugs offences. Both have been bailed.
Post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests are due to be carried out on those who died.
The man in hospital, who is in his 40s, is in a stable condition, Thames Valley Police said.
Drugs paraphernalia was found at the multi-occupancy property, but officers said they had not yet linked it to the deaths.
Stan Gilmour, local policing area commander for Reading, said: "We would like to thank the residents of the Southampton Street area for their patience and tolerance while we conduct our inquiries into these men's deaths."
