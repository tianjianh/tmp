A campaign to raise money for the family of a lorry driver murdered in an attack on a Berlin Christmas market has raised almost £170,000 in six days.

The online effort was started by "fellow trucker" Dave Duncan, from Otley, West Yorkshire, in support of Lukasz Urban's relatives.
More than 10,000 people have donated to the fund since it was launched last week.
Mr Duncan said he had been "overwhelmed" by people's generosity.
Polish national Mr Urban was found dead in the passenger seat of his lorry after it smashed into Berlin's Breitscheidplatz market on 19 December, killing 12 people.
Identified attacker Anis Amri, a Tunisian, was shot dead by Italian police on 23 December in the city of Milan after a Europe-wide manhunt.
Mr Duncan said he had been shocked by what happened and had wanted to reach out to Mr Urban's family.
Writing on his GoFundMe page, Mr Duncan said he had received an email from Mr Urban's wife.
"She is extremely grateful for what you have all done for her and her family," he wrote.
He added: "Hopefully all your kind and generous donations will get to Lukasz's wife sooner rather than later."
Mr Duncan said he had also contacted the Polish Embassy asking for their help in getting the funds raised to the family.
