Francis Benali, who made more than 300 appearances for Southampton FC, ran a marathon and cycled 75 miles (120km) each day for a fortnight in October.
The city council unanimously approved a motion giving him honorary freedom of the city at a special meeting earlier.
Benali, 47, described receiving the honour as "a complete surprise".
"It's just wonderful to be thought of," he added.
The honour was awarded in recognition of Benali's fund raising achievements for charitable causes, as well those as a player and coach at Saints, the authority said.
It confers no rights or privileges, such as driving sheep through the city, and is "purely ceremonial", it added.
The 1,000-mile (1,600km) route linking 44 football clubs took him to south Wales, the Midlands and the North-West, before crossing the country and returning via East Anglia and London.
He raised more than Â£390,000 for Cancer Research.
Benali received a standing ovation from fans when he arrived at St Mary's Stadium at half-time during a home match against Burnley on 16 October.
It followed another challenge in 2014 which saw him running between 20 Premier League stadiums and raising more than Â£265,000 for charity.
As a result he was presented with the Barclays Spirit of the Game award in December 2014, acknowledged as the Cancer Research UK Flame of Hope Award Winner 2015, Fundraising Volunteer of the Year and also the Just Giving Celebrity Fundraiser of the Year 2015.
Other individuals to have been given the honour in Southampton include former Saints managers Ted Bates and Lawrie McMenemy, former player Matthew Le Tissier, and World War One prime minister David Lloyd George.
