[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 5-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe were ruthless in front of goal as they won for the first time in 12 games with a League Two demolition of Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Artell picked up his first win as the Railwaymen's boss to ease the club's relegation fears.
George Cooper and Chris Dagnall both hit a brace to sweep the strugglers into a four-goal lead before the half-hour mark.
Cooper tucked the ball past James McKeown from the tightest of angles to give his side a flying start in the second minute.
Grimsby responded with Jamey Osbourne - who had an unsuccessful trial at Crewe last summer - forcing a good save out of Ben Garratt with a rasping drive.
Opportunist finishing from Dagnall in the 16th minute doubled the lead with the striker hooking a low shot under the despairing McKeown.
Defender Ben Nugent and Jordan Bowery went close and the Railwaymen looked threatening whenever they piled forward.
They had been the joint lowest scorers in League Two before the game, but they surprised even their die-hard fans when they picked off two more goals in quick succession.
First Cooper curled a superb free-kick from the edge of the D over the wall after 25 minutes. Then four minutes later Dagnall also grabbed his second when he was on hand to prod home from close range after Bowery helped on Cooper's low cross.
Grimsby improved slightly after Marcus Bignot made a triple substitution at the break, but Tom Bolarinwa blazed high and wide with an easy late chance.
Crewe still piled forward with McKeown pushing Bowery's fierce drive around the post before excelling himself when tipping over an ambitious volley from the halfway line from the impressive Cooper.
Callum Cooke then wrapped up it up three minutes from time on his home debut when he slid a low shot into the corner of the net from Callum Ainley's ball.
