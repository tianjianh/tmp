Six Nations 2016: Rhys Webb called up to Wales squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have called Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb into their Six Nations squad after six months out of international rugby with injury.

The 27-year-old met up with the squad on Monday morning as they gathered ahead of their match against England.
Webb made his comeback from injury for Ospreys in mid-February and has not played for Wales since injuring a foot against Italy in September.
He led the team and played 80 minutes in Ospreys' 19-16 defeat by Leinster.
Webb established himself as Wales' first-choice scrum-half ahead of Mike Phillips after crossing for three tries in the 2015 Six Nations Championship.
However, he left the field on a stretcher in Wales' final warm-up game before the World Cup, where his place was taken by Gareth Davies.
The Scarlets number nine has since gone on to score six tries - five of them in the World Cup - and was named man of the match in Wales' 19-10 win against France.
Webb suffered a setback on his return for Ospreys when a clash of heads ruled him out for a week.
But he has looked assured in two matches since, and completed the full game against Leinster.
Both teams are unbeaten in this season's Six Nations, with England on course for a first Grand Slam since 2003 and Wales likely to be tournament favourites if they win at Twickenham.
