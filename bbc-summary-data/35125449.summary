[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-soldier Carl Murdoch jailed for Barnstaple rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former soldier has been jailed for nine years after being convicted of rape for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Murdoch, 36, left his victim with "serious psychological trauma" after dragging her down an alleyway and attacking her in Barnstaple, Devon.
He appeared to be reformed after the previous rape, the court heard, and had married and "settled down to family life" until the attack in January 2014.
Recorder Philip Mott QC branded him a "dangerous offender".
Murdoch, of Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, denied rape but was convicted by a jury who were not told of his previous conviction.
After his conviction Exeter Crown Court was told the former soldier at RMB Chivernor had served seven years in prison after being found guilty in 2004 of raping a 15-year-old girl.
The court heard the second victim had met him only once before and had been drinking with him and her friends in a pub before the attack.
Mr Philip Mott said: "You may have stopped in a doorway but at the most she agreed to mere kissing... You used force and it must have been apparent from her reaction that she did not consent."
He said the impact on the woman had been "deep and lasting and tragic".
Murdoch was jailed for nine years with a six year extended licence and placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
