Police have released the full CCTV film from a Kirkcaldy bank which was held up by two armed men in January.

The men stole money from the TSB bank on Dunearn Drive on 29 January before escaping on bicycles.
The six-minute film shows them pointing what appears to be a handgun at staff before filling green bags with cash.
Officers have appealed for information about the two men, at least one of whom is believed to be Eastern European.
Staff were threatened by the men with the gun and a crowbar, which can also be seen in the footage. No-one was injured in the raid.
After leaving the bank at about 10:40, the two men cycled off along Alford Avenue and were spotted a short time later on Cawdor Crescent.
Both were white, roughly 30 years old and were wearing dark-coloured baseball caps.
One suspect, who was about 5ft 9in (1.75m) tall, was wearing dark blue jogging bottoms with a distinctive white logo, which police have established is that of Mordex, a Polish brand associated with bodybuilding.
Det Insp Colin Robson, who is leading the investigation, said he hoped the footage could jog the memory of people in the area.
He said: "I can reassure the local community that we're working tirelessly to track down these men and will exhaust all avenues of inquiry.
"While the answer to their identity remains unknown, it may lie in the local community and I would urge anyone who views this footage, which is being shared nationally, and who recognises them or their description to contact police immediately."
