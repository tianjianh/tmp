Mike Buss, who raised about £40,000 for Help For Heroes, remains angry and fears people still think he was guilty.
"I wouldn't raise a penny for them ever again," said the 41-year-old from Highworth, Wiltshire, who was acquitted of theft last month.
A charity spokesman said they had "already been in touch with Mr Buss to see what support we can offer him".
Between 2009 and 2011, the ex-serviceman raised funds by running 24 hours on a treadmill and completing 100 marathons in as many days.
Last year, though, he was arrested and accused of defrauding the charity of the money he had raised.
After he was cleared at Swindon Crown Court, Mr Buss said he had contacted the Wiltshire-based charity "for answers" but had "so far had no joy".
"I worked so hard and this is how I've been repaid," he said.
"I spent nearly three years putting my body through a lot of physically demanding challenges to raise money for Help for Heroes.
"But people still think I'm guilty. Even now, over a month after I was proved innocent, I've had threats of violence and death threats.
"I've lost everything - I was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for nearly three months, and I'm still taking tablets for depression and anxiety."
Help for Heroes said the court case was brought against Mr Buss by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) following a police investigation.
The CPS said it had "considered all the available evidence" before deciding "there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest" to bring charges.
The judge dismissed a count of fraud but left the jury to decide on the count of theft, a spokesperson added.
"When the jury reached its verdict, it decided that Mr Buss should be acquitted. We respect this decision."
