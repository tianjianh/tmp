Seven-week-old "Laurie" suffered serious facial injuries including a broken jaw when dropped on the M58 in Merseyside at 05:30 BST on Wednesday.
A Tesco lorry driver spotted him cowering in the central reservation, and thought he had been run over.
Laurie is on painkillers and is also being treated for an infection. Vets are unsure whether he will survive.
Stephanie Taylor, from the Rescue Me Animal Sanctuary, said: "I was woken up by one of our supporters saying she needed help as they have got a kitten in the car. The lorry driver put him in the footwell and didn't know what to do.
"We had the cat checked over by the vet who said the injuries were more likely sustained by being thrown from a moving vehicle landing on its face."
In addition to a broken jaw - which cannot be wired and is infected - Laurie has a badly scraped face, a split lip, and has lost his lower teeth.
He had been in a "great deal of pain," said Ms Taylor, who added that he was very affectionate and enjoys rubbing up against people and purring.
It is the third kitten admitted to the sanctuary this week after being "dumped in isolated places with horrific injuries", she said.
