Nick Thomas, 45, from Ellesmere in Shropshire, was pulled unconscious from the water as he neared the end of the 21-mile endurance feat.
A spokesman for the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation said he was taken from the water "less than a mile from the finish in France".
Mr Thomas had set off from Dover on Saturday morning and had been swimming for about 16 hours.
He was pulled unconscious from the water on Sunday before being given CPR and taken to Calais where he was pronounced dead.
"There was an extremely experienced support team on board the support vessel," the spokesman added.
"It is an extreme sport, we know the risks. He was doing what he loved doing. Our thoughts are with his family."
The 45-year-old had successfully swum the Channel in 2014 as part of an Enduroman ultra triathlon but at that time was wearing a wetsuit.
He was not wearing one on Saturday to comply with the Channel Swimming Association's rules for cross channel swimming.
Enduroman Ultra Events, which was tweeting his solo progress, wrote: "Our friend Nick Thomas left us whilst doing what he loved - he just kept going.
"He'll always be a part of what we do and who we are."
