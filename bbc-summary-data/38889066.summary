Vincent Sasso volleyed the Owls ahead before Danny Graham's header went in off Sam Hutchinson to put Rovers level.
Defender Sasso rose highest to head the hosts back ahead, but Blackburn went close when Marvin Emnes struck the bar.
In the closing stages, Akpan had a goal disallowed for handball and was given a straight red for his excessive protest.
The 25-year-old appeared to raise his arms to referee Duncan, prompting the official to dismiss the Rovers midfielder without hesitation.
Wednesday remain sixth in the Championship, but now have a four-point cushion in the final play-off place, while Blackburn are down to second-bottom.
Ross Wallace had already hit the bar with a free-kick before Sasso opened the scoring, the French defender netting his first league goals since November 2013.
Owen Coyle's side suffered a blow when Sam Gallagher was stretchered off after being caught by Hutchinson prior to half-time.
Before Emnes struck the underside of the crossbar, both he and Liam Feeney were denied by excellent saves from home goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"In these type of games we need a goal to calm us down, we achieved this goal and thought we could then play our football.
"But we didn't have time to taste the goal because after two minutes Blackburn scored and it was 1-1.
"We can't always play opera when we are playing against gladiators, sometimes we must put clothes on like gladiators to achieve the points.
"We played efficiently and achieved the three points."
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle:
"We don't control what decisions are given and the stuff that went against Blackburn Rovers tonight was beyond belief.
"Sometimes you can take an odd decision here and there, but for three or four huge decisions to be given against the football club, I thought it was beyond belief.
"We have scored three good goals tonight, but that has resulted in only one being awarded.
"Followed on from the fact that young Sam Gallagher is sat in there with 12 stitches across a deep gash on his knee that was punished with a yellow card.
"It is hard to take because of how well the players played tonight and how much the players put into the game."
