The report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) is due in December.
It is expected to clarify concerns about Russian doping, specifically at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Deas' team-mate Lizzy Yarnold may boycott Sochi following allegations of Russian state-sponsored doping.
"It's a really disappointing position to be in as clean athlete," Deas said.
"Once again preparations are being compromised by people who don't like to abide by the rules and it's frustrating to be in this position as a sport, not just as an individual."
A second Wada report from Canadian law professor and sports lawyer Dr Richard McLaren is due next month.
His first report, released in July 2016, stated the doping programme in Russia was "planned and operated" from late 2011 and continued through the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics until August 2015.
Deas, 28, said she would not make any "long-term decisions" until the publication of the second report.
"There's a lot of World Cup racing to do between now and then so that's what I'm going to focus on," she said.
The World Championships take place from 16-25 February.
