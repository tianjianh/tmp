County Championship: Mark Stoneman's century leads Durham response

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Stoneman's unbeaten century helped Durham fight back against Middlesex on day two at Chester-le-Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England all-rounder Ben Stokes (4-80) had Paul Stirling caught behind and bowled Steven Finn as Middlesex went from 358-7 overnight to 389 all out.
Durham's reply began quickly, racing to 71-0 from 12.4 overs before Finn (3-59) had Keaton Jennings (34) caught behind.
Stoneman reached his ton off 139 balls and ended on 139 not out as the hosts finished on 295-4, trailing by 94 runs.
The 28-year-old, who hit 12 fours on the way to his 15th first-class hundred, shared a 131-run third-wicket partnership with Jack Burnham (61) before the latter was trapped lbw by Finn.
Finn then had England team-mate Stokes caught at mid-wicket by Stirling for just nine but opener Stoneman remained untroubled.
Wicketkeeper Michael Richardson (31no) shared an unbroken 64-run fifth-wicket stand with Stoneman before snow brought play to a premature close.
