[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stained glass window commemorating the sacrifice of the Inniskilling Regiments that fought in World War One has been installed at a County Fermanagh cathedral.

It was commissioned by the Inniskillings Museum in Enniskillen.
The window at St Macartin's Cathedral honours those who served in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons.
It commemorates those who died, those who survived and their families.
Some who returned from the trenches faced a lifetime of physical and psychological trauma.
The window will be dedicated on Friday at an ecumenical service of reflection to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.
St Macartin's Cathedral contains the Inniskilling Regimental Chapel, where the standards that once rallied the troops and list past battle honours, including The Somme, are laid up.
World War One was only the third occasion that both Inniskilling regiments shared the same battlefield since they were raised to defend Enniskillen in 1688 from the forces of the Catholic King James II.
Dean of Clogher Kenneth Hall said: "The men and women who fought for their country are to be honoured with gratitude.
"They gave their lives for a cause they believed to be true, and by installing this commemorative stained glass window we remember their sacrifice.
"But also we need to remember the effect that that has had on so many who fought and survived and had to live with varied and mixed emotions."
"War endeavours to bring peace and justice, but true peace can only be found in the God of Peace in whom we should place our trust and in whose name this window will be dedicated."
The Sunday service from St Macartin's Cathedral on 3 July reflecting on the centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Ulster at 10:15 BST.
