Kriss Donald murderer Daanish Zahid jailed for appeal lies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the men jailed for life for murdering Glasgow teenager Kriss Donald has been given another jail term for lying in a bid to free an accomplice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daanish Zahid, 31, gave evidence during Imran Shahid's 2011 appeal against his conviction for the racially-motivated murder of the 15-year-old in 2004.
Judges threw out Shahid's appeal after concluding Zahid had lied.
Zahid was jailed for another six years after he admitted attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
He is already serving a minimum of 17 years after being found guilty of abducting and murdering the schoolboy.
The additional sentence, which will begin when the minimum term ends, means it could be 2027 before he is freed.
Three other men - Imran Shahid, his brother Zeeshan Shahid and Faisal Mushtaq - were also jailed for life for the murder after being convicted in 2006.
Shahid, who was the ringleader of the gang, was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years - his brother received a minimum of 23 years and Mushtaq 22 years.
Mushtaq and Zeeshan Shahid abandoned their plans to appeal against their minimum jail terms in 2009.
Imran Shahid's appeal was eventually thrown out in 2011 despite Zahid giving evidence on his behalf.
During that case, Zahid insisted Shahid was "innocent" and that another Glasgow-based Asian gang was behind the murder.
Zahid claimed he had been threatened into silence and then revealed a string of texts supposedly naming the "real killers".
But appeal judges criticised the evidence - while also throwing out Shahid's appeal - before ordering an investigation into the lies.
It lead to Zahid being jailed again.
As Zahid was jailed again, Kriss Donald's mother Angela screamed "yes" and shouted: "Hope you die in jail".
