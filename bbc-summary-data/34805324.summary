CAA approves Gatwick Airport airspace departures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gatwick Airport has been given approval to run six narrower flight paths to allow planes to fly in less airspace.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said aircraft taking off from Gatwick would be more concentrated following advances in aviation navigation.
It said the aim was to reduce the environmental impact of flights, with fewer people affected by the noise.
Sally Pavey, of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign, said it would be like having "a superhighway of planes".
There are an average of 350 daily flights from Gatwick's single runway.
The CAA's approval follows its review of the impact of a 2013 airspace change for departures.
Advanced satellite navigation technology means aircraft no longer have to fly over ground-based beacons, allowing planes to fly closer together and use less airspace.
New European legislation requires the UK to maximise this technology and the concentrated flight paths are Gatwick's response to this.
Phil Roberts, the CAA's head of airspace, air traffic management and aerodromes, said: "We absolutely understand that aircraft noise disturbs many people and we have taken the required amount of time to fully assess the considerable amount of feedback we have received from across the local communities.
"As we have done throughout this review, we will continue to consider the environmental impact of all our airspace decisions."
Opponents have claimed Gatwick is blighting some parts of the south east.
Tonbridge and Malling Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said he would have to look into the changes in more detail but urged Gatwick to "become a better neighbour".
"There are communities as far over as Hildenborough and Tonbridge, running through Leigh and Penshurst, Chiddingstone, Edenbridge and even over my own home, just south of Edenbridge, who are very badly affected by the noise and it is absolutely unbearable."
Gatwick Airport said in time the narrowing of the flight paths would allow it to switch some of them on and off, providing some respite for people facing a "concentrated over-flight".
