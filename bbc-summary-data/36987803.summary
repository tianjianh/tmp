In a repeat of the 2015 final, Arsenal took the lead when Casey Stoney fired in from a Williams corner.
Aileen Whelan headed the equaliser and Jess Clarke slotted into the corner to put the visitors ahead.
But Arsenal - winners four times in the Cup's five-year history - drew level through Kelly Smith's shot, before Williams' spot-kick secured the win.
