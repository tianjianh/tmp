Susannah Townsend then finished off Hannah Martin's run before Gurjit Kaur pulled one back from a penalty corner.

Ansley put England ahead from the penalty spot before Danson reacted quickest as the umpire played advantage to hammer in from close range.
India hit the post late in the second quarter and piled on the pressure before half-time but could not find the target from their penalty corners.
They were left to rue their mistakes when England grabbed a third goal - their best of the match - as Martin dribbled to the by-line and found Townsend.
India finally scored through Kaur's low flick into the bottom-right corner but Martin wrapped up an easy victory for England.
England head coach Danny Kerry missed his side's past two fixtures as he is unwell and it has been confirmed that he will not attend the squad's remaining matches.
