Ministers from countries conducting air strikes against the Islamic State group are to discuss intensifying the military campaign.

The meeting on Wednesday in Paris, the first of its kind, will involve defence ministers from countries including the UK, the US, Germany and France.
It is expected to discuss strengthening military operations in Iraq and Syria.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the coalition aimed to "dismantle" the group's "structure and capabilities".
In December MPs voted in favour of UK airstrikes against the militant group in Syria.
The UK has been carrying out airstrikes against the group in Iraq since 2014.
Mr Fallon will say: "We have made strong progress in recent weeks.
"Now the campaign is moving into a new phase where we aim to systematically dismantle Daesh's (also known as the Islamic State group) structure and capabilities.
"That means striking harder at the head of the snake, with an increased focus on infrastructure, lines of communication and supply routes."
The meeting comes as government figures show that UK air strikes have risen from a monthly average of 29 between May and October last year to more than 80 in December.
In January the RAF conducted 31 strikes in the first week alone.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK will also deploy HMS St Albans to patrol the waters of the Gulf, protecting the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle as strike operations are conducted.
St Albans will also perform a similar role for the US carrier Harry S Truman, the MoD added.
Meanwhile on Wednesday Mr Fallon will also announce that nearly 1,000 British troops are to be sent to Poland for Nato exercises.
The UK is sending about 800 military personnel for Exercise Anakonda and 150 personnel to Exercise Swift Response, Michael Fallon will say.
Mr Fallon is due to confirm the deployment after talks with his Polish counterpart Antoni Macierewicz.
A further 1,000 personnel will also be sent to Nato's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force in 2020, he will add.
Mr Fallon and Mr Macierewicz are expected to discuss the security relationship between the two countries when they meet in Edinburgh.
The frigate HMS Iron Duke will visit Poland on Nato duties this summer.
The helicopter carrier HMS Ocean will also take part in a Baltic Sea exercise, and a Royal Navy minehunter is due to visit Poland in the autumn.
