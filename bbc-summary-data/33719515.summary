The 27-year-old's body was found by police after they were called to a property on Central Promenade in Douglas at 09:00 BST.
A police spokeswoman said the cause of death was "unknown" but not thought to be suspicious.
The Plymouth-born entrepreneur lived in the Isle of Man for most of his life and ran a telecommunications company.
He was the youngest-ever candidate when he appeared on the BBC One show in 2010, at 21 years old.
Leading tributes to Baggs, Lord Sugar tweeted: "terrible news Stuart Baggs has died. My sincere condolences to his family and friends. RIP one of the stand out characters of the apprentice."
Insp Michelle McKillop said: "We can confirm that there was nothing in his room or anything about his condition that indicates to us any cause of death.
"Our thoughts go to his family and friends at this difficult time," she added.
There was "nothing to indicate that his death is criminally suspicious at this time", and the death would be fully investigated on behalf of the coroner, a police spokeswoman added.
Ramsey resident Baggs, who was fired in the semi-final, became famous for his one liners which included "Everything I touch turns to sold" and "I'm Stuart Baggs the brand".
The series was eventually won by 30-year-old investment banker Stella English from London.
Baggs launched his company Bluewave Communications in 2007 and had held a press conference on Tuesday to launch his latest product on the Isle of Man - a home hub.
He tweeted about the success of the launch on Wednesday.
His friend and employee Ryan Gilmour said: "Stuart was an inspirational boss - he was a friend, a mentor. He'd come in full of enthusiasm every single day to work.
"He was funny, he'd come in straight away and he'd cheer you up... he'd motivate you, he was such a great guy."
