Stormont crisis: Belfast is talking about the weather - not politics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crisis? What crisis?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The political world in Northern Ireland is in a whirl.
The Ulster Unionists are leaving the Executive and the assembly could crumble if the Democratic Unionist Party do the same.
But have people on the streets of Belfast even noticed what's happening at Stormont?
Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme conducted a survey to find out.
It wasn't the most scientific, but it involved brightly coloured stickers, so people were happy to get involved.
The survey consisted of one question - what have you been talking about today?
There were nine different answers to choose from; the weather, school starting, uniforms, sport, holidays, family, work, Stormont, and other.
Unsurprisingly, after a wash-out summer, 16 people said the weather was what they were talking about today.
Next was holidays with 11 votes, then sport with seven, school with six and other topics five (these included surprise birthday parties, 50-year-old watches, and problematic bus lanes).
At the bottom of the list with three votes were work ... and Stormont.
However, those who said they were talking about Stormont were very concerned indeed.
One man said: "We don't need those people arguing in Stormont.
"Whatever makes them happy makes them happy, but sit together and sort it out. End of."
Another woman said: "People just don't want any upset, they just want to keep it the way it is at the minute, without any trouble."
Those who are talking about the activities of Northern Ireland's Assembly are few and far between.
Lots of people said they had no interest in politics, were disillusioned with it and fed-up with politicians.
Despite the headlines of political crisis, people in Northern Ireland have seen crises come and go before.
They've even seen the assembly come and go.
Belfast taxi drivers are always in the know when it comes to what people are saying about our politicians and Northern Ireland politics.
But they weren't talking about Stormont either.
One driver said: "Nobody has has any interest in Stormont.
"We're sick of listening to it. We don't even talk about it as taxi drivers anymore.
"Who cares if it falls apart? Who really gives a fiddlers?"
