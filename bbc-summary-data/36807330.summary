Partick Thistle have signed David Crawford on a short-term deal to solve a goalkeeping crisis ahead of their season opener against Airdrieonians.

Scotland's domestic football season kicks off on Friday with three Scottish League Cup ties.
Thistle number one Tomas Cerny had already been ruled out through injury and deputy Ryan Scully is struggling with a thigh strain.
So they turned to 31-year-old Crawford, who was released by Alloa Athletic.
Crawford, who only played 12 times for the Wasps last season as they suffered relegation from the Scottish Championship, featured for the Premiership side as a trialist in a friendly against Greenock Morton last weekend.
Thistle will become the 10th side for whom he has played should he debut against the Diamonds, with Ayr United and Dumbarton among Crawford's former clubs.
Scully, who signed a new two-year contract in May, was hoping to establish himself as first choice after a run of games at the end of last season following an injury to Cerny.
"I got a taste of the action towards the end of the season," said the 23-year-old ahead of Thistle's visit to Excelsior Stadium.
"It was a great experience for me to play at the highest level in Scotland and it gives me the extra bit of confidence knowing I can play at that level.
"With Tomas' form last year, it was going to take an injury for me to step in, but it is up to me now.
"If I get my chance then hopefully I can take it."
