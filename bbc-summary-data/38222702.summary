[SN]TITLE[SN]
NI is top UK region for export growth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's manufacturing export performance is improving at a better rate than any other part of the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
HM Revenue and Customs data for the 12 months to September shows a 6% rise in the value of exports to £7.4bn.
Developing export business is crucial to Northern Ireland's economy and is a priority at Stormont.
Businesses have been helped by a slump in the pound, which makes their goods more competitively priced in the Eurozone and the United States.
More than £4bn worth of export business was done with the EU in the period covered.
Export trade with the Republic of Ireland has risen by 3% to £2.3bn.
But the largest growth market has been the US - which is up by 30%.
Northern Ireland's improvement is in contrast to Scotland, where exports have decreased.
