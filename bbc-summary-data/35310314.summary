Cumbria Wildlife Trust warns over seal's car boot 'rescue'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wildlife group has warned people not to assume young animals on their own are in trouble after a seal pup was "rescued" by being put into a car boot and driven to a nature reserve.

Cumbria Wildlife Trust said it was taken to the facility at South Walney after being spotted on a nearby beach.
Another was "chased into the sea" to encourage it to return to the reserve.
The trust said adult seals often leave youngsters alone on a beach while they go fishing.
Interfering with them disturbs the animals and their reaction can be to bite, the organisation added.
Marine conservation officer Dr Emily Baxter said: "People often do not realise that seals need to come up on to the beaches to rest.
"There is a misconception that they are sick, when they are more than likely perfectly fine and just resting or sleeping.
"Grey seals spend about as much time out of the water as they do in it, it is part of their normal behaviour.
"Chasing seals back into the sea is stopping them from what they need to do."
David Harpley, the trust's conservation manager, said: "People are acting with the best intentions, but they should leave the seals alone.
"Putting one in the boot of your car is the silliest thing you can do. They have teeth like lions and you're also taking them away from their family."
