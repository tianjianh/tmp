[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Â£4m crematorium is being built in Dorset to ease pressure amid high service demand, developers have said.

There are currently three in the county at Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth.
Harbour View Crematorium is expected to open in the Purbecks in the autumn to relieve demand at Poole Crematorium.
Poole, which was built in the mid-1980s to alleviate pressure in Bournemouth, was 22 out of 281 in the UK last year in terms of demand, according to the Cremation Society.
It carried out 2,610 cremations in 2016.
Bournemouth came fifth with 3,300, while Weymouth was at 177 with 1,362 cremations.
The 70-acre (28-hectare) crematorium site at Harbour View includes an underground crematory, burial ground and chapel - to accommodate 100 people.
"Poole Crematorium opened in 1985 to assist with pressure on Bournemouth and now Poole needs assistance," said Steven Tapper, joint managing director at Tapper Funeral Service, which is developing the new site.
"Harbour View will take the pressure off Poole to enable it to offer more to residual families."
Poole Crematorium has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.
Weymouth does not have as high demand due to a lower population in that area, he added.
Plans for Harbour View, which will service the Isle of Purbeck, central Dorset, including Blandford, and south-west Poole, were approved by Purbeck District Council last year.
