The day-night Test between England and West Indies on Thursday is a "step into the unknown," says bowler Stuart Broad.

Edgbaston will host the first ever Test to be played under these conditions in England, and the fifth in international cricket anywhere.
Play will start at 14:00 BST and continue until 21:00 BST, with an additional 30 minutes possible at the end of each day's play.
"I just don't know what to expect," said 31-year-old Broad.
"We are just going to have to be so adaptable on the day and figure out what's going on."
Australia beat New Zealand in Adelaide in the inaugural day-night Test in November 2015, while Australia have also beaten South Africa and Pakistan under lights.
The other day-night Test involved West Indies, who were beaten by Pakistan in October 2016.
Broad says he is "excited" by the concept of the format, with teams wearing traditional white clothing but using a pink Dukes ball.
"I watched the day-night match in Adelaide and enjoyed it. The exciting thing as a player is we are going in with a clear mind and learning on the job almost," he said.
"The team which will come out successful this week will be the team which reacts quicker. It's stepping into the unknown completely."
England are coming off the back of a 3-1 series victory over South Africa, whereas the West Indies side have lost six consecutive Test series, their last win coming against Bangladesh in 2014.
The Windies will be missing some of their key players, including Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Darren Sammy and Marlon Samuels.
Broad, who has taken 379 Test wickets, says England are expecting the inexperienced opposition to be "hungry".
"We've got a huge amount of respect for the way the West Indies play and the competitive spirit they bring," he added.
"Every ball in this series is going to be competitive and we have to be switched on to that."

Durham all-rounder Paul Collingwood, who played 68 Tests for England between 2003 and 2011, criticised the introduction of the pink ball.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show on Monday, he said: "It will do all sorts in the first 10 overs and then it becomes this soft as plastic thing that you can't hit that doesn't deviate off anywhere.
"It's shocking. It feels like plastic when you hit it. Apparently they don't like using [Australian manufactured] Kookaburras in England because of the weather.
"I played in one four-day game against Worcestershire and the opening batsman was laughing.
"Ben Stokes played and he couldn't even lay a bat on it. John Hastings was swinging it like a one-wood off the first tee and trying to connect with this pink ball that was going all over the place.
"The ball wasn't even coming off the bat. It's just totally different. It was like 'what is going on?'.
Commenting on Collingwood's criticism, England bowler Chris Woakes told BBC Sport: "That's one of the negative comments, but we've also heard a lot of positive stuff as well.
"I can't give you my full opinion as I haven't played with it. The fact we've got mixed reports is interesting but the fact that the ground is going to be sold out is probably the most important thing."
