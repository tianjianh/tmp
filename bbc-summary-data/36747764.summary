Harry Whitlam death: Tractor driver admits safety breach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The driver of a tractor which knocked down and killed an 11-year-old boy has admitted breaching health and safety rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Whitlam, 11, died after the vehicle driven by Gary Green, 51, reversed into him at Swithens Farm, Rothwell, in 2013.
An  inquest last year heard Mr Green was almost three times the legal alcohol limit on the day of the crash.
He was not prosecuted at the time as it happened on private land.
Mr Green, of Bradburn Road, Wakefield, admitted failing to ensure the safety of others at a hearing at Leeds Crown Court.
He is due to appear in November for a further hearing before sentencing.
The Health and Safety Executive announced this year it had brought a charge against Mr Green under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act.
