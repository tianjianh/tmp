Warwickshire Police described the vehicle as an "overseas lorry".
The operation closed the A45 Westbound between the M45 and the A4071. It later reopened.
A haulage lorry is parked up just before the garage.
I can see about 100 square boxes out on the pavement area and a team of about 10 people, in suits and police uniform and what looks like forensic investigators, who are going through the boxes.
They are going through every box before putting them back on the lorry.
The lorry looks to be foreign and is possibly from Romania.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the three treated men were looked over at the scene for signs of heat exhaustion before being taken to University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.
Lorry driver Will Fry said he had seen the men, whom he described as Middle Eastern, at the service station wrapped in blankets and silver foil.
He told BBC News he was about to pull into the garage when he saw a "large number of police cars with blue lights flashing, ambulances and police everywhere".
"There was a continental fridge lorry with a trailer and its freight was strewn about all over the floor.
"Ambulance crew were attending to what looked like Middle Eastern gentlemen, most were bearded, and wrapped in silver foil and blankets with some not looking like they were in the best shape to be honest."
Hotel worker Tunde Kosa told the BBC she had arrived for work at the Travelodge Rugby Dunchurch Hotel, which is near the service station, to find several police cars outside.
She said the hotel was not affected by the incident.
