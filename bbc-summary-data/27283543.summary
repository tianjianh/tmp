The Foxes return to the top flight after a 10-year absence having set a club record for league victories (31) and points collected (102) in a season.
Leicester finished top of the Championship, nine points clear of Burnley, who have also earned automatic promotion in second place.
The open-top bus route started on High Street and continued past Clock Tower.
It finished in Town Hall Square where around 6,000 fans had gathered to greet the team.
Mike McCarthy, from BBC Leicester, said: "The bus stopped at Gallowtree Gate. Leicester stopped. Time stopped.
"The entire of Leicester seems to have turned out to see its team."
One fan, who had waited more than two hours with his son to witness the parade, said: "I have been waiting 10 years since the last time we were promoted but this parade beats that.
"The crowds have been fantastic. It has been brilliant."
The parade was followed by a party at the King Power Stadium.
