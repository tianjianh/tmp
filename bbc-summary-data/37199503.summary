Lobsters worth £1,300 stolen from Fife dock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 150 lobsters have been stolen from a Fife dock after being caught by a fisherman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The catch, thought to be worth about £1,300, was taken from Methil Docks between 01:00 and 05:00 on Monday.
Police said they believe the lobsters were hand-picked from a container, and urged restaurant owners to be on the alert.
Sgt Craig Fyall said: "This might seem like a comical incident, but this is a fisherman's livelihood."
He added: "It's likely they were hand-picked from the container, so it would've been noticeable if anyone left the docks with that amount of lobsters.
"If anyone remembers seeing anything suspicious, or has any relevant information, please contact police."
