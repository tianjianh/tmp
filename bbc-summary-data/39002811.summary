Wrexham has 'big problem' with psychoactive Mamba drug

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns have been raised about the availability of the psychoactive substance Mamba in Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Criminal lawyer Emma Simoes told magistrates there was "a big problem" in the area as she defended a man who admitted being under its influence on three occasions in the town centre.
A blanket ban on so-called legal highs came into force in the UK last May.
Carl Williams, 44, admitted breaching a town centre public spaces protection order to curb anti-social behaviour.
The legal order, which gives police and council officials powers to disperse anyone causing a nuisance in Wrexham town centre, was imposed last August.
Magistrates fined him Â£90 with a further Â£100 fine for two offences of failing to turn up in court.
Miss Simoes said: "There is a big problem with Mamba, especially in the Wrexham area."
North Wales Police has been asked to comment.
