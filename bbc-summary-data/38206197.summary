Customers took to social media to complain of long queues at the Windsor resort during the first day of the "Christmas Bricktacular" opening.
Caroline Other, of Windsor, said her four-year-old son was left crying in the "freezing cold".
Legoland apologised for the delay and said a power cut meant some time slots to see Santa were missed.
More on this and other Berkshire stories.
On the resort's Facebook page, Lisha Jones wrote: "We drove 400 miles to visit Legoland. We didn't get to go on all the rides due to the long wait to see Santa. It was freezing cold and my four-year-old ended up falling asleep in the long wait."
Kelly Jackson said: "The wait, despite allocated time slots for a visit to see Father Christmas, left us all feeling angry and upset. We had a slot booked for 15:00 GMT but ended seeing the big man at 18:00 GMT."
Others said Legoland staff were "fantastic", handing out popcorn to those waiting in the queue.
Josh Gibbons wrote on Facebook: "We had to queue for over an hour for Santa which kind of makes the allotted time redundant.
"But the staff were excellent, handing out popcorn and being very apologetic for the wait."
In a statement, Legoland said: "We would like to apologise to guests visiting our Christmas Bricktacular on opening day, Saturday 3 December. Unfortunately we experienced some power issues which resulted in unacceptable delays.
"We tried to keep spirits up with festive snacks and timing changes but we know a lot of guests were disappointed. Please be assured it's all systems go now and Legoland and Father Christmas look forward to welcoming our guests."
