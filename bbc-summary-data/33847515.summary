A mystery sinkhole has appeared for a third time on a popular Devon beach.

An area has been cordoned off after people reported water and bubbles spurting from the sand at Orcombe Point, near Exmouth.
It is more than 6ft (1.8m) wide and believed to be up to 10ft (3m) deep - and could be caused by a spring or outfall pipe beneath, authorities said.
East Devon District Council cordoned the area off around the hole and said it was investigating.
Nick Christow, from the council, said its appearance seemed to be linked with heavy rainfall.
"We don't know the full extent of what the dangers could be. Our advice is to take precautions, use a bit of common sense and stay out of the area," he said.
"We believe there may be a spring underneath there...and we're also investigating the possibility that there might be an outfall pipe as well that may have been cracked or blocked."
Sharon Sweeny, who lives nearby, said she spotted "something bubbling up" on Monday morning.
"There's something going on, it's weird. It's never been like this before this year."
She said she hoped authorities would find out what was going on as a matter of urgency, in case someone was hurt. "It could be like sinking sand," she said.
"There's got to be something underneath."
