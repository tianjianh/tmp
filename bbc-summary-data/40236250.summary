Rangers striker Hardie scored the opener with an excellent second-half free-kick.
Dundee's Wighton made it 2-0 and a Denis Granecny own goal put the result beyond doubt.
The win ensured Scotland sealed their best ever finish at the tournament in France.
A 3-0 semi-final defeat to England had ended Scotland's hopes of lifting the trophy for the first time.
Scotland Under-20s coach Scot Gemmill told the Scottish FA website: "They have finished third from 12 teams so it's a great achievement and we are really pleased to finish the tournament on a high.
"The players deserve credit for how they have applied themselves in France and how they have responded to the demands we have placed on them.
"I'm sure they will take a lot from this experience and hope they go back to their clubs in a positive frame of mind and ready for the new season."
