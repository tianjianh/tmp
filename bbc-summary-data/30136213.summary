The story, told in weekly episodes, investigates the murder of a teenager in US city of Baltimore and whether her ex-boyfriend was wrongfully convicted of the crime.
Its popularity has led to plans for a new series but the makers say they need fans' help to crowd fund it.
Critics say a tragedy has been turned into entertainment and producers have used "racist" stereotypes.
Nevertheless, producers are keen to capitalise on their popularity; they want to "continue doing in-depth reporting" and want podcasters to buy in.
Suggested donations vary from $20 (£13) to $1,000 (£640). People in the US are also being offered the chance to donate $10 (£6.50) via text message.
Serial is top of the iTunes chart and has broken the record for the quickest podcast to reach five million downloads, according to Apple.
The series investigates the death of 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and asks whether Adnan Syed, who was found guilty of her murder, really committed the crime.
It's currently in its ninth episode with a total of 12 planned, although as producers are still working on the story, there could be more.
Although it's a spin-off of This American Life - a successful US radio programme - and has a list of sponsors, the podcast's makers claim they need more money so the show "can stand on its own".
There is no word yet on what subject series two would tackle but in an interview last month reporter Sarah Koenig suggested that "many stories" could fit the format.
"As long as something is happening over time and we can document whatever that is, and you like the people involved and you're compelled by whatever it is they're doing and feeling and experiencing, I think it can work," she told The Guardian.
"I feel like it's just a natural thing as humans. We just want to know what happens next. So as long as you can supply that tension and that narrative thread, you're good."
In 1999, Hae Min Lee was found dead in a city park in Baltimore, after going missing a month before.
Her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was arrested and then convicted of her murder. He was sentenced to life in prison. He has always protested his innocence.
According to the makers of Serial, the evidence in the case against Syed was "largely based on the story of one witness, Adnan's friend Jay".
Last year, Sarah Koenig was contacted by a friend of Syed who wanted her to investigate the case. She has since been "looking for answers".
Serial's website states: "What she [Koenig] realised is that the trial covered up a far more complicated story, which neither the jury nor the public got to hear."
Each week the podcast has focused on a different aspect of the case, from mobile phone records on the day Hae was murdered, to scenes from court.
There are no guarantees that Serial will ever uncover the truth.
But many thousands of people are tuning in each week to find out if they will "get to the bottom" of what happened on 13 January 1999.
