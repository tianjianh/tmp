Patients on Teesside are being asked to bear with the health trust while a new electronic records system comes online.

North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust said its former patient records setup was labour intensive and in need of replacement.
The new Â£7m computerised system means patient details will be accessible on screen to all health professionals.
It has been two years in the planning, and comes into effect on Monday.
Lynne Hodgson, from the trust, said "a massive amount of training has taken place" but they were "still expecting some teething problems".
"We're just asking at this time that patients and relatives bear with us while the new system is bedding in," she added.
