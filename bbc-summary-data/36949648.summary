[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors' Mikael Mandron and Joe Partington combined well early on, the former forcing a good save from Jamie Butler.
Butler had to be in fine form again to thwart the French forward from close range.
The Spitfires went in front in the second half, courtesy of James Constable, but Jamie Day's men roared back and Lee Barnard fired past Ross Flitney from 25 yards for the equaliser.
Late on, Ryan Cresswell had to clear off the line to preserve a point for Eastleigh.
