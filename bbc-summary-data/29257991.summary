[SN]TITLE[SN]
North England gang jailed for cocaine dealing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of a gang who dealt cocaine across the north of England have been sentenced to between two and 16 years in jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12 men from County Durham, Tyne and Wear, Liverpool and Manchester were found guilty at Teesside Crown Court of supplying and dealing drugs.
Police seized cocaine and cannabis with a street value of about Â£1m in 2013.
Det Ch Insp Victoria Fuller from Durham Constabulary said the men were "quite simply horrible people".
"At no stage did they give a single thought to the misery their offending inflicted on communities or the innocent people caught up in their activities," she said.
"This is not just about the damage drugs themselves may cause but the associated crime which can badly affect communities."
Durham Police said the fact that some of the cocaine was 91% pure proved the gang were at the top of the supply chain.
Operation Skyhawk involved more than 200 police officers and staff and was carried out as part of Durham Constabulary's Sledgehammer campaign to target organised criminal groups in the force area.
