British middleweight Anthony Ogogo says he believes he can fulfil his ambition of becoming world champion after nearly a year out from boxing.

The 27-year-old from Lowestoft dislocated his shoulder against Ruslan Schelev in Germany in July 2015.
"I've had two years of hellacious rehab," Ogogo told BBC Radio Suffolk. "It's been heartbreaking at times.
"I 100% believe I'm going to get what I want out of boxing," he continued. "And that's to become a world champion."
The London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist was returning from a previous injury when he suffered the setback in the second round against Schelev.
"I boxed four and a half rounds with a dislocated arm, won the fight, dug in, but I didn't learn much from it," Ogogo continued.
"It was just about proving to myself I had the minerals to stay in there despite the pain."
The Suffolk boxer is due to make his comeback on 28 May in Glasgow on the Ricky Burns v Michele Di Rocco undercard, where he will hope to improve on his record of eight professional fights unbeaten.
"If any guy is going to fight me, it's best to fight me now," said Ogogo. "My right shoulder is probably at about 80-85% compared to where it was prior to the dislocation.
"I've got the speed back but my right arm is only going to get bigger and stronger.
"It's frightening how much better I can get. British boxing is on the crest of a wave at the moment.
"I feel like I've sat on the outskirts looking in, so I'm glad I can finally get stuck in myself."
