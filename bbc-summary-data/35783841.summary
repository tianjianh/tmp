The 29-year-old Briton will now concentrate on defending his Olympic long jump title in Rio this summer.
"His body reacted harder than expected to this week's training," said British Athletics performance director Neil Black.
The World Indoors take place in Portland, USA, from 17-20 March.
Rutherford also missed last month's Indoor British Championships and the Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix with a chest infection and a small muscle tear.
The European and Commonwealth champion, who last month jumped 8.26m in Albuquerque, is second in the world rankings.
