Kaiser Chiefs' Ricky Wilson, Cockney Rebel's Steve Harley and singer-songwriters KT Tunstall and David Gray are among those taking part.
They will be joined by a cross-party group of MPs and others for a special recording of The Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want.
Mrs Cox was killed outside her constituency surgery on 16 June.
Mrs Cox, 41, who was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen at the time, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, in front of her staff and residents.
Thomas Mair, 53, is currently on trial for her killing at the Old Bailey. He denies murder and other charges.
The song, released next year, will mark the launch of the Jo Cox Foundation, which will raise funds for causes close to the late MP.
A group of 20 MPs from across the political spectrum, members of parliamentary rock group MP4 and the Royal Opera House Thurrock Community Chorus will also feature on the track.
Kevin Brennan, Labour MP for Cardiff West and organiser of the project, said he hoped the song would show "there's more that unites than divides us".
He said he felt the choice of song, first released in 1969, reflected the ethos of Mrs Cox.
He said: "Jo Cox was someone who really tried very hard until she got what was needed and that's a message within the song.
"She also said that people should work together - that we are stronger together, there's more that unites than divides us.
"So we wanted to do something that reflected that and would help raise awareness of the foundation."
KT Tunstall said her decision to take part in the project was a "complete no-brainer".
She told the Press Association: "There's too few of her in the world, so it's just incredibly sad that she has gone.
"At the same time I think she'd be really happy that we are doing something so joyful and so celebratory and fun in her honour - and to help raise money and awareness for her causes."
MPs gathered at the Backstage Centre in Thurrock, Essex, on Thursday to record their part on the track, conducted by Suzie Rigby, who has worked with The Rolling Stones.
Labour MP Tracy Brabin, who won the by-election in Batley and Spen following the death of Mrs Cox, said: "I think it's an amazing event because it's bringing people together cross-party.
"There's Conservatives, there's Labour and I think that's what Jo always loved, to be able to work - when the idea was big and important - across parties."
The former Coronation Street star said it was happening in "desperately sad circumstances" but Mrs Cox would have wanted to "bring people together in a joyous scenario where we can do something positive".
