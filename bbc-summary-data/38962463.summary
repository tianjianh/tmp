[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Juventus striker Paulo Dybala scored twice against his former club Palermo in a comfortable win for the champions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Juve, who are now 10 points clear at the top, led through Claudio Marchisio.
Dybala, who had earlier hit the post, curled a brilliant free-kick into the top corner and then set up Higuain for a chipped third.
The Argentina striker got a late second from Higuain's backheel before Ivaylo Chochev's consolation header in the third minute of injury time.
That was the first goal Juventus had conceded in Serie A in six games.
Palermo remain eight points adrift of safety in 18th.
Second-placed Roma can pull the gap back to seven points if they beat Joe Hart's Torino on Sunday.
Match ends, Juventus 4, Palermo 1.
