Peaty, 21, who won Great Britain's first medal of Rio 2016 with gold in the men's 100m breaststroke, toured through Uttoxeter.
Peaty's nan, Mavis Williams, who captured hearts with her social media support of the swimmer, was among family members on the bus with him.
Hundreds of people lined the streets to cheer and applaud him.
On the steps of Uttoxeter's town hall, he said he would now look "to the future".
Peaty was presented with a "book of pride" which signed people from across the town.
He told BBC reporter Martyn Williams who travelled on the tour: "Uttoxeter has given me so much over the years. It's where I was born, I was born in this house and it is where my first club was.
"It's where is all started so it's important, obviously to recognise that and hopefully inspire the next generation of swimmers."
Mrs Williams, 74, expected many of her friends to be there. "It's going to stop a few minutes down the road [from their homes] so they can all see," she said ahead of the event.
Peaty broke his own world record in Rio by winning in 57.13 seconds, well clear of the field.
The success in August made him first British man to win an Olympic swimming gold medal since Adrian Moorhouse, who won the same event in Seoul in 1988.
Peaty, who also took silver in the men's 4x100m medley relay, displayed both medals.
