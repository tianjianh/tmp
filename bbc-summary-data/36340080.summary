Murray's compatriots Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund will also face qualifiers, who are yet to be determined.
Johanna Konta, Britain's top-ranked female player, will start her campaign against German Julia Goerges.
Fellow Britons Heather Watson, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady will face Nicole Gibbs, Andrea Petkovic and Coco Vandeweghe respectively.
Robson, in particular, faces a tough challenge as Petkovic is a former semi-finalist at the clay-court tournament, which begins on Sunday, 22 May.
Defending women's champion Serena Williams, who will start against Magdalena Rybarikova, is in the same half of the draw as Angelique Kerber and Victoria Azarenka, the third and fifth seeds respectively.
Murray, 29, is in the same half of the draw as reigning champion Stan Wawrinka, with world number one Novak Djokovic and nine-time winner Rafael Nadal in the opposite half.
Having reached three semi-finals in Paris, Murray goes into this year's tournament having beaten Djokovic in the final of the Italian Open earlier this month.
In the previous tournament, the Scot beat Nadal as he reached the Madrid Open final, where he was beaten by Djokovic.
"There's a lot of guys coming back that will be feeling good about their chances," Murray told the French Open website.
"I hope I can have a good run and get some good work done in the next few days to get ready."
The French Open is the only Grand Slam Djokovic, who lost in the final to Wawrinka last year, is yet to win and he is attempting to become the first man since 1969 to hold all four majors at the same time.
The Serb will play Lu Yen-hsun in round one, while Nadal will play Australian Sam Groth. Wawrinka will begin his title defence against Lukas Rosol.
Roger Federer has withdrawn after failing to recover from a back injury, while Frenchman Gael Monfils has pulled out because of a viral infection.
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
"It seemed very much in Nadal's interests to be promoted to fourth seed after Roger Federer's withdrawal, but he has ended up with the toughest draw of the three most in-form players.
"He may need to beat both Dominic Thiem and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga before even thinking about a semi-final with Djokovic.
"Murray will be pleased to be in the other half of the draw - but less delighted with the prospect of meeting Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals.
"None of the four British women have terrifying draws, but each of their opponents can be very dangerous on their day. And Serena Williams may have to beat Ana Ivanovic, Victoria Azarenka and Angelique Kerber just to reach the final."
