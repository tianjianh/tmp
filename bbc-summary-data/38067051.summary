Rent Smart Wales delays admitted by minister Carl Sargeant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welsh Government minister has admitted that a system registering all residential landlords across Wales for the first time has faced delays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said Rent Smart Wales (RSW) had taken longer than usual to respond to some calls and emails.
RSW requires landlords to register or become licensed by Wednesday.
He said landlords who have started the process will not face action "if they have done all they can to comply".
The Welsh Government estimated there were between 70,000 and 130,000 private landlords in Wales.
It said that by midnight on Monday more than 55,000 had registered, and another 12,000 had started the registration process.
More than 81,000 users had created accounts and were involved in the process of complying, it added.
Those who do not comply could face fines.
Registering as a landlord costs Â£33.50 if completed online and Â£80.50 on paper, irrespective of the number of properties.
Mr Sargeant said: "Recent months have seen a huge rush to register.
"As a result, Rent Smart Wales has taken longer than usual to respond to some calls and emails.
"I appreciate this has caused concern for some landlords who haven't been able to complete the registration and licensing process."
He said: "Rent Smart Wales has said that those who have started the process to comply will not face enforcement action if they have done all they reasonably can to comply.
"But, this must not be seen as an excuse to ignore the law. My message to private landlords is clear. You must take action to comply with the requirements of the law."
In the Senedd last week, Mr Sargeant denied accusations by Conservative economy spokesman Russell George that Rent Smart Wales was in "chaos" with staff "completely overwhelmed" by demand.
He also rejected a call by Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy to extend the deadline for registration.
