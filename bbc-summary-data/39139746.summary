Ramsey, 26, has not played since he limped off in the Gunners' 2-1 defeat to Watford on 31 January.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Ramsey was back in full training ahead of Saturday's Premier League game against Liverpool.
Ramsey's return to training is a boost for Wales ahead of their game against the Republic of Ireland on 24 March.
Wales manager Chris Coleman is confident Ramsey will be available for the World Cup qualifier in Dublin.
"We need Rambo," Coleman said.
"At our best, we're a tough team to play against. We've proved that against the very best. At the moment we've got enough time for Aaron to make sure he's okay."
