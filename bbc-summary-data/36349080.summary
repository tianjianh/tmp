Matt Gohdes deflected in the opener for the hosts, but Simon Mantell equalised for GB in his 200th international after a 30-minute storm delay.
Iain Lewers then put the tourists ahead in the third quarter, but Jamie Dwyer levelled for the world number one side with nine minutes left.
The second match, at the same Western Australia venue, takes place on Sunday.
The series concludes in Perth on Tuesday, 24 May.
The teams will also meet on the opening day of the Champions Trophy in London on 10 June, and are in the same pool at the Rio Olympics in August.
Britain recorded a 5-2 victory in the last match between the sides at the World League Final pool stage in India in November.
However, they went behind after 11 minutes at the Narrogin Regional Recreational Centre when Fergus Kavanagh's powerful pass into the circle was deflected in by Gohdes.
Mantell, 32, who made his international debut in 2005, slid in to convert a backhand cross from Ashley Jackson - and Jackson was again the provider for the second, finding Lewers at the far post for an emphatic finish.
George Pinner made some fine saves in the GB goal but Dwyer salvaged a draw for the home side, touching home a Trent Mitton pass.
"The conditions made hockey very difficult early on," said GB head coach Bobby Crutchley.
"We played our best hockey in the third quarter when we controlled the game, but then performed poorly in the final stages with the ball."
