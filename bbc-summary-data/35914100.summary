Belgium's friendly going ahead in Portugal on Tuesday shows "football is not afraid" after the Brussels attacks, says home coach Fernando Santos.

The match was moved from the Belgian capital after attacks in the city killed 35 people last week.
It was called off for security reasons before Portugal's football association offered Leiria as an alternate venue.
"It's very important the match is being held, and to organise it in Portugal is a very good solution," said Santos.
"I don't get the impression that during the match the players are going to think about the tragedy and that they won't be able to get away from it during the game.
"The important thing is the signal this match gives, the signal is that football is not afraid, the people are not afraid."
