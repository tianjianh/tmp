The 33-year-old takes over the role from Charlotte Burton, whom he assisted last season alongside his coaching commitments at Brighton College.
Seamer Anyon took 199 wickets in 63 first-class appearances for Sussex between 2010 and 2014 and retired last year because of a knee injury.
He will also coach the women's under-19 and under-21 sides.
"This is a great opportunity to continue working with Sussex," he said.
"The women's game is fast-growing and I am looking forward to bringing my own experiences from professional cricket and using them to help the girls."
Alexia Walker, Sussex's most-capped women's player and coach of the under-17 side, will take on roles with the senior, under-21 and under-19 sides.
