Kevin Lau, who used to work with the Ming Pao newspaper, was assaulted in the street in February 2014.
Yip Kim-wah and Wong Chi-wah were found guilty by a jury in Hong Kong, but have refused to say who ordered the attack.
Mr Lau said he hoped police would continue their investigation to find who was behind the assault. The two men will be sentenced next week.
Shortly before the attack, Mr Lau had been replaced by a Malaysian editor viewed as pro-Beijing, sparking fears among staff that the paper's independence was under threat.
Ming Pao is a respected Chinese-language Hong Kong paper known for its investigative reporting.
