Councils in the East of England need to make budget cuts of £1.2bn, BBC research has found, leaving many facing "unpalatable" decisions.

The 14 county and unitary councils are looking to save of between £7m and £50m from their annual budgets.
There are warnings of further pressure on services such as care for the elderly.
Chris Hayward, deputy leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said it faced a "difficult" challenge.
£1.2bn
The amount 14 councils need to save in the East of England
£250m The amount to be cut from Essex County Council's £1.8bn annual budget over five years
£136m Northamptonshire County Council to lose from its £413m annual budget over three years
£80m Hertfordshire County Council is looking to trim its £1.7bn annual budget over four years
£166m Peterborough City Council needs to save that sum from its £139m annual budget over five years
"With the new cuts we are going to have to make difficult and unpalatable decisions," he said.
"The options are out to consultation so I can't say where the cuts will fall, but I can say adult care takes up two thirds of the budget.
"Hertfordshire has a rapidly expanding population and an increasing elderly population."
David Phillips, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which provides independent economic analysis, said councils across the country were looking at major cuts.
"They have already had real-term cuts of 25% since 2009-10 and demand is rising," he said. "And there is less left to cut.
"I wouldn't be surprised if non-statutory services will receive significant cuts."

Mark Harrison, chief executive of Norfolk disability charity Equal Lives, said local groups were facing cuts in grants from authorities.
He said cuts to local government funding was a "stupid and cruel policy", but said councils could do more to save money by sharing "back office" functions.
Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: "Services caring for our elderly and vulnerable people are under pressure now.
"While councils will strive to limit the impact on local communities, they will face tough decisions about how to keep providing the hundreds of vital services which communities value and rely on to go about their daily lives, from keeping streets lit and clean to caring for our vulnerable children and adults."
