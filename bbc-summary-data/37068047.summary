[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree secured their first win of the season in the National League with a 2-0 victory over Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors flew out of the blocks and could have taken the lead early on as Bernard Mensah combined well with Nick Arnold, who fired just over.
But Jake Goodman headed Braintree into the lead against the run of play after eight minutes.
Simeon Akinola put the result beyond doubt in the 76th minute, sweeping the ball into the top corner after a searing counter-attack down the right.
Braintree have now picked up their first win after two draws and as many defeats in their first four games.
