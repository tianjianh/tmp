[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 30-year old man who raped a grandmother in an east Belfast car park has been jailed for nine years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lukasz Artur Kubik, who is originally from Poland, was convicted earlier this year of raping and sexually assaulting the 52-year-old woman in January 2013.
The judge told the court Kubik, who has lived in Northern Ireland since 2006, had 28 previous criminal convictions both in Northern Ireland and Poland.
She said he had been deemed to present a significant risk to the public.
The judge added that she was extending his licence for a further three years - meaning that after serving four and a half years of his sentence, Kubik will be eligible to apply for parole.
During the trial, the jury heard the woman was attacked as she made her way home from a relative's house during the early hours of 31 January 2013.
She had gone to a taxi depot in east Belfast, but it was closed.
She then spoke to a group of men and women outside the depot, including Kubik.
The trial was told he later raped her in the nearby car park, shortly after the rest of his group left the area.
The judge sentenced him to nine years for the rape, with a concurrent two year sentence imposed for the sexual assault.
