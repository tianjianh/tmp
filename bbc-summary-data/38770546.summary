Drivers have been left confused by road markings for the latest phase of Edinburgh's new 20mph speed limit.

Roads have had 20mph markings painted at the start of the lower-speed zone.
However, on the other side there are 30mph signs to indicate the upcoming road has a different speed limit.
Some motorists have posted pictures on Twitter of the road markings on Craigentinny Road with confused emoji symbols.
The 20mph network is being introduced over six phases across the capital.
The new contrasting road markings have been painted ahead of phase two of the initiative, which comes into effect on 28 February.
Zone one, covering the city centre, came into force on 1 August 2016.
Motorists face Â£100 fines and three penalty points if they are caught over the 20mph limit.
A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: "The 30mph road marking signifies the speed limit on Portobello Rd onto which drivers exit.
"This will be reinforced by an adjacent road sign signalling the end of the 20mph zone, which will be erected before the 20mph limit comes into force in this area on 28 February.
"The 20mph road marking refers to the 20mph speed limit on Craigentinny Crescent."
