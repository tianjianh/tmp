The 29-year-old Jamaican, who holds the world 200m record with 19.19 seconds, will line up against Britain's European 200m champion Adam Gemili.
Britain's Zharnel Hughes, fifth in last year's World Championship 200m, also runs in the event, which serves as the London leg of the Diamond League.
Bolt holds the London Grand Prix record (19.76), set at Crystal Palace in 2008.

Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, 22, the second fastest Briton of all time with a personal best of 19.95, is also expected to compete.
It will be Bolt's eighth appearance at the London leg - he first appeared in the former Golden League in 2005, aged 18.
He has twice competed in the 100m under the floodlights on the Friday night of the London Anniversary Games, winning in both 2013 and 2015 with times of 9.85 and 9.87 respectively.
Bolt said: "The London Anniversary Games will be one of my last races before Rio and running in the 200m will hopefully set me up for a successful Olympic Games."
You can watch live coverage of the Anniversary Games on BBC Two, the BBC Sport website and app.
