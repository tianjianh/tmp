Stormont crisis: Paramilitary monitoring body may 'mend stalled talks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Establishing a new body to monitor paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland could help mend the stalled peace process, Theresa Villiers has said.

The Northern Ireland Secretary told the House of Commons that the situation in Northern Ireland was "very grave".
But the DUP leader Peter Robinson called her words "a holding statement".
Her "commitment to respond to concerns in the coming days" would delay talks, he said.
In her Commons statement, Ms Villiers said relationships between the political parties had "almost completely broken down."
"The brutal murders of Gerard Davison and Kevin McGuigan have brought into sharp focus the continuing problems around the existence of paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland and the involvement of some of their members in criminality and organised crime," Ms Villiers told the House of Commons.
"Serious consideration needs to be given to whether the time is right to re-establish a body along the lines of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC).
The IMC was set up in 2004 to monitor paramilitary activity and the normalisation of security measures in Northern Ireland. It stopped work officially in March 2011.

She said the government would also look at ways to support efforts to tackle organised crime and cross-border crime in Northern Ireland.
But she added it was also vital to address the differences blocking the implementation of the Stormont Agreement.
"Without welfare reform and steps to tackle in-year budget pressures, there is a real danger that executive departments could start running out of money," she said.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said it is only prepared to attend more talks "in the right circumstances."
But Sinn Féin has warned the government against preconditions for the talks.
Sinn Féin MLA Conor Murphy said there should be no delays or preconditions in beginning all-party talks.
"These talks should begin immediately," he said.
"If people are not prepared to go into those talks, the only other option is an election. This is a farcical situation and it is becoming worse by the day."
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said: "The words uttered in the Commons today don't really move us forward very much. But it is a process and we are keen to see a resolution."
Alex Attwood, SDLP, said: "There must be no unilateral action by the British government in order to dig out the DUP from where they find themselves."
"Let the government send out the message that there is no compromise on the Good Friday Agreement or the rule of law and, if we proceed on that basis, then those who have held up these talks and held up this island might not continue to prevail.
"Let the talks begin."
Ms Villiers plans to resume her discussions with the five main Stormont parties on Wednesday.
The DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) were waiting to hear Ms Villiers' address to the Commons before they would commit to round table discussions with the other parties.
At the beginning of her address, Ms Villiers noted the change in the Labour leadership.
She said it would be helpful if the new shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Vernon Coaker, would confirm that "the consent principle, at the heart of the Belfast Agreement, will remain paramount".
In response, Mr Coaker said his party intended to "pursue a bipartisan approach based on the agreements reached - in particular the principle of consent".
"Our policy remains absolutely the same," he said.
