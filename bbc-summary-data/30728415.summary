Residents in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, set about trying to reopen the Byron Cinema in 2013.
Since then they have raised funds through events and donations from the community but say a final push for money would help complete the work.
Project chairwoman Ria Cash said too many people were passionate about the cinema for the  project to fail.
The cinema closed in 2006 and has since operated as a bingo hall.
Ms Cash said the rundown building required a lot of renovation work including new carpets.  Donations had already bought a new screen and 400 seats, she said.
"A lot of it is about raising the funds but also about raising the awareness of what we are doing," said Ms Cash.
"I don't know how long it will take us but we will get there.
"The team is passionate about it and the community has really embraced it."
A National Lottery funding application was withdrawn last year after the conditions for applying changed.
Ms Cash said the team were now planning events, film quizzes and exhibitions to gather the final £190,000.
She said: "A lot of people have childhood memories here so this is something the local people need and want."
