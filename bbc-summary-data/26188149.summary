Joseph Kent killing: No verdict in Samir Bostan punch charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has been discharged after failing to reach a verdict in the trial of a man accused of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samir Bostan, 25, of Wolston Meadow, Middleton, had denied the charge, saying he struck Joseph Kent, 24, in self defence in January 2013.
Mr Kent died two days after sustaining head injuries outside KFC, at Xscape. Mr Bostan told Luton Crown Court he was trying to "defuse" a row.
The Crown Prosecution Service has seven days to decide if it wants a retrial.
In the same trial, Hamza Noor, 22, of Ranelagh Road, Wembley, north-west London, was found not guilty of causing actual bodily harm to Mr Kent's friend, Andrew Curzon-Berners.
Tariq Bostan, 27, of Sarum Road, Luton, had previously admitted two counts of causing actual bodily harm to the victim's brother Matthew Kent and Mr Curzon-Berners.
During the trial, the jury heard Mr Kent had been in Milton Keynes celebrating his wife Emma's 22nd birthday on Saturday 12 January.
He died as a result of receiving a punch to his face and jaw, which caused a blood vessel going up through his neck and into his brain to tear, causing a fatal bleed.
The court heard Mr Kent had been queuing with his wife, his brother and Mr Curzon-Berners when a fight broke out which the jury was told was instigated by Tariq Bostan, with his brother Samir Bostan and cousin Hamza Noor joining in.
After two days of deliberations the judge said he would accept a majority decision, but the jury could not reach a verdict.
