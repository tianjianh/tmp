Eoin Corcoran, aged 14 from Jersey, died on 5 February after receiving injuries while playing at the sand dunes in St Brelade, Jersey.
The inquest heard on Wednesday that he was digging a tunnel with a friend when it collapsed on him, burying his upper body.
The coroner said it was a "very tragic accidental death of a young man".
Deputy Viscount Mark Harris said the cause of death was sand inhalation and asphyxiation caused by the weight of the sand on his body.
Eoin's father, Michael Corcoran, said: "He was a beautiful boy, very special."
The inquest heard Eoin and his friend, who cannot be named, walked Eoin's dog on the sand dunes after school before deciding to burrow into the sand with their hands.
After the tunnel collapsed, Eoin's friend called for help and tried but failed to dig him out.
The inquest heard one passing dog walker came within 50 yards (46m) of the two boys and saw Eoin's legs sticking out of the sand, but walked past assuming it was children playing.
Paramedics were called by another passer-by who pulled Eoin's body out of the sand and performed CPR on him for nearly half an hour.
Eoin was taken to Jersey's General Hospital, where resuscitation attempts continued, but he was pronounced dead shortly after 20:00 BST.
Mr Harris said: "Everyone did what they could, and should be commended for doing so."
Jersey's Environment Department said it was looking into improving the signs around the sand dunes.
