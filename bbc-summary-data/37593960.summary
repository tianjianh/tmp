[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 1-1 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Alex Kiwomya rescued a point for Crewe as they held Notts County to a 1-1 draw at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides looked low on confidence in a first half where the goalkeepers remained untroubled.
But the game did begin to liven up after the interval thanks to County's introduction of on-loan Wolves teenager Aaron Collins.
The youngster showed why he is so highly rated by the Championship side as he forced Ben Garratt into a save thanks to his persistence chasing a long ball.
He then volleyed over the bar, before a neat exchange of passes with Adam Campbell saw the latter miscontrol when in a terrific position.
Campbell then turned provider when his cross into the box was poorly defended, allowing Jonathan Forte to nip in and put the Magpies ahead in the 80th minute.
But Crewe were level just 60 seconds later when George Cooper teed up Kiwomya, on loan from Chelsea, to score with a superb finish as both sides settled for a point.
