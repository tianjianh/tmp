Truro City have agreed contracts with Les Afful and Ben Adelsbury for the 2016-17 season.

Former Exeter City player Afful scored once for Truro last season as they made the National League South play-offs.
Adelsbury, 25, rejoined Truro last February from Bath City, having previously played for the club during boss Lee Hodges' first spell in charge.
City are still in discussions with Isaac Vassell, Ryan Brett and Ollie Knowles about new contracts.
"Les brings a lot of experience and a lot of enthusiasm," Hodges told BBC Sport.
"Over the last couple of years he's been used more from the bench as an impact player, I have to see if he's that again at the start of the season.
"But Les seems to make things happen and he's a good player to have.
"Ben's a good, experienced player who knows this level very well and from a midfield point of view I'll be pleased have him on board to be in there as the engine room and do everything to keep the ball ticking over."
