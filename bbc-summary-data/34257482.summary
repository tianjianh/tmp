The 31-year-old was released by Premiership rivals Kilmarnock in August.
At Fir Park he will provide competition for Connor Ripley, on loan from Middlesbrough, and Dan Twardzik.
"I know Connor has the jersey at the moment, I know Dan is pushing hard; so it is up to me to train hard and try and force my way in," said Samson.
Talking to the club website, he added: "I've spoken with the manager on a few occasions since leaving Kilmarnock and it was only last night we came to an agreement.
"I think this is a club going in the right direction. The team performed so well in the play-offs and this season they're ready to kick on and do well. I believe the manager has added well and there is competition for every spot."
