Llandaff Cathedral new bishop vote ends with no result

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An election to decide the new Bishop of Llandaff has ended with no result.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An electoral college of 47 people, including all the bishops in Wales, had met over three days to vote on a confidential candidates list.
The election follows the retirement of Dr Barry Morgan at the end of January.
The Church in Wales said none of the candidates received the number of votes required for election - a two-thirds majority.
Under the terms of the Church's constitution, the responsibility of filling the vacancy now falls to the Bench of Bishops.
The Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, John Davies, who is president of the electoral college, said the process leading up to an eventual appointment would include a wide-ranging consultation of both the laity and the clergy.
It is only the second time in the Church of Wales' history that it has not been able to reach a decision on a bishop's appointment.
The first was in 2004, when the electoral college could not reach agreement on a new Bishop of Bangor.
