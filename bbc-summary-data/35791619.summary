Paddy Madden latched on to Jim O'Brien's through ball to put the hosts ahead with his 20th goal of the season.
Chesterfield could have levelled before the break when goalkeeper Luke Daniels tipped Connor Dimaio's shot over.
But Campbell-Ryce, who joined the club on loan from Sheffield United prior to kick-off, salvaged a draw for the visitors from Jay O'Shea's cross.

Scunthorpe manager Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside: "Today we haven't created enough chances and we've not forced Tommy Lee to make enough saves. I thought we opened them up and showed what a good side we can be.
"We lacked a little bit of energy and that's not been up recently and I thought we looked a little bit lethargic and a little bit stretched.
"We turned the ball over too many times and that gave Chesterfield opportunities."
