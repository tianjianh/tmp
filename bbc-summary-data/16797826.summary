[SN]TITLE[SN]
Appeal hearing date set for Occupy London St Paul's camp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal by protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral against a decision by the High Court to evict them is to be heard on 13 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three judges will hear the application for permission to challenge Mr Justice Lindblom's decision in favour of the City of London Corporation.
Occupy London group set up camp outside the landmark on 15 October, last year.
The judge granted orders of possession and injunctions to the corporation saying the action was "justified".
Five protesters, Tammy Semede, George Barda, Daniel Ashman, Stephen Moore and Paul Randle-Joliffe, filed applications to the Court of Appeal, a lawyer for the Occupy group said.
The corporation brought the court case after the group, which campaigns against corporate greed, ignored an order to clear its tents from the public highway.
The local authority has said it will not enforce any court orders until the appeal case is resolved.
