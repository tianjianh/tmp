There is a "danger" for Welsh people who depend on a Labour government if the party turns its back on winning the next election, a leadership candidate has said.

Yvette Cooper said the upcoming vote should be a "huge opportunity" for the party to move forward.
Liz Kendall, Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn are the other contenders.
Ms Cooper also said First Minister Carwyn Jones should be given a "stronger voice" in the party in Wales.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, she said: "This should be a huge opportunity. The danger not just for the Labour party but the whole country is if we turn our back on winning the next election."
She added: "There are so many people in Wales who depend on a Labour government."
Ms Cooper called the leadership vote an opportunity to "come together" and have "radical ideas for the future but also to be credible".
She also said Labour should have more shadow cabinet meetings in Wales, champion more devolution and a UK constitutional convention.
The result of the leadership contest is due on 12 September.
