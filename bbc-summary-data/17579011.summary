The funeral of Scottish darts legend Jocky Wilson has taken place in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The twice world darts champion died on 24 March at the age of 62. He had been suffering from the lung disorder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
About 400 people, including former darts star Eric Bristow, packed Kirkcaldy Crematorium to hear about a "wonderful and loving" dad.
He leaves behind wife Malvina and their three children Anne Marie, John and William, and six grandchildren.
During the service, conducted by Denis Madden, mourners heard how Wilson would have celebrated his 44th wedding anniversary next month.
Mr Madden said: "When it came to the crunch, what this man's life was all about was his wife, his children and grandchildren. That's what mattered.
"He was a lovely, quiet, firm family man."
Mr Madden told how Wilson never sought the fame his success brought him after he first picked up darts in a local pub when the team were a player down.
He said: "He went on to play all over the world. I don't think there's a continent that the man did not play in. But if the truth be told, Jocky Wilson never wanted to become famous or in the spotlight.
"Jocky would be the first to tell you that work in its own right was a means to an end, all he wanted out of it was to provide well for his wife and family."
He added: "Jocky was a wonderful dad. He was full of fun and laughter, and yet I have to say he and Malvina brought their children up well because they have instilled nothing but the best of values, morals and standards in all three of them.
"He has played a huge part in moulding each one of them into the people that they have become today."
From his debut at the World Championship in 1979 until 1991, Wilson managed to reach at least the quarter-finals of the tournament on every occasion.
Wilson also lifted the British Professional Championship four-times between 1981 and 1988, as well as the British Open and Matchplay titles.
He was a founding member of the Professional Darts Corporation and is acknowledged as one of the main forerunners to darts' current popularity.
