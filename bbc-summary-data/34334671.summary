[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire have released batsman Joe Gatting as well as bowlers Basil Akram and Tom Barber after the trio reached the end of their contracts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gatting, 27, nephew of former England captain Mike, leaves after two seasons having joined from Sussex in 2013.
Left-arm seamer Barber, 20, made two List A appearances for Hampshire having come through the county's academy.
Akram made just one List A first-team appearance against Yorkshire in 2014 after signing for the club last season.
"All three have been popular members of the squad," said Hampshire director of cricket Giles White.
"It's always a sad time, but we would like to thank them for their hard work and commitment over the last two years and we wish them well for the future."
