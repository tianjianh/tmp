Forth Road Bridge: Restrictions to continue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic Scotland has reported long tailbacks on approaches to the Forth Road Bridge after faults forced the closure of the southbound carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The operators have said it is likely some form of traffic restrictions will continue for the next few days.
They have now banned all goods vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, which will have to use an alternative route.
Efforts are continuing to fix defective steelwork that led to the introduction of a contra flow system.
Long queues of traffic had formed well before the rush hour peak on Thursday afternoon.
Engineers are working on a temporary repair to ease the immediate pressure before replacing the faulty component.
Restrictions were imposed on the crossing after engineers uncovered a potential fault in the structure of the bridge on Tuesday.
Only one lane of traffic is operating in each direction.
The road network company Amey has revealed there are eight parts of the bridge where a similar problem could be encountered in the future.
Disruption on Thursday has included heavy traffic through Rosyth and Inverkeithing.
The Kincardine Bridge and Clackmannanshire Bridge, which are alternative routes for some drivers, were busier than usual.
Amey Facilities Manager Chris Waite said: "Once we have a fix in place we would hope the bridge would reopen to all traffic but in the meantime the engineers are working out what level of traffic can we allow on while we are putting a temporary repair in place, which might take some time.
Meanwhile, motorists are being warned to be prepared for additional disruption on the bridge due to very strong winds from mid-afternoon on Friday 4 through to the early hours of Saturday.
The bridge is likely to be open to cars only during the evening peak period and a full bridge closure is possible around midnight.
Public transport may be affected, with winds forecast in excess of the level at which buses would be allowed to cross.
Hauliers are advised to plan an alternative route.
The bridge is also expected to be closed to cyclists and pedestrians for most of the afternoon and overnight.
Before the bridge was opened by the Queen on 4 September 1964, cars could only get across the Forth on a ferry.
So the Forth Road Bridge, which at the time was the fourth biggest suspension bridge in the world and the longest outside the United States, was welcomed as an engineering marvel.
It transformed the journey between Edinburgh and Fife and from the north of Scotland to the south.
Traffic on the crossing grew steadily and it now carries 24 million vehicles across the Forth every year - far more than it was originally designed to handle.
But its reputation for engineering excellence has been tarnished over the years by traffic congestion and maintenance problems.

A new Â£1.4bn Queensferry Crossing over the Firth of Forth is due to open in December next year.
It was ordered by ministers because of corrosion of the main suspension cable on the Forth Road Bridge.
