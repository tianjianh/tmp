The telecommunication company said 11 cables were vandalised in Ealing on Saturday affecting people in the capital and parts of the South East.
BT said the vast majority of customers had been reconnected but engineers were still working on the problem.
The issue has also affected some Plusnet and Talk Talk customers.
BT said broadband, TV and mobile services were unaffected.
