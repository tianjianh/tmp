Lewis Dunne death: Witnesses describe finding shot teenager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A witness heard a "loud bang" and "a low moan" at the time a teenager was shot dead in what may have been a case of mistaken identity, a court heard.

Lewis Dunne, 16, was shot in the back in Eldonian Village, Vauxhall, Liverpool, in November 2015.
Jake Culshaw, 25, of no fixed address, and brothers John and Paul Martin, aged 20 and 25, of Walton, all deny murder.
The prosecution claim they mistakenly targeted Lewis as they sought revenge following an earlier altercation.
The accused men had been involved in violent clashes with another group before Lewis was killed, the jury was told.
James Watson, who found Lewis on a canal towpath, told the court he was standing on a bridge over the canal when he saw something below.
As he got close, he realised it was a person whose eyes were open and who had blood coming from the nose.
He then went to get help from a nearby house.
The man he alerted, Daniel Newby, said he had heard a "very very loud bang" which he thought must have been a gun.
He also heard a low "moan sound - 'aah'" which he now believes was the noise Lewis made after he was shot.
Another witness, Zoe Poole, described hearing a loud bang and seeing men run away from the scene quickly - one of them holding something long.
Some of Lewis's relatives left the court in tears as the jury heard the details of how he came to be found.
The prosecution claim the defendants believed Lewis to be a member of the rival group with which they had clashed earlier that day because he had similar-looking curly hair.
The jury were shown CCTV footage of cars ramming and chasing each other in the early hours of the day on which Lewis was shot.
Witnesses described how groups of men chased each other on foot and in cars in and around pubs in the Vauxhall Road area of Liverpool.
One witness described one of the men as having hair as "sticking out wild from his baseball cap. It was very distinctive."
The trial, expected to last between four and six weeks, continues on Tuesday.
