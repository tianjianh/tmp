The 33-year-old central defender has made more than 100 league appearances for the Black Cats since joining from Manchester United in 2011.
O'Shea won 15 major honours at Old Trafford, including five league titles and the 2008 Champions League.
"I'm really happy that I can continue here for another two years," he said.
"To captain a club like this and to play in front of our fantastic supporters is a huge honour and I look forward to showing my commitment on the pitch in the years to come."
Sunderland boss Gus Poyet said: "He is our captain, one of our leaders and I am sure he will continue to help us get better and stronger as a team. I really look forward to continuing to work with John."
O'Shea scored an injury-time equaliser for the Republic of Ireland against Germany in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday, on a night he won his 100th international cap.
Sunderland, currently 13th in the Premier League, travel to Southampton on Saturday.
