An "eyesore" former sorting office has been chosen as the site of the University of Bristol's new campus.

Earlier this month the university said it was assessing potential locations as its current campus was near capacity.
The new Temple Quarter Campus will house a "digital innovation hub", a "business school of the future" and student residential village.
Elected mayor Marvin Rees said he is glad the site is being transformed as it was "dragging Bristol down".
More on this and other news from the West of England.
"In future, visitors will no longer be welcomed to Bristol by a derelict building, but by a flourishing and inclusive home of digital excellence, innovation, education and industry," he added.
It is hoped the campus will open in time for the start of the 2021/22 academic year.
The former Royal Mail sorting office at Cattle Market Road has been derelict since 1997.
