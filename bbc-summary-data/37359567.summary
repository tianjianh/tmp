Alison Jane Farr-Davies, 42, was found dead at a home in Neath Road, Hafod, at about 13:35 BST on Tuesday afternoon.
Police said officers responded to several calls from residents who reported seeing a man in the road between 13:00 and 14:00, and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
The arrested man, 37, remains in custody at Swansea Central station.
Acting Det Supt Kath Pritchard thanked people who stopped at the scene to help on Tuesday.
She also said detectives were keen to talk to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious involving a man and a woman in the area at the time of the Swansea City v Chelsea football match at the Liberty Stadium.
"There was a football car park in this area so there would have been a lot of people around at the time," she said.
"These people may have information that could be of assistance to us regarding Alison's death."
