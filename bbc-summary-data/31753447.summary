Twelve rail lines across the north of England have been prioritised for electrification.

The Calder Valley and Liverpool to Manchester via Warrington Central lines are seen as most in need of work.
A cross-party group set up by the government to advise on rail investment has published a report recommending which routes to improve first.
The "Tier One" lines should be considered for the next funding cycle of 2019-2024, the task force said.
Electric trains accelerate faster than their diesel equivalents and would allow for shorter journey times, according to the report.
The North of England Electrification Task Force said new electric trains would also mean less overcrowding on the routes.
A number of routes across northern England are already being electrified, including Liverpool to Wigan and the Manchester-Bolton-Preston-Blackpool line.
Passengers made the first journey on an electric train between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport on Thursday.
But work on the 32 non-electrified routes looked at by the task force will be dependent on Network Rail.
Twelve lines were classed as Tier One, with the remaining routes split between Tier Two and Tier Three.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: "I want to see a rolling plan for further electrification and this study will have a vital part to play in setting the agenda for 2019 and beyond.
"Network Rail will take the task force's findings into account as it develops its nationwide plan to improve the nation's railways."
