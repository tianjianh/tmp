[SN]TITLE[SN]
Go-ahead for Dunluce Castle visitor centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim farmer has been granted permission to build his own visitors centre and car park at Dunluce Castle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean McKinley, who owns a farm beside the castle on the north coast, plans to build the centre just opposite it.
After a planning debacle that has lasted for years, the Planning Appeals Commission has now granted outline planning approval for the development.
It allows for the demolition of the existing tea rooms at Dunluce and some farm buildings.
They will be replaced with a "visitor centre building incorporating tourism, recreational, educational, hot food, retail and conference and office uses".
Speaking publicly for the first time about his plan, Mr McKinley told the BBC that he hopes to begin work on the centre within the next 12 to 18 months.
"This kicked off approximately five years ago because of tourist numbers increasing on the site," he said.
"I personally felt there was an opportunity for me to enhance the site, and not be selfish on the site, and facilitate the people who come from all around the world.
"Equally important is that people in the private sector in the area also get a spin out of this. That was my intention from the start and still is."
His plan includes provision for a car park.
Unlike at the Giant's Causeway, parking at Dunluce Castle is free.
Asked if this is likely to change after his development goes ahead, Mr McKinley said: "Possibly further down the line. That has all to be played out. It all depends how we go forward with funding etc. "
Scheme architect Johann Muldoon said: "We are beyond delighted. Projects like this at an iconic site beside a national monument only come along once in a lifetime."
Mr McKinley first applied for planning approval several years ago and because of the delays involved in the planning process, he brought his case to the appeals commission for adjudication.
It has now found in his favour and granted him the approval to go ahead with his private scheme, subject to more detailed plans being submitted.
The Department of the Environment has its own plans to enhance the visitor experience at Dunluce.
Originally, planners objected to the farmers' proposals.
The Planning Authority presented 10 reasons why it should be turned down, but at the appeal hearing all 10 reasons for refusal were withdrawn.
A spokesperson for the DoE said: "The department remains committed to the development of a heritage visitors centre at Dunluce.
"It is considering options for how best to do so and will be engaging with the adjacent landowner [Mr McKinley] and with other organisations, including the National Trust and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council in doing so."
