George Oakley: AFC Wimbledon forward makes Maidstone United loan switch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone United have signed striker George Oakley on a month-long loan deal from AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oakley, 21, was given his first-team debut by the Dons in 2014 as a late substitute at Northampton Town.
A hamstring tear and a broken leg, which he sustained in training in January 2016, kept him out for much of last season.
He went on loan to National League South club Welling United in November and scored four times in seven games.
