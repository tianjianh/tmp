[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The male officer was slashed on the neck, face and hand while attempting to arrest Paul Owens at the Leeds store.
Owens, 36, of no fixed address, admitted wounding with intent to resist arrest, attempted theft and possessing an offensive weapon.
He was jailed for six years and 147 days at Leeds Crown Court.
The HMV store on Victoria Walk was closed for about two hours after the attack on 25 November, with witness Liam Hughes describing the incident as "absolute madness".
Owens was eventually arrested after store staff helped to stop him.
Nick Smart, chairman of West Yorkshire Police Federation, said: "Officers are acutely aware of the need to act on and off duty and place themselves in dangerous situations.
"The sentence reflects the seriousness of attack that he suffered."
