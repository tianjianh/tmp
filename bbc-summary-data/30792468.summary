Associated British Ports Southampton buys Marchwood industrial estates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The company which manages Southampton port has bought industrial estates close to its western side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Marchwood Park and Cracknore Hard industrial estates, covering 113.73 acres, were acquired by Associated British Ports (ABP) for an undisclosed amount.
Port director Nick Ridehalgh said the estates would provide "strategic long term value" for the company.
Local councillor David Harrison called for a "statement of intent" from ABP.
The estates are located on the western side of Southampton water, opposite the cruise terminal and Southampton Docks, and are six miles (9.5km) from the M271 motorway.
The sites had been owned by Oceanic Estates for the last 15 years and and are among the largest self-contained industrial and warehouse holdings in the South East with occupiers including Ocado and Royal Mail, according to property consultants Lambert Smith Hampton.
Mr Harrison, who represents Totton South and Marchwood, said: "In the longer term, local people in Marchwood and Totton South will be particularly concerned about any change to future usage of the site. For example, any increases in traffic and more pressure on our overburdened local roads will be completely unacceptable".
Mr Ridehalgh said: "Our intention is to continue to develop the estates to increase the income... and directly contribute to the economic success of the Port of Southampton and the wider region."
