The latest incident happened at Forest Street, off the Springfield Road, at about 20:50 GMT on Thursday. He is in a stable condition in hospital.
Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said it was too early to say if the shootings were linked.
"There is an active line of inquiry around the involvement of violent dissident republicans," he said.
