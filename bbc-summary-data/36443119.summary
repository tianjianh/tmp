It topped the rundown with combined chart sales of 38,000, according to the Official Charts Company.
The achievement comes after the group were named best British newcomer at the Brit Awards earlier this year.
"It's class to be number one with the new album. We're made up with that. Thank you!" the band told the Official Charts Company.
Drake's Views held firm at two in the chart, while Beyonce's Lemonade climbed one place to number three.
Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams jumped four places to four in anticipation of their Wembley Arena dates later this month, and ABC entered the chart at five with The Lexicon of Love II, their first top 10 in 26 years.
Fifth Harmony were another new entry at six with their second album 7/27, while last week's number one - Ariana Grande's Dangerous Woman - tumbled to number eight.
In the singles chart, Drake notched up his eighth week at the top with his single One Dance.
The track is now the longest-running UK chart-topper since Rihanna's Umbrella, which racked up an unbroken 10-week run at the summit in 2007.
One Dance sold just shy of 85,000 combined chart sales, made up of 23,000 sales and 6.15 million streams.
This week's highest new entry goes to Clean Bandit and Louisa Johnson's new single Tears, which dropped in at number six.
The track gives last year's X Factor winner a second top 10, following her number nine peak with the winner's single Forever Young.
US singer-songwriter Gnash enters the top 10 for the first time with I Hate You, I Love You, up four spots to number eight.
There are two more big climbers: Cheat Codes and Kris Kross Amsterdam's Sex - a reworking of Salt-N-Pepa's Let's Talk About Sex - which lifts six places to number 14; and Pink's Just Like Fire jumped 14 spots to 22.
