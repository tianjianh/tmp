Bolton Wanderers fans have paid tribute to one of the last survivors of the 1946 Burnden Park disaster, who has died aged 102.

Fans held a minute's applause for lifelong supporter Phyllis Robb, 10 minutes into their team's home game with Charlton.
Mrs Robb was the subject of a famous photo which showed her being lifted above the crowd.
Thirty-six fans died in the crush at the FA Cup Tie against Stoke.
Mrs Robb, who was born in 1914, died on 19 January. Her nephew David Kay said his aunt would have been very touched by the tribute.
Her funeral is on Wednesday and her ashes are going to be scattered on the pitch at a later date.
Last year Mrs Robb told the BBC she retained vivid memories of the disaster.
She said: "I can remember barriers breaking down and they were all rushing out.
"I was more bothered about my father because he was still inside the ground."
A tribute from the club said: "The image of her escape has become one of the most powerful and iconic images of that fateful day."
Club chaplain Phil Mason added: "To see Phyllis as a young woman among all those people was very powerful indeed.
"She was so full of life and every day was an excitement for her - I remember she went pitch-side on her 100th birthday and it was hard to keep up with her."
