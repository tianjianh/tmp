Conor McCloskey's 67th-minute headed goal put Carrick ahead for the second time but Wilson levelled in the 88th minute with a shot from 25 yards.
Miguel Chines gave Carrick the lead on 31 minutes as his 35-yard free-kick deceived Dungannon keeper Andy Coleman.
Terry Fitzpatrick hit Dungannon's first equaliser with a superb shot on 54.
Both teams are now four points ahead of bottom club Warrenpoint Town following Thursday's game, which was played at Seaview because of Carrick's ongoing pitch problems at their own premises.
Carrick started the brighter with Chines missing a great chance in the ninth minute as Swifts keeper Coleman got down to block the point-blank opportunity after a through ball from McCloskey.
After a lull in proceedings, Carrick took the lead on 31 minutes as Chines' free-kick was allowed to float all the way to the net, with Coleman apparently expecting a flick-on.
Coleman redeemed himself somewhat before the interval as he saved a Kyle Cherry effort.
Dungannon got on terms in the 54th minute as Fitzpatrick struck a great 20-yard shot past James Taylor after some sloppy Carrick defending, with the low drive going in off the keeper's right-hand post.
Carrick restored their advantage 13 minutes later as McCloskey nodded an Aaron Traynor cross past Coleman.
After Traynor missed a chance to extend Carrick's lead, Dungannon had a strong penalty shout turned down in the 78th minute as Andrew Doyle appeared to upend Andrew Mitchell.
To their credit, Dungannon kept battling and Wilson volleyed in a great left-footed equaliser from 25 yards with two minutes remaining.
