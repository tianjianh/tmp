Wales coach Warren Gatland believes Wales are capable of beating South Africa in their last autumn international match.

The Springboks beat Italy 22-6 while Wales were losing 34-16 to New Zealand.
The teams meet in Cardiff on 29 November, with Gatland saying his team are determined after their battling display against the All Blacks.
"If they put that same effort and intensity and commitment in we're good enough to win next week," he said.
Wales led 16-15 going into the last 10 minutes against New Zealand, but three tries in six minutes by the world champions ended the Welsh challenge.
Gatland was proud of his team's display, but acknowledged the All Blacks' position as the leading rugby union team on the planet.
"I think there were periods today when we rattled them," said the New Zealander.
"There were periods in that last 15 minutes when we put them under some pressure, but they came out the other end and that's why they're the best team in the world.
"We've got to learn from that and learn to ensure we keep smart."
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen - who coached Wales between 2002 and 2004 - praised Wales' effort but denied his team was ever "rattled".
"It's called a Test match because it's a test of both your physical and your mental attributes, and when you play a good side you expect to be getting tested.
"I don't think we were rattled, but we were certainly tested."

He added that Wales were overpowered in the last 10 minutes because the All Blacks worked out tactics to counteract the home team's aggressive defence.
Hansen also felt Wales ran out of steam because of the effort they had to put in to keeping the All Blacks at bay.
"The effort they put into that 55 minutes was very, very good and defensively they worked extremely hard to put us under the pressure.
"They did put us under pressure but they had to work hard and at some point you pay a price for that.
"I don't think fitness is their problem, the issue was they had to defend for long periods of the game and it's a lot harder defending than it is attacking."
Gatland said he was proud of his team's display in spite of their 26th consecutive defeat by the All Blacks, and expects them to be able to ask serious questions of the Springboks.
"I was really proud of the performance and the effort and the commitment the guys put in to the game," he added.
"I thought we gave it everything and you can't ask any more from the players.
"It was great that the players responded [after the match] about wanting to make sure that we're capable of putting South Africa under the same sort of pressure and hopefully playing for the full 80 minutes and getting that win."
