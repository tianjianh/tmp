Manchester City face an anxious wait on the fitness of captain Vincent Kompany after he limped out of the Champions League home defeat by Juventus.

Kompany was instrumental as City took the lead, pressuring Giorgio Chiellini into turning the ball into his own net.
However, he sustained a calf injury as the Italians fought back to win 2-1.
"We will have to see how Vincent is on Wednesday," said City manager Manuel Pellegrini. "We will check and see how serious the injury is."
Kompany, 29, was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi - City's Â£32.5m signing from Valencia - after Mario Mandzukic equalised for Juve, with Alvaro Morata scoring the winner nine minutes from time.
Pellegrini was also unable to start with striker Sergio Aguero after he sustained a knee injury early in the win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, although the Argentina international did make a seven-minute appearance as a substitute after City went behind.
"He was not fit to play 90 minutes," said Pellegrini. "It was a risk and I tried not to use him in case he got a kick in the same place."
It was a familiar tale for City - who have yet to win an opening Champions League home game in five attempts in the group stage - but Pellegrini is confident they can still make the last 16.
Their next two games are trips to face German side Borussia Monchengladbach and Spain's reigning Europa League winners Sevilla.
The Chilean, who is 62 on Wednesday, said: "We have 15 more points to play for, so it depends on how we play and what result we get in our next game.
"It is not the best way to start to lose at home to such a strong team in the group as Juventus.
"But this has happened to us before and it doesn't mean we are not going to qualify."
Raheem Sterling was the chief culprit, missing an early chance, then another with City leading 1-0, but Pellegrini said: "I don't think I need to talk about Raheem Sterling. We controlled the game.
"It was a strange game and I don't think we deserved to lose it. I thought we played better than Juventus but they are a strong team.
"We missed chances and we know when we have chances in the Champions League we must score them. Juventus didn't create so many chances."
