We're down to the final five.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Over the past two weeks you have been voting for your favourite goals from 25 years of the Premier League - and we now have a shortlist from which you can choose the best one the league has seen.
We broke the votes down into five-year periods (1992-93 - 1996-97, 1997-98 - 2001-02, 2002-03 - 2006-07, 2007-08 - 2011-12, 2012-13 - 2016-17), with one goal selected from each season.
With a winner picked from each five-year period (see full results below), you can now choose your overall favourite, with the most popular goal revealed on Match of the Day 2 on 13 August.
So what are you waiting for? Take a look and get voting.

The vote closes at 23:10 BST on 13 August.
Tony Yeboah won the first vote - for the seasons 1992-93 to 1996-97 - for his stunning strike for Leeds against Wimbledon in September 1995.
The second vote was won by Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular goal for Arsenal at Newcastle in March 2002.
The third, covering 2002-03 until 2006-07, was won by another Arsenal player, Thierry Henry, for his solo effort against rivals Tottenham in November 2002.
Wayne Rooney took the fourth for his overhead kick against Manchester City in February 2011.
The fifth vote was won by Jack Wilshere for the brilliant Arsenal team move against Norwich in October 2013.
