Manchester United and Bournemouth fans have returned to Old Trafford after a bomb scare led to the postponement of a game between the sides on Sunday.

The south coast club laid on a fleet of coaches to transport fans to Manchester for the second time in three days ahead of the 20:00 BST kick off.
Sunday's game was postponed due to a fake bomb left in a stadium toilet.
Fans said many people were unable to attend the re-arranged game due to work and family commitments.
There were plenty of empty seats. Bournemouth fan Steve Baxter said: "I came with 14 on Sunday but I'm the only one here."
But others such as self-employed Stephen Large and Gary Hickson decided to make one more trip.
"I have been to every game this season and I'm not going to miss this one," he said.
Mr Hickson added; "When we evacuated the stadium I left my programme on the seat and want to go back for another one."
The men said their 12-year-old sons had not been able to make the trip.
Man Utd fan Moses Kamara, from Sierra Leone, whose dream trip to watch United on Sunday was ruined, paid tribute to the fans who have helped him watch the rematch.
"I am so happy, I have had an incredible day," he said.
The fan, whose 3,000 mile (4,800km) trip ended in tears initially, has been looked after by the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), which provided accommodation  and raised funds for the flight home.
"They have treated me so well," he said.
Before that match he was taken round the club museum and also made a pilgrimage to the grave of legendary former United boss Sir Matt Busby.
"It was awesome to go the grave of such a great man," he said.
Brian Dodd, from Christchurch, said: "I work nights... I've had to beg my firm to let me have last night and tonight off. It's cost me a lot of money and a lot of aggravation."
Fan Andrew Hardy was not keen to make a second 10-hour car journey in 48 hours and had tried to sell his tickets on a fans' message board.
"I changed my mind when I was put in touch with three lads who offered to pay petrol if they could get a lift to the match - it meant I could cover my costs and help some other fans."
One group of fans cycled 300 miles from Bournemouth to Old Trafford for Sunday's fixture, raising more than Â£3,000 for Dorset Cancer Care.
Cyclist David Jones called the cancellation a "disappointing end to an amazing few days".
The match on Tuesday finished with United beating Bournemouth 3-1.
The device which prompted Sunday's match to be postponed turned out to be a dummy bomb left behind after a security exercise.
Chris Reid, managing director of Security Search Management & Solutions Ltd (SSMS) - the firm that left the device - has since apologised for making a "devastating mistake".
