"I immediately said yes for one reason and one reason onlyâ€¦ Netflix rhymes with Wet Chicks," joked the star of Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer.
Netflix's members will have exclusive access to the four films.
The multiple movie deal follows the site's announcement it is to release its first feature-length film, a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
In a statement, Netflix called Sandler "a unique and prolific comic voice" and "one of the world's top film stars".
"Let the streaming begin!" said the 48-year-old, who will shortly be seen as a philandering husband in Jason Reitman's film Men, Women and Children.
The former Saturday Night Live star's other films include The Waterboy, Grown Ups, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and the critically acclaimed Punch-Drunk Love.
"People love Adam's films and often watch them again and again," said Netflix's Ted Sarandos. "His appeal spans across viewers of all ages... not just in the US but all over the world."
Founded in 1997 as a postal DVD rental service, Netflix has more than 50 million subscribers in more than 40 countries.
The firm already produces its own TV programmes, notably the politically-themed House of Cards and prison drama Orange is the New Black.
