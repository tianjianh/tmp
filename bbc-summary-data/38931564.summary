German town hall stops fox song after vegan complains

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The German town of Limburg has stopped playing a children's folk song from its town hall bell tower after a complaint from a vegan.

Usually, Fox, You Stole the Goose sounds out frequently on the carillon, a mechanical chiming instrument.
Although the words are not used, a woman was upset by the song line "the hunter will get you with his gun", town spokesman Johannes Laubach said.
But the mayor is facing a wave of anger over the decision, Der Spiegel reports.
Marius Hahn agreed to remove the song from the bell tower's playlist temporarily as a gesture of kindness, the German newspaper reports.
However, his administration's phone has been ringing constantly, it quotes Mr Laubach as saying, with people phoning to express anger over the decision - or over the time being devoted to the issue.
The tower usually chimes out tunes from a list of 33 songs, including German children's songs, tunes from towns that Limburg is partnered with, and seasonal songs such as Silent Night, German media say.
The vegan woman, who is said to work within earshot of the town hall, has not been named.
