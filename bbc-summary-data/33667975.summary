Cornwall shellfish farms re-open after E.coli fear

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shellfish farms on the Helford River and Camel Estuary in Cornwall have re-opened after pollution closure notices were lifted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Temporary closure notices were placed on the shellfish beds after high E.coli bacteria readings last week.
Latest tests have showed satisfactory water quality levels, said the FSA.
Closures remain in place in Devon at Slapton, Taw and Torridge and in Jersey.
An FSA spokesman said: "Recent tests have shown high levels of E.coli contamination in 30 shellfish beds in Cornwall and Devon.
"However, a number of factors have led us to question circumstances which may have led to these unusual results, including the unprecedented nature of the results, the lack of a clear cause and the fact that other testing does not support the view that there is an obvious risk to public health.
"Because of this, the FSA will not follow its normal protocol and in this case will allow the closed shellfish beds to re-open as long as there is one further test that shows the bed has E coli within accepted tolerance levels."
