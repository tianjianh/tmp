Multiple agencies are responding to the incident, said Vermont state police spokesman Scott Waterman.
Amtrak has said there are no "immediate reports of any life-threatening injuries".
In a news release it said the train, travelling south to Washington, derailed after striking a rock slide on the tracks.
Four people were taken away from the scene by ambulance.
Other passengers were taken by school bus to nearby Norwich University.
A deadly Amtrak passenger train derailment in Philadelphia this year killed seven people.
