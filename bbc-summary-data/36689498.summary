Police have warned people in Wrexham to expect traffic delays due to a Stereophonics concert on Saturday.

Doors opened for the gig at Wrexham FC's Racecourse Stadium at 15:00 BST and 20,000 people were expected.
Supt Alex Goss said it would be "the largest influx of people into Wrexham on a single day, to one location, for a considerable time".
It is the first concert at the ground for 30 years, according to Glyndwr University which manages the stadium.
Bosses have said they hope more will follow.
Llandudno band and Brit Awards winners Catfish and the Bottlemen will support the Stereophonics.
The last gig at the stadium in 1982 saw rock legends Motorhead perform along with Budgie, Tank, Raven, Orion and Twisted Sister.
Mold Road will be one-way out of town until 21:45, with inbound traffic diverted.
Nearby Crispin Lane will be closed at the access to the rear of the stadium.
Residents will have to access the roads opposite the stadium via the town centre and, during the road closure, Central Road emerging from Central Retail Park will be coned to one lane and traffic will be directed on to Regent Street.
Supt Goss added: "With such large numbers converging on the town it is important that people, especially those who are not going to the concert, are aware that it will be an extremely busy day and to bear this in mind when out and about."
