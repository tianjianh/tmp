[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and his estranged wife had sex shortly before her death but were "too drunk too finish", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gytis Griskevicius denies attacking and drowning Marina Erte, 33, in the bath at her flat in Boston on 20 May 2016.
Lincoln Crown Court had previously heard he was motivated by jealousy as Ms Erte was in a new relationship.
Mr Griskevicius, 32, of St Ann's Lane, Boston, is accused of murdering Ms Erte just hours after celebrating his birthday at a barbecue with friends.

The court heard evidence from police interviews in which the defendant said his estranged wife had called at his house to wish him happy birthday.
He said they had then visited Asda, and bought alcohol before going back to Ms Erte's flat to drink it.
He told officers that his estranged wife later "became cheeky" and asked him to go to bed with her.
As the interview continued, Mr Griskevicius said: "We went to the bedroom where she took off her clothes and I took off mine."
He said they stared having sex, but added: "We didn't manage to finish because we were so drunk"
The defendant said he left her home at about 02:00 BST and walked home.
"When I left she was quite happy. We had some kisses at the flat. She was alright," he added.
He denied murdering Ms Erte and said he was "sad" she was dead.
It is alleged Griskevicius drowned his estranged wife with a shower attachment before setting fire to her flat in Boston to destroy the evidence.
Ms Erte's naked and badly beaten body was found in the bath at her flat by firemen who had been called out by neighbours.
The trial continues.
