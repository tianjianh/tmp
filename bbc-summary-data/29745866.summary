Adam Jones, Hook & Evans Wales omission shows 'no man is safe'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George North says coach Warren Gatland's omissions of Adam Jones, James Hook and Ian Evans for Wales' autumn squad proves no player is safe.

Like Northampton's North, Jones, Hook and Evans are British and Irish Lions.
But they will not face Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa.
"I think it shows where Gats [Gatland] is right now. I think he's trying to pick on form, I guess," said North, ahead of Saints' European clash against Ospreys on Saturday.
"He's got to try and bring in a few new players.
"Obviously looking at the [2015] World Cup, he's trying to build an ethos that you have to fight for your jersey.
"No man is safe anymore.
"I think you've got to prove that the jersey you're putting on is one you've earned and not one that's just given to you."
Jones said he was "gutted" after missing out on selection.
Gatland said the coaches had asked Jones to work on aspects of his game and that the door was not closed on the Cardiff Blues prop's Test return.
Blues director of rugby Mark Hammett says the player is in "the best shape of his life" and felt he would be ready should Gatland recall him.
Jones joined the Blues from Ospreys in the summer after 11 seasons with the Swansea-based region.
It followed a difficult summer which saw the 2009 and 2013 British and Irish Lions player having to train on his own while negotiations over a new deal at Ospreys stalled.
Jones was substituted after 30 minutes of Wales' 38-16 defeat by South Africa in the first Test last June, and was not included in the match-day squad of 23 for the second Test, which saw Wales give a much improved display before losing 31-30.
His place went to Scarlets tight-head Samson Lee, who has again named in the squad for the autumn Tests.
Hook moved from relegated French Top 14 side Perpignan to Gloucester in the summer.
In the meantime, Cardiff Blues recruited New Zealand-born, Wales-qualified utility back Gareth Anscombe and he has been tipped for a possible national dual contract.
And lock Evans moved from Ospreys to English second-tier club Bristol after a proposed move to Toulon collapsed.
That left Jones as the only major Wales-based regular to be overlooked for November's Tests.
