Championship: Ed Joyce ton gives Sussex upper hand over Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A century from Division Two leading runscorer Ed Joyce put Sussex into a strong position at halfway, just 108 behind Glamorgan at Hove.

Joyce was one of few players to time the ball properly on a sluggish pitch, in an innings off 106 off 177 balls.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph (hand injury) and paceman Michael Hogan (head knock) both sat out the Sussex innings.
Hogan's retirement had prevented Stu Whittingham (4-58) from turning career-best figures into a five-wicket haul.
Hogan was hit on the head by a short-pitched ball from Whittingham, but hopes to resume on day three.
Rudolph, who reached a season's best score of 87, faces an X-ray after being struck on the hand.
Glamorgan's T20 signing Shaun Tait did fielding duty as 13th man, more than seven years after the Australia paceman's last first-class game.
Joyce dominated a stand of 133 for the first Sussex wicket with Chris Nash.
But Nash fell for 37 to debutant spinner Owen Morgan, who conceded only 37 runs in 20 overs.
Glamorgan spinner Owen Morgan told BBC Wales Sport:
"I was pretty pleased with how it went on that type of wicket. Pretty flat with not much assistance.
"It was a bit of a grind but, if we can get three quick wickets, then we can get right back in the game.
"There was Dean Cosker and Andrew Salter ahead of me going into the season, but thankfully I've taken a few wickets for the seconds and my opportunity's come.
"Hopefully I can remain in the first team for the remainder of the season."
