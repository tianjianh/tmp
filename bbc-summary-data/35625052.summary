A member of the public found the body at Polpeor Cove, on the Lizard Peninsula, on Saturday morning.
They alerted Falmouth Coastguard who contacted Devon and Cornwall Police at about 11:00 GMT.
A force spokesman said officers were making inquires to identify the man and at this stage it was not clear how he died. He said the death was not being treated as suspicious.
The spokesman added the body was not that of RSPCA inspector Mike Reid who disappeared near Penzance on 7 February.
