They were due to meet for the vacant belt on Saturday 20 May at Ravenscraig Sports Centre in Motherwell.
"I'm gutted for Gary because he had a real chance of becoming Scotland's first-ever British heavyweight champion," promoter Paul Graham said.
"But we've been left with no choice other than to cancel the show."
The event was also due to feature Connor Law, Eddie Doyle, Rhys Pagan, JP McGuiness, Leon Roberts and Martin Taylor.
