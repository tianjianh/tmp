Two-time champion Petra Kvitova needed less than an hour to beat Romania's Sorana Cirstea and seal a Wimbledon second-round spot.

The Czech, winner in 2011 and 2014, broke Cirstea four times during a 6-0 6-4 victory on Court 18.
World number 10 Kvitova, 26, will face the winner of the match between Ekaterina Makarova and Johanna Larsson.
The match was delayed to the afternoon session after wet weather meant play was only possible on Centre Court.

Agnieszka Radwanska played one of the few matches of the morning, and came through in straight sets on Centre Court against Kateryna Kozlova.
The 27-year-old third seed beat Ukrainian Kozlova 6-2 6-1 under the roof despite being broken once in the first set.
The 2012 runner-up now faces Croatia's Ana Konjuh, who beat Italy's Karin Knapp 6-3 6-3.
"Of course, a one-hour match is always good. I'm very happy with that win," world number three Radwanska told BBC Sport.
It was the first meeting between Radwanska and 22-year-old Kozlova, who was making her main-draw debut at SW19.
"It's just like an indoor tournament," Radwanska said. "We have to get used to it. It's good we could play today."
German 32nd seed Andrea Petkovic set up a second-round match with Russia's Elena Vesnina by beating Nao Hibino 3-6 7-5 6-2.
Petkovic has reached the semi-finals of the French Open, as well as the last eight of the Australian and US Open, but has never progressed beyond round three at Wimbledon.
"I've had a strange love affair with grass because it wasn't love at first sight," she said.
"It's been a growing love, maybe like when you have an old school friend that you meet again after 10 years and suddenly you realise - 'Ah that's the one, I actually kind of like him'.
"I really want to do well here and I'm trying my all."
Meanwhile, Swiss seventh seed Belinda Bencic progressed to round two by beating Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova 6-2 6-3.
Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, ranked 23 in the world, beat Taiwanese Su-Wei Hsieh 7-5 1-6 6-1 for a second-round meeting with Kazakh Yulia Putintseva.
