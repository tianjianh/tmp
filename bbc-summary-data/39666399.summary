John McKay, 46, stabbed William Scott seven times during a "furious and murderous" assault in a flat in Airdrie in April 2016.
A court was told that a seven-year-old girl found Mr Scott, 43, blood-soaked and dying on his bathroom floor following the attack.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lady Scott ordered McKay, from Airdrie, to serve a life sentence.
He was found guilty of murder following an earlier trial at the High Court in Glasgow.
The jury heard that McKay was in a secret relationship with Mr Scott's partner, Louisa Corcoran, 34.
He carried out the attack after learning that Mr Scott had verbally abused Ms Corcoran in a phone call, upon discovering the relationship.
Lady Scott told McKay that his crime was "out of character" as he had no history of violence.
She added: "It appears to be related to your depression at the time, for which you were receiving treatment and a history of animosity with the deceased, in the context of your affair with the deceased's partner being discovered.
"Whatever the background, you went to the deceased's house when angry and demanded entry. You were seen aggressively banging on the windows and kicking the door to get in."
She said McKay stabbed his victim seven times, with the fatal wound piercing his liver.
"It appears you also gripped the deceased's neck with such severe force as to break the thyroid cartilage inside on either side," she added.
"In total 67 injuries were inflicted. This was a truly ferocious and murderous assault."
During the earlier trial, McKay denied murder and claimed he had been provoked.
His defence advocate Edward Targowski QC told Lady Scott that experts had assessed McKay at being at a low risk of reoffending when he is eventually released from prison.
