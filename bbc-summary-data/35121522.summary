Tequiilah Burke: Newcastle couple jailed for baby death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who caused the death of their baby, who suffered brain injuries during a jealous row between the pair, have been jailed for eight years each.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tequiilah Burke, who was 16 weeks old, sustained fatal injuries and bruising during the argument in December 2013, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
Victoria Burke, 24, and partner Paul Nicholson, 20, of Crigdon Hill, East Denton, had denied responsibility.
They were convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child.
Nicholson had gone on the run as the jury was about to be sent out on 8 December, but was later arrested in the Byker area.
He was sentenced to an additional three months for breaching bail.
The trial heard the couple had argued in the early hours of 14 December 2013, after Burke came home late from work in a nightclub, and Nicholson believed she was associating with other men.
At some point Tequiilah was injured by one or both of them. She was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where she died.
A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered recent bruising, as well as brain swelling and bleeding.
Judge Mr Justice Jay said: "The precise circumstances leading up to the death are not wholly clear, largely because you have deliberately refrained from giving an honest account of what happened to medical staff, the police and the jury."
Nicholson shouted abuse and had to be restrained and carried from the dock when sentence was passed.
Speaking afterwards, Det Ch Insp Nicola Musgrove of Northumbria Police described it as "a tragic case".
She said "Paul Nicholson and Victoria Burke have refused to accept any responsibility for their action which led to the death of a 16-week old baby.
"Nicholson has then tried to avoid his punishment and led police on a man hunt, which was completely foolish of him.
"They have been utterly dishonest and shown no remorse throughout the investigation. I welcome the outcome of the court today."
