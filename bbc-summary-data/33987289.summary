[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marvin Couson, 39, was wounded at the Lime in London bar in Shoreditch in May 2002. He was left unable to communicate or leave his bed, and died on 8 August.
Police have launched a murder investigation and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
Mr Couson, who suffered injuries to his internal organs, was cared for at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability.
About 600 people were at the bar on 12 May 2002 when police were called to reports of gunfire. They found Mr Couson lying on the ground outside with a gunshot wound to the chest.
A man was arrested during the police investigation, but later released with no further action.
Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh said: "For 13 years Marvin's family have been at his bedside and now, tragically, he has succumbed to the injuries he suffered.
"We have launched a full murder investigation and, despite the passage of time, are committed to finding the person who shot Marvin that night."
He added: "We know there are potential witnesses who did not speak to police at the time and I would ask them to now please come forward with any information, no matter how small. Do not assume that someone else will contact police."
Until a change in the law in 1996, a murder was only deemed to have been committed if the victim died within a year and a day.
