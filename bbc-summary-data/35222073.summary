Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe believes loan signing Juan Iturbe will add quality to his squad.

Iturbe, 22, signed from Roma until the end of the season, could make his Cherries debut against Birmingham in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.
Roma paid more than Â£17m for the Argentine winger in July 2014.
"He will bring energy, creativity, pace and can pick a pass. We're hopeful that he can have a big impact for us," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
Bournemouth are awaiting a work permit for Iturbe before he can be cleared to play at St Andrew's.
"It was a really long process to get the deal agreed," added Howe. "A player of his calibre is not one you would normally associate with a club like us.
"But we're trying to compete and stay in the Premier League. To do that, we need to get the best players.
"We had competition and we were able to secure his signature in a move that favoured us so we get to look at him before any decision is made to sign him permanently."
Iturbe has made 19 appearances in all competitions for Roma this season, including Champions League games against Barcelona and Bayer Leverkusen.
