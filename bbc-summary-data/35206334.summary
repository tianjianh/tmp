A pub has been forced to close for three months after reports of dozens of violent crimes linked to gangs, West Midlands Police said.

The force said since the start of 2014 it received 60 calls about crimes at The Earl of Dudley Arms in Wellington Road, Dudley, including five serious assaults and an attempted murder.
A closure notice was served at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court.
The licensee was also ordered to pay costs of Â£750.
Det Ch Insp Chris Hanson, from West Midlands Police CID, said: "The licence holder of Earl of Dudley has a duty to protect his customers but he has failed to do that: he has allowed members of a local gang to frequent his premises and commit serious acts of violence towards innocent customers.
"In the latest incident earlier this month a man was badly beaten inside the premises. Two men have been charged in connection with that attack and await trial."
