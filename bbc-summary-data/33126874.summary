Beverly Hills police said they received calls about 19:45 local time reporting a possible drunken driver.
Officers later stopped Stamos, 51, who was the only person in the vehicle. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center but later returned home.
Stamos is set to produce and appear in a reboot of Full House for Netflix, which is expected to debut next year.
"Thanks to everyone for their love & support. I'm home & well,'' Stamos tweeted late Saturday morning.
"Very appreciative of the BHPD & Cedars for their care."
Stamos starred in Full House, which aired on ABC from 1987 to 1995.
He also has the leading role in new Fox comedy, Grandfathered, due to air in the autumn in the US.
His other credits include The New Normal, Glee and ER.
