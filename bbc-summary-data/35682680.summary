[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Manchester United chief executive David Gill has said he will help Fifa reform its finances, if asked by new president Gianni Infantino.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Swiss succeeded Sepp Blatter on Friday, the same day reforms were passed as the governing body aims to recover from a corruption crisis.
Blatter quit last year and was later suspended for six years from football.
Gill, 58, who is also on the Uefa executive committee, said: "Fifa has got to rebuild."
He added: "I sit on Uefa's finance committee and had that role at the Premier League so I would be prepared to do it at Fifa."
The organisation's executive committee is to be expanded to a 36-seat council following the passing of the reforms. Fifa's finance committee must have an independent chairman, while any executive committee member who also sits on the finance committee is required to have a financial qualification.
"I am happy to get involved," said Gill, who is a qualified chartered accountant.
Gill had worked with Infantino at Europe's governing body since 2013.
"What  Infantino can do - and what he has done at Uefa - is build a good team around him," Gill added.
"It's not just one person doing it. Yes, he's president and he'll set the tone. But, at the same time, he will understand he's got to do it with a team.
"He's got a great understanding of what it takes to run Uefa. He can use those skills and translate those on to the world stage now."
