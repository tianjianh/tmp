At its peak, stop-start traffic stretched back for 45 miles, from Malpas, Newport, to Chippenham.
One Direction are playing the first of two nights at the Millennium Stadium - while Manic Street Preachers are at Cardiff Castle for BBC Music Day.
Traffic still remains slow between junctions 23 Magor and 26 Malpas.
Traffic Wales and the Trunk Road Agency in England said the delays began building on the motorway from about 12:40 BST on Friday.
A Traffic Wales spokesman said: "It is definitely because of the two concerts.
"The traffic is flowing but slowly."
The highways official said delays were down to "just the sheer volume of traffic" rather than any incident or accident.
Park and ride facilities put on to cope with the events have also come under huge pressure, with concert-goers warned that the Cardiff east park and ride at Pentwyn has no spaces left, and only limited space left at the Cardiff west site.
