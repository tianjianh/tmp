A picture of people photographing the summer solstice at Stonehenge is the winner of this year's British Life Photography award. The image, titled Past Present, was taken by Elena Marimon Munoz and triumphed in the Brits on Holiday category.
The competition, which aims to showcase "the essence and spirit of British life", was open to both amateur and professional photographers.
"By the time the sun started to rise above the stones, hundreds, if not thousands of people, had gathered inside the stone circle, phones and cameras up in the air ready to record the magical moment," says Marimon Munoz. "In the picture, I wanted to capture the mixture of ancient history and modern technology, fused together - past and present."
"After spotting it whilst driving along the Golden Road on the east coast of Harris, I jumped out of the car on the single-track road to catch the backlit scene before the sun disappeared behind the clouds again."
"I was out in east London documenting the streets. Walking along Holywell Lane, famous for street graffiti, I stumbled across this team freshly designing a unique urban fresco," says Mellish.
"I really like the symmetry between the artists in relation to the characters they are painting."
An early-morning fog envelopes Tower Bridge as commuters make their way to work in Nick Isden's winning image.
"George, 84, has lived in this flat for 42 years. He shared it with his sister Doris until she was moved into a care home. George has also moved into new accommodation as a result of a regeneration programme.
"This image was part of an installation challenging common prejudices about people living on council estates, as well as exploring the sense of loss and gain that irreversible change brings with it," says Janke.
"I love the old fishing net huts and boats here," says Parker. "They provided the perfect background to capture this snow flurry."
"Established in 1903, the Gainsborough Silk Weaving Company in west Suffolk is now one of the oldest and last remaining commercial mills in England.  It has produced many fabrics for the Royal Family as well as state buildings worldwide."
Dan Giannopoulos's project, titled Living with Dementia looks, at life for Dennis and his family.
"Dennis suffered a stroke in August 2008. The stroke triggered the onset of vascular dementia. After spending a number of months being cared for by his wife Ruby, the decision was made to transfer him to a care facility nearby," says Giannopoulos.
Dennis is being visited by his youngest daughter, Jane, on his last day in his family home, where he's lived with his wife Ruby for almost 30 years.
"The protest was aimed at British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her refusal to impose harsh enough economic measures against South Africa to force President Botha's government to end apartheid," says Wiedel. "Banners demanded the release of Nelson Mandela serving a life sentence for a 1964 conviction for plotting sabotage."
Protesters gather outside Downing Street to urge the prime minister to back the ban on hunting with dogs in Luke Dray's winning shot.
