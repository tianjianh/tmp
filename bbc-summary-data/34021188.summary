The Windrush was named after the first boat which brought people from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948.
The exhibition, called 'From Caribbean Isles to the British Isles -Home to Home', aims to give an insight into people who travelled across the Atlantic to seek a better life in what was still the Empire's "mother country".
