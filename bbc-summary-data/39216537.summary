Portsmouth City Council has put up new road signs after a six-month campaign against an enforcement camera near the Queen Alexandra Hospital.
Patients and visitors were fined more than £10,000 a week and argued signs around Cavell Drive were easy to miss.
Campaigner Andrew Peryer was fined two days after his wife's death.
The camera was set up in July last year and regularly caught out drivers using the bus lane.
The campaign began after Mr Peryer was sent a picture of him and terminally-ill wife Wendy, 53, using the bus lane, and a £60 fine after she died from cancer.
He said: "It was quite a shock to have that through the post. I really wanted to make sure it wasn't going to happen again to someone who was unsuspecting."
Mr Peryer confronted the council and said warning signs were partially hidden by a bus shelter and other billboards and drivers were "genuinely making a mistake".
Portsmouth City Council argued the signs complied with legal requirements, but six months on the authority has taken action.
Council figures previously revealed the enforcement camera amassed fines totalling £123,000 within 11 weeks of it being installed.
A further 1,453 tickets had been issued since November, bringing the total fines to more than £210,000.
Councillor Jim Fleming, cabinet member for traffic and transportation, said: "We listened to resident feedback and have made some updates which we hope will address the confusion that some people experiences."
Mr Peryer said it was a "great result" and the signage was "as it should be".
Portsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt also backed the campaign and said the council should now review any "high-income" sights for driving fines.
