[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 1-0 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage won their eighth home game in a row and strengthened their League Two play-off position in the process after edging to victory against Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Pett's solitary strike was enough for the win, despite both sides missing a host of chances, as Darren Sarll's men moved five points clear of eighth-placed Blackpool.
David Tutonda's snapshot gave Barnet an early chance, but Stevenage gained the lead soon after when Pett, stretchered off last time out against Cambridge, hit a first time shot that bounced in after a cruel deflection deceived Jamie Stephens.
Weston tested Chris Day with a rasping 30-yard strike, and the Bees could count themselves unlucky not to draw level when John Akinde missed a rare one-on-one after a superb flighted ball from Ruben Bover.
In the second half, Matt Godden lashed a half volley just wide, then curled inches over moments later as Stevenage looked to put the game to bed.
Akinde wasted another great chance when played in after Tutonda won possession high up the pitch, while at the other end of the pitch Boro top scorer Godden found the back of the net late on, only to be denied by the linesman's flag.
