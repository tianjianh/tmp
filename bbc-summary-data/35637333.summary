There were 14 minutes added on at the end of the first half after Pilgrims defender Jordon Forster was taken off on a stretcher with a head injury.
Argyle came closest before the break, Reuben Reid firing wide and James Pearson heading an effort off the line.
Yiadom netted on the turn after a forceful John Akinde run, making it just one loss in eight for the Bees.
Barnet remain 15th in League Two while the Pilgrims host Oxford, who leapfrogged them into second, on Saturday.
Speaking after the match, Plymouth boss Derek Adams revealed first indications say Forster has a broken jaw while striker Ryan Brunt, who was also forced off, has a suspected cruciate ligament injury.
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London:
"I think they played quite well in the first half and we didn't actually make our mark on the game.
"At half-time I encouraged our players to show some more self-belief, a bit more tenacity and some more courage.
"It was a very, very good second-half performance - I'd say up there with the best."
