The Robins, 18th in the Championship, gave debuts to new signings Milan Djuric, Jens Hegeler and Bailey Wright.
Home keeper Frank Fielding produced a fine save to deny David Ball early on, while Fleetwood's Alex Cairns saved from Korey Smith and Lee Tomlin.
Bosnia-Herzegovina striker Djuric went closest after the break, hitting the side netting and heading wide late on.
City could be without defender Adam Matthews for the replay on 17 or 18 January after he was ruled out with a hamstring injury ahead of kick-off. Keeper Fielding and midfielder Smith also both limped off with first-half injuries.
It promises to be a stiff test for Lee Johnson's side at Highbury Stadium, where Fleetwood, who have never reached round four, have not lost in nine matches.
Fleetwood rode their luck at times at Ashton Gate as City had 63% of possession and 18 shots. But Uwe Rosler's side are now 12 matches unbeaten in all competitions.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "I was quite pleased with the way we played. The new boys were fantastic and we had just one day to work with them on a new formation. Jens Hegeler looked like a Rolls Royce, while Bailey Wright did what it said on the tin with his performance and big Milan Djuric also did well.
"We stopped the rot of defeats, kept a clean sheet and dominated possession. So we can move forward to our next Championship game against Cardiff with a bedrock of a solid display."
Fleetwood manager Uwe Rosler: "Keeping our good record going against a Championship club who have just made three great signings was very pleasing.
"They controlled the game in the second half, but it was credit to our defensive organisation and attitude that we restricted them mainly to shots from outside the box."
