Neil Warnock: Cardiff City boss warns things could be 'worse before they are better'

Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock has told fans they may have to be patient before their form turns around and they move up the Championship table.

"It could get worse before it gets better," Warnock said before Cardiff face his former club Huddersfield Town.
The Bluebirds are 21st in the table and lost their last two league games before the international break.
"I am sure the lads will be doing their utmost now in the next few weeks to take us up the table."
Saturday's home game with third-placed Huddersfield is followed by a trip to improving Aston Villa, before title contenders Brighton visit Cardiff City Stadium.
"It's a tough run now with the games we have coming up," Warnock said.
"But we just have to get on until January now and see what we can do. We don't want it to [get worse], we have to roll our sleeves up.
"I am aware of the difficulty of the fixtures we have coming up. I think on our day we can beat anybody."
Warnock brought Marouane Chamakh, Sol Bamba, Junior Hoilett and Kieran Richardson to the club in October but is already planning ahead for the January window.
He indicated again that the club will be busy during January's transfer window and that he has two or three players on his wish list, with some players set to be moved on.
"I think there are two or three needed in the squad to give it different dimensions in the Championship," Warnock added.
"I don't think its a massive job. I think the squad needs thinning as well.
"Certain players need to be leaving now and finding fresh pastures which enables you to get a few fresher faces in."
Warnock has no plans to recall striker Rhys Healey from his loan at League Two Newport, believing the front runner is benefitting from regular football.
He said: "If I feel they are good enough, I won't hesitate. I am not saying I won't call him back, but with what we have I feel he is better off getting game time there."
