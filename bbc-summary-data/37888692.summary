Liverpool's mid-river fireworks event disappoints crowds

More than 200,000 gathered for a huge Bonfire Night spectacular on the River Mersey, but many said it was disappointing.

The event was held on the waterfront for the first time, having replaced traditional displays in suburban parks in Liverpool and Wirral.
Hundreds of people later took to social media to lambast what some described as a "rubbish" and "disappointing" night.
Council officer Claire McColgan said the council would "assess feedback".
The event was designed so crowds could line both sides of the River Mersey to watch fireworks launched from barges.
But, some spectators said the fireworks were too far away, while others bemoaned the lack of musical accompaniment.
Posting on Twitter, Zoe Whittingham said: "Travel to Liverpool to see the firework display on the docks and what a load of rubbish! No music and the worst fireworks I've seen!"
Caitlin Austin wrote: "The fireworks on the docks tonight were so disappointing. Liverpool City Council what were you playing at?"
Alexandra Jones said: "Such a disappointment! No atmosphere and poorly organised!"
However, some people defended the event.
Music Mafia said: "It wasn't all bad. The warm up event was brilliant."
Nicola Bolton  said: "Great view, great fireworks. Liverpool was heaving!"
Ms McColgan, Liverpool City Council's head of culture, admitted plans for a smartphone app to allow people to listen to music during the display were not made clear.
She also insisted the warm-up event, which featured drumming and aircraft pyrotechnics, had been a success.
She said: "We tried to do something new this year. Some people didn't like it, some did. We will take whatever lessons have been learned into next year.
"In terms of the fireworks on the river, the Mersey is so big and there are challenges around that. The drumming and the planes were brilliant."
Asked if the council would consider bringing displays back to local parks next year, Ms McColgan said: "Of course. We will consider everything."
A council spokesman said the authority would like to point out that the fireworks themselves were funded by the private sector.
