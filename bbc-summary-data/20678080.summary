The second round of data released from the 2011 Census showed 12.1% of Boston residents held such passports. The Lincolnshire average was 3.5%.
Figures also showed 83.9% of the market town described itself as white British.
Last month the Boston Protest Group held a demonstration aimed at highlighting the pressure it said migrants put on local services.
The district employs a large number of seasonal workers on surrounding farms to harvest fruits and vegetables.
Figures show about 10,000 people born abroad live in Boston - 3,000 of them were from Poland - more than in any local authority outside the South East.
Lincolnshire was shown to be home to about 50,000 foreign-born residents, a rise of about 30,000 since the 2001 Census.
