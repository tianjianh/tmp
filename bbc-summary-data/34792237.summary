[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas 'Slab' Murphy tax evasion trial told of nine-year gap

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of prominent republican Thomas 'Slab' Murphy has been told that a man of the same name and address did not pay taxes for nine years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old from Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, is being tried for tax evasion at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court.
He denies nine charges against him.
A revenue inspector told the court he believed Mr Murphy was involved in the farming business and that, from 1996 to 2004, he did not file any tax returns.
Prosecutors allege that Mr Murphy conducted significant dealings in relation to cattle and land, and received farming grants from the Department of Agriculture but failed to make any returns to revenue.
The prosecution followed an investigation by the Republic of Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).
The revenue inspector's evidence was heard last week during legal argument, but defence lawyers raised objections about its admissibility.
On Wednesday, the three-judge, non-jury court, ruled that the testimony was admissible.
The revenue inspector, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court that he was instructed to carry out an investigation into the tax affairs of Thomas Murphy in October 2005.
He said he examined various papers including bank account documents, cattle mart invoices, Department of Agriculture grant cheque documents, EU Area Aid application forms, statements from cattle mart staff and documents seized by CAB from the homes of Mr Murphy and members of his family.
The inspector told the court he was satisfied that "based on documentary evidence that he [Thomas Murphy] was a chargeable person and that he should have furnished returns".
Mr Murphy has already pleaded not guilty to nine charges alleging that he failed to furnish a return of his income, profits or gains or the source of his income, profits or gains to the Collector General or the Inspector of Taxes for the years 1996/97 to 2004.
The trial continues.
