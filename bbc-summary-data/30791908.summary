Two swastikas etched into doors at the Springwood Jewish Cemetery in Allerton were discovered by members of the Allerton Hebrew Congregation on Monday.
Merseyside Police has opened an investigation.
Rabbi Dan Lieberman said following the terrorist attack in Paris on Wednesday "the Jewish community is very aware that there are people out there who want to cause us harm".
He added: "We don't expect to see it on the streets of Liverpool, but it's come to visit us as well."
