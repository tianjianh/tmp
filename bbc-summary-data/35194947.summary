Four people have been arrested over a wedding video which showed Israeli revellers apparently celebrating a deadly arson attack on a Palestinian family, Israeli police say.

Reports say one of those arrested is the groom. The footage showed guests singing and dancing with weapons.
One stabbed a picture of a Palestinian baby who died in the attack in July.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the "shocking" scenes, aired on Israeli television.
Wedding-goers could also be heard singing about taking revenge on Palestinians in the video.
Police opened an investigation into the events on suspicion of incitement to violence.
Israeli media identified one of the suspects as a resident of the Jewish settlement of Kfar Tapuach in the occupied West Bank. The four were arrested on Tuesday, a week after the footage was broadcast.
It was filmed at a Jewish wedding in Jerusalem earlier this month.
In the clip, young Orthodox Jewish men are seen dancing with knives, guns and fire bombs while singing about revenge.
One of the revellers stabs a picture of 18-month-old Ali Dawabsha, who was killed in an arson attack on his home in the Palestinian village of Duma.
His parents, Saad and Riham, were also killed, while his five-year-old brother, Ali, was injured in the attack.
Several youths, whom the authorities suspect of belonging to a "Jewish terror organisation", have been arrested in connection with the attack.
