A manhunt was launched for Jed Allen, 21, who was suspected of killing his half-sister Derrin Jordon, aged six, his mother Janet Jordon, 48, and her partner Philip Howard, 44.
A post mortem examination confirmed they died from multiple stab wounds.
Their bodies were found in Vicarage Road, Didcot on Saturday. Allen's body was found in Oxford on Monday.
The body found in woodland is yet to be formally identified, but police are satisfied it is Allen.
A statement on behalf of Janet and Derrin's family said: "Janet was a beloved daughter, sister and auntie.
"Dezzy was a breath a fresh air and truly one of a kind.
"For a family to lose someone so young cannot be explained in mere words."
Philip's older brother said his family was in "shock and disbelief".
"My beloved bro and Uncle Philip you'll be missed so much," he said.
A statement from Philip's children said: "Take care of our sister Dezzy up there daddy, take care of Jan too.
"We wish you didn't have to go Daddy, it's our worst nightmare come true."
The search for Allen ended on Monday after a body was found off Marston Ferry Road in Oxford around 17:00 BST.
Police confirmed the 21-year-old was their prime suspect after officers discovered the bodies of Ms Jordon, Mr Howard and Derrin at 20:20 BST on Saturday.
More than 100 police were deployed to search Oxford University Parks where Allen worked as a groundsman.
Detectives believed he had arrived in the city by train from Didcot at 17:45 on Saturday.
Police have reopened Vicarage Road, but a cordon remains in place around the crime scene where officers are expected to remain until Thursday.
