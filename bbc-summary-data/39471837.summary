Two men and a woman were hit outside Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood at about 03:10 BST.
Eyewitness John Rolfe said the incident followed a fight which "escalated to 50 or 60 people".
Police said the three people injured - with one seriously hurt - were hit by a blue Audi.
An appeal has been launched for witnesses or anyone with footage to contact police.
Det Ch Insp Stephen Jennings, of the Essex and Kent Serious Crime Directorate, said he believed it was an "isolated" incident that happened as "hundreds of people" left the club when it closed.
"We would like to speak to anyone who was inside the Sugar Hut during the evening, but outside between 02:30 and 03:30 BST," he said.
"We are reviewing CCTV and are particularly keen to talk to anyone filming outside during the disturbance.
"We are also patrolling and engaging with people in the High Street to provide reassurance and seek any additional information."
Mr Rolfe, who runs a fan site about the ITVBe show and who called the emergency services to the scene, said there were "maybe 100 people standing around".
He added: "I don't know what started the fighting, but it escalated to 50 or 60 people at one time."
Brentwood High Street was sealed off in the aftermath of the brawl, but was reopened by police on Sunday morning.
