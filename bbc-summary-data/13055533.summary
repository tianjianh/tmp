[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prince Philip's 90th birthday service announced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke of Edinburgh's 90th birthday will be celebrated by a service attended by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service will take place at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 12 June, two days after his birthday.
Prince Philip, who is the longest-serving royal consort in British history, was born on 10 June 1921.
A special page has also been set up on the British Monarchy website.
On 12 June, the service will be followed by a reception for the guests in the state rooms at Windsor Castle.
On the duke's birthday itself, it will be business as usual for the royal, with two engagements planned.
In the afternoon, in his role as patron of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, he will hold a reception to mark its centenary.
In the evening, in his capacity as Senior Colonel, Household Division, he will chair the Senior Colonels' Conference and hold a dinner.
Last November, Buckingham Palace announced the duke would step down as president or patron of more than a dozen organisations when he turns 90 to reduce his commitments because of his age.
They include his chancellorships of the University of Edinburgh, held since 1952, and the University of Cambridge, held since 1976. He will also relinquish his patronage of UK Athletics, held since 1952.
He will remain involved with more than 800 organisations.
The special page dedicated to Prince Philip's birthday lists other charities and organisations - including the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme which he launched in 1956 - which the duke is involved with.
It also includes a collection of photographs chronicling his life as the Queen's consort.
One black-and-white image shows the duke and the monarch as parents with their first two children, the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal.
As a young Anne sits on a swing and her older brother Charles stands above her, the duke pushes both of them as the Queen looks on during a holiday at Balmoral in September 1955.
Others pictures include Prince Philip in a group photograph, dated 1944-46, with fellow officers on the warship HMS Whelp, and as a young man at his school Gordonstoun.
There are also 90 facts about Prince Philip - as well as an opportunity for members of the public to send their birthday greetings to the duke.
