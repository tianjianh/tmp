Chinese and air lanterns banned by Ceredigion council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Releasing Chinese and air lanterns on council land and beaches in Ceredigion has been banned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion council unanimously voted to impose the ban following concerns over the impact on land, wildlife and farm life.
The move was proposed by councillor Mark Strong and seconded by councillor Catrin Miles.
In October 2013, the Welsh government called on councils to make a stand, stopping short of an outright ban.
