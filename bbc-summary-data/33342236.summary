EU funding of 24m euros (£17m) has been secured for two railway upgrades in Northern Ireland, including the Londonderry-Coleraine line.

The Derry-Coleraine line will receive 14,373,993 euros (£10.2m), while the Knockmore to Lurgan line has received 9,684,520 euros (£6.9m).
In April, work on a major update to the Derry-Coleraine line was delayed for four months.
Transport Minister Danny Kennedy said the funding was "great news".
He said it was a success to obtain the money, as competition for the funding across Europe had been unprecedented.
