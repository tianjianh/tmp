Mickey Brady said police officers told him on Monday that a threat had been made against him.
A second threat was later made in a phone call on Tuesday morning. Then, there was a bomb alert at his home but nothing was found.
Mr Brady, who is a candidate for Newry and Armagh in the general election, said he would not be intimidated.
He described the bomb alert at his home as a "terrifying experience for my neighbours".
"Those responsible for this latest threat obviously did not get the message that I will not be deterred from working for the community and carrying out my duties as a Sinn Féin representative," he said.
"I have been heartened by the support I have received from across the constituency and will continue to campaign to retain the Newry and Armagh seat for Sinn Féin and represent everyone equally."
Later, Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson tweeted:  "4 bomb warning calls claiming a devise at my home. My family will not be intimated - all caring 4 our 90 year old mother with Alzheimers."
Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney also said a series of threats and bomb warnings had been made against Sinn Féin offices in Londonderry and the homes of elected representatives.
He said: "It is an attempt by negative elements to disrupt what has been a positive election campaign, highlighting all that is positive in the city."
The police said checks had been carried out at two houses in Derry, but nothing untoward was found.
The developments come after the home of his Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, was attacked with paint in Londonderry.
Mr Brady is standing for election in Newry and Armagh. The other candidates are Danny Kennedy, UUP;  Justin McNulty, SDLP; Kate Nicholl, Alliance and Robert Rigby, Conservative.
