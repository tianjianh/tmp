Election 2015: Oxfordshire Conservative dominance continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prime minister David Cameron was re-elected as Witney MP as the Conservatives held on to power across Oxfordshire.

Cameron polled 60% of the vote as he held his seat and declared "a very strong night" for his party.
Labour's sole victory came in Oxford East as Andrew Smith increased his majority by 7.5% to more than 15,000.
In the marginal of Oxford West and Abingdon, Conservative Nicola Blackwood retained her seat comfortably.
There were also Conservative wins for John Howell in Henley and Ed Vaizey in Wantage.
Meanwhile, the UKIP vote almost trebled across Oxfordshire's six constituencies, whilst the Lib Dems polled about 50,000 fewer votes in the county, compared with their 2010 performance.
Mr Vaizey said he was "thrilled" to hold on to his seat.
"I'm very, very pleased with the Conservative result. It's absolutely tremendous.
"We have to repay that trust. The public has given us a mandate now and we have to make sure we use it effectively for the country."
Mr Howell said: "I'm feeling absolutely elated actually, quite emotional, but then I've just massively increased my majority."
The final result came in Banbury, where a new Tory MP was declared in Victoria Prentis following the retirement of Conservative Sir Tony Baldry.
"I'm thrilled that people have voted for us and are pleased with the long term economic plan and the way things are going," she said.
Speaking after the count in Witney, David Cameron said it was "clearly a very strong night for the Conservative Party".
He said: "I think we've had a positive response to a positive campaign about safeguarding our economy, about creating jobs, about a record in government over the last five years but above all a plan for the next five years.
"My aim remains simple - to govern on the basis of governing for everyone in our United Kingdom.
A re-elected Nicola Blackwood told BBC Radio Oxford her new majority of almost 10,000 was down to "the massive support" she received from campaigners in the constituency.
"They've been out in all weathers and really helped us win here," she said.
"I want to make sure we continue to deliver on everything in the constituency, but I also want to make sure we have a louder voice nationally."
Labour's only win in Oxfordshire came for Andrew Smith as he held on to Oxford East for his party.
Mr Smith paid tribute to his terminally ill wife Val for all her support during the campaign.
"The result is a vote of confidence not simply in me, but in the way Oxford Labour as a whole does politics," he said.
This is reflecting in miniature the national picture we're seeing of the Lib Dems' collapse.
In the last election they were second in most Oxfordshire seats. This time around that's completely fallen away and they polled almost 50,000 fewer votes.
If you look at Banbury, for example, their vote has fallen by 14.5%. That's a pretty huge drop.
There's also been a big drop in Oxford West and Abingdon, which has led to Nicola Blackwood increasing her majority by much more than even the Conservatives thought she was going to.
