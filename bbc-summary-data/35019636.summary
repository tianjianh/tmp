The plane blew a tyre on take-off from Clarksdale, Mississippi, on Saturday.
The SJ30 jet made a forced landing in Tunica, about 40 miles (65km) away, where it went off the runway.
In a statement, the Shawshank Redemption star said: "Sometimes things don't go as planned and a tyre blew on take-off, which caused other problems."
He continued: "But thanks to my excellent pilot Jimmy Hobson we landed safely without a scratch.
"I cannot say the same about my plane. I appreciate the concern and prayers for our safety."
The 78-year-old has been nominated for seven Oscars for films including Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart and Invictus, and won in 2005 for his role in Million Dollar Baby.
