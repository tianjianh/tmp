Andrew Brooks, 35, of New Mill, Penzance admitted wounding and was jailed for three years at Exeter Crown Court.
The toddler was left with a fractured skull and brain damage after Brooks had been looking after her.
He was caught 10 years after the incident when an ex-girlfriend contacted police.
Sentencing Brooks, Judge Erik Salomonsen said: "You have never given an explanation of your actions that led to this injury".
At the time of the incident a police inquiry concluded the little girl's fractured skull and brain damage were non-accidental.
However, the evidence it happened when she was in Brooks' care was circumstantial.
Over the next seven years Brooks made partial admissions to a series of girlfriends while trying to explain why social services were monitoring his contact with children.
One of those girlfriends called the police after Brooks told her he had injured the little girl by pushing her against a table.
He also told the women stories about his Army and SAS background, but the court heard he had in fact been kicked out of the Army after six weeks basic training.
Prosecuting, Martin Meeke QC said the toddler's mother left Brooks in charge of her daughter in September 2006 and returned to find the child unresponsive.
She was taken to a children's hospital in Bristol for emergency surgery for a bleeding on the brain.
In his defence Mr Lee Bembridge said Brooks admitted he needed treatment and was seeing a psychotherapist.
He said he became delusional as a result of being disowned by his father.
