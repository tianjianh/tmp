8 April
I have a younger sister Rebekah and an older brother Dean.
Once a week I play football over in the park with my mates. I love shopping, dancing and singing (really badly).
Blue.
My "Where the Wild things Are" T-shirt.
The Pipettes.
A day by the coast, eating candy floss, fish and chips and the dodgems!
Dogs - but only really small ones.
I'm scared of heights. I'm bad with flying and tall buildings.
My best friend Tulip makes me laugh.
I worked at a call centre for about eight months. I had to ring people up and talk them through questionnaires - lots of people hung up on me.
I was also a hair model for Toni & Guy, which meant I got a couple of free haircuts.
I love Thai food.
Sneezing when I was reading a live radio bulletin.
Barbados.
The 7/7 London bombings. I was on my way to work when the story broke, London came to a standstill and I had to file reports back to the news desk via my mobile.
Interviewing David Beckham when he launched his soccer school at the Millennium Dome in Greenwich in 2005.
I asked him whether he wanted Brooklyn to become a footballer like him and what music he liked to listen to.
Action-packed, adventure stories. I really liked the story about the British backpacker who survived 12 days in the Blue Mountains in Australia. Amazing.
It's important to get some work experience under your belt because that will give you a sense of what the job is really like.
Laughing, my niece and nephew smiling, chocolate and my Mini Cooper.
My mobile.
To run a marathon and to work for Newsround.
