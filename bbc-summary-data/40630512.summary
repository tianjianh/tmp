The 39-year-old played 102 NRL games for the Tigers between 2004 and 2008, helping them win the 2005 Premiership.
"It's a good fit for him as a bloke and it's the right thing to do," head coach Denis Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"He's done a fantastic job here and it's been an honour working with him."
Meanwhile, Betts confirmed hooker Aaron Heremaia could be out for the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury in their defeat by Wakefield.
"It's a real blow for us. He's hit his knee which is probably a 10 to 12-week injury which is not good for us as he's one of the leaders and strong members of our group," he said.
