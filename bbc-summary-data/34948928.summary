A PE teacher has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for sexually assaulting female pupils in his care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Maycock, 43, from Walsgrave in Warwickshire, was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl at a school in Coventry in 2013.
The girl told her parents Maycock touched her after a swimming lesson and said she would be in trouble if she told anyone.
He also admitted sexually assaulting a second girl at a school in Redditch.
The Redditch abuse came to light during the Coventry investigation, when a former pupil at a school in the Worcestershire town reported Maycock had abused her between 2005 and 2006 when he was a teacher there.
Det Con Sarah Rose from Warwickshire Police said: "Maycock used his position as a teacher to abuse the trust these two girls had in him.
"I cannot commend them enough for their bravery in reporting what happened to them. We also hope this case shows that we take such allegations extremely seriously and encourages other victims to come forward."
Maycock will also be placed on the sex offenders register.
