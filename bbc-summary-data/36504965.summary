Joe Baugh, who serves the green algae at the Savoy Hotel restaurant in Jersey, believes in its health benefits.
States officials in Jersey have previously raised concerns that the smell of sea lettuce at St Aubin's Bay puts off tourists, while the sandy shores of France and Rhode Island have also been plagued by the green stuff.
But in China, Japan and Korea people have been eating different types of seaweed for centuries.
"Sea lettuce is the new kale" and is "great for digestion, great for speeding up metabolism", Mr Baugh said.
He suggested a breakfast smoothie and makes it a regular part of his diet.
