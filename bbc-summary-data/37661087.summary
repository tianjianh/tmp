Police said he was approached by two men as he walked into Argyle Street station at about 22:35 on Thursday.
The attackers took his jacket from him and seriously assaulted him, leaving him with facial injuries.
PC Mark Harrington, of British Transport Police, said they believe the incident was completely unprovoked and appealed for help from witnesses.
"I would like to speak to anyone who was in the station at the time or thinks they may be able to help with the investigation," he said.
The attackers, who were both white and in their 20s, left in the direction of the Trongate.
One was wearing a white tracksuit and the other was wearing a black top and jeans.
