[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 80 officers from HM Revenue & Customs searched three homes and five businesses in Manchester, Merseyside Cheshire and London.
Cash, computers and documents were seized during Thursday's operation.
Those arrested are suspected of laundering money using offshore accounts and companies.
They have been released on bail.
Andrew Sackey, deputy director of HMRC's fraud investigation service, said: "We will act against those suspected of hiding money offshore.
"Businesses committing tax fraud steal from the public purse and have an unfair advantage over honest competitors."
