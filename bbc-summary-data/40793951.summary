Stradivarius won the Goodwood Cup as favourite Big Orange missed out on a record third successive victory.

Jockey Andrea Atzeni rode the John Gosden trained three-year-old to victory in the two-mile race, which has been upgraded to Group One status.
Big Orange, ridden by Frankie Dettori, was looking to become the first horse in Goodwood's 205-year history to win the Â£500,000 race three years in a row.
"Coming in I thought Big Orange was the one to beat," said Atzeni.
It was a third success on Tuesday for the 26-year-old Italian jockey as Stradivarius finished ahead of Big Orange in second and Desert Skyline in third.
"It's a great day," Atzeni, who also rode winners in the Lennox Stakes and the Qatar Vintage Stakes, told ITV.
Trainer Gosden added: "He's not the biggest of horses and it was a bit rough on the first bend. He didn't panic and it opened up for us. He's a lovely little horse."
Double Trigger has come the closest to claiming three Goodwood Cup wins on the bounce, having been successful three times in four years - 1995, 1997 and 1998.
Having already steered Eagle Eye to victory in the Vintage Stakes, Atzeni caused a shock in the Lennox Stakes as 50-1 shot Breton Rock came from last to first to win.
Limato hit the front a furlong out and looked like collecting victory, before fading inside the final 50 yards as David Simcock's seven-year-old swept down the outside.
"I didn't expect this at all. I dropped him out last to pick up the pieces, but he picked them all up," said Atzeni.
"I thought the ground would be too quick for him."

Under the conditions of the race, Big Orange, three years older than Stradivarius, had to concede the winner nearly a stone; that, plus the fact the going was softer than ideal made all the difference.
Having, like everyone else, heard all the hype and the talk of history-making, members of the Big Orange camp were understandably disappointed, but that soon turned to pride in what was another fine effort.
Stradivarius is now aiming to be his very much in-form trainer John Gosden's fifth win - but first since 2011 - in Doncaster's St Leger in September.
