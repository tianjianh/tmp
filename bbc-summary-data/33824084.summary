BBC Proms: Martin James Bartlett makes debut with Gershwin

Pianist Martin James Bartlett makes his Proms debut on Sunday after a whirlwind year that has seen him perform at some of the UK's highest-profile concert halls.

Since he won BBC Young Musician last year, the 19-year-old has become a student at the Royal College of Music, and has been getting a taste of life as a concert pianist.
"I've been exceedingly busy since," says Bartlett, reflecting on the BBC prize he won after wooing the judges with Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.
In the past year, he has completed engagements at St John's Smith Square, Cadogan Hall, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall - all opportunities, Bartlett believes, which came directly from the exposure generated by his Young Musician triumph.
"It's so great that BBC Young Musician is broadcast on BBC Four," says Bartlett. "So many people can tune in."
Despite his youth, Bartlett is a seasoned competition pianist, having won a string of prizes in his teens.
It became clear to him around the age of 13 that he wanted to pursue a career as a professional pianist - putting to bed ideas of an alternative career path as a marine biologist.
"I was very interested in physics and maths at different points," says Bartlett, "but music was always something I loved.
"It was only when I really believed in myself - believed that I could do it - that I realised I wanted to do it.
"It was when I had that self-confidence that I realised my biggest dream was to play concerts."
Winning prizes has helped Bartlett cement that self-belief, but competitions, he says, are "a tricky subject", and must be approached with an open mind.
"There are so many benefits from competitions," he explains. "Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages too."
"Competitions are so subjective. You have to have the attitude of doing them, not because of winning, but doing them for the music.
"I have won a few competitions, but there are many that I haven't won. You just can't get discouraged," he says. "You really have to just carry on going throughout, whatever happens."
Right now, Bartlett is making the final preparations for his first Proms appearance at the Royal Albert Hall, where he will perform Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
"Gershwin himself said the piece is a melting pot of all the crazy energy that's in New York - and it really is," says Bartlett.
"There are so many different styles, so many influences - it's just such an amazing work to perform. There's that element of spontaneity that sometimes you don't get with classical music."
Bartlett believes that "spark" comes from Gershwin being a jazz musician, as well as a classical performer. Rhapsody in Blue "was originally kind of improvised", he explains. "Even in the first concert, Gershwin still had things written in the score like 'when I nod the orchestra comes in'. He only wrote the piano part down after he had done the premiere, which is just totally unheard of now."
'Feeling comfortable'
As he builds his repertoire, Bartlett no longer has the luxury of focusing on one piece at a time. His performance schedule means he might start working on a piece eight-months in advance, even if he only spends half-an-hour a day on it.
The important thing, he says, is to "walk on stage and feel comfortable you know the piece inside out, top to bottom - that's when you give a good performance".
The pianist is conscious he is still developing as a musician, so spends a lot of time working on both his sound and technique. And being among other young musicians at the Royal College of Music is a big part of his development, allowing him to exchange ideas as he lays the groundwork for his career in music.
But Bartlett insists he doesn't have a big plan, he just wants to keep enjoying playing the piano.
"Just do the best that you can, work as hard as you can, but also have as much fun as you can," he says.
"Enjoy every moment, because you really never know where life is going to take you."
Martin James Bartlett performs Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday 9 August, 2015.
