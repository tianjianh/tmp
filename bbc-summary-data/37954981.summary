Man admits Westerham Costa coffee death crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving after his car crashed into a coffee shop, killing a woman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lord, 87, of Croydon Road in Westerham, Kent, lost control of his Audi on the High Street in Westerham at 10:30 GMT on 24 December 2015.
It mounted the footpath and smashed through a window of Costa Coffee, killing 74-year-old Valerie Deakin, from Udimore, East Sussex.
Lord previously denied the charge.
A further two men and two women were seriously hurt and taken to hospital after the crash. Another woman was treated for minor injuries.
The court heard medical evidence from a consultant neurologist which argued Lord suffered a complex partial seizure imminently before the collision.
Driver admits Costa death crash charge
Lord's defence barrister told the court that after regaining consciousness, he suffered confusion and pressed hard on the accelerator when he meant to apply the brakes.
The judge ordered the prosecution be allowed to medically examine Lord to investigate the claim.
Speaking outside the court, Mr Lord said he "blacked out" and had written a letter to apologise for the crash.
The case was adjourned.
