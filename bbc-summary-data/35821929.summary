A tweet by an online gambling company comparing footballer Jamie Vardy to a Holocaust victim has been condemned by the National Holocaust Centre.

Fruity King tweeted a picture of the Leicester City striker and described him as looking "like an extra from Schindler's List".
Phil Lyons, chief executive of the centre, said the post was "disrespectful" and "inappropriate".
The betting firm has yet to comment and the post can still be seen on Twitter.
Mr Lyons, from the Nottinghamshire-based museum, said: "The holocaust was the darkest moment in the history of mankind.
"[The tweet was] thoughtless and unearths a latent anti-Semitism when you strip it all away.
"It's disrespectful and too important a matter to relate to something as trivial as a Premier League footballer.
"It shows the job we have to do at the centre in terms of education."
Fruity King describes itself as a mobile casino delivered with a "side dish of mischief".
The tweet has prompted a number of angry responses since it was posted on Monday.
One tweeter, Ollie Philip, said: "You're just awful. I know you can't afford a social media manager but at least employ a decent human being to do your tweets."
Day Anthony tweeted: "Poking fun at the holocaust? That's your idea of marketing? Sick". And Oscar Foxley said: "I can't believe there hasn't been an apology for this yet. Just shameful."
Schindler's List (1993) was directed by Steven Spielberg and tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who helped save 1,200 Jewish lives during World War Two.
Jamie Vardy is the Premier League's top scorer with 19 goals that have helped propel Leicester City to the top of the Premier League.
The BBC has approached Fruity King for comment but has yet to receive a response.
