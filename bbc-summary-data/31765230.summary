Tower Bridge lift fall company told to pay £100k

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company operating a lift in Tower Bridge which fell and seriously injured four people in 2009 has been told to pay £100,000 due to its "catastrophic failure".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The injured suffered broken ankles and legs and one woman is still undergoing operations as a result of the accident.
Six others were treated for shock.
Temple Lifts, the operating company, admitted to two counts of breaching health and safety law on the north and south lifts.
Ten people were in the lift when it fell three metres into its service pit because a vital mechanism failed.
The lift, which usually carries around 40 people, fell as it was elevating from the ground floor and had tourists from Spain among the people in it.
Southwark Crown Court heard the company could have done more to stop the accident from happening and that the lift's design, maintenance and refurbishment were wanting.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) bought the case to court.
HSE Inspector Michael La Rose said it was a "truly disturbing" incident that could have resulted in greater injuries.
"There were warning signs here that were seemingly overlooked, and missed opportunities to properly rectify recurring faults," he said.
Mr La Rose said there were "clear failings" in how the company did its job.
The company was fined £50,000 and ordered to pay £50,000 in costs. It did not respond to requests to comment.
