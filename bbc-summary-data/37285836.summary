Sam Burgess: England return delayed by one-match ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Burgess has been hit with a ban that will delay his England comeback.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burgess, 27, was suspended for one game after pleading guilty to a tripping offence while playing for South Sydney in Australia's NRL last weekend.
He will serve the ban when England play France on 22 October but will be free for their opening Four Nations Series match with New Zealand a week later.
Burgess switched codes to play in last year's union World Cup but returned to league with South Sydney Rabbitohs.
He last played for England's rugby league side in the 2013 World Cup semi-final, when New Zealand scored a last-minute try to win at Wembley.
He has since played union for Bath and England.
The forward is certain to be included in Wayne Bennett's first squad, which will be announced after the Super League Grand Final on 8 October.
