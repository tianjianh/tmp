[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harley-Davidson is recalling nearly 46,000 motorcycles in the US due to clutch problems.

The recall covers certain Electra Glide, Ultra Limited, Police Electra Glide, Street Glide, Road Glide and Road King models from 2014 and 2015.
The bikes are being recalled because they could stay in gear due to clutches that won't fully disengage, AP reports.
A rider could lose control of a bike if it was started in gear. The problem was found through customer complaints.
Harley-Davidson Motor Company said in documents that gas bubbles can cause the clutch malfunction, especially if the bike had been parked for a long time.
Harley Davidson dealers will flush the clutch and rebuild the part of that is affected by the problem - the clutch master cylinder.
The recall started on Thursday.
