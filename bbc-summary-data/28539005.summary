Founded in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, the company is hugely popular for selling books and electronics online.
It has 22 million registered users and handles over 150,000 shipments a day.
Earlier this year, Flipkart acquired fashion portal Myntra and exceeded $1bn in annual sales.
India's e-commerce market was worth $13bn in 2013, with online travel accounting for more than 70% of transactions.
According to research firm Forrester, online sales of retail goods were worth $1.6bn last year, but with the growing reach of internet in the country and more people shopping online, it is expected to reach $76bn by 2021, according to consulting firm Technopak.
Correspondents say Flipkart is competing for a bigger slice of the Indian online retail market with the Delhi-based marketplace Snapdeal, fashion e-tailer Jabong, and global e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay.
In the last seven years, Flipkart had raised $760m and the recent funding is the largest for the company.
