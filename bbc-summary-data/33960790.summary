Dredging to be banned in Wester Ross MPA from midnight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All forms of dredging will be banned in an area of seabed off the west Highlands coast from midnight, the Scottish government has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said it was introducing an urgent marine conservation order to cover the Wester Ross Marine Protected Area.
It follows damage to coral-like seaweed called maerl by a scallop dredger.
Dredging in the MPA, which includes Loch Ewe and areas around the Summer Isles, was due to be prohibited from November.
Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said the scale of the damage had left him with no choice but to bring forward the timing of the ban.
Evidence of the damage was gathered by people in the local community, the government said.
Mr Lochhead said: "It's very disappointing that a scallop dredger has breached the voluntary fishery management measures in this MPA which is considered vital to the recovery of maerl beds.
"The seabed shows signs of damage consistent with a pass of scallop dredging gear.
"Maerl beds can take centuries to grow back and further risk of damage to these precious habitats cannot be allowed."
The order will not affect other fishing activity in the Wester Ross MPA, including hand diving for scallops.
Pink-purple maerl beds offer protection to young cod, scallops and crabs.
