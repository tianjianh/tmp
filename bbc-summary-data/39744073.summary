A thrilling climax to the Premiership title race is in store with leaders Linfield and Crusaders vying for glory on the final day.

The Blues visit Cliftonville with a two-point lead over the champions, who take on Glenavon at Seaview.
Linfield are chasing a first league crown since 2012 while the Crues are going for a third straight title.
"We're not counting our chickens yet but we're relishing the challenge," said Linfield manager David Healy.
All the other major Premiership issues have been settled so all eyes will be on Seaview and Solitude.
Healy's team were nine points behind the Crues in February but they whittled down the gap before moving top with a 5-1 win at Coleraine last weekend.
Linfield have won their last eight league games and their plus 19 goal difference over Crusaders means a draw should also ensure Gibson Cup success.
However, Cliftonville are boosted by the midweek return of Tommy Breslin as temporary boss and this will be his first game in charge.
"When a new manager comes in you always expect a response - it's going to be a tough game but I can't wait for it," added Healy.
"We're on a great winning run and we're not going to Solitude to sit behind the ball and go for the draw.
"We've showed some character this season. A lot of people had written us off.
"A lot of people said we weren't good enough and that we didn't have the right attitude.
"But we've went toe-to-toe with Crusaders for the last five or six months and now we're top with one game remaining."
Last Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Ballymena was a devastating blow for Crusaders as they aim for three-in-row Premiership triumphs.
They must hope north Belfast derby Cliftonville beat the Blues while ensuring three points are secured against the Lurgan Blues.
"We'll fight to the to the death - we'll give everything we have against Glenavon and see what happens," said Crues boss Stephen Baxter.

"Linfield have been reyling on teams to help them so now we're relying on a team to do us a favour.
"I'm sure Cliftonville will be up for the fight and will not want Linfield to win the title at their place.
"There's twists and turns in football and nothing will be settled until the whistle blows after 90 minutes on Saturday."
