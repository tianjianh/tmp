S4C expected to make 'reasonable' savings similar to BBC

Welsh TV channel S4C faces budget cuts similar to those faced by the BBC, the UK culture secretary has told MPs.

John Whittingdale told Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards it was "reasonable" S4C should make "the same kind of efficiency savings" asked of the BBC.
The warning came as the minister announced the BBC would foot the bill for free TV licences for people over the age of 75 from 2018.
Shadow Culture Secretary Chris Bryant denounced it as a "shabby little deal".
S4C receives the bulk of its money - Â£75m - from the BBC licence fee, with Â£7m from the UK government plus some commercial income.
Mr Bryant had warned in May that the Welsh channel could be "shrunk" as a result of pressure on the licence fee.
But in June, junior UK culture minister Ed Vaizey dismissed criticism of S4C's financial arrangements, saying the channel was "extremely generously funded".
