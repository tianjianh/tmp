[SN]TITLE[SN]
British Museum chief Neil MacGregor to step down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil MacGregor has announced he is to step down as director of the British Museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
MacGregor told colleagues he had made the "very difficult decision" to leave in December this year, stating he wanted to stop working full-time.
Since joining in 2002,  MacGregor has been credited with reforming its one-time "stuffy" image to make it one of the world's most visited attractions.
He said the role had been the "greatest privilege of my professional life".
Major success stories under his watch have included its History of the World project, which attempted to tell the world's history in 100 objects. The project included a 100-part series on BBC Radio 4.
The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army exhibition in 2007 and Turner Prize-winner Grayson Perry's Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman in 2011 also drew in the crowds.
And overall, visitor numbers to the museum in central London have also risen from 4.6 million a year to 6.7 million since 2002.
Perhaps Neil MacGregor's greatest achievement as the boss of the British Museum has been transforming it from a slightly old-fashioned institution with a chilly welcome, into one of the world's most popular visitor attractions without feeling the need to dumb down.
In fact, his success stems from having the confidence to assume the public are not stupid, but are open-minded and intellectually curious.
As a leader he has been dynamic, innovative and popular, although I understand he was never particularly keen on the details. The task facing the trustees is to find a successor who can firstly consolidate MacGregor's achievements and build upon them.
It won't be easy.
Having made the decision to leave, the end of 2015 seemed "a good time to go", said MacGregor.
"The new building has been completed, so we at last have proper exhibition space, new conservation and scientific facilities, and first class accommodation for our growing research activities," he said.
"We have built strong partnerships with fellow museums across the UK, and are rapidly expanding our programme of loans and training around the world.
"The museum is now ready to embark on a new phase - deploying the collection to present different histories of the world.
"It is an exhilarating prospect, and it will start with the new Islamic Galleries and with plans for the future of the Old Reading Room."
MacGregor joined the British Museum from another major cultural institution, London's National Gallery.
When there, he oversaw the completion of the Sainsbury Wing and the refurbishment of the whole main display.
Although he will no longer be working full-time, MacGregor said he would be involved in a number of projects.
They include working with the BBC and the British Museum on a new Radio 4 series on faith and society.
He'll also be giving advice and guidance to the German Minister of Culture, Monika Grutters.
And in Mumbai, India, he'll be offering his expertise to the CSMVS Museum.
