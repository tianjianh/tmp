Suffolk's new police and crime commissioner has defended the costs of his office to MPs.

Tim Passmore appeared before the Home Affairs select committee and was questioned about his £1.7m budget.
Keith Vaz MP, committee chairman, suggested there had been almost a doubling of costs since the change from the old Suffolk Police Authority.
Mr Passmore said that was incorrect and the costs had actually gone down by £100,000 since his election last year.
Mr Vaz said to Mr Passmore: "You employ nine people, but your total office cost is £1.7m and that's a 48% increase on the previous police committee."
Mr Passmore replied: "The cost of the office is actually over £100,000 less than the previous police authority.
"I can assure you nobody is being paid any extra and there have been no other appointments at all on top of what I inherited from the police authority, which is something we're looking at at the moment."
Mr Passmore's office said there was a 48% increase in his total budget, but it was due to the inclusion of the £600,000 Community Safety Fund, which came from the government.
This fund was not included in the old police authority budget.
