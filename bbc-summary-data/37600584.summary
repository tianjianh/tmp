Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared on 24 July 1991.
The items of are "low importance", Det Insp Jon Cousins, of South Yorkshire Police said.
They are investigating claims Ben may have been accidentally run over by a digger driver 25 years ago.
Police have extended their stay to search a second site, 750m from where Ben was last seen and close to the farmhouse where the dig started last month.
Det Insp Jon Cousins said: "There are over 60 items that need looking at and I'll engage with the magistrates here in Kos, to explain the significance of them.
"They are items I want to compare to other things, either information or items that were recovered throughout the past 18 months or in 2012."
Detectives are now focusing their efforts on the second site, where compacted material deposited over the last 30 years is being broken up before the soil is dug to a depth of about two feet.
Mr Cousins said on Saturday the team would remain on site for "at least two or three days".
Ben vanished from a farmhouse, which his grandfather was renovating, in the village of Iraklis.
Officers are working on the theory that Konstantinos Barkas, who died of cancer in 2015, might be responsible for Ben's death.
