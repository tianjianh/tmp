Mr Murdoch, whose News UK company publishes The Times and The Sun newspapers, and Miss Hall married in a civil ceremony at Spencer House.
It is Mr Murdoch's fourth marriage and the first for Miss Hall, 59, after her 1992 Bali wedding to Sir Mick Jagger was later deemed legally void.
Australian-born Mr Murdoch, 84, who now has US nationality, tweeted he was "the luckiest and happiest man in world".
The pair will hold a private ceremony of celebration on Saturday at London's St Bride's Church, in Fleet Street, which proclaims itself as the "spiritual home of the media".
They announced their engagement in the births, marriages and deaths section of The Times in January.
Speaking at the time, a spokesman said they were "thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future".
Mr Murdoch, whose family control 120 newspapers in five countries, split up with his third wife Wendi Deng in 2013.
His relationship with Miss Hall reportedly began last summer and they are rumoured to have got engaged while in Los Angeles earlier this year.
They were first spotted together in public in October at the Rugby World Cup final in London between Australia and New Zealand.
The couple are reported to have been introduced to each other in Australia by one of Mr Murdoch's sisters and his niece.
