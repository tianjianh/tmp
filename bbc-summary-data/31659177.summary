The Scottish Salmon Company has reported a leap in sales last year, as it expanded exports into 23 countries.

The company, which has about 20% of Scottish output of farmed salmon, produced 30,200 tonnes during 2014.
That was a 40% rise on 2013. The company said the growth of fish was helped by sustained warm water temperatures during the year.
More than two-fifths of output is exported, with six countries being added to its overseas markets in 2015.
The company, which has its headquarters in Edinburgh, has about 60 fish farms and hatcheries, with more than 400 employees.
The parent company in Oslo reported to the Norwegian stock exchange that the Scottish Salmon Company made pre-tax earnings of £13.7m, up from £3.5m in 2013.
That was on full-year revenue of £126m, up from £82.4m.
Managing director Craig Anderson said: "Salmon is Scotland's largest food export, to which we are a significant contributor.
"Scotland is quite rightly using 2015 to showcase its produce with the Year of Food and Drink. We're proud to be part of this and will showcase our salmon to the eyes of the world."
Output for 2013 is forecast to remain at about 30,000 tonnes.
