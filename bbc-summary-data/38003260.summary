Jockey Paddy Brennan has clocked up his 1,000th jumps win in Britain and Ireland - on Colin's Sister at Warwick.

Brennan reached the landmark on the 13-8 favourite, trained by Fergal O'Brien, in the mares' novices hurdle.
The 35-year-old Irishman, who won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on Imperial Commander, said: "My ambition ever since I came to England was to ride 1,000 winners and win a Gold Cup.
"I count myself very lucky. It's a landmark I'm very proud of."
As well as Imperial Commander, Brennan has ridden top-class horses including Cue Card, Inglis Drever and Tidal Bay.
He is one of an elite group to pass the 1,000 winners mark, although he is a long way short of the all-time record of 4,358 held by Sir Anthony McCoy.
