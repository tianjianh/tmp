Election 2015: Labour pledges to protect tax credits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour would raise tax credits at least in line with inflation every year until 2020 to "protect family budgets", Ed Miliband will say later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In contrast, the Labour leader will claim tax credits could be cut by £3.8bn under a Conservative government.
Mr Miliband will suggest that families with two children could be left more than £2,000 worse off under the Tories.
The Tories dismissed the figures, saying they were based on false assumptions about their spending plans.
Households on average will be around £900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010, the Conservatives said.
This election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
With just over a week until polling day on 7 May, both parties are focusing on the economy  - with David Cameron due to say he would pass a law to stop a future government raising income tax, VAT or national insurance before 2020.
Mr Miliband will set out a new commitment for a Labour government to raise tax credits at least in line with inflation every year, attacking Conservative policy in the process.
"Another five years of Tory government will mean a plan to double the pace of cuts next year, a plan that puts your family budget, your NHS and our country's future at risk," he will say.
The Conservatives have said they want to find a further £12bn in savings to the welfare bill, which they argue is achievable given that £21bn has been saved in the past five years.
But Labour says the Tories have given no details of what would be cut and that it would be "impossible" to reach the £12bn figure without reducing tax credits.
Mr Miliband will say: "I ask you this: do you believe what you've heard from the Tories in the last five weeks, or what you've seen and what your family has felt in the last five years? It's when you remember their record you realise the reality of their plan."
The opposition has published analysis by the House of Commons library suggesting proposed cuts would affect millions of families currently receiving tax credits.
The research, it says, suggests families earning £12,000 or more will lose at least £550 a year. It suggests families with one child will lose tax credits when their incomes hit £23,000 a year, leaving them over £1,600 a year worse off while families with two children will lose tax credits when their incomes hit £29,000, leaving them over £2,000 worse off.
But the Conservatives said the figures did not take account of its plan to raise a further £5bn from anti-tax avoidance measures as part of its deficit-reduction plan, as well its commitment to shield the most vulnerable, including pensioners and those with disabilities, from the welfare cuts.
"There's one guaranteed risk to working people's finances - Ed Miliband, propped up by the SNP, crashing the economy and putting up taxes, just like he did last time," a Tory spokesman said.
"We will cut 30 million working people's income tax, take everyone working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage out of income tax altogether and support working parents by offering 30 hours of free childcare for three and four-year-olds.
"But if you work hard, Ed Miliband and the SNP will be coming after your money through higher taxes. There's only one way to stop this happening - voting Conservative on 7 May."
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said neither the Conservatives nor Labour have provided "anything like full details" on plans to cut the deficit and have also questioned the commitments of other parties.
