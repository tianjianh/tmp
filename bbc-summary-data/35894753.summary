[SN]TITLE[SN]
MoD to sell 10 sites releasing land for up to 7,000 homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A total of 10 Ministry of Defence sites are to be sold off to raise £140m and release land for up to 7,000 homes, the government says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defence minister Mark Lancaster acknowledged this would have an impact on civilian and military staff.
Mr Lancaster promised to work with them to "determine the future provision" for the sites' occupants.
The sites will contribute to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes to be built by 2020.
In a written ministerial statement, Mr Lancaster said: "The release of these sites supports the generation of £1 billion through land sales and, in part, supports the contribution of up to 55,000 homes to support wider Government targets within this Parliament.
"The intent to dispose of these 10 sites is estimated to provide some £140 million in land sales receipts and land to provide up to 7,000 homes (of which 6,000 are expected in this Parliament), in addition to the land for up to 15,000 homes announced on 18 January 2016."
