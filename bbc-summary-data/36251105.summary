Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs says he will not be distracted by speculation regarding his future at Easter Road.

Stubbs has been linked with a move to former club Bolton, who have been relegated to League One in England.
Hibs host Falkirk at Easter Road on Tuesday in the first leg of their Premiership semi-final play-off.
"There is only one thing on my mind right now and that is trying to achieve a great end to the season for the football club," Stubbs said.
"And nothing will deter me or make me lose concentration. It is as simple as that. I've got a job to do and I want to be successful."
Hibs finished third in the Scottish Championship but could still win promotion via the play-offs.
They have already beaten Raith Rovers over two legs and face another double-header against Falkirk on Tuesday and Friday this week for the right to face Kilmarnock in the play-off final, again over two legs.
The Edinburgh side will face Rangers in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park on Saturday 21 May.
"We have got an opportunity to bring success in the next 16 days," added Stubbs, whose side were beaten by Rangers in the play-off semi-finals last year.
Asked if he would expect to still be Hibs boss if they stay in the Championship or gain promotion, Stubbs - who enjoyed six seasons as a player at Bolton - replied: "I've got another year left on my contract, so nothing has changed.
"People were  saying I was under pressure two weeks ago, and now I am getting linked with another job. That is the game. That's part of being a manager.
"If you're doing well, you get linked with jobs. If you are not doing well, you don't get linked with jobs.
"Some people might beg to differ, but it's speculation. That's all."
Bolton have been under the interim management of Jimmy Phillips, assisted by former Sunderland boss Peter Reid, since the departure of Neil Lennon.
