[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby enjoyed a successful return to the English Football League as they defeated Morecambe at Blundell Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheered on by more than 6,000 fans, the Mariners went ahead through Kayden Jackson early on.
Ben Davies made it two with a stunning free-kick midway through the second half.
Grimsby's Josh Gowling was dismissed for a professional foul, but it mattered little in the end as the hosts held on.
It was a frantic start from both sides, but Jackson helped settle home nerves with a calm finish on seven minutes.
And just seconds later, the Mariners could have doubled their lead.
Tom Bolarinwa and Scott Vernon combined as the latter prodded over Morecambe keeper Barry Roche - only to see Alex Whitmore produce a stunning clearance.
James Berrett also fired over as Town marked their return to the fourth tier with a dominant performance against the Shrimps.
After the break, Berrett went close before Davies settled matters with a curling set piece from 25 yards.
