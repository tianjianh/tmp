[SN]TITLE[SN]
Atlético Madrid 1-0 Deportivo La Coruña

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antoine Griezmann scored his fifth goal of the season as Atletico Madrid moved up to third place in La Liga by beating 10-man Deportivo La Coruna.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deportivo had midfielder Faycal Fajr sent off for a second bookable offence in first-half injury time.
The visitors then looked to frustrate Atletico in pursuit of a third successive 0-0 draw away from home.
But the hosts' pressure paid off when Kevin Gameiro crossed for Griezmann to sidefoot the winner.
Atletico, who play at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night, lost Jose Gimenez and Augusto Fernandez to injury in the first half.
But Diego Simeone's side remain unbeaten this season and, after winning three of their last four league games, are two points behind leaders Real Madrid.
It was a good day for the Simeone family, as son Giovanni scored on his first Serie A start for Genoa as they drew 1-1 with Pescara.
Match ends, Atlético de Madrid 1, Deportivo de La Coruña 0.
