Tom Daley's success in the men's synchronised 10m platform can propel him to an individual Olympic medal, says his former training partner.

London 2012 bronze-medallist Daley and Dan Goodfellow won bronze on Monday at Rio 2016 with the event's last dive.
"It's perfectly set up for Tom's individual," Brooke Graddon said.
"The pressure that would have built up if he hadn't have got that medal this time would have been even bigger for the individual," she told BBC Sport.
Graddon, who won a bronze medal at the European Championships in 2009, trained alongside Daley as he was starting his career in Plymouth and is still close to the star.
Daley, 22, is competing at his third Olympic Games, having made his debut as a 14-year-old in Beijing in 2008, and Graddon said his experience would help him deal with the scrutiny he will be under.
"It's a huge amount of pressure, but this is his third Olympics so he's dealing with that pressure," she added.
"He's older, he's wiser, he knows what he's doing, he's more confident in his skin now and I feel that really shows when he's stood on the end of the diving board."
