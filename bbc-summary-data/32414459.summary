County Championship: Sussex win as Ajmal Shahzad takes five

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire suffered another second-innings batting collapse as they fell to a 61-run defeat against Sussex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 47-0 and needing another 200 for victory, the visitors were all out for 185 as Ajmal Shahzad took 5-46.
The winning margin would have been even wider had it not been for a last-wicket stand of 51 between wicketkeeper Ben Cox (48 not out) and Charlie Morris.
Steve Rhodes' side made 100 in their second innings against Yorkshire in the opening Championship game loss.
Worcestershire's batting troubles this time around were triggered by Australian seamer Steve Magoffin when he removed captain Daryl Mitchell lbw for 21.
Seven balls later, former Nottinghamshire fast bowler Shahzad sent Richard Oliver's stumps flying and then dismissed Alex Gidman and Tom Kohler-Cadmore in the space of three deliveries.
The wickets continued to tumble as Alexei Kervezee and Tom Fell were both trapped lbw and Gareth Andrew was bowled by Shahzad as the visitors reached lunch on 127-7.
After the interval, Jack Shantry became the fifth leg-before victim of the innings to Magoffin and Shahzad soon had his fifth wicket when Sachithra Senanayake edged behind.
The visitors had lost nine wickets for just 77 runs and although Cox and Morris delayed the inevitable, spinner Luke Wells eventually wrapped up the win when he enticed Morris to edge to slip.
Sussex captain Ed Joyce:
"It was a fantastic performance. At the start of the day they were slight favourites but we got Daryl Mitchell, who is a massive wicket, early and then we stuck at it.
"Shahzad bowled fantastically. He got it to swing conventionally and then reverse and was aggressive on a pitch that didn't do much, although it was a bit up and down in bounce.
"It's good to get two wins on the board even though there are still areas we can be better in.
"We were a bit careless with our first-innings batting, we should have got more runs and made the last day a bit easier and I'm frustrated with the number of catches we dropped."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes:
"It was a fantastic effort by the team but sadly we failed to carry it through today.
"An hour's cricket probably cost us the game. We lost a cluster of wickets but we can't afford to keep doing that and have to address it.
"We're an inexperienced side and have to learn from these situations and improve."
