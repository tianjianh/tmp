[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bio-scientist Samantha Ho, 39, was found dead in Curlew Place, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on 29 August.
Her husband, Timothy Allen, 40, of Curlew Place, admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Southwark Crown Court.
The court heard that watching an episode of X Factor could have triggered his actions.

Medical reports presented in court showed Allen had suffered a series of psychiatric problems, including paranoid schizophrenia, following a motorbike accident in 2004.
On the night of her death, the couple had been watching an episode of ITV's X Factor, during which Allen suffered a "delusion" and attempted to take his own life, the court heard.
He then turned the knife on his wife and their pet dog, who also died.
Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said despite Ms Ho begging him not to kill her, "he carried on and had meant to do so".
Allen told police he believed dancers on the television show were "puppets being controlled by a puppet master".
He believed this figure was trying to get to him and his wife and so decided he had to take her life and his own, Mr Jackson told the court.
The X Factor episode "appears to have been the trigger for what happened", he said.
Ms Ho, a former Nottingham Trent University student had worked at bio-science firm Asterand, in Royston, Hertfordshire, for more than 10 years. Before that she was employed at Pharmagene, which is part of Asterand, and Cambridge firm Cytocell.
"She wanted to be a great scientist, have time to travel the world, realise her dreams and spend more time with family," Ms Ho's family said.
The day she was "tragically taken... part of us died", they added.
At his sentencing Allen appeared via videolink from Cambridge Crown Court and held his head in his hands for much of the hearing.
Three members of Ms Ho's family were in court to hear the sentence. Her brother and sister appeared distressed as the details of the attack were read out.
Sentencing Allen, the Hon Mrs Justice McGowan said: "This was a terrible case... it is a tragic loss.
"What happened that night was clearly a product of a severe and chronic mental illness."
It was "one of the saddest cases this court has had to deal with", she added.
Allen was detained indefinitely under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, meaning he will be kept in a secure hospital facility rather than a prison.
