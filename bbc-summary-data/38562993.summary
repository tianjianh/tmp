Brenda Wilding, 86, from Littleport, Cambridgeshire, called emergency services after experiencing stomach pains caused by cancer medication.
Paramedics stopped the ambulance for a stray dog on the A10. They then took the dog with them.
Mrs Wilding said it was "a nightmare". The ambulance service has apologised.
"I was just left when they went out, I was left in the ambulance alone," said Mrs Wilding, who is in remission for bladder cancer.
"The whole experience was very bad."
Paramedics were taking Mrs Wilding to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mrs Wilding said she was "vomiting violently" while the ambulance staff dealt with the dog.
Her daughter Linda said she "deserves better".
In a letter, the East of England Ambulance Service claimed Mrs Wilding was happy to have the dog "come in to the warmth" because of animal ornaments seen at her home.
The trust apologised for the incident and said staff understand their actions were "against trust guidelines".
A spokesman added: "They now understand there is no legal responsibility to stop for a domestic dog."
