That match will take place on Monday, while Thursday's second semi-final will see the host nation take on the winner of Monday's match between Pakistan and West Indies.
"I genuinely believe we had an off-day," said England captain Brad Taylor, whose team had won all three of their group games.
"You have days when it does not come off. I think Sri Lanka played very well, but on another day, we would back ourselves.
"We expected Sri Lanka to rely on spin, but the batsmen did not stay long enough to build partnerships. We had come here to win the tournament, so obviously we are very disappointed."
Durham's Jack Burnham and Essex's Dan Lawrence had been in superb form with the bat during the tournament but managed only 20 runs between them.
Leg spinner Wanidu Hasanranga claimed three wickets while seamer Asitha Fernando claimed two early in the England innings.
