The Turkish champions will pay future instalments based on their qualification for the Champions League.
Podolski, 30, moved to Arsenal from German side FC Koln in 2012 for a reported £11m and scored 31 goals in 82 appearances for the Gunners.
He helped Arsenal win the FA Cup in 2014 but spent the second half of last season on loan at Inter Milan.
His chances became limited as Gunners' manager Arsene Wenger added the likes of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck to his forward options.
Wenger also has Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at his disposal.
Galatasary president Dursun Aydin Ozbek said Podolski, a World Cup winner with Germany in 2014, had been a long-term target.
He added: "Podolski was a player we have been following for a long time. We have met the expectations of our fans. We think he will serve us for many years."
