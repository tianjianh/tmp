[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gang leader Alexander Donnelly ordered to hand over cash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leader of a Glasgow drugs gang has been ordered to hand over £52,000 in earnings from crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Donnelly, 60, is serving a 10 year prison sentence after directing others in a £200,000 heroin supply operation.
At a brief confiscation hearing, the High Court in Edinburgh heard that a settlement had been reached.
It was told that Donnelly made £82,000 from his criminal conduct and it made a confiscation order of £52,785.
The figure included £22,970 recovered during a police operation.
Donnelly was previously made the subject of a confiscation order in 1997 which, at the time, was the largest ever made in Scotland.
He was then ordered to hand over £270,000.
The order was made a year after he was jailed for 54 months for heroin dealing.
In 2006 was imprisoned for 10 years for his role in a cocaine gang.
And Donnelly returned to crime in 2011, shortly after being freed from prison.
He later admitted directing serious organised crime during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow in 2014.
He was made the subject of a reporting order requiring him to inform police of financial details.
