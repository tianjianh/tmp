The 25-year-old was manager Slaven Bilic's first signing when he joined from Sampdoria in 2015.
"Over the next five years, we can achieve many, many things," the former Spain Under-21 international said.
He is the second player to sign a long-term contract in a week, following defender Angelo Ogbonna, who also put pen to paper on a five-year deal.
