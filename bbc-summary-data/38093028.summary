Scotland v Georgia: Mark Bennett among five changes for hosts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Bennett makes his first appearance of this year's autumn internationals as Scotland complete their series against Georgia in Kilmarnock on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glasgow Warriors' Bennett, 23, comes in at inside centre for Huw Jones, who was injured in the 19-16 defeat of Argentina.
Ross Ford returns at hooker while Richie Gray is also back, partnering brother Jonny in the second row.
And, in the back row, Rob Harley and Ryan Wilson earn starts.
Their inclusion at blindside flanker and number 8 means John Barclay drops to the bench, while Magnus Bradbury misses out after making his debut against the Pumas.
Fraser Brown makes way for Ford while Grant Gilchrist joins Brown on the bench to accommodate the return of Richie Gray in the second row.
Jones was injured in the act of setting up Sean Maitland's try against Argentina, with captain Greig Laidlaw's added-time penalty securing victory.
That result followed a 23-22 loss to Australia, with the first two Tests of the series taking place at Murrayfield.
Kilmarnock FC's Rugby Park, which has an artificial 3G pitch, is the venue for Georgia's visit, with the east Ayrshire ground used for the 2014 win over Tonga.
"Our players are excited to be back in Kilmarnock and having them supporting us like they did two years ago will be great," said Scotland head coach Vern Cotter.
"The crowd's enthusiasm will be key to getting a good performance; the players feed off the energy from the stands. It's really does help spur on the guys.
"Georgia are striving to be among the world's best as they knock on the door of the top 10 in the world rankings.
"We are expecting a typical Georgian game. They will be physical up front as they play a forwards-based game, however they are also developing their backs."
Scotland: Hogg, Maitland, Bennett, Dunbar, Seymour, Russell, Laidlaw (capt); Dell, Ford, Fagerson, R Gray, J Gray, Harley, Watson, Wilson.
Replacements: Brown, Allan, Low, Gilchrist, Barclay, Price, Horne, Hughes.
