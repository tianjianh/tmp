[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacqueline Perry, of Morriston, allegedly took cash, medication and jewellery from semi-conscious patients at Swansea's Morriston Hospital.
The 49-year-old is accused of stealing ??1 coins from the glasses case of one elderly cancer sufferer and valuable gold heirloom rings from another.
She faced eight counts of theft at Swansea Magistrates' Court.
Perry was working at the hospital over the period in question, which covers the three months until January this year.
All the alleged victims were vulnerable and elderly patients on ward G at the hospital, who were recovering from surgery, prosecutor Linda Baker said.
Items Ms Perry allegedly stole include a 22 carat gold wedding ring belonging to 89-year-old Nancy Thomas.
The cancer sufferer also lost two other gold rings of "sentimental value," with all three collectively worth ??1,800, the court heard.
Ms Perry is also accused of stealing a gold ring from a patient recovering from surgery for stomach cancer.
She allegedly stole wallets containing small amounts of cash from chronically ill patients and medication including co-codamol and gabapentin, from the ward.
Magistrates sent the case to be heard before a judge next week at Swansea Crown Court.
Ms Perry was released on unconditional bail.
