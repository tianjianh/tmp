Kyle Hand, 28, died after he was attacked by Jovan Martin in Sunny Brow Road in the Gorton area of Manchester in March.
He stabbed Mr Hand in the neck, thigh and buttock, police said.
Martin, 26, of Whitburn Avenue, Manchester, was found guilty of murder at Preston Crown Court and given a minimum sentence of 27 years.
Mr Hand, who died in hospital from his injuries, will be "deeply missed", his family said.
Ch Insp Debbie Dooley, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "This is a tragic and unnecessary loss of life and my heart goes out to Kyle's family.
"Jovan Martin will now spend the next 27 years of his life behind bars and I hope his sentence goes some way to give Kyle's family the justice they deserve."
