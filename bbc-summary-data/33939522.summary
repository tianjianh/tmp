Bradford Kings Science Academy former department head denies fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former department head at a flagship free school in Bradford has denied fraud charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shabana Hussain, 38, pleaded not guilty to fraud by abuse of position and a charge of acquiring criminal property relating to Kings Science Academy.
She appeared at Leeds Crown Court with ex-principal Sajid Raza, 42, and ex finance chief Daud Khan, 43 who also face charges.
The charges relate to the period between April and August 2011.
All three are accused of abusing their positions as officers of the academy by making a series of unauthorised and unlawful payments into the personal bank accounts of Mr Raza and Ms Hussain from a grant provided to the school by the Department for Education.
School founder Mr Raza, of Spring Gardens Road, Bradford, faces three charges of fraud, three of false accounting, two of obtaining a money transfer by deception and one of fraud by false representation.
Mr Khan, of Thornhill Place, Thornbury, is charged with two offences of fraud by abuse of position and three offences of false accounting.
Neither he nor Mr Raza entered pleas at the hearing on Friday.
Ms Hussain, of Wilmer Road, Bradford, Mr Raza and Mr Khan are on bail.
They are due to appear at the same court on 2 October, with a trial date set for 20 June 2016.
The academy was one of the first free schools to open, in September 2011.   It has since become part of the Dixons academy group.
The school is where supply teacher Vincent Uzomah, 50, was stabbed by a 14-year-old boy in a racially-motivated attack on 11 June.
The teenager was handed an 11-year sentence on Monday.
