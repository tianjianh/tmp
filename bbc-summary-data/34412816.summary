The driver appeared to lose control of the bus in the central Dikimevi area of the city, ploughing into commuters before eventually coming to a halt further down the street.
Ankara governor Mehmet Kiliclar said Thursday's crash also caused several injuries.
Emergency workers had to pull the dead and injured from under the bus.
Turkish media said the driver's brakes had failed as he approached the bus stop at around 13:00 (10:00 GMT).
Eyewitnesses said that after the bus had struck the queue at the bus stop it continued for more than 70m (230ft), hitting people and parked cars.
