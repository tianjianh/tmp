Nerijus Gudelevicius would entice Lithuanians to the UK with the promise of paid work, delivering and collecting charity clothes bags.
The 34-year-old, of Westlea, Swindon, was found guilty at Swindon Crown Court of two charges of human trafficking.
He was cleared of a further four charges of slavery and released on conditional bail.
The court heard Gudelevicius would pay workers between Â£10 and Â£30 a week - but sometimes payments were made every fortnight or three weeks.
He would also charge them Â£40-a-week in rent, if they needed accommodation.
Gudelevicius, originally from Lithuania, is due to sentenced at Salisbury Crown Court on 19 June.
Following the judgement, acting Det Insp Rob Findlay said the verdict was a "positive result" following months of robust investigation work.
"The victims of human trafficking are often very vulnerable people who are used as simple commodities - often for the financial gain of the perpetrators," he said.
"Wiltshire Police will always treat human trafficking as a priority and vigorously investigate, along with our partners, such incidents.
"Community-based intelligence proves crucial in investigations such as this, and I would always urge anyone with information or concerns about potential victims of modern slavery to contact us."
