Five UN peacekeepers have been killed in a mortar attack on their base in Kidal in northern Mali.

Thirty others were injured in the raid, which involved rockets and a truck bomb.
A local militia that signed a peace deal with the government last year blamed Islamist militants for the attack, Reuters news agency reports.
The UN is trying to restore peace to the north, which was overrun in 2012 by jihadists and ethnic Tuareg groups.
The al-Qaeda-linked insurgents, who fell out with Tuareg separatists, were ousted from northern towns by a French led-force in 2013.
Last June, Tuareg-led rebels and other Arab groups seeking more autonomy for the north signed a ceasefire agreement with the government.
UN chief Ban Ki-moon says attacks on peacekeepers "constitute a war crime," and will not deter them from supporting the Malian government.
Three of those killed were from Guinea. The nationalities of the other dead and wounded have not been revealed.
The attack in Kidal comes 48 hours after the UN representative in the country, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, visited the area.
It is the latest in a series of attacks on the UN force, made up of 10,000 soldiers from dozens of different contributor countries - the majority from Mali's West African neighbours.
"This serious act reflects the disarray of the enemies of peace since it comes at a time when the implementation of the peace agreement increasingly becomes a reality in Mali," Mr Annadif said in a statement.
In a separate incident, three Malian soldiers were killed in an ambush on a military convoy near Timbuktu. It is not clear who is behind the attack.
