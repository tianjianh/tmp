Morris, 23, had two years remaining on his contract but has now signed an extended deal tying him to New Road until the end of 2018.
"We're very excited about Charlie and have been since we saw him up at Oxford University playing against us," said director of cricket Steve Rhodes.
"He has got the ability when things are not quite right to make contributions."
In a succession of concluded contract talks over the final two months of the 2015 season, Ross Whiteley has signed on for another four years, Brett D'Oliveira, Joe Leach, Joe Clarke, Tom Fell and Ed Barnard have all signed three-year deals, while Tom Kohler-Cadmore last week committed to New Road for the next two years.
"The club is going in the right direction," said Morris. "There are a lot of promising players coming through and, although it's disappointing we've been relegated, there are positives to take from the 2015 season.
"We know as a team we probably could have won a few more games from the positions we got ourselves in. But we have learnt a huge amount.
"You don't always have a smooth path to the top. The average age of the team is very young and the experience we gained this year from playing some of the sides we have come up against is invaluable."
