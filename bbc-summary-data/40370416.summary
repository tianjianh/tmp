Boss Neal Ardley told the club website: "He has only just turned 31 and he still has years ahead of him.
"He scored 12 goals last season for Gillingham in a team that struggled a bit and his goalscoring record previously has been very good."
The Dons have not disclosed the length of the former Norwich and Coventry player's contract.
