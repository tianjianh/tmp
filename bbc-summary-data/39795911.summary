The 28-year-old, who was born in Peterborough, scored 42 goals in 43 games for the Whites this season.
Miller is out of contract in the summer and will join the League One side on a three-year deal when it expires.
"He has been the top player in the National League, has scored over 40 goals and is a winner," Posh boss Grant McCann told the club's website.
McCann added: "He knows where the back of the net is and I am looking forward to working with him."
Miller completed a medical on Wednesday and will link up with his new team-mates for pre-season training at the end of June.
The former Spalding United, Stamford and Boston United player has previous Football League experience with Luton, prior to joining Dover.
Posh director of football Barry Fry said: "We tried to buy Ricky in January, but Jim [Parmenter], the chairman and owner of Dover, and Chris [Kinnear], the manager, never returned my calls.
"But I admire that greatly because Dover had great ambition to get promoted.
"Ricky has done brilliantly to score the amount of goals he has and hopefully he will come here and hit the ground running."
