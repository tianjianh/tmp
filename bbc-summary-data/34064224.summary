A 12-year-old girl killed herself after struggling with "feelings of worthlessness and loss" following her mother's death, an inquest has heard.

Isabel Richardson's father Stephen found his daughter, from Norwich, hanging on 12 May.
The inquest heard Isabel's self-harming had become a concern to her father and the Hewett School, where she was a pupil.
Coroner Jacqueline Lake said it was not clear Isabel intended to take her life.
Recording a narrative verdict, Ms Lake said: "Clearly Isabel was very upset by the death of her mother and had feelings of worthlessness and loss which she expressed on social media."
She said no-one could be blamed for her death and praised the care provided by Isabel's teachers.
But she added it was vital that pupils were properly cared for at the school.
"I am concerned at the robustness of the structure of pastoral care," she said. "I have not heard clear evidence and want to be assured that it is robust."
Mr Richardson said in a statement, read out at the inquest in Norwich, that he became aware that his daughter was self-harming about five weeks before her death.
He arranged for her to see a doctor, but Isabel asked him to cancel the appointment.
Mr Richardson had a meeting with pastoral staff at the school and Isabel and when teachers asked her why she self-harmed, she said she "missed her mum" who died in 2010.
On 12 May, Isabel's brother Kyle saw self-harm messages on social network Instagram and alerted his father who discovered his daughter and called an ambulance.
Isabel died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on 18 May.
Hewett School head teacher Tom Leverage said: "The welfare of students is always uppermost in our concerns and we will carefully consider the coroner's comments.
"We already take pastoral care very seriously but if there are things we can improve, we will."
