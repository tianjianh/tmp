The government is looking at calls to take in thousands of unaccompanied refugee children who have made it into Europe, a Cabinet minister says.

Charities have been calling on the UK to admit 3,000 child refugees as part of its response to the Syrian conflict.
International Development Secretary Justine Greening said ministers were considering "whether we can do more" for unaccompanied children.
Downing Street sources say no decision has been made yet.
Speaking on Sky News, Ms Greening said children "have always been at the heart of our response".
Asked about the calls for the government to consider admitting 3,000, she said:  "That's what we are doing and I think that is the right thing."
Her comment come after David Cameron told the Commons earlier in January that he was considering the issue " in good faith".
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron - who has been pushing the PM to take in unaccompanied children - told the BBC on Sunday "there may be some signs" from Mr Cameron's responses during a six-month long campaign that his view was "moving in that direction".
"His response when I first raised it with him was very negative. When I raised it with him privately, a little less negative," said Mr Farron, while the prime minister's response to the issue during the Syria debate in December had also been encouraging.
The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made similar calls on Saturday on a trip to see refugees in Calais.
In September, the government promised to resettle 20,000 refugees from Syria over five years.
