Tupsley man considers appeal over tree house decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was ordered to pull down a tree house he built for his daughter without applying for planning permission could launch an appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mat Waybourne, 42, from Tupsley, Herefordshire, spent two months and Â£800 building the two-storey wooden house for seven-year-old Lilly.
It features a balcony, ladders and windows that overlook other gardens.
Herefordshire Council has advised Mr Waybourne he can choose to appeal against the decision.
However, he said paperwork sent to him stated a fee of Â£344 must be paid to the authority if he does go ahead.
Mr Waybourne said: "My daughter always wanted a tree house. That's why I'd built one. I don't feel it's safe for the kids to play in the streets.
"[The council] is wasting money on silly things like this. Hopefully I'll be able to afford [the appeal]."
A council spokeswoman said: "The council has served an enforcement notice upon Mr Waybourne for a breach of planning regulations, relating to a four metre construction he has erected within two metres of his land boundary.
"He has a right to appeal against this."
