The Snowdrop was repainted in a unique "dazzle" design by Sir Peter Blake.
World War One ship designers used the dazzle effect to try to avoid detection by the enemy.
The bright and twisty designs made it harder for hostile forces to track the range and speed of allied ships.
Sir Peter Blake, 83, was the artist behind the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper album.
The Snowdrop was repainted at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead and was commissioned by arts festival Liverpool Biennial and Tate Liverpool.
Passengers will be able to learn about the history of "dazzle" and the role that Mersey ferries played in World War One by visiting an onboard exhibition.
Peter Blake was one of the major figures of British pop art and has strong links with Liverpool.
He first visited the city during his National Service with the RAF.
