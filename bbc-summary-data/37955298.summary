[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who committed such "vile" child sex abuse other paedophiles called him "a monster" has been jailed for 21 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Scott, 63, of Wickenfields, Ware, arranged for groups of men to visit a house to rape a young boy on many occasions.
Judge Stuart Bridge told him Luton Crown Court had heard an account that was "depraved and harrowing".
He said: "You were cold, callous and calculating."
Judge Bridge added: "Some of the men involved finally told you it had to stop and called you a monster. They were absolutely right."
The boy told investigators he had been given something to make him sleepy before the abuse took place.
Scott had pleaded not guilty to seven charges involving the rape of a child under 13. He was found guilty of six of them after a trial in October.
He pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images of children and breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
Marion Smullen, for the defence, said Scott had been on remand at HMP Bedford when riots broke out, and his wing had been targeted by rioters.
She told the court: "Obviously he is going to prison for a very lengthy time and it will not be a soft option for him."
During the trial the jury heard the offences spanned a number of years, possibly as many as three, ending in 2009.
They came to light when the boy made a complaint earlier this year.
After the case, Det Sgt Colin Nelson said Scott "showed no remorse for this horrific and vile sex abuse".
Scott had been jailed in 2011 to three years and nine months in prison for making, possessing and distributing images of child abuse.
