People living in a Shrewsbury care home were locked in rooms and treated without respect, inspectors have found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ottley House, which is run by Barchester Healthcare, was rated as "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission following an inspection.
The report said people were "unnecessarily deprived of their liberty, they were not always respected and staff were not supported."
Barchester Healthcare said it had made "numerous" improvements.
The unannounced two-day inspection was carried out in July.
The home cares for 72 people who are housed in two different units.
In one, Memory Lane, inspectors said staff had not followed the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act.
"This meant some people were potentially unlawfully having their movements restricted," the report said.
"We saw one example where a person was potentially being deprived of their liberty.
"When we arrived on Memory Lane unit we saw two people in a side room together but they could not get out. We asked why they were in there, staff told us, 'The lock on the door is broken'."
Inspectors said on another occasion they saw a person repeatedly kick the door of the unit to try to leave, but no staff intervened to help them.
The report said staff had not received adequate training, supervision and appraisals.
"We saw one person being supported to eat their meal by a member of staff... the food on the spoon was in such great quantity the person was barely able to get it into their mouth," it said.
"We saw one person sliding out of the chair where they were seated.
"The person's clothing had risen up and exposed their underwear.
"We saw three members of staff in the same room talking amongst themselves [who] did not help the person until we intervened."
The CQC said it would not take formal enforcement action "at this stage".
The company said it had taken "immediate action".
"Some of the improvements already in place include training for all staff, appointment of a new general and deputy manager and substantial investment," it said.
"We would like to reassure everyone of our commitment to provide the highest quality of care to those residing at Ottley House."
