Green Party councillor Gus Hoyt stood down on Monday after it was revealed he used a four-letter expletive in an exchange over a city farm project.
Mr Ferguson said it was a private exchange between two people who knew each other well.
Mr Hoyt will be replaced by Daniella Radice in the council's cabinet.
He had used the swearword in a private Twitter message to Steve Glover who was lobbying for more land to expand the Severn Project city farm scheme.
Mr Glover then posted the message publicly on his own Twitter account.
In his statement, Mr Ferguson, an independent, thanked Mr Hoyt for his dedication and hard work.
"I know the Severn Project has referenced my support for their good work, but I should be clear that it has been to a large extent as a result of Gus championing their cause," he said.
"I also know that Gus has been mercilessly taunted on Twitter over several issues in recent months.
"I think anyone would appreciate the frustration which led to his response and that this was a private exchange between two people who knew each other well."
