Patriots' Day will be based on the first-hand account of Ed Davis, whom Wahlberg may play in the drama.
The Boston Police commissioner played a key role in the hunt for the brothers held responsible for the attack.
"There is nothing more compelling than a real story populated by real heroes," said CBS Films president Terry Press.
He said the film will "give audiences a very personal look at what occurred during the days when the eyes of the world were on the city of Boston and how a group of contemporary patriots faced this crisis".
Three people, including an eight-year-old boy, were killed after two pressure cooker bombs packed with nails, ball bearings and other shrapnel detonated in April 2013.
A police officer was fatally shot days after the attack, in which more than 260 people were injured.
One of the bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died during a shootout with police. His younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later and is currently on trial.
According to CBS Films, Patriots' Day will be "an intense thriller, spanning the five-day search up to the infamous siege... in Watertown" near Boston.
20th Century Fox is working on a rival project, entitled Boston Strong, about the deadliest terror attack on US soil since 9/11.
Wahlberg appeared last year in Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Gambler and will be seen this year in the sequel to his 2012 comedy Ted.
