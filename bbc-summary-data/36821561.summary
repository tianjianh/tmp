Captain Batty made an unbeaten 110 and Foakes scored 141 not out in a partnership of 222 before the visitors declared on day two at the Ageas Bowl.
Hampshire spinner Mason Crane took heavy punishment as Surrey scored 305 runs in 67 overs - ending with 3-210.
Mark Footitt then claimed two Hampshire wickets but Tom Alsop and Ryan McLaren guided the hosts to 73-2 at stumps.
Surrey, who resumed on 332-4, lost Australia international Aaron Finch for 86 before lunch, along with Steve Davies (25) and Sam Curran (16).
But 38-year-old Batty and wicketkeeper Foakes dominated in the afternoon session, with Batty bringing up his maiden hundred for the county and Foakes reaching his first century of the season.
Alsop (29) and McLaren (31) will return on Tuesday with Surrey aiming to increase the pressure as they search for just their second Championship win of the season.
Surrey wicketkeeper Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London:
"It is a very good wicket so it was important we got a good first-innings score and we have done that.
"We are in a good position to boss the game but there is some hard graft ahead if we want to win it.
"It is good to make a couple of inroads. When you have 600-odd on the board it is quite daunting and we can use that to our advantage."
