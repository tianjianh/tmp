A £10,000 reward has been offered after two pensioners were threatened with knives during an aggravated burglary at their south-east London home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men wearing khaki uniforms and with African accents knocked on their door in Bushmoor Crescent, Shooters Hill, at about 17:30 BST on 1 July.
The men forced their way inside, injuring the male resident in his 70s.
The intruders both in their early 30s stole credit cards, debit cards and £700 in cash, Scotland Yard said.
The injured resident did not require hospital treatment.
The first man is described as black, about 6ft tall, of stocky build and with short dreadlocks while the other was black, about 6ft 2ins tall, of medium build and with short cropped black hair.
Det Con Andrew Payne said: "[We] believe that the suspects may have specifically targeted this address in Bushmoor Crescent.
"There are people in the community that will have information about the motive and know those involved."
