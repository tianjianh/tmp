Aisar Gul Khan, 21, of Devon Street, Farnworth, and Dale Michael Duncan, 21, of Bolton Road, Farnworth, were convicted of the murder of James Tierney at Manchester Crown Court.
Khan must serve 15 years and Duncan 12 years before being eligible for parole.
Det Sgt Mike Gladwin said the attack in April was "one of the most brutal and appalling" he had investigated.
Mr Tierney was found in Devon Street by Greater Manchester Police in the early hours of 15 April.
He had received severe facial injuries and died in hospital a short time later.
Witnesses described seeing Duncan pull a drainpipe from the side of a house to swing at the victim.
Mr Gladwin said there were also reports that Mr Tierney "begged Khan and Duncan to let him go home but instead was savagely beaten to death".
"James had been at his girlfriend's house and was making his way home when he was subjected to one of the most brutal and appalling attacks I have had the misfortune to investigate," he said.
"We don't know what prompted this attack but clearly both men have no regard for human life and left an innocent man to suffer a shocking death.
"I hope that their life sentences are of some small comfort to James' family and friends."
