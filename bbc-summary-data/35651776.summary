[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A husband tried to pull his wife out of the firing line moments before she was shot dead in a terror attack at a museum in Tunisia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sally Adey, 57, of Caynton, Shropshire, was among 22 people killed at the Bardo National Museum on 18 March last year.
An inquest heard how her husband Robert, who survived, held his dying wife after she told him: "Oh God Rob, I'm hit.'
Coroner John Ellery ruled she was unlawfully killed.
More on this story and others on Shropshire.
The couple were on an excursion from cruise liner MSC Splendida when the gunmen burst in.
Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer Detective Inspector Simon Harding said two attackers walked through the gates, but were not searched because "it was not policy".
Nine tourists were killed in the car park before the gunmen went inside.
Coroner's officer Julie Hartridge told the hearing: "A couple of people were hit to Mr Adey's left and a bullet hit the wall above his head but as people were falling down, he managed to get through (the doorway).
"He shoved Sally into the bay window balcony and pushed her in. Just as he grabbed Sally to pull her towards him, she was hit.
"Sally said something to him... it was words to the effect of, 'Oh God Rob, I'm hit'.
"As she slid down, he slid with her and just held her." He daubed his face with blood to dupe the gunmen, the inquest heard.
Retired Birmingham solicitor Mrs Adey was killed by a bullet which went through her handbag and into her stomach.
Her husband, 52, was wounded. Neither he nor their children were at Shropshire Coroner's Court in Shrewsbury.
Mr Harding said al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked Ansar al-Sharia were likely to be behind the atrocity.
