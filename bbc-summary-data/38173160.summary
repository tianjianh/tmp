The disorientated male pup was spotted at Liverpool's Ice Festival at Pierhead on Wednesday morning and was coaxed back into the water.
RSPCA animal welfare officer Matt Brown said he was uninjured but needed help finding his way.
He added: "He was a little reluctant, perhaps he wanted another go on the ice, but after some encouragement, off he went and we watched him swim away."
Mr Brown said no-one knew how the pup made his way to the ice rink.
An RSPCA spokesperson said animal welfare officers believed the seal may have come from the Mersey.
Anyone finding stricken seal pups that appear not to be in immediate danger is advised to monitor the animal, but to call the RSPCA if the mother does not return within 24 hours.
A healthy pup will look big and fat without a neck, whereas a poorly pup will look thin, the organisation said.
