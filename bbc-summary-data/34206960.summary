Scotland's only Labour MP has said he would serve in the shadow cabinet of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn if he were to win the leadership of the UK party.

Ian Murray wants to see Yvette Cooper replace Ed Miliband.
But he said if Mr Corbyn triumphed he would take on the shadow Scottish secretary role.
Voting in the election, being fought by Ms Cooper, Mr Corbyn, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall has closed and the winner will be announced on Saturday.
Mr Murray told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he had made clear in the past that he would "think about serving in a Corbyn shadow cabinet".
He said: "But I think anyone who asks me to serve as shadow Scottish secretary, I'll be accepting of that because we need a Scottish voice in that shadow cabinet. We need to work with the leadership."
Mr Murray added: "I would serve under Jeremy Cobryn's leadership if I'm asked to do so."
The contest has been plagued by internal rows over Labour's direction and concerns that non-party supporters have tried to influence the outcome.
The Labour leadership election was sparked by Mr Miliband's resignation following the party's poor performance at the general election.
The surprise emergence of left-winger Mr Corbyn, a last-minute addition to the race, has led to warnings from his rivals and senior Labour figures, including former prime minister Tony Blair, against a lurch to the left.
The party is also in the process of choosing a new deputy leader, with the result of the ballot also to be unveiled at the leadership conference on Saturday.
