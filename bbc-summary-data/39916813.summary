Chris Lloyd of Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team said the pair had been walking in the area over the weekend when they took a wrong path down the mountain.
"It's very easy to take the wrong turning," he said.
"They realised it was steeper than they wanted and turned round when he slipped and fell."
A nearby rock climber raised the alarm and the rescue team called a Coastguard helicopter to take the man to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor while they guided his "distraught" daughter, aged in her 20s, down the mountain.
