The collision happened at about 08:25 BST on the A1081 St Albans Road between South Mimms and Barnet.
The East of England Ambulance Service said no-one was thought to be critically injured but 45 of the 87 people involved were taken to hospital.
A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Six ambulances were sent to the scene together with an air ambulance, a hazardous area response unit, the fire service and police.
The bus overturned, injuring a number of people on board, police said.
The driver of a white Vauxhall Corsa, a 40-year-old woman, was also injured.
Eight people were taken to hospital by ambulance with suspected head, neck, and other traumatic injuries.
A further 37 people with minor injuries were taken to hospital by a bus from the same company whose vehicle crashed.
Forty-two people were unhurt, the ambulance service said.
Passenger Kevyn Kermani Llanos, 19, a student from Brent Cross, said the bus "went up a small bank and started tilting, then it toppled over".
"Everyone fell on top of each other and then some people started kicking out the windows so we could get out."
He had been on the upper deck and was taken by ambulance to hospital with severe whiplash, but has now been released.
Darren Meads, of the East of England Ambulance Service Trust, said: "Although this incident involved a large number of potential patients, we had resources on scene quickly and were able to start assessing and treating those in need as soon as possible."
A University of Hertfordshire spokesman said they were aware a number of students were travelling on the bus which was involved in the crash.
"Members of the university community are being supported by the Office of Dean of Students," he said.
The bus was the 614 Uno service to Hatfield Business Park via Barnet. The company said in a statement it was co-operating with the emergency services.
