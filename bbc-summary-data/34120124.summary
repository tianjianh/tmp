Both have joined the Scottish Championship club on season-long loans.
Estonia international Anier, 24, joined United in January but has made only four starts and has not featured at all this season.
The 19-year-old Feruz, who began his career with Celtic, made his Chelsea debut in a friendly in July 2013 and has played for Scotland Under-21s.
Feruz, previously loaned to OFI Crete and Blackpool, said: "I am excited to be coming back to Scotland to get some first-team football under my belt.
"Hibs have a good young team and I've played with a number of the boys before with the national team."
Speaking to the Hibs website, the player added: "The manager has shown faith me and I'm looking forward to repaying it by giving 100% when I'm selected."
Feruz and his family came to Scotland from Somalia and was brought through Celtic's youth system until, aged 16, he left in 2011 for Stamford Bridge.
Hibs head coach Alan Stubbs said: "I am delighted that we have managed to secure Islam on loan.
"He is another really exciting young talent, a player who has fantastic ability and potential.
"He will add a different dimension to the options that we currently have."
"Henri will bring something different to our attacking options.
"He is a powerful centre forward who will bring others into play and compliment the qualities of our other strikers. "
Anier, who is currently on international duty, first came to Scotland in 2014 to join Motherwell and had a brief spell with German club Erzgebirge Aue before joining United.
