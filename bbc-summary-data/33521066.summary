More than 200,000 golf fans are expected to descend on the Fife town for the event.
The town's Old Course is hosting the championship for the 29th time.
VisitScotland, which is an associate of the event, said it believed The Open played "a crucial role" in helping bring golf enthusiasts to Scotland.
This year's championship will feature many of the world's top golfers, including Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia.
However, defending champion Rory McIlroy will miss the competition after injuring his ankle playing football with friends.
VisitScotland chairman Mike Cantlay said: "Excitement has been building for months as we prepare to welcome hundreds of thousands of spectators, the world's greatest golfers and global media, back to St Andrews for The Open.
"These visitors, whether here for the day or for longer, help contribute to Scotland's economy by staying in hotels, using restaurants, drinking in bars or shopping in retail outlets.
"Scotland is the undisputed home of golf, and The Open is the jewel in the crown of what is a truly unmissable summer for the sport."
Golf tourism is estimated to be worth £220m to the Scottish economy and supports about 4,400 jobs.
VisitScotland said that for every £1 a visiting golfer spends on green fees, a further £5 is spent on extras such as food and drink and entertainment.
