Pilkington's neat finish put Cardiff ahead, only for Joe Newell to equalise from a tight angle moments before half-time.
Rotherham claimed an unlikely lead with Pilkington's own goal from a corner.
But he then struck his second for the Bluebirds, who had Lee Peltier sent off late on.
Cardiff stay ninth in the Championship table while Rotherham remain 21st, one point above the relegation zone.
Having lost seven of their previous eight league away games, Rotherham eased their relegation worries with a valuable point.
For Cardiff, however, the draw represented a missed opportunity as it kept the gap between them and the play-off places to five points.
This was the first game played at Cardiff City Stadium since its pitch had been relaid, and the firm new surface was far more conducive to passing football than its troublesome predecessor.
Cardiff were the first to threaten with chances for Joe Mason and Pilkington, and it was the latter who gave the hosts the lead.
Controlling the ball with his head inside the penalty area, Pilkington kept calm to score with a low shot in off the far post.
Rotherham offered precious little in attack but, shortly before half-time, Newell evaded Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall before finishing deftly from a tight angle.
If that goal came against the run of play, the Millers' second stunned the home crowd into silence as Pilkington inadvertently deflected a Rotherham corner into his own net.
The Republic of Ireland international soon atoned for his error as he latched on to a loose ball in the box and poked in despite a touch from Rotherham goalkeeper Lee Camp.
Peltier had a glorious chance to put Cardiff back in front but the right-back headed wide after rising unmarked to meet Peter Whittingham's tantalising free-kick.
Pilkington found himself the centre of attention once again as he was booked for diving in the Rotherham penalty area, before Lex Immers and Bruno Ecuele Manga squandered good chances for the hosts.
Cardiff desperately pursued a late winner but, with Peltier sent off for a second yellow card with five minutes left, Russell Slade's side had to be content with a point.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade said: "Rotherham always fight and scrap, that's the kind of team they are, but we had more quality in my opinion than they had.
"Rotherham did not offer too many threats in the first period and I was disappointed to go in 1-1.
"But it's about reacting to such set-backs. But then we got another one, an own goal, against the run of play.
"Our reaction then and our attitude were good, we got the second and had a couple of wonderful opportunities."
Rotherham boss Neil Redfearn told the media: "That is a point gained but, in the context of the game, it might be more a feeling of two dropped.
"I think we deserved to win. We were the better of two good sides.
"They played their part in a good game, but for us to come here and be disappointed with just a point shows how far we have come.
"It was a good football game, although it took a while to come to life. We started slow and they got their goal which was disappointing. "
