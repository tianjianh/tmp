Portland Road was cordoned off between City Road and the Ridgeway and the car has been taken away for investigation.
Det Insp Paul Joyce said police are working "around the clock" to try to piece together Mr Iqbal's last movements.
"Portland Road is likely to remain closed until later today while my team continues to carry out an important forensic examination at the scene," he said.
"I am particularly keen to speak to any witnesses who may have seen Mr Iqbal between closing his shop in Smethwick on Sunday night and the time he was discovered at lunchtime on Monday."
