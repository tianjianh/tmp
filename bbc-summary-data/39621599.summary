The public have been asked to help track down those responsible for the massive piles of refuse at a warehouse near Newton Mearns.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said calls about the former Netherplace Dye Works would be treated in confidence.
The waste has been blamed for an infestation of flies in Glasgow's southern suburbs.
