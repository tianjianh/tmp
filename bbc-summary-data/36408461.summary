Plans to enhance New Quay harbour in Ceredigion to allow better access to boats have been unveiled.

They include improving the existing stone pier, which dates back to 1835, and building a new jetty.
There are concerns it would cause disruption, but the company behind the plans said the work was needed to improve access to boats offering sight-seeing and dolphin trips.
The development would cost about Â£500,000.
New Quay town councillor Steve Hartley said: "The dolphin industry is generating Â£4.5m a year to the local economy. It's extremely important that we look after those customers who come and see the wildlife here on the boats.
"Being able to load and unload safely for all vessels using the harbour is vital."
