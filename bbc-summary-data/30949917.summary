Police sources said Amedy Coulibaly had been buried in the Muslim section of the Thiais cemetery, outside the city.
Seventeen people died in three days of violence in Paris that began with an assault on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on 7 January.
Two other attackers, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, are already buried.
Coulibaly, 32, killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris on 9 January.
Police also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital a day earlier.
Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers.
Earlier, France's top legal authority ruled that it was lawful to strip a dual national convicted of terrorism offences of his French nationality.
Ahmed Sahnouni, a Moroccan naturalised by France in 2003, had challenged the stripping of his citizenship.
Mr Sahnouni's lawyer argued that stripping his bi-national client of French citizenship created a two-tier system, with some Frenchmen "more French" than others.
But the Constitutional Council ruled that the move was justified by the seriousness of the need to tackle Islamist extremism.
Sahnouni was jailed for seven years in 2013 for terror-related activities. A dual citizen, he is now due to be extradited to Morocco on completing his sentence.
Under French law, nationals can be stripped of their naturalised citizenship if they are convicted of "terror acts", but only if the move would not make them stateless.
A poll published in a French newspaper several days ago suggested 81% of French people wanted dual nationals convicted of terrorism offences to have their French passports taken away.
It also suggested 68% believed French citizens involved in violent jihad abroad should not be allowed to return to France.
For those convicted of terrorism offences with only French nationality, the government is looking at reviving the status of 'national disgrace', used for collaborators after World War Two, the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports from Paris.
Under this label, convicts would be stripped of some of their civic rights.
The controversial suggestion is part of a large package of measures, outlined this week by Prime Minister Manuel Valls, to boost security in the wake of this month's attacks.
