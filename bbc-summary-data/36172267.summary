Cabrera Bello, Kjeldsen, Fitzpatrick and Sullivan all currently occupy automatic qualifying places in the European points list for the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in late September.
Kaymer played played at the K Club in the 2007 European Open.
"Although it maybe wasn't my best week on the course, I can remember being really impressed by it," added the former world number one, who clinched his first major win at the US PGA Championship in 2010.
"The Irish people love their golf and really get behind the players, so it should make for a great atmosphere, especially with such a strong field there."
McIlroy will be joined at the event by other Irish major winners Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell while other big names in the field include Shane Lowry and Lee Westwood.
