[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea's 'invincible' missionary Griffith John

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was in squalor, in a disease-hit, 19th Century Swansea that Griffith John grew up, with cholera claiming the lives of both his parents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This upbringing created an "invincible determination" which saw him spend 50 years providing healthcare and education for Chinese peasants living in similar poverty.
The "enormous legacy" he left behind in the far east includes hospitals, churches and schools - many of which are now major research centres serving millions of people.
To mark 150 years since he founded Union Hospital in Wuhan, a committee was formed to help send an exhibition on his life to the city.
About Â£20,000 is needed and more than 400 people recently attended a Chinese New Year fundraiser at the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea.
About half the figure was raised and the plan is to ship the exhibits to China in September ahead of the anniversary in October.
He was described as simply "a remarkable man" by retired university lecturer and chairman of the Griffith John Committee, Dr Vernon Williams.
The Swansea where Mr John was born in 1831 was experiencing rapid industrial growth, with disease spread by the River Tawe leading to frequent outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever and cholera.
These claimed the lives of his mother when he was eight months and his father when he was 17.
At the time, 15 people would live in two-room houses and with no schools, Mr John would have been expected to follow his father to work in the copper industry.
Religion, though, played a major role and he learnt to read his native Welsh by studying religious scriptures at Ebenezer Congregational Chapel.
Mr John became known as "the boy preacher" as he gave readings around the Neath and Swansea valleys as a teenager.
But it was after he gained a place at Brecon Memorial College in 1850 that perhaps his path towards China was set.
While there, he heard an address by a missionary who had been to Madagascar, which left him determined to enter the field.
He headed to Shanghai with his wife Margaret in 1855, where he spent four years preaching after learning the language in six months.
"Griffith John was brought up in a greatly over-crowded, impoverished borough, where illness and disease, particularly cholera, and squalor were rampant," said Dr Williams.
"This most definitely, as a Christian minister, would have had a profound effect on him and seeing that again, in then the poorest part of China, seems to have motivated him into action."
After moving up the Yangtze River, Mr John set up his base in Hankow (now Wuhan).
"He was a great visionary not only in his mission work but also in providing schools and hospitals when there were very few, if any, in Swansea at that time," he added.
Conditions were tough, but Dr Williams described Mr John as "short and stockily built, possessing a single-mindedness, great courage and invincible determination".
This allowed him to survive extremely hot summers and intense humidity that claimed the lives of his first wife Margaret (in 1873) and second wife Jeanette (in 1885).
By 1900, Mr John had helped set up a number of boys and girls schools and a teacher training college, meaning education in the area was thought to be 30 years ahead of the rest of China.
He also built about 10 hospitals, preached daily and distributed more than six million of his religious translations.
But after a number of strokes, he died "a frail and burned-out man" in London in 1912, when his body was returned home.
"Griffith John was extremely well know in his day in Swansea with over 2,000 people attending his funeral.
"In the 1960s, a block of flats was erected in Greenhill in the location where he was born and these and the adjacent street were named after him.
"However, as is common place with time, memories fade somewhat," Dr Williams added.
While he described Mr John as "one of the great sons of Swansea who left an enormous legacy in central China", he slipped out of the wider public consciousness.
But an exhibition on his life went on display at Swansea Museum in 2012 followed by a blue plaque on Ebenezer church.
The Griffith John Committee his since been set up and fundraising will continue over the coming months to send the exhibits to China.
With the country's influence on the Welsh economy set to grow, Cllr Robert Francis-Davies said Swansea wanted to strengthen "a cultural link that goes back to the 1850s".
Local businessman Chris Foxall is another driving force and said Mr John's "tireless work" means the city has a "special relationship" with the Asian country.
