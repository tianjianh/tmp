[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 2-2 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet's winless run extended to six games as Liam Shephard's late goal for Yeovil denied the hosts at the Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sloppy Barnet defending had led to Ben Whitfield putting the visitors ahead but Michael Nelson nodded the home side level from a corner before the break.
The Bees looked to have won it when Ryan Watson's free-kick from long range went in through a crowded area.
But on-loan Swansea defender Shephard netted his first goal for Yeovil from close range to level in stoppage time.
The draw sees the Glovers move 12 points clear of the relegation zone, four points below Barnet.
