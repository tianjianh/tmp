[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Otis Goldsmith, 49,  is accused of killing his wife Jill, 49, at the house they shared in Wootton Hall Park, Northampton, on Thursday.
Northamptonshire Police officer Mr Goldsmith appeared at Corby Magistrates' Court and was remanded into custody.
Mr Goldsmith, who has been a serving officer for 28 years, is due to appear at Northampton Crown Court on Tuesday.
A post-mortem examination took place on Friday, at Leicester Royal Infirmary, when the cause of death was confirmed as a head injury.
Mr Goldsmith was arrested shortly after 13:00 GMT on Thursday, while off-duty, at his home, which is close to the force's headquarters.
The murder investigation team "will not include anyone from Northamptonshire Police", police said earlier.
The overall investigation will be led by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, headed by Det Supt Kate Meynell, with about 50 officers drafted in from across the region, including Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was notified of the death on Thursday night and has received a "formal referral" from Northamptonshire Police.
