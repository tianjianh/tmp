England's performances since the 2014 World Cup will have "frightened" other nations, says captain Wayne Rooney.

The Manchester United striker scored one and hit the woodwork twice as England beat Lithuania 4-0 to record their fifth Euro 2016 qualifying win.
Roy Hodgson's side failed to win a game at the World Cup in Brazil, but have since won seven matches in a row.
"We've had some great victories, are scoring goals and have real energy around the team," said Rooney, 29.
"Since the World Cup we have been fantastic. A lot of teams around Europe will be looking at this team and will be frightened."
Danny Welbeck added a second before Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane both scored their first international goals, with Kane's close-range header coming 79 seconds after he came on as a substitute.
"It's fantastic for Harry Kane and we're delighted for him," said Hodgson.
"It's a bit of a fairytale but it's nice when fairytales come true and it has come true for Harry. He has had a wonderful season and crowned his debut with a well-taken goal."
Hodgson's team, who play a friendly in Italy on Tuesday, remain six points clear at the top of Group E as they look to qualify for next year's tournament in France.
"Our major test will be when we get to France and I'm convinced we'll get there," added Hodgson.
"We've got a year and bit to work with them and this team are so young.
"You can only beat what's in front of you. We had to work hard to wear them down in the first half and we got our reward in the second half when they tired."
Everton left-back Leighton Baines, Manchester City midfielder James Milner, Liverpool forward Sterling and Arsenal striker Welbeck will miss Tuesday's game in Turin and will return to their clubs.
England have called up Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand into the squad for the match against Italy.
