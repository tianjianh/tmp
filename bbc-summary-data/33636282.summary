[SN]TITLE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox appears in court for nine sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox has appeared in court accused of nine sex offences over a period spanning more than 20 years ahead of his trial later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Westminster Magistrates' Court heard how three of the six complainants made claims against him having first been approached by detectives.
His barrister Jonathan Caplan QC asked for details of conversations between police and the women to be revealed.
Mr Fox denies the offences, alleged to have taken place between 1991 and 2014.
The 54-year-old DJ - known as Dr Fox - faces seven charges of indecent assault and two of sexual touching without consent.
He is accused of assaulting girls and women aged between 14 and 36, at locations including the offices of London commercial radio stations Capital FM and Magic FM, as well as at the Chessington World of Adventures theme park.
Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that during the trial witnesses would be called to give evidence via videolink from Australia, and that the complainants would be giving evidence from behind screens.
Mr Fox sat taking notes throughout the administrative hearing.
Details of the charges the Magic FM presenter is accused of have been reported after Mr Caplan asked for the reporting restrictions to be lifted at a previous hearing.
Mr Caplan said there had been a lot of false reports about what his client had allegedly done.
Among the charges, Mr Fox, from Fulham, in south-west London, is accused of repeatedly assaulting a woman at Capital Radio's studios in London's Leicester Square.
Two other women claim to have been sexually touched against their will at Magic FM's premises, in central London, while two girls were allegedly assaulted at a motor show in Bromley, south-east London, in 1991.
Mr Fox, who is is due to stand trial before magistrates on 5 November, was released on unconditional bail.
A further hearing will be held in October.
