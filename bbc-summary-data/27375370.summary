It is the second grant to the Sure Chill Company in Tywyn, Gwynedd, to develop a cooler for use in the developing world.
The firm said the money from the billionaire philanthropist's foundation will allow field trials within a year.
Gates' foundation aims to back innovation in ways to deliver vaccines.
Refrigerators based on the technology developed by the firm are used in Haiti, South Sudan, Niger and Sierra Leone, where there is no reliable power supply.
The UN Children's Fund (Unicef) has ordered 220 refrigerators which can keep vaccines at the right temperature for up to 10 days without power.
Last year, the Gates foundation gave the firm, formerly True Energy, $100,000 (Â£67,000) to prove it could develop a portable cooler capable of running for up to 35 days.
