Skelton, who co-presented the BBC's swimming and diving coverage at the Olympics in Rio, will fill the hot seat on Lorraine from 24 to 28 October.
The 33-year-old said was "so excited" to filling Kelly's shoes and looking forward to the show's cookery items.
Lady Gaga, James Arthur, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Jodie Kidd will be among her celebrity guests.
She will also speak to former Coronation Street star Tracy Brabin, Labour's candidate for the Batley and Spen by-election prompted by the killing of Jo Cox.
Fiona Phillips, Gaby Roslin and Lisa Snowdon took turns to host Lorraine when Kelly, 56, took time off in August.
