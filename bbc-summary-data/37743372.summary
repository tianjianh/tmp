Scotland's Russell Knox fell out of contention on the final day as American Justin Thomas successfully defended his CIMB Classic title in Malaysia.

Knox and Thomas both started their final round four shots behind overnight leader Anirban Lahiri of India.
A quadruple bogey nine at the third brought Lahiri back into the pack and Thomas capitalised, carding an eight-under 64 to finish on 23 under, three clear of Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (66).
Knox was 10 adrift after posting a 74.
Thomas, 23, had led over the first two days of the tournament and started his charge with four birdies in his first five holes on Sunday.
"I got a great start and I really was very pleased with how I felt like I handled myself and how I felt out there," he said.
Lahiri, who was looking for his first PGA Tour win, lodged his tee shot in a tree on the third and eventually finished in a tie for third place, four strokes back.
