Lewis Hamilton: Could he become a legend at the British Grand Prix?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The weather's not great and the place is so flat it feels like you can see the curvature of the earth, but Silverstone remains one of the world's truly great grand prix circuits.

For Lewis Hamilton, it offers a chance to create history this weekend. On Sunday, he will attempt to equal Nigel Mansell's British record of four F1 wins at the Northamptonshire circuit.
Several drivers will say that the track is not as good as it was before the newest layout was created for the 2010 race, replacing the Bridge and Priory corners with the section that runs infield to Village and The Loop.
But, thankfully, they left the best bit intact - and very few places anywhere in the world match up with the section from heart-in-mouth Copse through the breathtaking Becketts sweepers.
It's a place where a Formula 1 car can breathe, where its driver gets to extend its full capabilities. And to watch a great driver through there is to marvel both at the laws of physics and man's ability to master and exploit them.
No matter how many times you see it, you still can't quite believe it.
A little lift and then flat - at nearly 190mph - through Copse. This was where Fernando Alonso passed Sebastian Vettel around the outside during the race in 2014.
Then it's flat through the kink at Maggotts, a dab on the brakes into the first right-hander at Becketts, then left and right again - shedding speed all the time, but with neck-snapping G-forces, and never less than 120mph - before flooring it through Chapel and out on to the Hangar Straight.
This section alone is worth the price of admission. But there's a lot more to Silverstone.
With the venue packed out for three days, no matter what the weather, the fans are as knowledgeable and enthusiastic as anywhere in the world. They create a unique atmosphere that just has to be experienced. And it's not a bad place for racing, either.
It's not as crazy as Suzuka, as amazing as Spa, as spooky as Monza or as glamorous as Monaco.
But Silverstone has something special all of its own.
And even the traffic's generally OK these days, too.
