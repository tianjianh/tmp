Leeds United 0-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Preston frustrated Leeds United after Ben Pearson was dismissed as the two sides played out a goalless draw at Elland Road.

The visitors had the better chances to win the game before going down to 10 men, Tom Barkhuizen and Alan Browne both going close in the first half.
Pearson was sent off for a second booking on 60 minutes.
Leeds striker Chris Wood had a number of chances before Preston's Josh Harrop hit the bar in stoppage time.
It was the first time Leeds had failed to score since 17 April, having scored seven goals in their opening two games this season.
New Zealand international Wood forced Chris Maxwell into a fine second-half save and failed to put away a Cameron Borthwick-Johnson cross before chances for Stuart Dallas and Pablo Hernandez.
But Preston - who have now won only one of their last nine league visits to Elland Road - could have come away an unlikely three points had Felix Wiedwald not got a finger to Harrop's shot and tipped it onto the woodwork.
Leeds United head coach Thomas Christiansen:
"When you play for that amount of time with one player more and do not win, it is an opportunity lost.
"We have to impose ourselves on our home ground and we did not do that in the first half.
"We gave the ball away too easily and when you play against a good team you suffer. We did not have the speed in the game that we should."
Preston manager Alex Neil:
"For 60 minutes I thought we were great and were the better side. We controlled the ball, we were aggressive. I thought we dominated which was really pleasing.
"Once we went down to 10 men we had to change our approach. They had a man more and that makes it more difficult for us to press.
"The lads worked extremely hard and kept their shape and discipline. They showed just how much it means to them individually and collectively."
