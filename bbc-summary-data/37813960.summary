Wood, who have never beaten a Football League club in the FA Cup, led through Morgan Ferrier's angled shot and Angelo Balanta's finish from six yards.
Half-time substitute Campbell fired in from 20 yards to give the League Two side hope.
And he earned them a second chance when he headed in a late corner.
Notts, beaten by Salford City in the first round last season, thought they had grabbed a late winner but Vadaine Oliver was adjudged offside.
Boreham Wood, who went into the game on the back of five wins in six games in all competitions, thought they were on course for the second round for the first time since 1997 when Balanta struck to add to Ferrier's eighth goal in as many games.
But Campbell earned Notts, who have lost in round one in each of the last three seasons, a replay when he followed up his strike by nodding in Carl Dickinson's corner from close range.
Notts County striker Adam Campbell told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I'm ecstatic. To score two goals is always nice. Thankfully we've pulled ourselves back into it and we're still in the draw.
"Once our first goal came it was just a matter of time before the second one followed.
"It was vital we didn't get beaten today. The fans stuck with us and thankfully they've gone home at least without a defeat."
