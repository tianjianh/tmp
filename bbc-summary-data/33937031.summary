[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a two-storey house in Leicestershire has been torn off after a lorry crashed into the property.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No-one was seriously injured in the crash on Bumblebee Lane in Sharnford, but the lorry driver had to be rescued from his vehicle.
The owner of the house was not injured, but has been moved out of the property.
His son Steve Rowley said: "This is the second time this happened in a year as a car went thought the other end of the building."
"It is a terrible part of the road - I don't know why so many cars seem to come off here - it really does need looking at," Mr Rowley said.
He said the house would probably need to be completely rebuilt.
