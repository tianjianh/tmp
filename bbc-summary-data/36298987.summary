Replying to Worcestershire's total of 491, the visitors limped to 116-5 in search of the follow-on target of 342.
But stand-in skipper Brown (49 not out) and Matt Machan (36) put on a stand of 56 to help their team close on 192-6, still 299 behind.
Ross Whiteley (71) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (51) had earlier completed half centuries for the hosts.
Their 120-run fifth-wicket stand lower down the order, further bolstered by Ben Cox (30) and Joe Leach (26), helped Worcestershire post their highest total in 156 first-class meetings with Sussex.
Leach then took two of the six Sussex wickets, while in-form converted opener Brett D'Oliveira captured his first wicket of the season with his off spin.
Brown is captaining Sussex in this game in the absence of the injured Luke Wright.
Worcs assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was a terrific effort by the bowlers on that wicket because it is a good pitch. We applied ourselves very well.
"We hung in there after they initially got away from us with the new ball. They scored freely for a little bit there.
"But Jack Shantry and Ed Barnard pegged the scoring back and created the opportunities we took later in the day."
Sussex head coach Mark Davis:
"It was a good morning for us. We said we must come out and try to win the first session.
"We got six wickets and I felt we bowled better, then we fought our corner with the bat.
"It's getting more difficult out there. Full marks to the guys. They are committed."
