The couple, aged 78 and 87, had been trapped since 20:00 BST on Saturday, Gloucestershire Police said.
The vehicle was spotted by a lorry driver on the A46 between Cranham and Nut Hill just after 10:00 BST.
The couple, from Churchdown, were taken to hospital but were not seriously injured.
A force spokesman said the pair were "extremely lucky" to be spotted by the driver of a high-sided vehicle.
He added investigations continued as to why the driver lost control of the car.
The A46 is closed in both directions and is expected to reopen later.
