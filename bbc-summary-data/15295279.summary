Anthrax tests in Herefordshire after cow carcass burned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The carcass of a cow has been burned on a farm in Herefordshire as tests are carried out to see if it died from anthrax.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A footpath has been closed across a field on the farm at Bartonsham near Hereford where the animal was found.
Mike Higgins, from Herefordshire Council, said the vet who examined the cow was "unsure" of the cause of death.
He said: "Samples are now with the laboratory and we're awaiting the results."
Decontamination equipment has been placed at the gates leading onto the field, together with warning signs saying the area is restricted.
Council officials will stay at the site overnight.
Mr Higgins said: "That's the normal practice - Defra contact us and the local authority has a duty placed on them to dispose of an animal in these circumstances."
A Defra spokesman said that whenever a cow dies in a field it is routine for tests to be done.
Anthrax is a notifiable disease and any suspected outbreak must be reported to Defra.
