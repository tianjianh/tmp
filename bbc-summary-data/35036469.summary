Hauliers costs warning over bridge diversions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hauliers have warned they may seek compensation for extra costs totalling £600,000 a day because of the Forth Road Bridge delays and diversions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge has been completely closed until the new year after steelwork faults were found.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the main diversion route was adding an extra £30 in fuel costs.
The Scottish government said the alternative travel arrangements were working better than expected.
Repair work on the bridge is due to begin next week. Operators said they were carrying out a controlled test on Tuesday to check out structural behaviour.
The RHA welcomed the setting up of a dedicated HGV lane on the A985 and a temporary relaxation of  Department of Transport  rules on drivers' working hours.
But RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said the Scottish government did not appear to appreciate fully the extra costs being borne by hauliers.
He said: "The knock-on effects for hauliers are already beginning to bite,
"Although we welcome the dedicated HGV route on the A985, the additional cost to hauliers is immense.
"The extra cost for a single HGV to replace what is in effect, a 2.5 mile journey with a detour that can amount to approximately a 60 mile round trip will add an extra £30 in fuel costs alone.
"With an estimated 10,500 HGVs using the bridge each day, the additional operating costs for the industry will be well in excess of £600,000 per day.
"Already we have had reports from members who have had no alternative but to ask their customers for a rate rise. A request that has, unsurprisingly, been met with a great deal of resistance.
"In addition to the increase in operating costs, the overall efficiency of the haulage industry in Scotland is already being greatly reduced as a journey that would take 30 minutes can now take up to three hours if the route is congested."
Mr Burnett said there was concern the extra costs meant Scottish hauliers would be unable to compete for contracts
He added: ""This current state of affairs in unsustainable and we shall be pushing the Scottish government for compensation.
"Hauliers, already working to tight margins simply cannot absorb these extra costs.
"We need answers. Why, despite regular routine inspections, were these defects not picked up before? And why did they become so serious so quickly?"
Meanwhile, Transport Minister Derek Mackay based himself at the National Traffic Control Centre during the rush hour disruption to see how the alternative travel arrangements were working.
Traffic Scotland reported hour-long queues on southbound approach to Kincardine Bridge, the alternative Forth crossing from Fife.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who visited the traffic control centre, said the contingency plans were "working as well as we could have expected".
"Clearly the closure of the bridge is causing inconvenience and disruption to people and I absolutely understand that," she said.
She thanked the travelling public for their "patience and forbearance".
Ms Sturgeon said there was significant extra capacity on the trains and the buses and a diversion route for buses and HGVs.
She said: "I would encourage people who are being incredibly patient to continue to think about car sharing, using the buses - there is extra capacity still on the buses and the journey times are not as long as might have been the case.
"Think about staggering your journey times to and from work. If we all play our part, then we will get through this with as little disruption as possible and then hopefully get this bridge open again at the start of the year."
The first minister added: "We are absolutely determined to get the bridge open at the start of the new year and, weather aside, from everything the engineers have told me this morning they remain optimistic that the repairs can be done in this timescale."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said it was the biggest change to Fife's transport system in 50 years.
The MSP for mid Scotland and Fife told BBC Scotland that some villages in Fife, such as Culross and Torryburn, were not designed to cope with the extra traffic now passing through them.
He also called for some of the restrictions to be lifted outside peak times to help local residents.
Mr Rennie, a keen cyclist, said he had asked the transport minister why people could not cross the Forth bridge on bicycles.
The minister said the bridge was an "active" workplace and there would be risks involved.
The crossing restrictions have been lifted for some patients travelling for cancer treatment but they will have to be escorted across the bridge.
