Pro12: Connacht v Ulster (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster have made four changes for the Boxing Day derby against Connacht at the Sportsground in Galway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rory Scholes replaces the injured Craig Gilroy on the wing while Andy Warwick, Rob Herring and Nick Williams also come in for the Pro12 game.
It's a new-look Connacht team with coach Pat Lam making 12 changes from the side which lost to Newcastle in the Challenge Cup last weekend.
Niyi Adeolokun, Craig Ronaldson and Eoghan Materson retain their places.
Tiernan O'Halloran returns to take his spot at full-back while Ronaldson is joined in the centre by the returning Bundee Aki.
Matt Healy starts on the left wing while the half-back pairing sees Jack Carty and Kieran Marmion line out together for the seventh time this season.
Masterson switches to number eight to allow captain John Muldoon to return at blindside flanker, while Academy flanker James Connolly completes the back row.
Ultan Dillane and Aly Muldowney form the second row partnership behind the new front row trio of Finlay Bealham, Dave Heffernan and Ireland international Nathan White.
Herring replaces Rory Best, who is rested, as hooker and Ulster captain while Warwick will make his fifth start of the season at loosehead prop.
Williams, who will join Cardiff Blues from Ulster at the end of the season, comes in for Roger Wilson at number eight.
Gilroy is ruled out after fracturing an eye socket in Sunday's victory over Toulouse.
The Ireland player was forced off early in the European Champions Cup pool game in France following a clash of heads with Fijian Semi Kunatani.
Gilroy is also a doubt for the Kingspan Stadium encounter against Irish rivals Munster on 2 January.
Ulster are fifth in the Pro12 standings and six points behind Connacht.
