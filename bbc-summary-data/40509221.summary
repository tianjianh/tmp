American-based real estate firm, ARC, is seeking planning permission for the £30m development, which, it says, will create 250 jobs.
If it goes ahead, the 120-bedroom hotel will overlook the Royal Portrush Golf Club, which is due to host the Open in 2019.
A planning application is due to be lodged by Causeway Coast Developments Ltd at the beginning of September.
ARC, which is based in Austin Texas is headed up by Gavin Boyd, who is originally from Kilrea, County Londonderry, and his wife Minka.
Mr Boyd said a project on this scale normally takes between five and six years to complete.
He added: "The challenge the developers face is making it happen in two years in order to be ready for The Open which will be nothing short of a small miracle.
"A team of international experts are working around the clock to ensure this world class resort will be delivered on time for Northern Ireland."
