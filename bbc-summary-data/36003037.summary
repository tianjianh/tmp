The promotion-chasing Bantams took the lead when Tony McMahon's whipped cross was headed in by Jamie Proctor.
But Akpa Akpro beat keeper Ben Williams to the ball with six minutes left to draw Shrewsbury level.
Fourth-placed City are six points off a League One automatic promotion place, while Shrewsbury are 20th, two points clear of fourth-from-bottom Blackpool.
Micky Mellon's side have two games in hand over his former club, but Town's next three matches are all against promotion-chasing sides.
They are now at home to eighth-placed Sheffield United on Tuesday night before trips to sixth-placed Gillingham and third-placed Walsall.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"You have to dig in and keep fighting. It's very tight at the bottom and tense, but we need people who can believe.
"We didn't compose ourselves in the first half - but we kept battling away. You always get an opportunity at some stage in the game and we got one fall our way.
"The substitutions worked and gave us the battling qualities we needed to get back in it, but it's frustrating because we're trying to find a system that works."
