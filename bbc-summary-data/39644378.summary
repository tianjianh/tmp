British and Irish Lions 2017: Ireland's Jared Payne shocked to be picked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster back Jared Payne said he was hugely surprised to be included in the 41-man British and Irish Lions squad for the tour to New Zealand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old, born in New Zealand but Irish qualified having played for Ulster since 2011, was seen as one of the more unexpected inclusions.
His Ulster team-mates Rory Best and Iain Henderson have also been selected.
"It was a pretty big shock and something which has come out of the blue for me," said Payne.
"I am hugely proud and my family are all over the moon as you can imagine. It hasn't really sunk in yet.
"It is great for Ulster, and for me to have a few friendly faces on the trip.
"Those two have worked hard over the last few years and it is good to see them recognised."
Payne, who operates at centre or full-back, has won 20 caps since making his Ireland debut against South Africa in 2014.

Forward Henderson said he heard about his selection by watching the announcement on television.
"I was definitely more nervous than I'd usually be watching TV in my living room," admitted the 25-year-old.
"It was enjoyable to hear my name read out and I am immensely proud."
