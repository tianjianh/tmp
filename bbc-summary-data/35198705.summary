The Old Trafford club hope the Red Rose Floods Appeal will reach an initial target of £10,000.
"Our thoughts are with those communities who have suffered," said head coach Ashley Giles.
"We hope that as a famous Lancashire institution we can encourage people to dig deep and help their fellow Lancastrians in their hour of need."
By 16;00 GMT on Wednesday, the total raised had already reached close to £4,000.
The funds raised by the appeal, launched in conjunction with the LCCC Foundation and Lancashire Cricket Board, will be distributed to "carefully selected recipients" in the county.
The LCB and LCCC Foundation recently donated £1,500 to nine cricket clubs in Cumbria and Lancashire affected by the flooding caused by Storm Desmond earlier this month.
Earlier this week, Roses rivals Yorkshire announced the setting up of an emergency fund to help cricket clubs whose grounds have been flooded.
