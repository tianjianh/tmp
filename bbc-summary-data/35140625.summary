Scottish League Two: Arbroath P-P East Stirlingshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A frozen pitch has forced the postponement of Tuesday's Scottish League One match between Arbroath and East Stirlingshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a 13.00 GMT pitch inspection at Arbroath's Gayfield Park.
The hosts were hoping for a victory that would take them to within a point of third-top Stirling Albion, Queen's Park and Annan Athletic.
Shire were looking to continue where they left off after a win over Queen's Park lifted them off the bottom.
