Scott Brown came out of international retirement to help Scotland head coach Gordon Strachan tackle England, says Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers.

The Celtic midfielder retired in August before the start of the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.
But the Scots have had poor results before trip to Wembley on 11 November.
"He probably recognises that someone he respects hugely is in a difficult position because of injuries to some key players," Rodgers said.
"He decided he wanted to give it a go for this game and then see what happens after that."
After thumping Malta 5-1 away from home, the Scots drew 1-1 at home to Lithuania and lost 3-0 in Slovakia.
That left Strachan's men three points behind leaders England in fourth place in Group F.
Hull City midfielder Robert Snodgrass is a major doubt for the match in London.
Meanwhile, club-mate Andrew Robertson and a second left-back, Celtic's Kieran Tierney, have been ruled out through injury.
Former national captain Brown's U-turn means he will almost certainly be named in Strachan's squad on Wednesday for next month's game.
"He wanted to retire and concentrate on his career with Celtic," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"But, knowing Scott as I do, he is a very loyal guy. The type of guy Scott is, he wants to help someone in that position."
Rodgers said he was fully behind the decision by a player who has blossomed this season since deciding to end his Scotland career after earning his 50th cap.
"I gave him my thoughts of what the benefits and issues might be, but I back him 100%," the Celtic boss added.
"I will always support the players even though my interest is only Celtic.
"But it is a short career and Scott has always stood up for his country and he knows his country needs him.
"He wants to go and help Gordon, someone he has huge respect for, and it is a decision I support 100%."
