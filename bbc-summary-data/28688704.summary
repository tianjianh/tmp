Six council-run children's centres in Derby have been told to improve.

Following an inspection last month, Oftsed inspectors said the council was unaware of how well the centres were performing.
The report also stated not enough children were taking up free places at the centres in Sunnyhill, Pear Tree, Mickleover and Littleover.
Derby City Council said an improvement plan had been put in place to address the concerns raised.
The visit by Ofsted in July found while the centres were good at encouraging migrant parents to use them, information was not always provided in other languages or made easy for parents to understand.
Councillor Fareed Hussain, cabinet member for children and young people, said an improvement plan had been created to address the issues raised by Ofsted.
He said: "In terms of encouraging more families to take up childcare provision, the council continues to support the development of good quality, affordable childcare for two, three and four-year-olds across the city.
"Children's centres continue to encourage parents of children not receiving their free entitlement to do so, and on an individual basis, support families to select and make contact with providers."
Mr Hussain said advertising campaigns and a new system had also been introduced by the council to monitor the take-up of free places and offer support to parents for accessing childcare.
