Commonwealth Games 2014 judo silver medallist Stephanie Inglis has told of being warned not to return to the sport she has done since she was four.

Inglis, from Daviot, near Inverness, is recovering from serious neck and head injuries sustained in a road accident in Vietnam a year ago this week.
The 28-year-old told BBC Scotland's Timeline that a surgeon has advised her against returning to the contact sport.
But she added that another surgeon has said competing at judo may be possible.
Inglis was given a 1% chance of survival by doctors in Vietnam.
A crowdfunding campaign raised money to cover the cost of treatment in Thailand and then a flight back to Scotland where she woke up from a coma in a hospital in Edinburgh, six weeks after the accident.
A titanium cap was bolted to her skull as part of her treatment and recovery from her injuries.
Inglis, who was teaching primary and secondary school children in Vietnam, told Timeline: "I have had talks with my surgeon and he is really not keen for me to return to the sport because it is a full contact sport.
"He thinks there is a risk of another head injury and that I wouldn't come through that."
She added: "I have spoken to another surgeon who says your brain is like any other muscle and when it is fixed it is fixed."
Asked which advice she will follow, Inglis said: "I will give it a couple of years to let everything to settle down and get some more tests done and scans done."
The sportswoman said she still aspired to compete at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.
