English devolution: Government urged 'don't forget Hull'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Osborne's English devolution aspirations place the focus largely on Greater Manchester, the heart of the so-called Northern Powerhouse. But there is another city determined not to be left behind.

Home to more than 250,000 people, Kingston upon Hull is readying itself to become the UK's first City of Culture in 2017.
Government minsters who awarded the accolade said Hull made a "compelling case" as "a city coming out of the shadows".
But Hull's council leader wants government recognition of the area to go further.
"We've been banging the drum for Hull for the last few years," Labour's Stephen Brady told the BBC.
"My message is, yes to Manchester and Leeds, but don't forget great cities like Hull.
"The Humber is the largest port complex in the country and the fourth largest in Europe and we continue to get forgotten about in the Northern Powerhouse, rail electrification etc. and it's not good enough."

Greater Manchester, a "blueprint" for other cities according to Mr Osborne, will elect a mayor and have control over an additional Â£2bn of public money.
The area's 10 council leaders will work with the new mayor and make decisions about housing, transport, planning and policing.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the new communities and local government secretary Greg Clark described the move as a "big breakthrough".
"Decisions about Hull and about Manchester, Leeds or Birmingham should be made by the people of those great cities who know and love their area, rather than troop up to London and plead for crumbs from the table," he said.
Mr Brady said he welcomed the plans, which will formally proposed as a "Cities Devolution bill" in the Queen's Speech later this month.
He was critical of the amount of time his city council had spent "putting bids together to civil servants in London" in the past.
"It seems to me it's all cap in hand, when other areas of the country can get that just by saying they're going to leave the union," he said.
"What we in Yorkshire say is 'no'. We want exactly the same as what's happening in Scotland."
