"He took a swing with his knife at a guy sat on the bench. I followed him for about 30 seconds until he reached a [Spar] shop. He was shouting at the people in the shop.
"He turned round to me and an off-duty police officer and shouted 'shake my hand and show me some respect'.
"We replied 'put the knives down and we'll shake your hand'.
"We were thinking 'is he going to go and hurt someone else?'. I was obviously concerned, just trying to distract him.
"At that point an unmarked police car pulled up and the lady got out and threatened to fire the Taser if he didn't drop the knives.
"He rolled to the floor and that's when I jumped on him to assist the off-duty police officer."
An 80-year-old man, who was confronted by the suspect while sitting on a bench near Poundland, suffered a hand injury.
Supt Rory Freeman said: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the public who responded so bravely to the incident, in particular the nurses nearby who came to help, Poundland staff and customers and the staff of Santander bank."
Thames Valley Police has appealed for anyone who captured footage at the scene to come forward.
