The man who became known as the naked rambler has been jailed for five months for a breach of the peace.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Gough, 53, was seen walking unclothed near a children's play park in Dunfermline, Fife, on 20 July.
He was jailed after he told a court he would not co-operate with social workers tasked with assessing his mental health.
Gough has spent much of the past six years in prison on similar charges for being nude in a public place.
The former marine, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, was sentenced at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court, where he appeared naked in the dock.
Sheriff James Williamson had expressed concern about Gough's demeanour at a previous hearing.
He ordered social workers to produce a report assessing his emotional and mental health.
But on Thursday the sheriff told the rambler he had "no alternative" but to impose another custodial sentence after Gough refused to meet the officials and indicated he had no intention of doing so in the future.
A Crown Office spokesman said: "The actions of the accused made his arrest and prosecution necessary.
"Mr Gough intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents.
"The evidence in this case clearly established that despite repeated police requests not to do so, he was determined to deliberately walk naked past a busy children's play-park in Fife.
"He knew that in doing so he would provoke anger and upset.
"The sheriff held that his conduct constituted the crime of breach of the peace."
