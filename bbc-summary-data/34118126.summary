[SN]TITLE[SN]
EBT beneficiaries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This table contains the names of Rangers players, coaches and staff who were beneficiaries of the Murray Group Remuneration Trust, and how much they received through that trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It also lists the names of people where the BBC has seen evidence that they received side-letters - a promise to make contributions to their individual sub-trusts.
BBC Scotland asked everyone in the Employee Benefit Trust scheme featured in the documentary Rangers: The Men Who Sold the Jerseys, broadcast in 2012, about their use of the trust.
None would tell us anything about their EBTs.
