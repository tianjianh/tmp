The spinoff, starring Bob Odenkirk, will debut in the US on AMC on 8 February, with its second episode due to air the following night.
It will then be shown in weekly instalments every Monday.
There's still no word on a UK release date, though the show is expected to arrive on Netflix across Europe shortly after its AMC run.
Following a series of short clips and a behind-the-scenes mini-feature, a new teaser has been released.
Entitled Tingle Fingers, the preview is set in a ransacked hotel room.
There's a cigar burning in an ashtray, a set of high heels discarded on the floor and a vibrating bed.
AMC president Charlie Collier has confirmed that the series will focus on the lawyer's pre-Goodman life as Jimmy McGill.
"We're going to introduce Jimmy McGill to the world. Known to Breaking Bad fans as Saul Goodman, viewers will soon discover Saul wasn't always Albuquerque's top criminal (criminal) lawyer," said Collier.
Jonathan Banks, who played Mike Ehrmantraut, will also return for the prequel, with new cast additions including Rhea Seehorn, Michael Mando and Julie Ann Emery.
Although it is yet to be confirmed, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan has previously said that Bryan Cranston and his co-star Aaron Paul, who played Jesse Pinkman in the show, are likely to feature in the forthcoming spin-off Better Call Saul.
Breaking Bad told the story of a high school chemistry teacher Walter White, played by Cranston, who produced methamphetamine with a former student and became a fearsome drug kingpin.
