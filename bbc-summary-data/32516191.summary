Jason Russell, 28, his brother Darren, 26, and Daniel Hughes, 36, are in Talu, a small village about 56 miles (90km) from Kathmandu.
A helicopter was sent to the area on Wednesday, but failed to find them. It will return on Thursday.
The 7.8-magnitude quake has claimed more than 5,000 lives.
The three men were part of an organised trip, and spoke to company officials on Wednesday.
Om Shahi, director of Hard Rock Trek, the trekking company the men travelled with, had said earlier on Wednesday that help was on its way.
"They are all OK," Mr Shahi told BBC Wales. "There are landslides and the pass is completely blocked.
"They are stuck in the same place for the last four days."
Mr Shahi had said the men were supposed to be flown to a town called Trisuli Bazar, a small town 70km from Kathmandu, from where they would be able to make their own way to the capital, which would take around three hours.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has confirmed a Briton living overseas is among the victims of the earthquake.
Eight million people have been affected by the disaster, according to the UN, and the British public has donated more than Â£19m to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Earthquake Appeal, a day after it was launched.
Elsewhere, Brecon Beacons national park says it was "overwhelmed" by the public's generosity after appealing for help to gather aid to take out to Nepal.
