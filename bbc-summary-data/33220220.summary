Greece debt crisis: EU leaders hold critical summit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greece faces a critical 24 hours as European leaders hold an emergency summit that could break the deadlock around the country's debt crisis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said he hoped Greece would "return to growth within the eurozone".
But European ministers have said there is still no basis for making a decision for aid for Greece on Monday.
On Sunday, Mr Tsipras set out new proposals to try to prevent a default on a €1.6bn (£1.1bn) IMF loan.
But he has ruled out pension cuts, higher power rates, and an excessive budget surplus.
Greece must repay the loan by the end of June or risk crashing out of the single currency and possibly the EU.
Talks have been in deadlock for five months. The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) are unwilling to unlock the final €7.2bn tranche of bailout funds until Greece agrees to economic reforms.

Stock markets rise on hopes of deal
The chairman of Greece's fourth-biggest bank, Nikolaos Karamouzis, warned there was a genuine risk of Greek banks being forced to close their doors tomorrow and cease dispensing cash for days, if there is no deal in Brussels today.
He said that because of the pace of withdrawals of cash from Greek banks by anxious savers - which he said was running at €700m (£501m) a day - all the banks can only keep going thanks to life-saving loans to them made by the Bank of Greece, with approval of the ECB, under the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) scheme.
There was a serious risk, he said, that the governing council of the ECB would end the ELA scheme, and terminate Greek banks' full access to the Eurosystem payments arrangements, if there was no sign today that Greece is back on a path to solvency.
In that dire eventuality, all the banks would have to cease trading, as soon as tomorrow. And they could only reopen as and when the Greek government passed legislation to restrict cash withdrawals, or introduce capital controls, which - he said - would take days.

Prime Minister Tsipras is meeting the heads of Greece's three international creditors in Brussels, ahead of his talks with the leaders of 18 other eurozone nations.
Mr Tsipras' offer on Sunday of a reforms package to the leaders of Germany, France and the European Commission is seen by some as a sign the Greek government is willing to make concessions.
The proposals, which Mr Tsipras described as "mutually beneficial", were adopted at an emergency meeting of the Greek cabinet - though details have yet to be revealed.
The deadline for Greece to pay back a slice of its loan is 30 June, but a last-minute deal would make it difficult to arrange the logistics of transferring the money.
A separate European Council summit is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, and its agenda is packed.
In theory, if no deal is struck on Monday, there is still a week to get things resolved.
What's behind the crisis?
On Monday, the ECB again increased the amount of emergency credit it allows Greek banks to draw on to remain afloat, and may renew the increase in coming days if necessary, banking officials said.
Greek savers have withdrawn billions of euros in recent days, putting the banking system under intense pressure.
But Greek banks opened as normal on Monday following an emergency loan from the ECB on Friday.
