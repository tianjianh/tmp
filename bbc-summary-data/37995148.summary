Scotland lock Jonny Gray says playing alongside brother Richie can prove an "emotional" experience.

The Gray brothers are likely to make up the second row for Scotland against Argentina on Saturday, two years after starting their first international together against the same opposition.
"During the national anthem when I've got my brother by my side it's pretty emotional," said the younger Gray.
"It's hard to describe and it does make you feel lucky."
He added: "To be involved in the Scotland set-up and have my brother by my side is something I never thought [would happen].
"I'm very lucky that I've always had Rich by my side growing up to see how he's got to that level and how hard he's had to work to get there."
Gray, 22, believes Scotland will face a "world class" Argentina side at Murrayfield on Saturday.

The Scots were edged out 23-22 by Australia last weekend, and Gray says the Pumas pose just as big a threat.
"They are a great team that can attack from anywhere," said the Glasgow Warriors co-captain.
"They've got dangerous strike runners and they're always keeping the ball alive so you can never switch off. I think they're a world-class side."
Argentina have improved markedly since they were admitted to the Rugby Championship in 2013, registering victories over Australia and South Africa in recent years.
Their style has evolved from the traditional Pumas' brand of set-piece, forwards-dominated rugby, and Gray warns they have the weapons to hurt Scotland this weekend.
"When you look at some of the results they've had in the Rugby Championship, and some of the games they've lost to New Zealand, they've pushed them all the way. The brand of rugby they play is very exciting, very threatening, so defensively we have to be switched on.
"I think they are dangerous whether they're home or away. Every time they play they are very physical. We need to be clever in attack. We can't be coughing up ball to them."
