[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Dann's injury-time equaliser gave Crystal Palace their first point of the season against Bournemouth.

The Eagles looked like falling to a third successive defeat before Dann headed home Jason Puncheon's cross to give them a deserved leveller.
Josh King gave the visitors an early lead when he finished well from Harry Arter's pass.
Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye saw a penalty well saved by Artur Boruc in the first half.
Christian Benteke was pulled back on the edge of the area but Cabaye put his spot kick too close to the Polish keeper.
Both teams remain winless in the league this season.
Crystal Palace gave a Premier League debut to £27m-signing Benteke.
The Belgian had scored on his Premier League debuts for both Aston Villa and Liverpool but could not make it a hat-trick on Saturday.
In truth, it was a mixed afternoon for the big striker.
He won the first half penalty and will possibly feel aggrieved that Cabaye refused to let him take it - having asked to do so - before the Frenchman saw his kick saved.
He had little influence thereafter in a first 45 minutes that was dominated by Bournemouth.
Team-mate Damien Delaney said in midweek that Palace "had not signed Lionel Messi" and that Benteke would need good service to thrive.

The Belgian had two chances in the second half. First he headed over after attacking Puncheon's corner with real conviction and then he fired over in the final minutes after bringing the ball down well on the edge of the area.
Fortunately for him Dann, who had been made an auxiliary striker for the final minutes, came to Palace's rescue with a bullet header in the final minute of stoppage time.
Alan Pardew knows it will take Benteke time to adapt to his new team-mates but with just one point and one goal in their first three games he will need his record signing to start firing after the international break.
Former England striker Alan Shearer said on MOTD: "Crystal Palace have to find a way to work out his game and he has to find out what Palace are all about.
"Alan Pardew has spent a lot of money on attacking players and he has to get the best out of them. If they don't then Pardew will be under pressure."
Both teams came into this game desperate for points having lost their opening two games of the Premier League season.
Indeed Palace have won just two league games in the whole of 2016, while the Cherries are now winless in their last eight league matches.
Bournemouth had the better of the opening 45 minutes and possibly should have led by more at the break, with Callum Wilson guilty of a poor finish after being played in by goalscorer King.
However, the second half was a totally different case, with Palace piling on the pressure.
Arter cleared a Dann header off the line, Boruc saved magnificently from Lee Chung-yong and Connor Wickham smashed over when well-placed as the Eagles threw everything at the visitors.
It looked like Eddie Howe's men were going to hold out but ultimately a quality ball from Puncheon proved to be their undoing.

Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "Justice was my overriding emotion when we equalised because we had an unbelievable amount of pressure in the second half.
"If our fans had gone home at half time then I couldn't have blamed them but they stuck with us and kept us going.
"I think the signs are there for us with Christian (Benteke). It was a promising debut from him."
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: "They're such a strong physical team and it's very difficult to stop the direct play.
"We ended up sinking very deep to try and protect what we had and that wasn't our wish but psychologically I think it's very hard to reverse that."
Crystal Palace travel to Middlesbrough after the international break while Bournemouth host West Brom.
