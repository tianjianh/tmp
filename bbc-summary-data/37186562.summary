Community in Strontian plans to build its own school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community in the west Highlands has proposed building its own school to replace an ageing primary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new building in Strontian would be designed in such a way that it could easily be converted into three terraced houses, or another community facility.
This conversion would happen if, in the future, Highland Council went ahead with its plan to relocate the primary to a nearby secondary school.
Highland councillors have described the community's plan as "innovative".
The local authority's education, children and adult services committee has agreed to recommend that the council relocate the primary to the community-built school on land close to Ardnamurchan High School.
The plan is dependent on Strontian Community School Building Ltd realising its ambition to fund and develop the project to replace the mid-1970s primary school building.
Education committee chairman Drew Millar said: "The community of Strontian have come forward with very innovative proposals that could allow them to own their school which would be a community asset that is leased back to Highland Council to provide primary education in the area.
"There has been a huge amount of work done so far on this proposal by council officers with the community and local members; this is a very good news story for both the council and the community."
