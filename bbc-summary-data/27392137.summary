Study into East Yorkshire's coastal sea defences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A study of the sea defences along two stretches of the East Yorkshire coastline affected by coastal erosion is to be carried out by the council.

It wants to look at defences from Hornsea to Mappleton and south of Withernsea because of eroding cliffs.
The defences had become "increasingly difficult to maintain and the cliffs would threaten housing and roads in the near future", the council said.
Though no properties were at "imminent danger", the local authority added.
Councillor Chris Matthews, portfolio holder for infrastructure, highways and emergency planning at the council, said: "The East Riding coast has a high rate of coastal erosion.
"Hopefully the results will identify a way forward.
"It may be that we need to have a managed retreat.
"We don't perceive there to be any imminent danger at the moment, but hopefully the study will give us some better information and we'll be able to plan for the future."
A public consultation into the study is scheduled for the summer, but dates are yet to be announced by the local authority.
