Swansea parking fines refund over 'too short' sign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of motorists in Swansea will have their parking fines refunded because a warning sign was less than 3in (7cm) short of the legal height.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 320 tickets have been issued to drivers who parked in a loading bay in Burrows Place near Swansea museum since September.
Swansea councillor Sybil Crouch challenged the legality of the sign after receiving a Â£70 fine.
The council apologised and said all penalty notices would be paid back.
Ms Crouch, who represents the Castle ward, complained about the penalty charge after not seeing any of the "usual" warning signs at the site.
She said: "Having robustly challenged the adequacy of the sign, the council has finally conceded that it is not correct and they have ceased enforcing in this location until it is changed.
"I have also asked that all 320 recipients of a notice for this area be refunded as the sign has never been valid.
"Motorists are confused and misled into believing this is available for parking - evidenced by the fact that a staggering 320 tickets have been issued over a nine-month period in what is a very small area."
Swansea council said it would write to motorists to arrange reimbursement.
