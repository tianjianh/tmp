"I have the all clear as regards my prostate cancer," he said "That has been the case for quite a time now."
The 80-year-old former chat show host revealed he was receiving radiotherapy for the condition in 2013.
Two years on, he said he still needed to have regular tests and have the "occasional" blood transfusion.
The transfusions, he told the BBC, are "to deal with a problem with anaemia which I have always had and which was exacerbated by the radiotherapy.
"Hopefully the gap between transfusions will get longer and maybe finally disappear altogether," he went on.
"Otherwise I am feeling well and still have the odd gentle workout."
BBC News asked Sir Michael for an update on his condition after he was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying his doctors had "got rid of the cancer".
The broadcaster, known to many as Parky, was diagnosed after a routine health check in May 2013 but said at the time he would be "around for a while yet".
Sir Michael's television career spanned 50 years and saw him interview high-profile guests such as Muhammad Ali and Sir Elton John. He announced his retirement in 2007.
