Locomotion, the National Railway Museum at Shildon, is playing host to a number of guest steam locomotives from around the UK to mark the occasion over the weekend.
When it opened, visitor expectations were set at about 60,000 a year, but a decade on it attracts more than 200,000 people annually.
The museum says it brings an estimated Â£3.5m a year into the local economy.
Pam Porter, from the museum, said: "We definitely make a positive impact in the local area.
"We [have] a very vibrant and busy volunteering programme, and we try to offer training opportunities as well with placements and apprenticeships.
"There's always something here for everybody."
