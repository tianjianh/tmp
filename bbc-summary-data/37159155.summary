Officers were called to "an altercation" in Hunts Cross Shopping Park in Liverpool at about 17:30 BST.
The injured man was stabbed in the chest and is in a serious condition in hospital.
A 38-year-old man from Wavertree has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a 26-year-old woman on suspicion of assisting an offender.
Detectives are examining CCTV footage and the area has been cordoned off.
A sword has been seized, police said.
Det Insp Steve Christian said: "The shopping park around Asda and United Carpets would have been busy at this time of day as people shopped after work and I would urge anyone who has any information which could help us find those responsible to come forward as soon as possible."
