Kilmarnock edged out League Two outfit Clyde 2-1 to go top of Scottish League Cup Group H.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
League One side Albion Rovers drew 0-0 with Greenock Morton in the other group game, but the Championship side took the bonus point after penalties.
Killie goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald saved a penalty from Scott Linton before summer signing Souleymane Coulibaly put the Premiership side ahead.
Will Boyle added the second before Jamie Watson pulled a goal back.
Boyle, the defender on loan from Huddersfield Town, had an eventful debut in Cumbernauld, conceding the penalty with a hand ball before extending Killie's lead.
It means Kilmarnock lead Morton by a point after the opening group games.
The Greenock side took the bonus point in Coatbridge, introduced for the first time this season, with a 5-3 win on penalties.
Clyde manager Barry Ferguson: "We should have won the game. I thought we were the better team.
"After we missed the penalty, we felt a bit sorry for ourselves, but I thought overall we were the better team."
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "We're happy we've won the game and there were some good individual performances, but we're quite disappointed with our overall performance.
"We know there is lots to build on. We have to be better without the ball."
"One or two of the new players have hit the ground quicker than others. They just have to dig in and get it right."
