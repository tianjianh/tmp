What do the world's media make of London 2012?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sports sections of the world's media have, for the past two weeks, been preoccupied with one story - London's Olympic Games.

But what do those actually covering the Games for papers and media organisations around the world think of the event? BBC asks a selection for their views.
Defining image
The opening ceremony and the way it told Britain's far-reaching story was very striking and moving; the storytelling was unique and nuanced, and showed many sides of the British story.
Jessica Ennis probably tops the list of athletes who have impressed me and will stick in my memory; she seems to so deeply enjoy her athletic ability and her success in a way that is both confident and disarming without seeming at all egotistical.
Usain Bolt's strides have been just astonishing to watch, and of course what unfolded in the pool for the United States, men and women alike, has been riveting.
London's organisation and approach
My personal experience has been one of complete efficiency and friendliness. I keep reading about how Londoners grumble a lot, but I have to say that I haven't heard any of that.
Compared to other Games
This is my third Olympics in person, and each has its own character. I don't know that any of them are comparable. I have been delighted at much of the Olympic architecture, and I think that the Stratford and Hackney Wick neighbourhoods, which have probably been through a great deal these past few years as the Olympics approach, have lent a very distinctive flavour to my experience of these games.
Biggest surprise
I'm not sure it's a surprise so much, but I have been struck like never before by the multiculturalism here. I'm sure that has been just as present at previous Olympics I've been to, but for some reason I felt it more here.
One would think the ability to get along with others that pervades an Olympic Games might eventually extend itself into the larger world. That's always the hope, at least.
My father, a linguist, felt strongly that if people could communicate better with each other it might help prevent wars. I believe that to be the case, and I think that the Olympics are a pivotal proving ground for his notion.
Defining image
The cheering 80,000 fans who filled up the Olympic Stadium for the athletics events daily. The arena enjoyed a full house during the morning and afternoon sessions. And of course the union jack was one other prominent image.
London's organisation and approach
I'd give them 7/10. They did well for the athletes - security was watertight around them. But they made things difficult for the media at times with their exaggerated demarcation around some other events.
Biggest surprise
Team Great Britain hauled the medals as if their events were fixed! That was a remarkable feat for a nation that seemed buried at the start.
Defining image
For me, there has been nothing better than seeing the British Olympians excel at their home Olympics. Jessica Ennis, Andy Murray and Bradley Wiggins all delivered gold medals under tremendous pressure and the subsequent roars from the crowd were deafening. Sure, Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps cemented their legacies here, but for me, there is nothing better than seeing a host city celebrate the success of one of their own athletes.
London's organisation and approach
This has been a tremendous success, when you consider the fear and hesitation a lot of people felt prior to the games.
The last-minute security shortfall had the government scrambling to call in military support and left people feeling uneasy. But there hasn't been a single incident or legitimate scare and the authorities have done a marvellous job of getting people in and out of venues.
I was certain that I was going to be sitting in traffic or on crowded trains for two weeks, but that hasn't been the case at all. To pull that off in one of the busiest cities in the world is truly remarkable. I'm not sure if New York, Paris or Tokyo could do this any better.
Compared to other Games
I so like the fact that some of the venues here are only temporary - that way the city isn't stuck with any white elephants or venues that they don't know what to do with down the line. And I think in some previous host cities, that has been a big issue.
Biggest surprise
The weather has been the biggest surprise for me. Coming into London last month, everybody told me to bring my umbrella and winter clothes because the rain had been unbearable for two months in this city. And yet we've only had a few passing showers here and the weather hasn't wreaked havoc on any of the events.
Defining image
Usain Bolt in the 100 metres final - after all the speculation and doubts about his fitness and form he defeated the fastest field in history, set the second fastest time ever and confirmed beyond doubt that he is the greatest sprinter of all time.
London's organisation and approach
Exceeded all expectations. There were genuine and well-founded doubts about transport and security: the first has been fine, at least as far as accredited Olympic personnel are concerned; the second we won't know until after the closing ceremony but the security seems to have been efficient without being overbearing.
Compared to other Games
It's my seventh summer Olympics, and I would rank it in the top three along with Barcelona and Sydney. I was discussing the very same topic with the Sports Illustrated Olympic guy yesterday who's done 15 summer and winter Games and he's of the same opinion - although he would also put the Lillehammer winter Games up there.
Biggest surprise
How well it's all gone really - lucky with the weather after such a dreadful summer but the rest is down to organisation and the amazing public support. That in itself is not such a surprise - the British love grumbling before big events but they then embrace them and they do know their sport. As well they should because they invented most of them.
Defining image
The opening ceremony, of course. It was great, and this is the best ceremony I've ever seen. In addition to this, a lot of friendly smiles. And, of course, volunteers who coped brilliantly with their work.
London's organisation and approach
Organisation was at a high level, but it's not been without problems. The main thing has been the transport.
The buses for press have been late - some had to wait for an hour and a half or two hours, which is not acceptable. It should be noted, though, that there has been excellent security and volunteers.
Compared to other Games
At the moment, Beijing is still in first place for the organisation and the Olympic Games, but in general London has organised a Games to be proud of.
One of the downsides is that there are long distances between some of the the Olympic venues.
