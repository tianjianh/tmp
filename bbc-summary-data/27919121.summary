The museum will use music, instruments, costumes and film to chart her 21 years as a solo artist.
The "full-scale" installation will feature a "narrative" co-written by the performer and will culminate in an "immersive music and film experience".
The exhibition - organised by Klaus Biesenbach, MoMA's chief curator at large - runs from 7 March to 7 June.
"Bjork is an extraordinarily innovative artist whose contributions to contemporary music, video, film, fashion and art have had a major impact on her generation worldwide," said Biesenbach in a statement.
"This highly experimental exhibition offers visitors a direct experience of her hugely collaborative body of work."
Born Bjork Gudmundsdottir in 1965, the singer first found fame as a member of the Sugarcubes before embarking on a solo career.
The 48-year-old has released seven full-length albums, among them Debut (1993), Homogenic (1997) and her most recent release, Biophilia (2011).
Her other work includes the 2000 film Dancer in the Dark, for which she won a best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.
In 2012 the mother of two revealed she had successful surgery to remove a polyp on her vocal cords.
