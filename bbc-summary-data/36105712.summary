Peter Houston says his Falkirk team will have to collect full points from their final two league matches if they are to finish second in the table.

Hibernian closed the gap on the Bairns to just three points after their win over Rangers but have played a game more than Falkirk.
"We know that we have got to win the two matches," Houston said ahead of the Championship game against Raith Rovers.
"If we win our two games we are in with a good shout of finishing second."
Falkirk, who host Greenock Morton the following weekend, also hold a seven-goal advantage over Hibs but Houston says Alan Stubbs' side can wipe out that cushion.
"Hibs are capable on their day of changing that very quickly," explained Houston. "We will know where we are [in the league] perhaps this time next week, what we have to do."
Falkirk travel to to face Raith on Saturday evening, with the Kirkcaldy side the third Championship team involved in the battle for promotion to the Premiership via the play-offs.
Houston insists Ray McKinnon's side are the ones to avoid playing in the first play-off tie, which will feature the teams finishing third and fourth.
Raith are unbeaten in their last 10 games and have lost only one game since the middle of February.
"What ourselves and Hibs are trying to do is make sure we are not playing against Raith Rovers who are the form team," added Houston.
"We go there on Saturday for a very tough game knowing that we need the three points. Rovers will want to continue their excellent run so it's going to be a really tough match."
