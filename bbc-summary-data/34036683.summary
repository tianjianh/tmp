The Daily Telegraph's Kristi Miller told Australian media she was pushed and verbally abused while taking pictures of Gibson and his girlfriend.
She alleges Gibson's tirade ended when his partner, 24-year-old US equestrian vaulter Rosalind Ross, intervened.
"I thought he was going to punch me in the face," Ms Miller said. "He was spitting in my face as he was yelling."
Police confirmed they are investigating reports a female photographer was pushed outside a cinema on Sunday night.
"About 6.20 last night a man became involved in an altercation with a photographer outside a cinema on Oxford Street Paddington and allegedly pushed the female photographer," a police spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
"Police from the Surry Hills local area command are investigating the incident and urge anyone with information to come forward."
There has been no comment from Mel GIbson.
