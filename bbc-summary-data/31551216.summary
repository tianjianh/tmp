Spare a thought for Bobbie Beale, the one in California

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Poor Bobbie Beale. She thought it was just an ordinary day, but Twitter felt differently.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old student from California was in class when she started getting tweets calling her a murderer.
It started off small. She says she got about three tweets asking her why she killed someone called Lucy.
"I was pretty confused because I thought it was talking about my dog, because my dog's name is Lucy."
So after a couple of very confused tweets from her, she said "it just pretty much blew up".
She says: "I got over 1500 new followers. My tweet got 15,000 re-tweets."
Then she decided to take control of the situation in a very 21st Century way.
By posting up a selfie.
"It was just crazy. I was in class and my phone died because of how many notifications I was getting," she told BBC Radio 5 Live.
She says she's never seen EastEnders. Or as she thinks it's called "EastLanders".
But she's very clear about one point.
She says: "I definitely didn't kill my sister, and I definitely didn't kill my dog."
