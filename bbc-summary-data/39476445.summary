The Indian Twittersphere exploded after Sindhu beat Marin 21-19, 21-16 to take the India Open Super Series tournament in Delhi on Sunday night.
The hashtags #SindhuVsMarin and #Sindhu were trending on Sunday and Monday.
Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan were among those who congratulated her.
Spain's Marin beat Sindhu to the gold medal in the Olympic badminton singles final in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
The celebration over Sindhu's victory is also significant as it shows the growing popularity of badminton in a country that famously worships cricket alone.
But Sindhu, and Saina Nehwal before her, have been instrumental in bringing badminton to the forefront of public consciousness.
Nehwal won a bronze medal at the London Olympics.
Most tweets on Sunday and Monday talked about Sindhu getting "revenge" for her Olympic defeat to Marin, while others praised her fierce game.
The player later took to Instagram to thank her fans and sponsors for her support. She also told the Times of India newspaper that she was happy with her performance as there were no "easy" points.
