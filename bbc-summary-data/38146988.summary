[SN]TITLE[SN]
Piano teacher Phillip Fawcett wrote 'sickening' child abuse stories

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A piano teacher who uploaded "sickening" stories about child abuse after viewing indecent images of children has been sentenced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phillip Fawcett, 48, from Lancaster had worked as a piano teacher for 25 years, teaching pupils in their own homes.
He admitted at Preston Crown Court to storing hundreds of child abuse images and posting on a paedophile website.
The married father-of-two was given a three-year community order and banned from working with children.
Sentencing, Recorder Guy Mathieson told Fawcett he had written a number of "sickening articles, extolling the virtues of paedophilia".
"You delighted, it seems, in discussing your desires and expressing your desires in this way on the internet with other likeminded individuals, with whom you discussed your depravity, legitimising, encouraging and involving this behaviour in others and yourself - and the abuse of children.
"Part of the horror of this case is that whilst you were leading this secret life, revelling in the delights of abusing children, you were going into people's homes to teach their children music."
Lancashire Police officers raided Fawcett's home on 28 January seizing a laptop and a number of memory sticks containing hundreds of prohibited images of children aged between five and 15.
The court heard he used the images as inspiration for the stories and poems of around 1,500 words each that he uploaded to a paedophile's website.
Following his arrest, Fawcett admitted he had been using the website since 2012 and had been sexually attracted to children for the last decade.
Fawcett pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images, one of possessing indecent images, one of possessing prohibited images and six counts of publishing obscene material.
He was given a three-year community order, ordered to complete a 60 day sex offenders' rehabilitation program and must sign the sex offenders' register for five years.
