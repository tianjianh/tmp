[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend carried out a campaign of stalking and abuse before the killing, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewes Crown Court was told about the number of times Sussex Police were in contact with Michael Lane in the months leading up to the death of Shana Grice.
In August 2016, the 19-year-old's body was discovered with her throat slit in her bedroom, in Portslade, East Sussex, which had been torched.
Mr Lane, 27, denies murder.
The prosecution alleges Mr Lane became "obsessed" with the teenager and killed her when she renewed a relationship with her former boyfriend, Ashley Cooke.
Police contact with the accused:
The jury has watched taped interviews with the Mr Lane recorded on 26 August. When asked by an officer in an interrogation room  "What happened to Shana?" Mr Lane said '"I don't know."
"All I know is what I've been told here," he added.
The trial continues.
