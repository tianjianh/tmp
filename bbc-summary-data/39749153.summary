Police believe Jerry Ablorh, 41, from Thornton Heath, may have more victims who have not come forward.
He was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court on Friday, after being found guilty of rape and two counts of sexual assault by penetration.
His young victim "sobbed throughout" as she relived her ordeal in court, police said.
Detectives believe Ablorh knew an investigation against him had been launched and "went to ground".
Several raids at addresses linked to him were unsuccessful, however he was eventually detained after being spotted outside a church in Croydon on New Year's Eve.
Laura Davis, of the Met Police's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, described Ablorh's crimes as "despicable".
"He singled out the victim before launching his attack," she said.
"It was clearly the most horrible and terrifying experience for her, a girl of just five years old," she added.
