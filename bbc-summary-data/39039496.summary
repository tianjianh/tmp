Public vote on first heroine to enter Hall of Heroes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Hall of Heroes at The National Wallace Monument honours the legends of Scotland's history.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is home to 16 grand busts of figureheads like Robert Burns and John Knox - people who are recognised for helping to shape the history of their country.
But not one of them is a woman.
Now, for the first time in more than 100 years, a new bust is set to be added to the collection - and this time it will be a heroine.
A list of more than 200 remarkable women has been whittled down to a shortlist of 14 by a female-only selection panel.
It will be up to the public to vote for their preferred choice in an online poll.
Among the women on the selection panel was the chairwoman of Stirling District Tourism, Zillah Jamieson.
She said: "These historic female figures have been chosen because they have shaped Scotland's history and surprised, delighted and inspired generation after generation with their determination, fortitude and spirit - the very values which William Wallace stood for.
"Some have exhibited selflessness or personal commitment to social improvement and others were leaders in their fields, achieving worldwide recognition but all are worthy of a place in the Hall of Heroes among legends such as King Robert the Bruce, Sir Walter Scott and John Knox."
Here is a run down of the women on the shortlist.
Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh (1864-1933)
The wife of Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a naturally gifted and innovative artist in her own right.
Her design work was one of the defining features of the "Glasgow style" during the 1890s, and Charles himself said he owed much of his success to his wife.

Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (1821-1898)
Màiri Mhòr nan Òran - Big Mary of the Songs - was one of the most prolific Gaelic poets of the 19th century.
