Ewart Shadoff, who had shared the lead after day one, is now tied for 11th after the third round at Carlsbad's Aviara Golf Club.
The 28-year-old, who is ranked 215th in the world, carded a one-under-par 71 to go to seven under for the tournament.
New Zealand's Ko shot a bogey-free 67 to lead on 14 under.
Australia's Minjee Lee scored only the second hole-in-one on a par four in LPGA history, when her five wood tee shot rolled in on the 275-yard 16th.
Ewart Shadoff, from Northallerton, last achieved a top-10 finish in September 2014, coming fifth at the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic in Alabama.
England's Felicity Johnson (-4), Holly Clyburn (-3), Charley Hull (+2) and Scotland's Catriona Matthew (-2) all made the cut, but England's Laura Davies missed out on five over.
