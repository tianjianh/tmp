"David Bowie, he would be a very good one," he told the audience at a screening of the first two episodes of series nine in Cardiff.
He added he would also like to see Rolling Stones guitarist Richards stumbling around the Tardis, knocking out a few chords."
The new series starts on 19 September.
The trailer includes a clip of Capaldi - a new wave and rock and roll fan - playing the electric guitar, a scene the actor said he was "delighted" to find in the script.
"I think I'd sort of half mentioned it in joking, but I was really delighted that these guys went for it as an idea," he said.
"It was a great day when I went to pick the Doctor's guitar. We went to Denmark Street [in London] and went into various vintage guitar shops, looking for Doctor Who's guitar.
"I first thought it should be like a Stratocaster or a Telecaster, one of those old classic guitars, but they all started to look like I was having a mid-life crisis."
Doctor Who has played host to many high-profile guest stars over the years including Simon Pegg, Carey Mulligan, and John Hurt. This series will see guest actors including Maisie Williams and Michelle Gomez.
Executive producer Steven Moffat has said he hopes the series will continue forever.
"I think Doctor Who is permanent," he told BBC Wales.
"I think it's part of our culture now - I think like Robin Hood, King Arthur, James Bond, the things that are eternal, there will always be a Doctor for every generation. Long may it continue."
Asked whether he would want to broadcast a live episode of Doctor Who, Moffat told the audience he "wouldn't do it" and he would "run like hell" if TV bosses proposed one.
Capaldi said he had not understood how much his life would change after accepting the part of the Doctor, and admitted he struggled to satisfy fans' demands for selfies.
He said he "always feels bad" if there is not enough time to pose for every photo, but admitted the attention was "very nice, you've got to do as much as you can."
"It's a pretty amazing position to be in," he said. "It's lovely to feel the affection that people have for the show."
In the first episode of the new series, the Doctor and Clara are faced with a city of Daleks while fellow time-traveller Missy returns to plague the pair.
The new series of Doctor Who was filmed at the BBC's Roath Lock drama studios in Cardiff Bay and on location in Tenerife, while Welsh locations were also used including sites in Caerwent, Caerphilly Castle, Cardiff Castle, St Athan and Margam Park.
