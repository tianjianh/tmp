[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steve Smith made an unbeaten century for Australia on the opening day of their first Test against Pakistan.

Captain Smith was lucky on 97, as he nicked a Mohammad Amir delivery to the wicketkeeper - which showed on the decision review system - but Pakistan's players did not appeal.
Smith's 110 not out, together with opener Matthew Renshaw's 71, helped Australia to 288-3 at the close.
The 26,434 crowd was a record for day one of a non-Ashes Test in Brisbane.
