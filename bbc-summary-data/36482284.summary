Christian Benteke: Liverpool's Belgium striker says he will consider future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool striker Christian Benteke says he will have to consider leaving the club if manager Jurgen Klopp continues to leave him out next season.

Benteke, 25, was signed by former Reds boss Brendan Rodgers for Â£32.5m, but started just eight league games after German Klopp was appointed in October.
"I still have a contract at Liverpool and I'd like to stay there, if I remain in the coach's plans," he said.
"If that's not the case, it will become difficult to stay."
The Belgium striker, who is currently preparing for Euro 2016 in France, added: "When Klopp arrived I saw that I wasn't in his plans. That was frustrating because I knew that during my first season at Aston Villa he wanted me.
"But we had several discussions together - I respect and I understand his decisions. I'll think about if after the Euros."
