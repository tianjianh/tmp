The paceman ripped through the hosts' top order to reduce them to 145-7, despite Michael Lumb's battling 39.
Skipper Chris Read (70 not out) led a Notts fightback, helping them add 100 for the final three wickets before they were all out for 245, a deficit of 74.
By the close, Jimmy Adams' 68 not out helped Hampshire move to 106-1 in their second innings, 180 ahead.
The two sides occupy the bottom two places in County Championship Division One and both desperately need a victory as they bid to avoid the drop.
