Rachel Slater and Tim Newton were buried side by side in Glen Nevis near the slopes of Britain's highest mountain.
Members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, who had spent hundreds of hours looking for the couple, joined mourners at the service in Fort William.
The bodies of Ms Slater, 24 and her boyfriend Tim Newton, 27 - both from Bradford - were found on 23 March.
They had been buried by snow on the north face of the mountain.
The couple had been missing for more than five weeks and it is believed they were hit by the avalanche before they began their ascent.
