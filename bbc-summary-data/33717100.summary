This year's Tough Mann Adventure Challenge, held at Ballamoar Farm, features 25 obstacles including muddy bogs, rope scrambles and monkey bars.
Co-organiser Richie Cryer said it is a "real challenge just to complete the gruelling course".
The event will get under way at 13:00 BST.
Competitors will have to climb 1,000ft (300m) in the first 2km of the course on a climb known as "killer hill."
The obstacles also include more than six tonnes of ice.
Mr Cryer added: "The obstacle course has been designed to test physical strength and mental courage."
