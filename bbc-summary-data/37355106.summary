Daniel Dias took gold in the 50m freestyle on Monday in the S5 category.
He raced against and defeated the man who first inspired him to become a Paralympic swimmer.
After winning, he thanked his family for their support and told a TV channel: "We are made of dreams in life. If we stop dreaming, we die."
Mr Dias, 28, has won 20 medals - 12 gold, six silver and two bronze - over the course of his career to date.
He has won over crowds in the stadium, who cheered loudly for him, as well as online.
His father told the BBC he had "no words to describe the joy" of seeing his son take gold in his home country.
Paolo Dias said his son is "very focused and determined" and his success is "the result of dedication and concentration".
The S5 category is for swimmers with a short stature and an additional impairment. Mr Dias was born with no feet or hands.
He finished ahead of Clodoaldo Silva, a veteran Brazilian Paralympic swimmer who first inspired him to swim. He has said that before he saw Mr Silva swim at the 2011 Paralympic Games in Athens, he never knew people with his disabilities could do "any kind of sport".
On being compared to his other idol, the famous US Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Mr Dias said: "I am very happy to be compared to such an amazing athlete, but I am Daniel Dias. I want to do the best for Paralympic sports."
"Medals are consequences of good work," he said. "I never promise medals. I believe it is a consequence of my good work in the water."
The most-decorated Paralympian of all time is Trischa Zorn, a blind swimmer with 55 medals to her name.
