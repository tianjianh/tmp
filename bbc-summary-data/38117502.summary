Storm-hit trees given new lease of life as furniture

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trees that were blown down during a windstorm that struck the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) have been given new life as furniture.

The furniture was hand-crafted from trees destroyed when Cyclone Andrea struck in January 2012, with winds exceeding 100mph.
RBGE lost 34 trees and hundreds of plants in the storm.
It also caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage to buildings and glasshouses.
Now, nearly five years later, RBGE is to commemorate the dramatic event with a ground-breaking exhibition.
After the Storm, which opens on 3 December and runs until May, will include 14 unique tables, chairs, desks, cabinets and other items made from wood from the lost trees.
Ian Edwards, head of exhibitions and events at RBGE, said: "After the Storm will consider the legacy of the dramatic 'once-in-a-lifetime' event and its effect on the landscape.
"Dozens of trees were blown down in the garden. It was a pretty devastated site, but there is a silver lining to every storm.
"Some of those trees were suitable for making into furniture. Now we have given them a new lease of life.
"We're trying to show the positive effects of storms in encouraging regeneration and building up resilience."
Cyclone Andrea brought with it the strongest winds for a generation.
The storm left trees uprooted as well as damage to the Montane and Wet Tropics Glasshouses and the plants inside.
It took two years to hatch a plan to transform the logs into furniture.
The furniture has been hand-crafted by designer-makers in workshops all over Scotland, from the Borders to the Highlands, on the themes of rejuvenation and regrowth.
Craftsmen were selected with the support of the Scottish Furniture Makers' Association (SFMA) and the Forestry Commission, which has an interest in promoting the sustainable use of Scotland's hardwood timber.
Many of the pieces will be available for sale at the exhibition, as will a range of smaller items made from the wood, such as bowls and clocks.
Mr Edwards added: "The pieces demonstrate the masterly skills of Scotland's best craftsmen and highlight the beauty that can be found in disaster.
"They all reflect the theme in a different way. There is a personal story attached to each one."
The first exhibition of furniture, photographs and drawings will open in the John Hope Gateway, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, on 3 December and will run until 26 May 2017.
The furniture has been photographed standing in the spots where the original trees stood.
