Colin Graves was right about inquiry, says Matthew Hoggard

Colin Graves was right to suggest there would be an inquiry if England did not win in the West Indies, says former fast bowler Matthew Hoggard.

The incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman made the comments before the tour, which ended with England drawing the three-Test series 1-1.
"It was a big, bold statement from Colin Graves," said Hoggard. "But it was not that far away from the truth.
"England would have expected to beat the West Indies."
Hoggard added: "I fully expect whoever comes in as director of cricket to lead that inquiry as the chairman wants. It'll be interesting to see the fallout from it."

Graves said the current West Indies team were "mediocre", and the hosts suggested those comments were a source of motivation to win the third Test in Barbados last weekend.
England skipper Alastair Cook said Graves had provided West Indies with a team-talk, but Hoggard, 38, disagreed: "You can't hide behind an incoming chairman's comments."
The first Test in Antigua was drawn, with England winning the second in Grenada by nine wickets.
However, they were bowled out for 123 in their second innings of the third Test and Darren Bravo led West Indies to only their second Test win over England in 29 attempts.
"I don't think we're a million miles away... but to say we had a good series is a little bit optimistic," added Hoggard, who took 248 wickets in 67 Tests.
"Alastair Cook is scoring some runs; James Anderson is going from strength to strength; Joe Root and Gary Ballance continue improving.
"There are some good signs to have come out of the West Indies, but there's a lot of improvement to go."
