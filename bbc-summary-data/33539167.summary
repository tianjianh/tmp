In pictures: Crabb's first year as Welsh secretary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stephen Crabb marks his first anniversary as Welsh secretary in David Cameron's cabinet. It's been a year of continuing tensions with the Labour government in Cardiff and a general election in which the Conservatives made gains in Wales.  Here we look back at his year in pictures.

Stephen Crabb in Downing Street on 15 July 2014, the day he was promoted from junior Wales Office minister to Welsh secretary.  Political anoraks were excited by his appointment as the first bearded Tory cabinet minister since 1905.
The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP tried to strike a more pragmatic and consensual tone than his predecessor David Jones but Welsh Labour's First Minister Carwyn Jones said the UK government under-funded Wales.
In September, Mr Crabb played his part as Wales welcomed world leaders including US President Barack Obama for the NATO summit in Newport, and here at an official dinner in Cardiff Castle.
He was named ITV Wales Welsh Politician of the Year in December. The judges said he had revitalised Welsh political debate in the aftermath of the Scottish referendum. His prize? A Mumph cartoon of himself.
A veteran of the annual friendly rugby match between Parliament and the assembly, Mr Crabb's first appearance in the fixture as a cabinet minister in February was cut short as he went off with an injured hand.  There was "nothing friendly about the tackling", he quipped.
The injured hand was still plastered up at the end of February as Mr Crabb welcomed the media to a joint press conference by David Cameron and Nick Clegg at the Millennium Stadium to announce further devolution for Wales. It was hailed as the St David's Day agreement, although opposition parties pointed out it wasn't St David's Day and, on many issues, there was no agreement.
In May, he led the Welsh Conservatives to their best general election performance in Wales for 30 years, gaining three seats to return eleven MPs to Westminster, coming second to Labour in the overall Welsh vote.
Re-appointed secretary of state after the Tories' general election victory, the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP made his first ever appearance in the Senedd chamber in June to open the assembly's debate on the Queen's Speech.  He said he hoped that further devolution meant there would be no need for him or any future secretary of state for Wales to address the assembly again.
