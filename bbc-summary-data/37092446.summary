The 24-year-old joined the Pilgrims as a centre-back following his release by Blackburn Rovers, but played as a defensive midfielder in the 1-0 loss at Carlisle on Saturday.
"He was probably the standout performer," Argyle manager Derek Adams said after the defeat.
"He's a winner and I think that him going in there a bit further forward than the back three helped us."
With Latvia international Nauris Bulvitis getting international clearance and able to partner former Crawley skipper Sonny Bradley in the centre of defence, former Cameroon Under-21 international Songo'o was able to be pushed further forward.
"I think he's more than comfortable to play in there," added Adams. "You've got to give us a bit of protection, but going forward we have to create more chances than we're creating."
