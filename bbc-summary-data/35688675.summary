Also at the hearing were representatives of Whirlpool UK Appliances Ltd.
David Lewis, Assistant Coroner for North East Wales and Central, has ordered Whirlpool to supply information on how many TVM tumble dryer models have been produced and sold in the UK and abroad, how many times instances have arisen with a door switch mechanism on that model and how many such instances have involved a Trading Standards body.
