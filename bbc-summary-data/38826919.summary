A man has been jailed for life for murdering a dad-of-three who confronted him over the rape of a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Wheeler stabbed Scott Mackenzie to death and wounded his victim's son at his home in Shotts, North Lanarkshire.
Wheeler, 33, was convicted of rape, murder and attempted murder after trial at the High Court in Glasgow.
He was ordered to serve at least 22 years behind bars.
The court heard that Wheeler plied the young schoolgirl with alcohol before raping her.
She later revealed what had happened to her, and Mr Mackenzie and his son Jamie were among those who confronted Wheeler.
Judge Lady Carmichael told Wheeler: "You set in train a series of events of the most awful and tragic nature.
"You stabbed Mr Mackenzie three times. One of the wounds damaged an artery."
The judge said it was "particularly reprehensible" that Wheeler had no insight into the damage he had caused.
Lady Carmichael told him: "You took the life of a hard-working, much-loved husband and father and deprived his grandchild of ever knowing him."
Delivery driver Mr Mackenzie, 41, had been enjoying a summer evening with family and friends after a barbecue when he heard of the sex attack on the teenager.
He and son Jamie, 20, went to near-neighbour Wheeler's home to confront him and both men were stabbed.
Wheeler then went to the Mackenzies' family home with a blood-stained knife and threatened to kill Mr Mackenzie's wife Tracy.
A teenage witness said it was as though Wheeler "was possessed".
The incident ended when police officers arrived and used pepper spray to subdue Wheeler.
Wheeler was found guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl at his home in Inverkip Drive, Shotts, on 5 June after supplying her with alcoholic drinks.
He was also found guilty of murdering Mr Mackenzie and attempting to murder his son Jamie at his home on the same date.
The court was told that Wheeler's extended family have had to leave the area, but have maintained contact with him.
Wheeler showed no emotion as he was led away to begin his sentence.
