Marx, 18, made his first team debut against Barrow in March 2017 having spent a loan spell Sutton Coldfield Town earlier in the season.
Ex-Wales Under-21 keeper Dibble is the son of former Wales, Manchester City and Wrexham custodian Andy Dibble.
Both players have signed one-years deals.
Dibble, 23, started his career at Bury and has had spells at Barnsley, Chelmsford, Boston United and Nuneaton.
"He's someone I've known for a long time, from when he was a young man at Peterborough, with his dad Andy playing there," Wrexham manager Dean Keates said.
