Thomas, 22, scored nine goals in 34 appearances this season as Pools suffered relegation from League Two.
Blades boss Chris Wilder told the club website: "Nathan is someone we have tracked for a long time and is a talented young player."
Meanwhile, midfielder Jay O'Shea has rejected Sheffield United's contract offer and left the club.
The 28-year-old joined the Blades on loan until the end of the season in January from Chesterfield and helped them to the League One title.
He scored three goals in 10 appearances for the Bramall Lane side.
