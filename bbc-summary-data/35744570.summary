Unfortunate timing for skiing holiday?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The timing of this royal winter break could be viewed as rather unfortunate.

It comes after Prince William has been accused by some newspapers of shirking royal engagements, with the Sun demanding: "Where's Willy?"
The answer, for a few days last week, was the French Alps with his children and his wife.
The pictures will delight those who support the royals and who are avid consumers of images of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Such people will argue that everyone is entitled to downtime.
William's critics will continue to question whether he's reluctant to fully embrace his destiny. They insist he could do more in support of his soon-to-be 90-year-old grandmother, the Queen.
Defenders of the future king stress that he combines his work as a royal with his job as an air ambulance pilot and his role as a father.
