An unattended package investigated by an army bomb disposal team outside Redford Barracks in Edinburgh posed no threat to the public, police confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The item was deemed safe at 12:30, nearly two hours after after the bomb disposal team was called in.
Police are appealing for anyone who saw a man acting suspiciously in Colinton Road at about 10:30 to contact them.
The section between Patie's Road and Redford Road has been closed for several hours.
The road will be reopened once it has been recovered.
Earlier, a man was seen acting suspiciously in the area.
He was described as white, in his 50s, tall and of heavy build with short brown hair.
His appearance was dishevelled and he was wearing light-coloured clothing, possibly green or beige.
Insp Graeme Dignan, of Police Scotland, said: "This item was not a threat and there was no danger to the public at any time.
"I would like to thank people in the area for their patience whilst this situation was brought to a safe conclusion.
"We are now investigating how the item came to be left outside the barracks, and want to speak to anyone who was in the Colinton/Craiglockhart/Colinton Mains areas this morning and may have seen the man described or has any other information that may assist."
