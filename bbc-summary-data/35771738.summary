Fasa substance support charity suspension 'will breed hopelessness', minister says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The suspension of a substance abuse service in Belfast will lead to "hopelessness", a Presbyterian minister has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fasa (Forum for Action on Substance Abuse) faces "the prospect of immediate and terminal financial insolvency".
It is being investigated by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland.
Rev Lesley Carroll said: "It's not sensationalist to say this is disastrous, to say people's lives are at risk.
"The very fact that this has happened breeds hopelessness amongst people."
Fasa provides specialist support for people facing suicide, self-harm, substance abuse and mental health issues, and says it helps more than 2,000 people at five sites in Northern Ireland.
On Wednesday, it said all services were suspended and it was seeking an urgent meeting with its funders and politicians in a bid to "avert the crisis".
Fasa staff in north Belfast broke the news to some people who use its services, many of whom left the building visibly upset.
Father speaks of Fasa closure fears
A father whose child was helped by a substance abuse service facing closure has said lives could be lost as a result.
The man, who spoke anonymously, said his child was now drug free after receiving treatment at Fasa.
"Fasa is the only place my child speaks to, Fasa is the only place my child feels comfortable to speak to.
"You're not treated in there as a number and you're not given a time slot or anything like that.
"They're treated as a child, as a human being and I'm devastated to find out that they're closing down or have problems because they're the only place that has helped my child."
Community workers were distributing leaflets with suicide helpline numbers on them in the neighbourhood, saying they were concerned about where people in distress could go to for help.
Brian Kirker, a community worker in north Belfast, said people were "dumbfounded" after its suspension "came out of the blue".
He said: "Young men have relied on this service, people have told me: 'Without Fasa, I wouldn't be here. We have walked in and Fasa has saved our lives.'
"It will affect the grassroots people, the people who are most vulnerable, the people who need help.
"It's very difficult for those people to come forward - when they do come forward then all of a sudden there's nothing there."
Fasa closure Q&A
Ian McLaughlin, of the Lower Shankhill Community Association in north Belfast, said: "Something should have been put in place in the short term to ensure that those who need help can access it."
Fasa has contracts with government agencies to provide addiction and suicide prevention services.
The Department of Health said it would "be considering the implications and measures that might be taken to ensure the need in these crucial areas can continue".
Sixty people work for Fasa, while 70 volunteers also help it to provide its services.
The Charities Commission said it was "aware of concerns" in relation to Fasa and the organisation was co-operating with the investigation.
