The injured teenager was found on Tagus Street, at the rear of Lodge Lane, Toxteth, at about 20:30 BST on Friday.
Merseyside Police said he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. His family have been informed.
It follows two gun attacks in Seaforth and Fazakerley where two men were hurt in "linked" attacks in their homes.
Both attacks happened within 25 minutes of each other on Thursday.
Armed police attended the Toxteth murder scene.
Chief Inspector Keith McLachlan said: "We are relentless in pursuing those who choose to bring firearms onto the streets of Merseyside.
"I am sure local people will be appalled that this has taken place in daylight hours.
"Information from the community will always be acted on, so help us remove those responsible and their weapons from the streets."
A post-mortem examination is due to take place.
