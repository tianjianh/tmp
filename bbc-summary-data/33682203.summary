Andy Burnham: Labour frightened of its own shadow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has become "frightened of its own shadow" and lacks the courage or capacity for big ideas, leadership hopeful Andy Burnham is to warn.

In a speech later, he will say today's party would not be able to create the National Health Service.
And he will express his disillusionment with its drift away from voters.
His speech - seen as an effort to get back on the front foot in the contest - comes as a poll suggests Labour is less electable now than under Ed Miliband.
Mr Miliband led Labour to its worst electoral defeat since the 1980s, with the party down to 232 seats at the 2015 general election.
His subsequent resignation sparked the leadership contest, with Mr Burnham, Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall all in the running to succeed him.
The popularity of left-winger Mr Corbyn, who only got into the contest because some MPs nominated him to "broaden the debate", has sparked a row within Labour.
Some MPs have called for the contest to be restarted after "hard left" campaigners and Conservative supporters were reported to be backing him, and with one poll suggesting he was on course to win.

In a speech marking the 70th anniversary of the Attlee Labour government, Mr Burnham will sound a warning about the state of the modern day Labour Party.
He will say the anniversary should be "cause for joyous celebration, but I mark it with a sad realisation that the modern Labour Party could not have created the NHS".
"It has become frightened by its own shadow and does not have the courage or capacity to do it," he is to add.
The Leigh MP will also warn against "negativity and dire warnings of 'oblivion'" in response to Mr Corbyn's candidacy, saying that such reactions "mis-read the mood of the moment".
"What our members are telling us is that they are yearning for a different style of politics from Labour and a break with the bad habits of the past.
"They are sick of politicians speaking in soundbites, sticking to the script and looking like they don't believe a word they are saying," he will say.
Mr Burnham will set out five challenges he thinks the party must meet, including on housing, jobs, standards of living, schools and care for the elderly.
He will say of voters: "They are not being given any answers by the identikit politicians appearing on their TV screens. The people haven't drifted away from Labour; Labour has drifted away from them.
"I have lived through this and become increasingly disillusioned.
"We've lost the confidence to think big and provide substantial answers to the modern challenges. We will only win again when we inspire people with our ideas."
It comes as a poll for the Independent newspaper suggests that three quarters of people think Labour is less electable than it was at the general election.
An analysis by the Labour-affiliated Fabian Society says the party must broaden its appeal to Conservative voters, rather than "lurching to the left", if it is to have "any chance" of winning in 2020.
On Monday, Mr Burnham said Labour's policy of allowing people to vote in its leadership contest for a Â£3 fee should be reviewed once the new leader is in place.
He said that while backed the principle of the rule, the party should check it was not "open to abuse".
Mr Corbyn has said he only wants "genuine Labour" backers, after claims Conservative supporters and "hard left" activists have been registering in order to back the left wing MP.
