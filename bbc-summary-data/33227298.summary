[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 29-year-old Ceredigion man has admitted five drug offences after being arrested as part of a UK-wide operation into the dark web.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cei William Owens, of Llanbadarn Fawr, pleaded guilty at Swansea Crown Court to possession of Class A and B drugs and supplying or offering to supply Class A and B drugs.
He was arrested as part of a National Crime Agency operation.
Owens was bailed and will be sentenced on 24 July.
The dark web is sites that do not show up on regular internet searches and is an anonymous, virtually untraceable global network.
Owens was arrested along with five other people from across the UK, including two from Gwynedd.
Owens pleaded guilty to all five charges against him.
A National Crime Agency spokesman said: "Sites on the dark net represent a new variation on old crimes and are dealt with accordingly; the NCA and its international partners use a variety of traditional and innovative techniques to investigate people using the internet for criminal profit."
