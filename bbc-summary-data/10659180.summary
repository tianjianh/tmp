The star fell out of a harness which was supposed to carry her across the crowd, instead being dragged into a barricade.
The concert in Nuremberg was halted as the 30-year-old was taken to hospital to be checked over.
Later, she wrote on Twitter: "Nothing's broken, no fluid in the lungs, just seriously sore."
She also apologised to fans for having to cut short her concert.
"To all my nurnberg fans - I am so so so sorry to end the show that way. I am embarrassed and very sorry. I'm in ambulance now but I will b fine," she wrote.
"Didn't get clipped in2 harness correctly, drug me off stage, fell in2 barricade. Getting xrays. I hope it at least looked cool!!!"
Video footage, shot by a member of the crowd, shows the accident and Pink can be heard saying that it "really hurt".
It also shows her getting back on stage so fans could see she was not seriously injured, but was then taken by ambulance to hospital.
The Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour, which is travelling across Europe, is due to end later this month.
