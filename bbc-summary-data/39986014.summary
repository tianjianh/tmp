Stockdale, 31, played in all but one of the Seagulls' Championship games this season as they finished second.
Fellow keeper Niki Maenpaa, 32, full-back Gaetan Bong, 29, and experienced midfielder Steve Sidwell, 34, have also been offered new deals at the Amex.
Defender Vegard Forren, 29, and striker Chris O'Grady, 31, have been released.
O'Grady spent the whole of the 2016-17 season on loan at Burton Albion, while Norway international centre-back Forren failed to make a first-team appearance after joining in March.
Brighton have also extended 25-year-old midfielder Richie Towell's deal to 2019.
"We hope the four players we have offered new contracts will be with us next season for our first season in the Premier League," manager Chris Hughton told the club website.
Meanwhile, third-choice goalkeeper Casper Ankergren will be offered a new backroom role with the club.
