Point of Ayr Colliery headgear returns as memorial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial to the last deep pit to close in north Wales is being installed to mark a community's industrial past.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The refurbished headgear of Point of Ayr Colliery, near Prestatyn, is being erected alongside the coast road close to Ffynnongroyw, Flintshire.
The colliery closed in 1996 after more than 100 years but there is only a small plaque in the village to show it was once a mining area.
The pit opened in the 1880s and at its peak employed 500 workers.
The memorial is to be officially unveiled in March.
