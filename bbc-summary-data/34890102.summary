East Coast Construction BMW rider Johnston had qualified 10th fastest.
Hickman took over the lead from poleman Martin Jessopp with four laps to go and enjoyed a 6.267 seconds lead over his compatriot at the chequered flag.
Michael Rutter completed the podium positions on another BMW, with Senior TT winner John McGuinness in fourth.
Gary Johnson and Ian Hutchinson made up the top six leaderboard, with Republic of Ireland riders Steve Heneghan and Brian McCormack 14th and 16th respectively.
Hickman, who slid under Jessopp to hit the front at the Lisboa section of the 3.8-mile Guia circuit, had secured his first international road race win in the second Superbike outing at the Ulster Grand Prix in August.
Lincolnshire rider Hickman will compete for the JG Speedfit-backed GB Moto Kawasaki outfit in the British Superbike Championship and international road races in 2016.
