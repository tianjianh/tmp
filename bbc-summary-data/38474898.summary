Bradford City 2-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Marshall and Jordy Hiwula both scored for their second match in a row as Bradford extended their unbeaten run to six games with a home win over Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The result secured their second double of the season and lifts them into fourth place in League One, level on points with Rochdale but above them on goal difference.
Marshall put Bradford in front after 22 minutes when he received the ball on the right from Josh Cullen and cut into the penalty area before scoring with a superb right-foot shot low into the far corner of the net.
Ched Evans twice went close to equalising for Chesterfield. First, he took advantage of a mix-up between Bradford captain Romain Vincelot and fellow defender Nathaniel Knight-Percival before slipping the ball out to Reece Mitchell on the left and then just failing to connect when Mitchell returned the ball into the box.
He then latched on to former Bradford midfielder Gary Liddle's pass only to see his low, right-foot shot rebound off the post.
Marshall and Nicky Law then had shots saved by Ryan Fulton before Bradford doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Cullen's low cross from the right was met by the on-rushing Hiwula, who fired the ball into the net from close range.
Hiwula, Marshall and Law went close to adding to Bradford's lead in the second half as the Bantams maintained their unbeaten home record.
