Unconfirmed media reports say that Chinese troops have entered what India says is its territory near the disputed border.
"Chumar sector in eastern Ladakh remained active with Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) troops involved in tactical manoeuvre with the Indian army to exercise dominance by transgressing the Line of Actual Control (the de facto border)," reports the Hindustan Times.
Papers also report that the army chief, General Dalbir Singh Suhag, has cancelled his Bhutan visit due to the tensions on the border.
"The decision to put off the trip has been taken at a time when, for the last more than 10 days, Chinese troops have been sitting on this side of the Indian boundary in Chumar area of Ladakh," says a report on the First Post website.
Some media outlets say the tensions are likely to "undo" the progress made during Chinese President Xi Jinping's India visit last week.
Mr Xi and PM Narendra Modi had shown a keen interest in improving bilateral ties.
"The great bonhomie generated between Asia's giants at Ahmedabad and New Delhi is withering away in the windswept cold desert of Ladakh," says the India Today website.
Moving on to other stories, Abhinav Bindra, one of India's top Indian shooters, on Tuesday won two bronze medals in the ongoing Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, The Times of India reports.
His good performance comes a day after he announced his retirement from the sport. Bindra on Monday tweeted that the ongoing Asian Games could be his last competitive event.
"Tomorrow will mark the end of my professional shooting life! I will however still shoot, compete as a hobby shooter training twice a week," he tweeted.
And finally, papers are praising India's space agency after the country's maiden mission to Mars "entered the Martian neighbourhood" on Monday.
Launched last November, the spacecraft - known as Mangalyaan - will complete a 300-day journey to reach the orbit on Wednesday.
"If successful, India will become the first country to make it to Mars in its maiden attempt, propelling it to an elite club of space race leaders," the Hindustan Times reports.
