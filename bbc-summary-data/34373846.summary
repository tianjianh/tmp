Stephen Fry reunites with Oscar west Belfast premiere team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Kennedy Centre in west Belfast is an unlikely venue for a movie premiere but in 1997 the red carpet was rolled out for the debut of Wilde, starring Stephen Fry

Eighteen years on, Fry has been reunited with the people who made his visit possible, thanks to a BBC Northern Ireland programme.
Real Lives Reunited revisits poignant moments in local history and brings together people who shared this common bond.
In the first of six episodes, Fry speaks via videolink with some of the organisers of the West Belfast Film Festival, who gathered in the same cinema that hosted the premiere of the movie that told the story of Irish writer Oscar Wilde.
Fry tells the programme that the team behind the film decided that west Belfast was a good place for the film's debut.
"We wanted to have a UK opening that also recognised the Irishness of Oscar," he says.
"I thought that Oscar was a unifying figure enough because he could be regarded as British to some extent and he could certainly be regarded as Irish."
He adds: "I didn't realise that the festival's major film venue was right at the end of the Falls Road, in the Kennedy Centre.
"For a sad little Brit like me, the Falls Road was only ever something that you heard on the news."
Organiser Michele Devlin says that securing the film for the fledgling festival's gala opening was a big coup for them.
"At the time we only had a few thousand pounds in the bank, and everything was running on goodwill," she says.
"We had brass necks and thought 'we can do this'."
Danny Morrison of the festival says they remained nervous right up until the last minute.
"Even though an agent or the person themselves says they're coming, there is always nervousness right up until you see them in the flesh, but he was good to his word - he came, he saw, he gave his time and he conquered," he says.
Before the big event, Fry was treated to some local hospitality in a pub across the road.
"Everybody looked up from their Guinness or whatever, and then one voice said 'welcome to the belly of the pope'," he says.
"I thought, 'I know I've arrived'."
You can see what happened next on Real Lives Reunited, which is on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday at 19:30. It is available to watch afterwards on the iPlayer.
