About 24,000 Welsh fans had tickets to watch Wales beat Slovakia 2-1 in their opening Euro 2016 match and first major tournament in 58 years.
Welsh police officers, who are part of the police operation in France, praised the "great behaviour from our thousands of fans around Bordeaux city centre".
Meanwhile, the Eiffel Tower was lit up in Welsh colours and fans, celebrities and politicians have praised the team.
The police chief heading a group of officers from Wales in France, said earlier the number of police inside the stadium for next Thursday's game between Wales and England game may have to be increased.
Supt Steve Furnham's comments came after England fans were taken to hospital following a series of clashes between football supporters in Marseille.
The violence happened before and after England's 1-1 draw with Russia in their opening fixture.
The UK government has now offered to send more UK police to France ahead of the England v Wales match in Lens, a spokesman said.
And Uefa has released a statement saying Russia and England could be thrown out of Euro 2016 if their fans are involved in more violence.
Mr Furnham, from South Wales Police, said: "We have to respect that this is a French planned tournament and we are here just to support our French colleagues.
"What we'll be keen to do is to give our views and advice and guidance to those organisers in regard to how we think the safety of our fans is best placed.
"That may include options around both the deployment of police officers outside the stadium and also possibly inside the stadium."
Meanwhile reaction to Wales' performance has been pouring in on social media.
The Manic Street Preachers, who recorded the official anthem for Wales' appearance at Euro 2016, Together Stronger (C'mon Wales), tweeted: "The dedication, the skill, the passion, the fans, the players, the glory."
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said: "All hail Bale" following Gareth Bale's goal.
Former Wales rugby international Mike Phillips said: "Huge win, delighted, well done boys," while rugby pundit Jonathan Davies said: "Great day for Wales, let's keep it going."
Former World Champion boxer Joe Calzaghe said it was an "awesome result," while golfer Lee Westwood said: "Well done Wales on winning yesterday. Very good for apparently a one-man team."
First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "Brilliant, what a start," while Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the team had "done the country proud".
Congratulations also came in from football clubs across the country. Cardiff City congratulated Wales for a "fantastic first day at Euro 2016".
Wales' opening scorer Bale described the atmosphere in Bordeaux as being like a "home game".
"Our fans are the best in the world and fully got behind us. We gave them something to celebrate."
Wales manager Chris Coleman was also full of praise for the fans.
Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, he said: "Our supporters keep on topping what they have done - that support today was unbelievable."
In Bordeaux, Nicolas Zimmerman, a barman at the Charles Dickens pub, said Wales fans were now "brothers".
He said there was no trouble, adding the "Wales fans know how to party".
"It was intense," he said. "A lot of Welsh people. There was no trouble.
"With Welsh people we have a really good atmosphere. They are really friendly, they sing a lot. They are really good fans actually."
Alex Alim, assistant manager at the Houses of Parliament pub in Bordeaux was also full of praise for the "amazing atmosphere".
Mr Alim, originally from London, said it was "a big red riot but a very nice one" outside the bar.
