As bagpipes played in the background, thousands of people gathered outside St Mary's RC Church in the Woolton area of Liverpool to say farewell to Cilla Black.

Many rolled back the years to remember her days at the city's world-famous Cavern Club during the Swinging Sixties.
Pat Humphreys knew her from both the Iron Door Club and The Cavern, where the singer worked in the cloakroom before finding fame.
"She was a good laugh," the 70-year-old from Widnes said. "She would tell us to move on if we were in the way.
"You would go in to The Cavern with bouffant hair and come out dripping with sweat."
She added: "Cilla was so down to earth."
Terence O'Hara, 72, a former Beatles roadie, refurbished Cilla's home in Denham, Buckinghamshire.
Years later, while passing the house, he spotted her polishing the brass fittings which he had reglazed.
"She was down to earth," he said. "We had a laugh about the brass."
He said she attended his 21st birthday party at his home in Wellington Road, Liverpool.
He also used to meet Cilla for dinner after she performed at the Palladium in London.
Church bells pealed in the run-up to the service as many people clutched single red roses or white lilies - Cilla's favourite bloom.
There were cheers as a bus passed with Gary Barlow, Tom Jones, Lorraine Chase and Bob Carolgees among the celebrities on board.
Housewife Gillian Melling, 53, from Wigan, has been a Cilla fan since she was four years old and first saw her sing in Blackpool.
"I loved watching her on the telly," she said. "I would have travelled to London for the funeral."
Retired builder Jack Kershaw, 70, from Warrington, who rebuilt Cilla's old school in Bostock Street, said she was a "very different" sort of singer.
"Cilla had a very strong personality and could connect with people," he said.
His wife Glenys, 68, said: "Everyone could relate to her. She was a proper home-loving person."
