The 22-year-old cemented the outside centre position last season and his form saw him play for England's second team in South Africa during the summer.
James has joined hooker Cameron Neild in committing to the club.
"I'm more than delighted to sign with the club moving forward with the players that have signed recently," he told BBC Sport.
"One lucky season like last year doesn't define you as a player so I've got to move on and keep pushing forward."
Director of rugby Steve Diamond added: "I have every confidence he will build on his first full season with us and am sure he will be pushing towards an England call-up in the not too distant future."
