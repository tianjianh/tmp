Michael Turner, 57, drove his van at Frank Buckley, who ended up on the ground before he backed over him, St Albans Crown Court was told.
Mr Turner, of Landau Way, Turnford, Hertfordshire, denies murdering the 51-year-old in the village last June.
He died after suffering multiple injuries including a fractured skull.
Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC told the jury the defendant "deliberately" knocked down Mr Buckley, then ran him over and killed him at 11:30 BST on 26 June.
"It was carried out by a man who was angry and in a temper, possibly he acted in revenge about something that had happened in the course of the confrontation," said Mr Donnellan.
He said there was no doubt Mr Turner intended to seriously hurt or kill Mr Buckley, but it was not believed the killing was planned.
The court heard Mr Buckley died despite the efforts of bystanders, the police, paramedics and a doctor at the scene.
Witnesses told the police they had seen the two men fighting in Groom Road, the same street where Mr Buckley was later struck.
Mr Turner had stopped his VW Caddy van when he saw Mr Buckley walking, the jury was told.
He is then alleged to have returned to his van before driving at Mr Buckley.
The front bumper struck him, knocked him up in the air and then he fell to the ground. The van then allegedly reversed over his head.
Afterwards the vehicle was driven around a roundabout and sped off.
Mr Turner, who drove to a hospital, told police Mr Buckley had sprayed fluid into his eyes and he had been "frightened" of him.
