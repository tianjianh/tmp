[SN]TITLE[SN]
Firearms officer Nadeem Saddique wins discrimination case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A firearms officer who guarded Tony Blair and members of the Royal family was victimised because he is Asian, an employment tribunal has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Nadeem Saddique, from Stockton, Teesside, alleged he was forced out of Cleveland Police's firearms unit and resented by colleagues.
The tribunal concluded "the majority of his claims were well founded".
The force's chief constable said the judgment would be "quickly and carefully considered".
The 44-year-old Middlesbrough-born officer joined the force in 1991.
He trained as an authorised firearms officer in 2001 and five years later became a VIP close protection officer.
PC Saddique was the only Asian member of the force's firearm's unit and felt he was unfairly treated when he was removed from VIP duties.
The tribunal was told superiors were heard plotting to force him out of the department while on a night out at the Black Bull pub in Yarm
The officer began an employment tribunal against the force in 2011, claiming race discrimination, harassment and bullying.
He settled with the force without receiving any money on the understanding he would be given access to training and would regain his VIP protection status when he returned to work.
However, he later felt a personal development plan was not properly implemented.
Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer gave evidence at the tribunal and afterwards said: "I received the findings of the employment tribunal that examined the claims of victimisation and discrimination brought by PC Saddique.
"I take these findings extremely seriously and all of the issues within the tribunal's judgment will be quickly and carefully considered."
A remedy hearing will be staged to decide on the financial ramifications.
