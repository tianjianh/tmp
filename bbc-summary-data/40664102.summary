[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Women's Euro 2017 hosts Netherlands claimed their second victory in Group A by beating Denmark 1-0 in Rotterdam.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sherida Spitse scored the only goal from the penalty spot after Danielle van de Donk was tripped in the box.
Arsenal's Sari van Veenendaal made a superb save to deny Denmark's Pernille Harder, while Nadia Nadim headed straight at the goalkeeper late on.
Two-time champions Norway are on the brink of elimination after a surprise 2-0 defeat by Belgium.
Elke van Gorp came from an offside position to poke in from Ingrid Hjelmseth's parry and give debutants Belgium the lead on 59 minutes. They doubled their lead through Janice Cayman's free header after the Norwegian defenders failed to clear.
Norway's best chance fell to Caroline Graham Hansen, but the forward volleyed over the crossbar from close range.
They were on top in the first half as Andrine Hegerberg had a flicked effort pushed away, but her sister Ada - the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year - struggled to make an impact.
Martin Sjogren's Norway side - runners-up in 2013 - lost to hosts Netherlands in their first game and must now beat Denmark on Monday to have any chance of progressing.
Meanwhile, a point for Netherlands in their final group game against Belgium will seal progression to the knockout stages.
