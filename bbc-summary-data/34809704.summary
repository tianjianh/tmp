Premier League football, rugby, beaches and mountains have been used in a direct appeal by the health minister to attract junior doctors to Wales.

Mark Drakeford has launched a campaign urging them to take up training places in hospitals and GP practices.
It includes a YouTube video outlining the positives of choosing Wales as "a great place to be".
He also promised "discussion, negotiation and agreement" in dealing with the controversial contracts issue.
It comes following a dispute over a new contract for 50,000 junior doctors in England with the British Medical Association claiming some medics stand to lose up to 15% of their salaries.
The old contract still operates in Wales but ministers will be keeping an eye on what happens in England.
BMA Wales called the Welsh government's commitment to negotiation "the sensible way to achieve consensus and agreement".
In his video message, Mr Drakeford said the Welsh government would take a partnership approach.
"Does it mean we agree all the time on absolutely everything? Of course not," he said.
"But what it does mean is that when there are difficult issues which have to be addressed we do it by getting around the table - and putting that issue in the middle of the table - and making sure we solve that issue in a way that's common to us all.
"That's the way we do things in Wales and that's the way we're going to approach our part of the contract negotiations. We won't be changing anything here in Wales until we know we have a proper way ahead."
Mr Drakeford also points to Wales' record in medical research and a General Medical Council survey which found satisfaction among trainee doctors in Wales was 83% - higher than other parts of the UK.
He lists attributes from the national football team, music, Ashes test cricket and the prospect of extreme sports and recreation in a small country "which really does offer it all".
A medical careers website has also been launched.
Dr Bethan Roberts, chair of the Welsh junior doctors committee at the BMA said Wales was a "strong choice" for junior doctors.
"There are excellent and varied training opportunities and the fact that the junior doctor contract will remain unchanged in Wales adds to the pull factors," she said.
"Wales values junior doctors and that's the message we want to establish".
