Kidderminster Harriers 0-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley consigned bottom side Kidderminster Harriers to their seventh straight defeat in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gavin Rothery almost put the visitors ahead with a powerful close-range strike which was inches over.
Managerless Harriers battled gamely and went close when Elton Ngwatala's fine shot struck the post.
But from a late corner, Liam Dickinson connected with Jake Lawlor's header and volleyed Guiseley to a victory which left the hosts 14 points from safety.
