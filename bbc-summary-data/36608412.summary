[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee boss Paul Hartley is determined to retain Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart but admits other clubs have expressed interest in the forwards.

Stewart netted 11 times last term, while Hemmings scored 25 goals on his debut season at Dens Park.
Hemmings, 24, has two years to run on his deal, while Stewart, 26, has 12 months remaining on his contract.
"We have had a lot of interest, but no concrete offers," said Hartley. "They are two players we want to keep."
Both men, team-mates at Cowdenbeath in 2013-14, were shortlisted for PFA Scotland player of the year, making it two seasons in a row for Stewart to be recognised by his peers.
Stewart scored 15 goals in his first campaign for Hartley's side and was used mainly in a wide role in the past term.
"Obviously we can't stop speculation," added Hartley. "They are a vital part of our team and we want to hold on to them as much as we can.
"The window shuts in August, so there could be something in the next few weeks, who knows?"
With Stewart entering the final year of his contract, Hartley insists he would rather run the risk of losing out on a fee than sell on the cheap.
"I rate him very highly," Hartley explained. "It would take a lot of money for someone to take Greg away from us.
"We understand he is in the last year of his contract, but we don't want to sell him and, if we have got him for another year, we will keep him - with the possibility of getting no fee whatsoever.
"How do you replace Greg Stewart? It would take a lot of money, but we don't want to sell him and we are not going to sell him."
