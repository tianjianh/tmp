The 229-run win came after lunch on day three and was the 10th-shortest Test match ever for balls bowled (1,297) when all 40 wickets have fallen.
Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera finished with match figures of 10-99.
Australia, chasing 413, started on 25-3 but were all out for 183 as their problems against spinners were exposed.
"It's incredibly hard to play against," said Australia captain Steve Smith. "Particularly coming from Australia, it's very foreign.
"It's very challenging. We have a lot of work to do."
Australia have now lost eight successive Test matches in Asia.
"Not too many teams do this to the number one team," said Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews.
The third Test starts on Saturday, 13 August in Colombo.
