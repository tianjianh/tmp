Former Glentoran skipper Colin Nixon has joined Championship One side Bangor on a two-year-contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Nixon was released by the Glens at the end of the season and in his final game came on as a sub in the Irish Cup final win over Cliftonville.
Bangor escaped relegation from the second tier of the Irish League by winning their last game of the season against Tobermore United.
They are managed by former Linfield and Ballymena midfielder Garth Scates.
"Joining Bangor is a real challenge for me - just the move I was looking for," said 34-year-old Nixon.
"I was disappointed to be let go by Glentoran because I felt I still had a lot to offer."
Nixon was Glentoran's longest-serving player, making a record 792 appearances and scoring 87 goals.
