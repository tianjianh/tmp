[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Star Wars director is executive producer whilst Interstellar co-writer Jonathan Nolan will pen the scripts
Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, Evan Rachel Wood, Ed Harris and James Marsden will all star.
The show is a remake of a 1973 sci-fi western about a futuristic themed amusement park that has a robot malfunction.
HBO teased fans with a six second Vine clip and a cryptic, mathematical Tweet but there's no word on how many episodes will be made.
The studio is calling the series, which will debut in 2015, "a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the future of sin".
Author Michael Crichton directed the original film which saw the human owners of the park losing control of the androids as they began to attack guests.
Hopkins will play Dr Robert Ford, the theme park's owner, while Wood, Marsden and Newton are to star as androids.
Ed Harris is credited only as a character called 'The Man In Black'.
Other cast members include Hunger Games: Catching Fire's Jeffrey Wright, Lord Of The Rings' Miranda Otto and 300's Rodrigo Santaro.
