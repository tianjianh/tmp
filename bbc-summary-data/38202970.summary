Paul Hegarty was sacked last month, with the Gable Endies picking up one point from three games since his departure.
Petrie, 46, leaves his post as as assistant manager at Junior Super League side Broughty Athletic.
Born in Dundee, he played for Forfar, Dunfermline and Ross County and had spells in Australia and Singapore.
Petrie has previously served as assistant manager at Forfar and Arbroath.
"He is highly motivated and enthusiastic, comes with a wealth of playing and coaching experience and most importantly understands the lower leagues of Scottish football," said chairman John Crawford.
"I would like to thank John Holt for his support in stepping in and looking after the team since the departure of Paul Hegarty and wish him every success for the future."
