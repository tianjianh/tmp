[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff City eye Birmingham's David Cotterill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City are among the clubs interested in signing Wales winger David Cotterill from Birmingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff-born Cotterill, 28, has a Â£1.1m release clause in his current contract.
Fellow Championship sides Sheffield Wednesday and Reading are also understood to be keen on the former Swansea and Wigan player.
Cotterill is currently with the Wales squad as they prepare for their Euro 2016 semi-final against Portugal on Wednesday.
He has yet to feature for Chris Coleman's side in France, with the most recent of his 23 caps coming in the friendly draw against Northern Ireland in March.
Cotterill joined Birmingham from Doncaster in 2014 and, last season, he scored four goals in 29 league appearances as the Blues finished 10th in the Championship.
The Bristol City youth product scored in the 1-1 draw at Cardiff in the final game of the season, in what could prove to be his last game for Birmingham.
