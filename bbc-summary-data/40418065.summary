Leroy Cudjoe gave the Giants an early lead before tries in quick succession by Junior Sa'u, Rob Lui and Kris Welham put Salford in control.
Aaron Murphy reduced the arrears before the break but Gareth O'Brien touched down for the hosts.
Sa'u scored his second and Greg Johnson and Ben Murdoch-Masila added to their lead.
Kruise Leeming and Darnell McIntosh scored late consolations for the visitors, who slip to eighth in the table.
The Giants are now two points above ninth-placed Catalans Dragons with three games to go before the league splits, with the bottom four teams joining the top four Championship sides in the qualifiers.
Challenge Cup semi-finalists Salford are now eight points behind leaders Castleford, who they visit on 16 July.
Salford Red Devils head coach Ian Watson:
"It was a big one for us to win after three losses, especially after the results elsewhere this weekend fell for us.
"We worked really hard for each other and our eagerness shone through. They want to work hard and they want to be successful.
"Our game management was really good and that's important in the big games."
Huddersfield Giants head coach Rick Stone:
"Salford were the better team, no doubt. Salford managed the game really well and we didn't.
"The first 20 minutes were a bit of a contest but we let them off the hook a bit with a lack of polish with our last plays.
"I don't think our offence was our major issue today, it was our defence. As we became more tired we became more vulnerable and they took advantage of us."
