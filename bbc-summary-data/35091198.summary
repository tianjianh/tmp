In recent weeks, the X Factor has struggled to get past the 7 million mark, dipping to 6.71 million for last week's semi-final.
The ITV show has consistently been beaten by BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing this year.
Sunday's Strictly semi-final results show, which saw Anita Rani eliminated, was seen by an average of 10.8m.
The audience peaked at 11.7m.
Next week's final will see The Wanted singer Jay McGuinness, BBC Proms and Radio 3 presenter Katie Derham, EastEnders' Kellie Bright and former Coronation Street star Georgia May Foote compete for the Strictly crown.
