A court in the Indian capital, Delhi, has found five men guilty for the 2014 gang rape of a Danish woman.

The 51-year-old tourist was robbed and raped at knife point on 14 January. Nine people, including three minors, were arrested for the crime.
One of the accused died in February. The minors are being tried in a separate court for juveniles.
Scrutiny of sexual violence in India has grown since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus.
"All accused are held guilty for all offences," The Times of India quoted Additional Sessions Judge Ramesh Kumar as saying on Monday.
The sentencing is due on Thursday. The victim was not present in the court on Monday.
The tourist had lost her way to her hotel in Delhi's Paharganj area when she approached the men to ask for directions.
She gave a detailed statement in the presence of the Danish ambassador before leaving the country soon after the assault.
The 2012 gang rape led to protests and new anti-rape laws in India.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
