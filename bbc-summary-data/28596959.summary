A lorry driver was thrown over a crash barrier and another had to be cut free from his cab after two HGVs collided on the M74 in Dumfries and Galloway.

One lorry was stationary on the hard shoulder of the northbound lane when the collision happened near Ecclefechan at about 11:30 on Thursday.
The men were taken to hospital but their injuries were not thought to be life threatening.
Firefighters used hydraulic equipment to cut the trapped driver free.
The other driver fell down an embankment beside the motorway.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Phil Birkett said: "The position of the cabin meant our crews were operating in difficult circumstances.
"We were also working very closely with paramedics to care for the casualty throughout the road rescue.
"Hydraulic cutting equipment was used to create an opening in the driver-side door, which we were then able to get the casualty out through."
Both men were taken to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary
