Creagh Concrete: Toomebridge firm creates 'over 100 jobs' in one year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim building supply firm has said it has created more than 100 jobs in the past 12 months, in its most successful year since the downturn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Toomebridge-based Creagh Concrete is working on several multi-million pound projects, including a Â£12m contract involving apartments in Aberdeen.
It now employs 650 staff and has "plans for further job creation".
The company makes a range of pre-cast concrete products, including flooring.
About 80% of its turnover relates to projects outside Northern Ireland.
Government figures show that output across the local construction sector has had four successive quarters of growth.
However, output remains about one third lower than before the downturn in 2008.
