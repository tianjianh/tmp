Rashan Charles, 20, died after being apprehended by police in Dalston, east London, on 22 July.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating his death.
Angry clashes broke out on Friday evening after protesters, some with Black Lives Matter placards, blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight.
At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped onto a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade.
Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group.
Police in Hackney tweeted: "Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."
Videos on social media showed officers walking backwards as objects were thrown at them.
Several wheelie bins were set alight and mattresses thrown on top of the burning pile.
Shop windows were also smashed, littering the streets with glass, with those involved described by an eyewitness as "very, very angry".
The mood was said to have "calmed down" at about 22:45.
It is not yet known if there have been any arrests.
One man who was at the protest told the BBC the protesters were "angry and confused" because they were "not being represented".
He suggested young people were "living in fear", adding they "don't understand how to live, how to make money, how to work for what they want", with some "forced into" situations such as selling drugs or carrying knives.
Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, said the community wanted to hold peaceful protests, but some people from outside the borough wanted to "engage in vandalism and unrest".
"What we've tried to do all week is separate the two groups, to recognise the rawness of the anger out in the community," he said.
Mr Glanville said he did not think there was a problem between the police and the community, as a lot of work had been carried out in the area following the 2011 riots.
Mr Charles's father, Esa, will give a statement outside Stoke Newington Police station later.
He will be joined by the father of Edir Da Costa, who it is claimed was "brutally beaten" by Met officers in June.
His death is also being investigated by the police watchdog.
The IPCC said "we understand the concerns raised following Rashan's death".
A statement added: "We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality, and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have."
