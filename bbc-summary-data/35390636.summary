West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has announced his retirement from international cricket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Guyanese left-hander, 41, made his Test debut in 1994 but was dropped after West Indies' home series against England in May 2015.
With 11,867 runs from 164 Tests, he retires as the Windies' second highest run-scorer, only 45 short of Brian Lara's record of 11,912.
He is also the seventh-highest Test run-scorer of all time.
Chanderpaul also played in 268 one-day internationals - where he scored another 8,778 runs - including five World Cups, as well as 22 Twenty20 internationals.
He was the International Cricket Council's top-ranked Test batsman for several spells, and also appeared in English county cricket for Durham, Lancashire, Warwickshire and Derbyshire.
While his unorthodox batting stance and obdurate, limpet-like adhesion to the crease saw him occasionally nicknamed "The Crab", Chanderpaul's record of 30 Test centuries at a career average in excess of 50 marks him down as one of the most prolific batsmen of his generation.
