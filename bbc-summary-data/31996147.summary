Jersey parliament moved after fire alarm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fire alarm in the Jersey parliament forced politicians evacuate the building earlier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The meeting was suspended because of an electrical fault. Members will return to their normal building on Tuesday.
Engineers were already working on a suspected fault when a panel, a lamp and computer started smoking and triggered the fire alarm.
The States Assembly meeting was moved to the St Helier Town Hall, believed to be a first in modern times.
It was the last sitting before Easter and happened during a debate on funding for the Jersey Independent Care Inquiry.
