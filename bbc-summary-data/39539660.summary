[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elgin City moved above Annan into third place on goal difference, despite only taking a point against Montrose.
Clyde boosted their hopes of avoiding a relegation play-off with a 2-1 win over Annan while Berwick Rangers lost by a solitary goal to Stirling Albion.
And bottom side Cowdenbeath are three points adrift after a 1-1 draw with Edinburgh City.
City are a point above Clyde and four ahead of Cowden as the capital side seek to stay in the division after entering the Scottish Professional Football League's lowest division for the first time this season.
They led at home to Cowdenbeath through Josh Walker's free-kick but Kris Renton struck to restore parity in stoppage time.
In the top of the table encounter, Josh Peters fired Forfar ahead early in the second half but Ryan McCord's 65th-minute free-kick levelled matters.
Elgin's Brian Cameron netted from close range early on but Chris Templeman headed Montrose level on the hour and it finished 1-1 at Borough Briggs.
Darren Smith struck to put visitors Stirling 1-0 up after 17 minutes and Berwick could not recover.
At Broadwood Stadium, Chris Smith nodded Clyde ahead only for Aidan Smith to draw Annan Athletic level.
But David Gormley's 81st-minute shot gave the Bully Wee a valuable three points.
