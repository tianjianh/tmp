Rise in number of fines for term time school holidays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More parents in northern Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire are being fined for taking their children out of school in term time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull City Council issued 488 fines from September to March, a rise of 176 on the same period last year.
In North East Lincolnshire, 291 parents have been fined since September, compared with 176 in the previous year.
Emma Hardy from the Hull branch of the National Union of Teachers called for the fines to be abolished.
Ms Hardy claimed the fines could mean that "family holidays will be the preserve of the rich only".
"Obviously, I don't want my kids always away at school all the time as it make my job harder," she said.
"It's about being reasonable, being flexible and looking at it case by case, not just having this one size fits all no school holidays are allowed."
The fines were introduced by the coalition government in September 2013.
Parents are charged Â£60 for each unauthorised absence, rising to Â£120 if the fine is not paid within 21 days.
Heads teachers in England were previously able to grant up to 10 days of leave a year for family holidays but since the law changed they are no longer able to grant any absence in term time unless there are "exceptional circumstances".
Denham Kite, head teacher at Victoria Dock Primary School in Hull, said he had sympathy for parents but absences could not be approved just to save money on holidays.
"They are things we have to plan for and there will be members of staff in the same situation," he said.
"We do want to make sure that children come to school. They don't have their education disrupted or the education of others in the classroom when they come back and try to get them up to speed with other children."
