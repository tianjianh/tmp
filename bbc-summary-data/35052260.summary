Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was "great news for the town and the wider East Riding".
The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event.
The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it  brought £50m into the region's economy.
The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014.
More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route.
Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding.
"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy," he said.
Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival.
Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.
"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition," he said.
"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly."
Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was "fantastic news" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders.
He said: "It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more accessible than what it was last year when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye."
