Hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged when a record amount of rain fell during the weekend of 5 December.
Prince Charles began his tour in Carlisle, where he met residents who had been flooded out of their homes in Warwick Road, and viewed the ongoing clean-up.
Six years ago he visited the same area following major flooding.
He toured the McVitie's factory, one of Carlisle's largest employers, and will later meet members of the emergency services and charities who supported those affected.
More news on Prince Charles' visit.
Councillor Steve Layden, Carlisle's Mayor, said: "Many people, householders and businesses are still suffering.
"It means a great deal for them that the future king has come to see how they are getting on."
A Clarence House spokeswoman said: "The visit will recognise the efforts of those who helped in the relief operation as well as showing the progress of repair work as local communities prepare for Christmas and look ahead to the New Year."
