The 22-year-old Irishman was brought to the club as a central defender in the summer of 2014 from Bradford.
But he played much of last season as a left-back and has found himself in midfield under new manager Derek Adams.
"I was confident, I played there when I was younger before I moved to England, that's where I played when I was growing up," he told BBC Radio Devon.
And the former Republic of Ireland Under-19 international said he was ready to seize his chance in whatever role Adams assigned to him in pre-season.
"I was determined when I came back in pre-season that I would get in the team and I worked really hard in the summer and I wanted to make sure I was in the team and impress the new manager," he added.
"An opportunity came in a few of the pre-season games to play in midfield and I thought it was an opportunity to grab.
"You've got Curtis Nelson and Peter Hartley as centre-halves, who are really good centre-halves, so one of the three of us was going to have to drop out, so it's worked really well so far."
