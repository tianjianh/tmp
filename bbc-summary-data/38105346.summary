[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police Scotland says it remains "absolutely committed" to finding the killer of Nairn banker Alistair Wilson.

The 30-year-old was fatally injured on the doorstep of his home in the town near Inverness, 12 years ago.
The father-of-two's killer - a stocky man with a baseball cap - handed him an envelope before shooting him with a German-made handgun. Mr Wilson died later in hospital.
A massive police inquiry was launched but the murder remains unsolved.
In a statement Police Scotland said: "Following a review of the Alistair Wilson murder under homicide governance processes introduced by Police Scotland, the investigation remains active and ongoing.
"We will consider all forensic and investigative opportunities.
"We remain absolutely committed to tracing the person responsible for Alistair's death and continue to ask the public for any information which might assist us."
The gun involved in the shooting on 28 November 2004 was found the following month in a drain on Seabank Road, Nairn, by council workers carrying out gully cleaning.
Forensic analysis identified it as the murder weapon but tests on the gun failed to extract any DNA.
Criminologist Prof David Wilson told BBC Radio Scotland's Beattie programme that "a key to unlocking" the case were the contents of a blue or green envelope that the killer handed to Mr Wilson.
On the night of his murder, Mr Wilson had been putting his young sons to bed when his wife Veronica told him that there was a man at the door of their home.
Mr Wilson went to the door and was given an envelope.
He went back into the house and spoke to his wife, then returned to the door where he was shot three times.
Prof Wilson said: "Holding back some key pieces of information that only the police are aware of is one way of establishing whether people coming forward do genuinely have information which is of help, or simply wasting police time.
"I think, given how old this case is now, one of the keys to unlocking the case might be for Police Scotland to talk about what was contained within that letter."
Peter Bleksley, a former Scotland Yard detective who has been following the case, said: "I am sure they (Police Scotland) hope, as much as those who were close to Alistair will hope, that it will eventually be solved.
"We have seen cases in the UK that have been solved decades after they have been committed."
