The festival forms part of Cardiff hosting the world football's biggest domestic club final as Juventus face holders Real Madrid on Saturday.
Up to 170,000 fans are expected in the city over four days.
The pitch will host the traditional Ultimate Champions match which features previous winners including Ryan Giggs.
It is the first time a floating pitch has been used at the festival.
About 200 pieces have been put together to build the pitch with the surface laid on top, while netting has been erected around the side to stop balls going into the water.
The Champions match will take place on Friday with most of the names still to be revealed.
Last year's participants included Brazil and Real Madrid legend Roberto Carlos, Portugal's LuÃ­s Figo and Germany's Lothar Matthaus.
The pitch will also host a walking football game, a match involving refugee teams from Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, a deaf football friendly international, learning disability and youth groups matches.
