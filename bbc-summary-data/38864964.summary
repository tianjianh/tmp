[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 3-0 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion-chasing Plymouth ended Exeter's seven-match winning run in League Two with a comprehensive victory at Home Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lively start to the Devon derby saw Exeter's Jake Taylor volley an effort just wide from eight yards.
But almost immediately Plymouth playmaker Graham Carey sent a pass through to on-loan Cardiff winger Matty Kennedy, who beat Christy Pym and put Argyle 1-0 up.
Pym could do little to prevent the ball beating him then but he made a fine diving save to palm away Ryan Taylor's goal-bound 21st-minute effort after the tall striker latched on to a loose ball in the City area.
Argyle surged 2-0 up in first-half added time as Kennedy slipped the ball through to Taylor and he curled the ball into the corner and just out of the reach of the diving Pym.
A minute later Troy Brown's header smashed off the crossbar but Argyle went in 2-0 up at half-time.
Brown was denied again at the start of the second half as home keeper Luke McCormick made a brilliant one-handed save to keep out the central defender's strike.
Second-placed Plymouth, though, sealed the win in injury time as substitute Jake Jervis converted a penalty after being fouled by City keeper Pym.
