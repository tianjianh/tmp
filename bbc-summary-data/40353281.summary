[SN]TITLE[SN]
British and Irish Lions 2017: Pick your Lions Test team to face the All Blacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No George North. Leigh Halfpenny, Maro Itoje and Sam Warburton only on the bench. And with a captain in Peter O'Mahony who made the latest of late runs to get onto the tour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Do you agree with Lions head coach Warren Gatland's selections for the first Test against New Zealand on Saturday? Or do you think you could have done better?
Well, here's your chance to be a Lions selector.
Use the numbers as they correspond to positions. So, one is loose-head prop, two is hooker, three tight-head prop, four and five are second rows, six is blind-side flanker, seven open-side flanker and eight - well that's the number eight, obviously.
For the backs, nine is scrum-half, 10 fly-half, 11 is left wing, 12 inside centre, 13 outside centre, 14 right wing and 15 is full-back.
Who would you select in your Test XV for the Lions?
