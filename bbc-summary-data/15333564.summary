[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Post and Derby Telegraph printed in Birmingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Printing of two of the East Midlands' biggest newspapers has been moved to Birmingham in a bid to "reduce costs and increase sales".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Derby Telegraph and Nottingham Post are owned by Northcliffe Media, which said the move would allow the publications to be printed earlier.
The firm claimed the decision was good news for readers and advertisers.
But The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the papers risked damaging their local reputations.
Northcliffe Media said the move was part of their strategy to reduce costs and increase sales.
The decision has been taken so the publications can have an earlier print slot and therefore arrive at newsagents earlier in the day, according to the firm.
Nottingham Trent University media lecturer Dr Matt Ashton said: "It reflects the fact that a lot of the print industries in this country are in decline and are having to make economies of scale.
"Problems they've got going forward include inflation, the rising cost of printing the paper, the rising cost of journalism and their audience is getting older."
Reporters and staff will remain in the three cities but the Nottingham Post could move from its base at Castle Wharf.
Northcliffe Media wants the newspaper to find cheaper premises, the BBC understands.
Northcliffe Media director Steve Auckland said: "The new print site and earlier print times allow us to get the papers to market and into the hands of readers earlier, so the change is good news for advertisers and readers alike.
"The new location does not affect the content or the credibility of the papers, as all staff and reporters will remain in their current offices.
"We believe this change will help the Derby Telegraph and the Nottingham Post grow and meet the current challenges of the regional newspaper market."
Last week, Northcliffe title the Lincolnshire Echo was relaunched as a weekly edition.
Daily production of the newspaper came to an end after 118 years, in response to a drop in circulation.
