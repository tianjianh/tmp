Unite suspends industrial action at Scottish naval bases

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trade union Unite has announced a suspension of industrial action by civilian staff at the Coulport and Faslane naval bases.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move follows talks between the union and employer Babcock Marine.
Industrial action began in March, following union claims that Babcock was "undermining" workers' rights as part of a campaign to outsource work.
Unite said the decision to end the action was taken at a meeting of shop stewards and workplace representatives.
The union said a proposed new accord between Unite and Babcock Marine would be put to a mass meeting of union members on Tuesday.
Shop stewards are recommending that it should be accepted.
Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said talks with senior executives from Babcock Marine on Monday had been "constructive".
Unite regional officer Stephen Deans added: "As always, it's our members who will make the final decision on whether this accord goes far enough in meeting their concerns, but Unite believes it is a solid foundation to build a better partnership in the future."
The Faslane base on the Clyde is home to the UK's fleet of Trident nuclear submarines.
The union represents a range of workers at Faslane and Coulport, including cleaners, housekeepers, logistics operatives, drivers and mail staff.
It also has members in radiation monitoring and strategic weapons support roles.
