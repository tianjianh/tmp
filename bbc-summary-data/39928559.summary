[SN]TITLE[SN]
Modern Studies exam reprinted due to diagram error

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exam paper for Scottish secondary pupils is being re-issued after a mistake was spotted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National 5 Modern Studies exam will take place on Friday afternoon.
The Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) said the paper has been reprinted because of a typographical error.
The exams body said there was no suggestion of a security breach. A spokesman added that it had procedures in place to deal with situations like this.
The printing mistake in the original paper was in a diagram, not a question.
The SQA said it acted quickly after the error was spotted.
The reprinted paper - with the correct text in the diagram but otherwise identical - will be issued to exam centres across Scotland.
Last year the Higher English paper was replaced amid fears of a security breach.
The SQA also faced criticism over mistakes in the National 5 computing paper.
Earlier this month, the SQA announced that teachers would not have access to exam papers until the day after each test takes place.
It said the change was in order to improve security and confidentiality. The largest teachers' union, the EIS, has condemned the move.
