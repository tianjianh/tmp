Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, aged six months, was killed by an American pit bull in 2014 in Daventry, Northamptonshire.
Outside Northampton Crown Court, the father of Claire Riley is heard shouting "get your hands off my daughter" as camera crews and photographers watched the 23-year-old arriving under an umbrella.
She's being sentenced along with the child's grandmother Susan Aucott, 55, after both admitted being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog.
