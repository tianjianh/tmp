Seren Bernard inquest: Teenager a 'happy, bright girl'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of a teenager has been told she gave the impression of being a "happy, bright girl".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seren Bernard, 14, was found dead in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, in April 2012.
She had lived with foster carers from December 2011 until her death.
During the fourth day of the Milford Haven hearing on Thursday, social worker Wendy Rodriques said Seren "engaged well" with professionals involved in her care.
She said the teenager had people caring for her that she could trust, that Seren's foster parents had formed a good relationship with her and she had an adult she could speak to at school.
The hearing was told on Tuesday that Seren said she had "no aspirations" in the weeks leading up to her death.
A serious case review last year found her death under the care of social services might not have been preventable and police ruled out crime.
The inquest will resume on 15 June.
