[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who claims he was indecently assaulted by two ex-BBC presenters as a child learnt their identities when he heard them on the radio, a court heard.

The complainant said he had sex with Julie Wadsworth up to 15 times, including once when her husband Tony joined in.
Now in his 30s, he told police he felt compelled to report what happened after having child protection training.
The couple deny assaulting seven boys in the 1990s.
In video interviews shown to the jury, the alleged victim said he first met Mrs Wadsworth when he was 14 and she was sunbathing in a park in 1995.
He went on to have sexual activity with Mrs Wadsworth at her then home in Long Street, Atherstone, the court heard.
"The first time we had sex in her living room and basically from then until I was 18 I would say there are 10, 12 or 15 occasions I have seen her in the park and arranged to meet," he said.
The man told the interviewing officer he only discovered the couple's names while channel-hopping on the radio.
The man said: "It was probably after about a year or two.
"While it was going on I was listening to the radio one night and I recognised their voices...co-presenting an evening programme.
"You could play me a recording of 10 BBC presenters and I would be able to tell you straight away which one was them."
The Wadsworths, from Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, who have worked for BBC Radio Leicester and BBC WM, deny five counts of outraging public decency between July 1992 and June 1996.
Mrs Wadsworth, 60, has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of indecent assault, while her 69-year-old husband denies 10 counts of the same offence.
The man told officers: "I took part in (child protection) training and it brought up incidents that happened to me over four years from when I was 14 to when I was 18, when I engaged in sexual intercourse with a couple that I had met in the woods in Atherstone.
"I had never told a soul. I was sitting there having a conversation with myself, is this the day that I tell someone?"
