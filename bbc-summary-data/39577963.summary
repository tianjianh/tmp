The International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) near Lincoln was due to be unveiled in September but the official opening is now to be April 2018.
Nicky Barr, of the IBCC, said she was "devastated" about the setback.
Those behind the centre say they hope it will remember more than 55,000 killed personnel.

Ms Barr said the construction team would be working "flat out" to get building works completed and parts of the centre could be in use by December.
A delay in securing loans had put building work back, she said.
The centre still needs £2m of funding, although £10.5m has been raised and getting the final monies has proved "extremely challenging", said Ms Barr.
Fundraising has also been hampered by a number of break-ins at the site.
Bomber Command crews were tasked with attacking Germany's airbases, troops, shipping and industrial complexes connected to the war effort.
The contribution of men and women from more than 60 nations will be featured, according to the centre.
Lincoln was chosen for the site as it provides a central point for 27 bomber bases that were in Lincolnshire.
The county housed about a third of all World War Two Bomber Command stations.
