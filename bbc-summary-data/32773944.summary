[SN]TITLE[SN]
Institute of Directors urges action over UK deficit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new Conservative government should make bringing down the deficit a priority, members of the Institute of Directors (IoD) have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A survey of 1,211 IoD members indicated they believe that the deficit reduction should be achieved mainly through spending cuts rather than tax rises.
Infrastructure and education were other major policy areas the business body's members would like to see addressed.
IoD director Simon Walker said it was time for "decisive action".
More than half of those who took part in the survey, which was conducted immediately after the general election, also strongly opposed increases in national insurance, income tax, VAT and business rates.
The research also found support for improving the UK's broadband capability, investing in energy generation, and spending on railways.
In addition, there was also overwhelming support for a crackdown on tax avoidance.
Mr Walker said: "The election result was more decisive than most expected, and now is the time for the new government to take decisive action.
"Returning the budget to surplus must be the overriding goal in this Parliament, but businesses want the emphasis to be on finding further reductions in spending, not significantly raising taxes."
