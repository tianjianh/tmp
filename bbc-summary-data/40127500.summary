America's Cup 2017: Britain lose to New Zealand but beat France to progress

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain secured a play-off place at the America's Cup by narrowly defeating France in a thrilling contest at the end of Thursday's racing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The GB crew had earlier lost to New Zealand and retired with their opponents having already finished.
But a late manoeuvre saw them clinch a crucial victory against France, who had earlier lost to Japan.
Sir Ben Ainslie's Land Rover BAR team now have an unassailable lead over bottom-of-the-table France.
All but one of the six teams taking part of this stage go through - though Team USA, as holders, will skip the next stage of the competition and return for the actual America's Cup matches.
In their first race of the day Britain had been level with the New Zealand boat heading to the first mark but lost their way after a disastrous gybe saw the boat nosedive and turn sharply.
They soon trailed by 350 metres and Ainslie could be heard asking: "What happened? What happened?"
Britain's previous two victories in Bermuda came against Sweden.
Racing continues on Friday - but it is a rest day for the British crew.

Racing had been rescheduled after organisers decided winds on Wednesday were too light to let sailing go ahead in Bermuda.
Japan defeated France by almost six minutes in Thursday's opening race - taking them on to three points, one above the French.
The United States then defeated Japan by more than half-a-minute to move on to seven points at the top of the standings.
The light wind speed made for challenging conditions but Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill produced a tactical masterclass - a change of tack resulting in the American boat transforming a 22-second deficit into a 35-second lead between the fourth and fifth gates.
