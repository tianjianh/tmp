The comedian and actor first appeared as a panellist on the quiz show in 2009.
His debut in the host's chair will be broadcast on Friday 17 September.
"It is a massive honour to follow in the footsteps of Barrys Norman and Took, of Simon Hoggart and the delectable Sandi Toksvig and be asked to take on this role," Jupp said.
"Sandi has been remarkable in her time in charge of The News Quiz and her legacy will live on forever amongst listeners.
"Following her departure my first job will be to lead the regulars and listeners through as many of the stages of grief as are ultimately deemed necessary (by a completely independent arbiter).
"Then it will simply be a matter of dumbing it down and sexing it up. Or vice versa, depending entirely on the circumstances."
Jupp hosted the R4 panel show It's Not What You Know and wrote and starred in radio sitcom In And Out Of The Kitchen as the cookery writer Damien Trench. He later adapted the show for TV.
The 35-year-old is a familiar face on TV in programmes such as Rev, The Thick Of It, Have I Got News For You and Mock The Week. He also played Archie the inventor in the pre-school TV series Balamory.
Jupp began his comedy career in stand-up while a student at Edinburgh University.
He has appeared in a number of films including Made in Dagenham and The Monuments Men as well as plays in the London's West End and at the National Theatre, where he is currently in the cast of Rules for Living, alongside Stephen Mangan.
Toksvig announced in April that she was to step down from The News Quiz - after nine years and 28 series - to set up a new political party named the Women's Equality Party. Her last programme was broadcast last week.
Commenting on her replacement, she said: "I couldn't be more delighted that Miles Jupp is taking over as host of The News Quiz. He is perfect - affable, funny and charming. I look forward to going from host to fan."
The News Quiz was first broadcast in 1977 and is now in its 87th series.
