[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
European football's governing body has ruled that Scotland's women's Under-19s team must forfeit their match against Serbia after their "refusal to play".

The Scots had stated that several players had suffered from "an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis".
But they have been deemed to have lost the European Championship qualifying tie, which was due to be played on 19 September in Albania, 3-0.
It follows a ruling by Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary body.
Having already defeated Cyprus 8-0 and hosts Albania 11-0, Gareth Evans' side pulled out of the final group game in Durres saying that nine players and eight members of the backroom staff had fallen ill.
The Scottish FA was angered by reports in the Serbian media that the Scots had got drunk the night before and were too hungover to play.
Scotland's governing body was also unhappy with the poor hotel conditions to which their players were subjected, with the walls affected by damp.
It stressed that the illness outbreak had been reported to Uefa's match delegate on the day of the match and that a local doctor had verified the problem.
