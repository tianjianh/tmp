Officers were called to East Surrey Grove in Peckham at 22:30 BST on Tuesday, where they found the victim in a critical condition.
Police believe the 20-year-old was making his way through the estate on a bike when he was attacked by two people who ran away.
The victim's next of kin have been informed, but police are awaiting formal identification.
Det Ch Insp  Will Reynolds said: "At this early stage we believe that the victim was making his way into the estate by pedal cycle when he was confronted by two people who have shot him, stabbed him and left the scene on foot toward Sumner Road via a cut through from Cator Road.
"We know that local residents heard the shots and we are keen to speak with anyone who either witnessed the incident itself or saw the suspects fleeing the scene."
No arrests have been made.
