Alloa Athletic sent departing boss Jack Ross off in style to St Mirren as they convincingly beat Bala Town to make the Scottish Challenge Cup quarter-finals.

The tie was over by half-time as a brace from Greig Spence and a goal from Jon Robertson put Alloa in control.
The Welsh side, making their debut in the competition, scored via a Lee Hunt penalty and a Stuart Jones header in the second period.
But a Kevin Cawley goal confirmed Alloa's place in the last eight.
Ross was named St Mirren's new boss on Tuesday but was happy to fulfil his contractual notice period by taking charge of the Wasps one more time before starting at the Paisley club on Monday.
"I give my players the credit they deserve for giving me the opportunity," Ross said after Saturday's victory.
"You are only as good as your players and they continued the standards they have set.
"They have produced results like this all season and they are now into the quarter-finals of another cup competition, after already reaching the League Cup quarter-finals [where they lost 2-0 at Celtic]."
Alloa midfielder Graeme Holmes admitted the result brought a "bitter sweet feeling" for the players knowing it was Ross' final game.
"We wish him all the best and we are happy to send him on his way with a victory," Holmes said.
"For me, he has been different class to work with. I am sure he will be a big success at St Mirren and go on to bigger and better things as a manager."
