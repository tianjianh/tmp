Gordon Underwood, 39, was fined Â£300 after admitting the charge, and one of obstructing three of his colleagues, at Hull Magistrates' Court on 23 March.

He was dismissed at a disciplinary hearing for discreditable conduct.

The hearing, chaired by temporary Chief Constable Garry Forsyth, found Underwood's behaviour "fell far short of the standards of a police officer".
Underwood did not attend the proceedings but accepted the charge. The tribunal heard Underwood had served as an officer for 15 years and was of "previous good character".
The incident that led to his conviction took place in Hull city centre on 15 February.
Ch Supt Judi Heaton, head of the force's professional standards branch, said: "The public can be reassured that the vast majority of our workforce are hard-working, dedicated and committed professionals and it is important that those who let down the force are held to account and are not able to damage its good reputation."
