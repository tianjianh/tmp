[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 2-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Resurgent Bury held on for a home win over Coventry to take another step away from the League One relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Vaughan claimed a 16th-minute opener for the Shakers before strike partner Tom Pope doubled their lead on 40 minutes.
Stuart Beavon pulled one back for rock-bottom Coventry with a 65th-minute header but despite some late pressure, the Sky Blues could not avoid a seventh defeat from nine in the league.
Bury, meanwhile, are now four points above the bottom four after taking 13 points from 15, with three straight wins since Lee Clark took charge.
Coventry keeper Lee Burge had to deny Paul Caddis and Vaughan before the latter showed neat footwork to beat two defenders and sidefoot into the bottom corner.
The visitors replied with Charles Vernam and Callum Reilly going close, before Pope latched onto a Callum Styles through-ball to slot home and double the home side's lead.
Burge made a point-blank save from Pope just after the break, but Reilly and Vernam both fired wide before Beavon gave the visitors a lifeline, scoring from a left-wing cross by half-time substitute Ryan Haynes.
Burge then kept out a Taylor Moore header but Bury keeper Joe Murphy pulled off two fine saves to deny Kevin Foley and Reilly an equaliser.
