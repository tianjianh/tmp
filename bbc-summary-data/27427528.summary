Colman, who won two Baftas in 2013, cried on stage and said: "Sorry not cool", adding that working with co-star David Tennant was "a joy and a treat".
Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway won two Baftas, for best entertainment show and entertainment performance.
The IT Crowd took two awards for Richard Ayoade and Katherine Parkinson.
They won for best male and female in a comedy programme and Parkinson praised writer Graham Linehan "who has the most original comic brain".
After collecting his award for crime drama Broadchurch, Bradley said he was sent a replica Bafta award in chocolate by his agent last Christmas and added: "Finally I can take it down off the mantelpiece and eat it."
Colman added that writer Chris Chibnall was "a genius".
A nervous Sean Harris, who told himself "try not to mumble" on stage, won best actor for Channel 4's Southcliffe, the harrowing drama about shootings in a small English town.
Sarah Lancashire took the prize for best supporting actress for the BBC's Last Tango in Halifax.
ITV and Channel 4 took home eight awards each and the BBC won four, including the audience award.
Actress Julie Walters was given Bafta's highest honour, a Fellowship, for her contribution to film and TV, having starred in shows such as Victoria Wood and Talking Heads and films including Educating Rita, the Harry Potter movies and Billy Elliot.
Walters told the audience: "When I told my mother I wanted to be an an actress in 1969, she said: 'She'll be in in the gutter before she's 20'.
"But what a gutter, and I shared that gutter with some of the most amazing and talented people without whom I would not have a career."
US drama Breaking Bad, which was shown exclusively online in the UK, won the international award after a change in the rules allowed shows screened online to be eligible.
David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive 3D won the specialist factual award. It was screened on Sky and saw him reacting alongside a series of computer-generated dinosaurs, ice age beasts and giant reptiles.
BBC One's Doctor Who: Day of the Doctor won the Radio Times audience Bafta, the only award of the night chosen by viewers.
Declan Donnelly said their win for Takeaway was "brilliant" and Anthony McPartlin praised the "hardworking crew", adding: "I'm so chuffed."
Ceremony host Graham Norton, who was up for two awards but lost out to Ant and Dec, joked: "I remember talking to Olivia Colman last year when she said how happy she felt when she won two awards.
"I feel the opposite of that."
Cilla Black was honoured with a special award in recognition of her contribution to entertainment over her 50-year career and received a standing ovation from the star-studded audience.
"I've led a charmed life, I've worked with incredible people," she said, adding that she thanked both Bafta and the viewers "for making me feel so welcome".
Coronation Street won the soap and continuing drama gong while ITV's Long Lost Family won the features prize.
Sky One's A League of Their Own won for comedy entertainment programme and its host James Corden said: "No one is more shocked than we are to think that this is a Bafta-winning programme - it is something so silly that we all enjoy."
The single documentary Bafta was won by Channel 4's The Murder Trial, which filmed an entire murder case for the first time in a British court.
ITV won the Bafta for best news coverage for the Woolwich attacks.
Channel 4 had a total of 27 nominations - the most of any single channel this year. BBC One and BBC Two had 17 apiece, while ITV had 12.
