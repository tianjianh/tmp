Formula E has found an alternative venue for its Berlin race in May after its previous location was made into a shelter for refugees.

Organisers said on Monday that the new race will take place in the centre of the city after the German government announced alternative plans for the disused Tempelhof airport.
"It is fantastic news," said Formula E chief Alejandro Agag.
The world's first fully electric series is now in its second season.
The new layout - subject to approval by city authorities - will wind around Strausberger Platz, in the east of the city, towards Alexanderplatz with the pit lane on Karl-Marx-Allee.
