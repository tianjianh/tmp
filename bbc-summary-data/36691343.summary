World number two Long, who claimed bronze at London 2012, won 21-18 21-18 as top seed Lee missed out on earning his country a first ever Olympic gold.
Long beat Lee to become world champion last year and again proved too good for his rival.
Denmark's Viktor Axelsen beat China's Lin Dan 15-21 21-10 21-17 for bronze.
Lin had beaten Lee to gold at Beijing 2008 and London 2012 but left Rio without a medal.
