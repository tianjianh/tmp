Reid and partner Alfie Hewett came from a set down to beat the French pair Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer 4-6 6-1 7-6 (8-6).
The second seeds are the first Britons to capture the title.
"The able-bodied players are starting to enjoy watching and I think they really respect us now as athletes," Reid told BBC Scotland.
"I think there's a mutual respect. I've seen the change from the first times I played in Grand Slams three or four years ago.
"It's high level sport and hopefully we can build on that and more and more people can see it like that."
Reid's latest victory means he has now won three of the four major doubles titles.
He will have to put celebrations on hold, however. On Sunday he has the chance to make history, bidding to become the first winner of the newly-introduced singles, with Sweden's Stefan Olsson standing in his way.
Reid, who won the singles title at the Australian Open earlier this year, describes the chance of playing singles at Wimbledon as a "dream come true".
"I feel fit. I've felt good all week on the grass," said the 24-year-old. "It's has been tough, but my body's been feeling good."
Reid takes to the court before Andy Murray takes on Milos Raonic in the men's singles final on Centre Court and is sure his fellow Scot will deliver his second Wimbledon title.
"I'm sure 100 % he can win," he said. "He's done it before and he's playing great tennis, he looks really confident. I'll be supporting him all the way."
