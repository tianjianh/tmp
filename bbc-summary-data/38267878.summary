The Royal Oak Hotel in Betws-y-Coed initially claimed the cat, named Cali by a neighbour who said she cared for it, was "humanely euthanised".
Following an angry response in the area, owner Glenn Evans apologised and said he should have acted sooner.
He added: "We didn't in any way condone what had occurred... and, in hindsight, we should have dealt with the two individuals concerned."
An RSPCA spokesman said: "We can confirm that we are investigating reports about the death of a cat in the Betws-y-Coed area."
An online petition has been launched calling for those responsible to be prosecuted and had attracted more than 35,700 supporters by Friday evening.
Mr Evans added: "We are sorry for what has happened and embarrassed that we didn't deal with the situation as quickly as we should have.
"We didn't in any way condone what had occurred but were waiting for the RSPCA to get back to us."
The hotel owner said staff who had "no knowledge or involvement in what happened" had been threatened in the wake of the killing.
