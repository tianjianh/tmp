The foxhound was running toward oncoming traffic between the Llanfairfechan roundabout and the Conwy tunnel in the early hours of Monday.
The force said officers could not bring the dog under control and the "only safe option" was to destroy it.
Ch Insp Darren Wareing said they "did not take this decision lightly".
Officers responded to reports the animal was running in traffic shortly after 03:00 GMT on Monday.
An officer tried to bring the dog under control but was bitten and it escaped.
One car and a HGV had to swerve to avoid the dog while officers remained on foot on the carriageway.
Ch Insp Wareing, of the roads policing unit, said the "potential for a serious collision was present throughout" and there was "no alternative way" for them to minimise risks to motorists.
"The only safe option was to run the dog over at sufficient speed to ensure that it was destroyed and would not suffer. Other methods of destruction were considered, but were ruled out on the grounds of public safety," he added.
"Both officers have their own dogs and did not take this decision lightly. Due to the seriousness of the incident it needed bringing to a conclusion quickly for the safety of all concerned."
