Christina Edkins died on the way to Leasowes High School in Halesowen in what police described as a seemingly random attack.
A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Floral tributes were laid near to the spot on Hagley Road where Christina died, while friends described her as a caring, fun-loving person.
A card on one bunch of roses read: "Christina a truly lovely young girl. We'll miss you. Rest in peace angel. Cass and Ben".
Another card read: "To Christina. We will miss you loads. You were a beautiful girl and a bundle of joy. Rest in peace cutey. Lots of love Ryan and Dale xxx".
Laura Bishop, 16, said Christina had only celebrated her sixteenth birthday last week.
She said: "She loved to party. She was the most amazing person. No one hated her, there was nothing to hate.
"We were all having a laugh last Saturday. It's like ripped something out of you. She's been 16 for one week."
Laura said she had known Christina and her family for about eight years and she could only imagine what they were going through.
Katie Howells, 15, said many of Christina's friends felt "lost".
She said: "You can't take someone's best friend, someone's daughter, someone's sister. Why would you do that?"
Some friends said they were planning to release balloons in her memory.
Police said her family, who are being supported by specially trained officers, had been left "distressed and distraught".
Neil Shaw, the head teacher at Christina's school, said both friends and family were "deeply saddened" by her death.
"Christina was a bright and popular student much loved by staff and students alike," he said.
"The school is working closely with the police and a team of counsellors to provide support to our pupils and staff."
The Archbishop of Birmingham, The Most Reverend Bernard Longley, sent his condolences in a message from Rome.
He said he had been shocked to hear about the "terrible attack" and that his thoughts and prayers were with Christina's family and pupils at Leasowes High School.
Reverend Mike Rutter, Vicar of St Peter's Church in Lapal, Halesowen, said the church would remain open to people in the community who wanted to pray or light a candle in her memory.
A Facebook tribute page dedicated to Christina was flooded by messages, one saying her death had left the nation "in shock".
