[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
William Porterfield's fine century kept Warwickshire in contention for a One-Day Cup quarter-final place as they beat Sussex by four wickets at Rugby.

Chasing 218, the Irishman hit exactly 100 and shared a crucial stand of 81 with Ateeq Javid (42 not out) as the hosts reached 218-6.
Earlier, Sussex were bowled out for 217 as Australian George Bailey made 59.
Warwickshire play Kent on Wednesday at Edgbaston with victory likely to seal a last-eight spot.
Warwickshire's chase got off to a poor start when skipper Varun Chopra was bowled by Chris Jordan for a duck with the third ball of the innings.
Three quick wickets in the middle order then left the Bears 130-5, but Porterfield put last year's beaten finalists on the verge of victory with a 124-ball century which included 13 fours.
He was out the ball after reaching his ton, bowled by Jordan (3-39), but the hard work had already been done and Keith Barker sealed the win with a boundary.
Sussex, who are without a victory in this year's competition, looked well placed at 112-2 in their innings, but lost their last eight wickets for 105 for a total which proved to be well below par.
