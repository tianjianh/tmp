A museum's campaign to buy a Viking hoard worth more than £50,000 has been successful.

The hoard was discovered in Bedale, North Yorkshire, in 2012 and includes a gold sword pommel and silver neck ring and collar.
The Yorkshire Museum launched an appeal in January to raise the funds to buy the hoard, which was valued at £51,636.
It has since received enough public donations and grants to keep the treasure on display in Yorkshire.
Natalie McCaul, from the museum, said: "The hoard is an incredible and intriguing find and one that we can now carry out research on to hopefully shed new light on Viking life in this part of Yorkshire."
As well as the pommel, neck ring and collar, the hoard contains a silver armlet, 29 silver ingots, two other silver neck rings, gold rivets and half a silver brooch.
Archaeologists believe it dates from the late ninth or early 10th Century.
