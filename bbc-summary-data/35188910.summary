[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pope Francis appoints new Bishop of Argyll and Isles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monsignor Brian McGee has been appointed as the new Bishop of Argyll and the Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The diocese has been vacant since April 2014 when Bishop Joseph Toal became Bishop of Motherwell.
Mgr McGee is currently Vicar General of the Diocese of Paisley and parish priest of Holy Family in Port Glasgow.
Reacting to his appointment, confirmed by Pope Francis, he said it was "humbling and frightening", but also "exciting".
He will be ordained at St. Columba's Cathedral in Oban on a date to be confirmed.
He said: "It was very humbling, and indeed frightening, to be informed by the Papal Nuncio that Pope Francis had nominated me to be the new bishop of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles.
"However, after reflection and prayer I now face this mission with quiet but definite confidence.
"Yes, I remain aware of my limitations but I am even more aware of the power of God's grace which, with our co-operation, overcomes our shortcomings. Experience has taught me that positively answering God's invitations is always to our own advantage."
He said he would be sad to leave the Diocese of Paisley but was "excited" about going to Argyll and the Isles.
"It has an ancient and proud heritage whose roots stretch back almost one and a half thousand years preceding even its spiritual father, Saint Columba," he said.
"I am also mindful of the diocese's rich Gaelic character and I, although not yet a Gaelic speaker, will endeavour to promote its rightful use in the worship of God."
Mgr McGee was born in Greenock in 1965 and educated at St Joseph's Primary School, Greenock, Holy Cross Primary School, Greenock, St Vincent's College, Langbank, St Mary's College, Blairs, and St Patrick's College in Thurles, Ireland.
He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Paisley in 1989.
Administrator of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles, Monsignor James MacNeil, said: "We welcome him with joy and he can be sure of the support, cooperation, affection and prayers of the community of the diocese as he begins his ministry of leadership and service."
