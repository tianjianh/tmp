The 19-year-old, who joined Spurs last February from MK Dons, has impressed in his first full season and has scored six goals in 30 appearances so far.
"When I signed I knew wanted to play for Spurs," he told the club website.
"I've played a few games and showed people what I can do. I'm 19, have a lot to learn and can't think of a better place to do that."
Alli played at youth levels for England before receiving his first senior call-up for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and Lithuania last October.
He made his debut as a substitute against Estonia and a month later scored his first international goal, a long-range effort against France.
