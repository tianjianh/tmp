Gloucestershire wrapped up a three-day win over Glamorgan by 10 wickets as the Welsh side crashed to their seventh defeat of 2016.

David Payne followed a career-best 67 not out with a four-wicket haul to dismiss Glamorgan for 232.
The visitors needed just 90 to win and got home inside 20 overs.
Aneurin Donald, 19, became the youngest Glamorgan batsman to 1,000 first-class runs in a season early in his innings.
He beat the landmark set by Matthew Maynard, who was to become club captain and an England batsman, at the age of 20 in 1986.
But only Will Bragg with 52 provided any lengthy and patient resistance as Glamorgan wickets fell regularly.
Payne was well backed up by the accurate Josh Shaw and Matt Taylor, while spinner Jack Taylor weighed in with three wickets.
A stand of 58 for the last wicket between Mark Wallace (39 not out) and Michael Hogan (30) was the highest of the innings, after acting captain Hogan claimed his first five-wicket haul of the season in the morning session.
But the target of 90 proved easy for Gareth Roderick and Chris Dent, as the visitors notched up their fourth win of the campaign, leaving Glamorgan without a 2016 Championship success in Cardiff.
Glamorgan coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport:
"We let ourselves down badly in the first innings, on that pitch which was green and damp to start,  to get bowled out for 220 with some pretty slack batting after we got to 130 for 3 was not ideal.
"We had a couple of chances the second morning and didn't take them, it cost us, then in the third innings the pitch was flat, we played some slack shots and it cost us.
"The only entertainment I want is winning entertainment.
"But we've had a lot of young players this year who are learning the game, we've got a number of senior players out (Jacques Rudolph, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke), and that's telling."
Gloucestershire coach Richard Dawson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We had a lot of people contributing, David Payne had an exceptional game with bat and ball, Hamish Marshall with his hundred.
"The pleasing thing and something we talked about last week, once we got on top in the game, was to make sure we take advantage.
"We played simple cricket, I thought we played the conditions very well and we've put pressure on the opposition with bat and ball and got the result.
"It's all about getting ready on match-day at this time of year, it's not a case of training, so we'll try and get up again against Northants."
