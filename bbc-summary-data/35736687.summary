Plan to train Denbighshire taxi drivers to spot abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Denbighshire taxi drivers may have to take mandatory training to spot child sexual exploitation, under new plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year, neighbouring Conwy introduced similar training for all licensed drivers.
Denbighshire said it had considered the inquiry into the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal - which said taxi drivers had played a "prominent role".
The proposal would include "drivers of taxis and private-hire vehicles".
Graham Boase, head of planning and public protection at Denbighshire, said the authority had "carefully considered" Prof Alexis Jay's inquiry, which looked at the abuse of more than 1,400 children in Rotherham.
His comments are contained in a report for a meeting of Denbighshire's licensing committee on Wednesday, where the plan will be considered.
Some 300 taxi drivers and operators in Conwy have attended training to spot child sexual exploitation since the launch of its scheme.
