[SN]TITLE[SN]
Merseyside drug crime rate higher than anywhere in England and Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Merseyside has the worst rate of drug crime in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were 6.1 drug crimes per 1,000 population in the region during the 12 months to March.
By contrast, Gloucestershire only had a drug crime rate of 1.6 per 1,000 people.
Overall, the Merseyside Police region had the fifth highest crime rate (70.1 per 1,000) of all forces in England and Wales - an annual increase of 4.2%.
It now ranks just behind third-ranked Greater Manchester Police's region, where there were 73.8 crimes per 1,000 population.
Merseyside's Asst Ch Con Ian Pilling said: "The force is committed to tackling the serious and organised criminals who are involved in the supply of illegal drugs on Merseyside and we will be relentless in our efforts to target those involved."
He said they were "naturally disappointed" to see a slight increase in crime, partly caused by vehicle crime offences, public order and violence.
There were 97,244 crimes reported in the year to March 2015 - up from 93,348 in the preceding 12 months.
