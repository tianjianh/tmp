Ross Moriarty believes Wales can go a long way to victory against France on Saturday if they can thwart the threat posed by number eight Louis Picamoles.

Gloucester's Moriarty is set to be the direct opponent to Northampton's Picamoles.
"We know if we can stop him on the front foot then we have got a good chance," said Moriarty.
"He is a huge man, a very experienced player. Hopefully we can do a job on him."
Moriarty added: "I have played against him when he has played for Northampton and he is a huge player for France.
"He is very similar to Nathan Hughes for England, one of their main ball-carriers."
Moriarty has earned praise for his displays during Wales' rollercoaster Six Nations campaign.
They have beaten Italy, then lost to England and Scotland, before redeeming themselves with victory over Ireland on Friday.
A win against France could see Wales finish second behind England if the already crowned champions beat Ireland in Dublin later in the day.
Scotland could also finish second as they bid farewell to coach Vern Cotter against Italy in Edinburgh at lunchtime.
Moriarty says the incentive of finishing second to Eddie Jones' side means Wales will go to Paris feeling the game is "definitely not" a dead rubber.
He added: "France have got everything to play for in their own back yard and we have got everything to play for.
"If results go our way we could still come second in the championship; it is a big game."
