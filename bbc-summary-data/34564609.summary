Swindon Town: Mark Cooper leaves League One club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon Town have parted company with manager Mark Cooper.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League One side's chairman Lee Power will take over on a temporary basis, reports BBC Wiltshire.
Swindon confirmed Cooper's departure after Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Millwall - their eighth successive game without victory.
The Robins are 20th in the table, above the relegation zone only on goal difference and without a win since 5 September.
Cooper had been in charge since August 2013, guiding the club to the play-offs last season where they lost 4-0 to Preston in the final.
