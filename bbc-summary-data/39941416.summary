Six thousand people will attend the Last Night of the Proms event in the National Trust property in Enniskillen.
The classical music show on 9 September will see internationally acclaimed musicians performing alongside the Ulster Orchestra, led by David Brophy.
Last year, the concert was staged at Belfast's Titanic Slipways.
The BBC Proms is the world's largest classical music festival, with more than 90 concerts and other events taking place over eight weeks across the UK.
The Northern Ireland Proms is in its 16th year, with Hillsborough, Carrickfergus and Bangor having hosted major outside broadcasts in previous years.
Audiences can expect "a very special evening" with the "very best in music-making" from the Castle Coole show, said BBC Northern Ireland director Peter Johnston.
"Proms in the Park is one of the most ambitious outside broadcasts and events we undertake each year, with huge demand for tickets year-on-year," he added.
The concert will be hosted by Claire McCollum and Noel Thompson, with key moments being broadcast live on BBC television and a highlights programme shown at a later date.
The show will also be live on BBC Radio Ulster.
Robert Gibson of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said Castle Coole is an "inspired choice" to mark the Last Night of the Proms.
