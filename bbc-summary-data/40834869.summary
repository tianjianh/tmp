[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Devante Cole's strike helped Fleetwood make it two wins out of two as they claimed a narrow win over Northampton at Sixfields.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game appeared to be drifting towards a goalless draw when a fine finish from Cole sent the three points Fleetwood's way and condemned Northampton to a second straight defeat.
The visitors made the brighter start and almost had an early lead when Cian Bolger's header was blocked on the line before David Cornell beat away Jordy Hiwula's drive.
But Northampton responded strongly and should have gone into half-time ahead when, after Chris Long twice went close, Fleetwood goalkeeper Alex Cairns pulled off a sensational triple save to deny Aaron Pierre twice and then Billy Waters, all from close-range.
Clear-cut chances were harder to come by in a scrappy second half but the game's only goal arrived with 15 minutes remaining.
Two substitutes combined as Aiden O'Neill won the ball in midfield and fed Cole, who clinically beat Cornell to earn all three points.
