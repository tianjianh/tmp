The annual inductees to the Hall of Fame includes both singles and album recordings, all of which must be at least 25 years old.
The recordings are chosen for their "historical and cultural significance".
Blondie's Heart of Glass, Joan Jett's I Love Rock 'n' Roll and Little Eva's The Loco-Motion are some of the popular tunes chosen to join the 2016 roster.
Among the albums are Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 album, Grateful Dead's American Beauty and Bob Dylan's The Basement Tapes.
Albums by jazz greats Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis and Fats Domino also make the list of titles joining the class of 2016, as selected by the Recording Academy, hosts of the annual Grammy Awards.
"Spanning more than 50 years, the 2016 Grammy Hall Of Fame entries are an outstanding collection, marked by both historical and cultural significance," said Recording Academy president Neil Portnow, in a statement.
"These works have influenced and inspired music fans for generations and we are proud to induct them into our catalogue of distinguished recordings."
