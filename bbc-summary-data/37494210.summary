Anna Swabey, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, died the day before she was due to marry Andy Bell.
Her target of raising £100,000 for Brain Tumour Research was reached on the day of her funeral.
"As much as it's tragic we didn't get to the wedding, it's not the end of the world," Mr Bell said.
"She got to plan the wedding, she had a hen do, she got to buy a dress."
Ms Swabey's final blog post on 8 July said chemotherapy had left her feeling unwell but her spirits had been lifted by her hen party in York.
The 25-year-old died on 16 September.
"With Anna's positive attitude - I never once thought she would be beaten by it," Mr Bell said.
"I'll always class her as my wife. I don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony. I'll have my memories and I'll always have that.
"I'll always be lucky for the time I had with Anna and she made me the happiest person in the world."
Ms Swabey said she wanted to "make a positive out of this negative situation" when she set the target of £100,000 on a fundraising page.
Following her diagnosis, she described her treatment in the blog Inside my Head.
In a blog post after her death her sister, Victoria Cartwright, said the family "shared as much time as they could" with her, "some lucid, mostly not, but all precious nonetheless".
Mr Bell and Ms Swabey's family spent the weekend at what would have been the wedding venue in Richmond.
