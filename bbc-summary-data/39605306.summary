[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brett Williams' double at Dover sensationally pulled Torquay out of the National League relegation zone with one match to go, as they returned home with victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Kinnear's hosts dominated possession in the first half but it was the Gulls who took the lead two minutes shy of the interval when Williams escaped his marker and headed powerfully past Mitch Walker.
The visitors built on their lead in the second half when Williams netted his second with a clinical strike on 69 minutes after a swift break.
Substitute Aswad Thomas restored hope for the Whites, nodding a decisive header over Brendan Moore, but the defeat left play-off qualification out of their hands.
