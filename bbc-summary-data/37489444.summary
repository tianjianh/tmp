[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Courts, a 37-year-old barrister from Bladon, Woodstock, is the deputy leader of West Oxfordshire District Council having first been elected in 2014. He says he wants to focus on transport - such as tackling safety and congestion on the A34 - affordable housing, education, superfast broadband provision and championing independent shops.
He says: "I believe it is vital that Witney and West Oxfordshire residents continue to have a strong local voice in Parliament and I will work tirelessly to ensure that residents' views and concerns are heard."
Duncan Enright is a West Oxfordshire councillor and stood against David Cameron in 2015. He prematurely announced his defeat in the local elections in May, before a bundle of missing ballots was found. Focusing on education, transport and health, he says he wants to ensure Witney "continues to thrive for everyone".
He says: "A lot of David Cameron's time is taken up with national and international issues, and that's been to the detriment of West Oxfordshire."
Liz Leffman has been a West Oxfordshire councillor for the Charlbury and Finstock ward, and was the Lib Dem candidate for Witney in 2005. She runs her own company, which offers advice to businesses trading with other EU countries. She aims to campaign to save hospital services in Banbury, Chipping Norton and Witney and local bus transport. She is also pro-Europe.
She says: "I am clear that for the sake of jobs and the future of young people, Witney will be better off in Europe."
Dickie Bird served in the Army with the Royal Green Jackets, now The Rifles. More recently, he was head porter at Oxford's Oriel College. He stood as UKIP's candidate for Banbury at the 2015 general election. He says he wants to "do more to look after all those who have lived and paid tax here for years".
"On leaving, [the Army] I found the local council very unhelpful. This made me realise that in order to change things for people, it is no good railing at the radio and TV and sitting back; instead I felt that I had to get involved and do something to make things better."
Larry Sanders is the Oxford-based brother of Bernie Sanders, who fought Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic presidential candidate in this year's US election. Originally from New York, he is a social worker and lawyer, aiming to reduce inequality and increase the use of renewable energy to combat climate change.
He says he is also committed to bringing the NHS fully back into public hands, protecting public services in Witney and backing local campaigns for a light railway to ease congestion on the A40.
Winston McKenzie, a former boxer and Celebrity Big Brother housemate, is standing for the English Democrats, having previously fought elections for UKIP, among others.
The English Democrats call for the creation of a parliament for England and further devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Adam Knight is an entrepreneur and angel investor, as well as a trustee at London's Roundhouse performing arts venue.
He says, ahead of polling day, he has time to "build a new movement: investing to create prosperity and opportunity for all in society".
Dr Helen Salisbury is an Oxford GP and lecturer at Oxford University Medical School, and stood as the NHA candidate in Oxford West and Abingdon in 2015. She campaigns to end privatisation of parts of the NHS, and increase funding for health and social care.
She says: "The NHS is valued and relied on by all my patients, whatever their politics. The medical students and junior doctors I teach do not want their future to be in multinational healthcare corporations but in the NHS, publicly provided, free and fair."
Emilia Arno was raised in Luxembourg and moved to the UK six years ago, to pursue an academic career in arts and education. The One Love Party calls itself "techprogressive" and aims to "unite humanity for world peace". Ms Arno says she felt "it was about time that the youth have an official political platform from which to express their views and get their voices heard".
It campaigns strongly for emergency action to deal with what it calls the air pollution pandemic.
Daniel Skidmore is a fitness instructor from Witney. He has recently been involved in a campaign to save the derelict Witney football stadium from being turned into an office complex, and has criticised the "parachuting" in of candidates into the contest from outside the area.
Nicholas Ward is standing on a single issue, opposing the HS2 rail project. He says he wants the money to be spent on improvements to existing rail infrastructure and on the NHS. "I believe this High Speed 2 project is a huge mistake and want to try to stop it before it is too late," he says.
"I hope to rekindle the spirit shown in the recent referendum and to provide an opportunity for Witney voters to send a strong signal to the established parties that they do not want their taxes spent on grandiose vanity projects and that there are better ways of spending such huge sums of their money."
David Bishop has been fighting for votes since taking on Neil Hamilton in Tatton in 1987. Among other issues, he calls for a tax on junk food and fizzy drinks and better daytime television for people on benefits. His greatest success came in 2014 when he beat the Liberal Democrats in a local council by-election.
He says: "Apart from being a keen fan of Elvis, I'm also interested in green issues such as global warming, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the attempts by Tesco to take over the high street."
Mad Hatter stood in the 2015 general election in Oxford East, and previously for Oxford City Council in 2014. He has previously called for the House of Lords to be rebranded as "The House of Humpty-Dumpty and all the King's Horses and all the King's Men", as well as reducing the minimum voting age to eight.
Lord Toby Jug (real name Brian Borthwick) founded The Eccentric Party of Great Britain in 2015 after leaving the Monster Raving Loony Party. Among his policies are to introduce slot machines on electronic gadgets to stop children spending so much time playing with them and "text lanes" to stop mobile phone users walking into lampposts.
He says: "We love to prick the balloon of pomposity of the major established political parties and highlight the arrogance and folly of their policies with a large custard pie in the face."
