A newly established group has been chosen by Brighton and Hove City Council to run the parade and ticketed festival in Preston Park.
Pride Brighton and Hove will donate Â£1 of every ticket sold to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender charities.
In areport the council said the event had not been "financially successful"for the previous organisers, Pride South East.
The event, which is usually held in August, will now take place on 1 September due to pressures from the London 2012 Olympics.
One of the organisers, Michael Deol, said the festival was integral to Brighton's economy.
"The annual event has ensured a fantastic summer boom for businesses across the city from guest houses and hotels to restaurants, shops and clubs," he said.
A council spokeswoman said it received two proposals for running Pride.
"Pride Brighton and Hove are a new community interest company that has committed to ring fence a proportion of ticket income from the planned park event to go directly to charity to benefit the local LGBT community," she said.
"Pride is an important event for the city - not only for residents and visitors but also our economy."
