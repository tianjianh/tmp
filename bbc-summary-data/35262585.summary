The owl was flying above a motorway in Montreal when it swooped in front of the camera, posing perfectly.
Barbara Frei, the director of the McGill Bird Observatory in Montreal, told Canadian local news that the owl was probably looking for a place to perch.
She said that owls sometimes fly along motorways because they are a good place to find small prey, like rodents, which they hunt.
