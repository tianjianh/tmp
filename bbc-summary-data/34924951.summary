[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who died after falling headfirst into a drain had been trying to retrieve something while high on drugs, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Carpenter, 25, of Nantlle, Gwynedd, fell in while walking home from a friend's in Talysarn on 6 June.
A Caernarfon inquest heard he had taken enough heroin, cocaine and diazepam to kill someone not used to them.
He died of asphyxiation caused by drowning. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.
Mr Carpenter's friend Geynfor Jones told the inquest he had tried to convince him to stay at his house as he had fallen asleep in the road the previous evening.
But the gardener insisted on leaving and had only gone a few yards before lifting a heavy storm drain cover and reaching in head first.
His body was found when a team of refuse collectors spotted his legs sticking out of the drain the next morning.
PC Alexander Higgins said nothing was found when the fire service pumped out the drain, but he believed Mr Carpenter had dropped an item too small to detect.
Senior coroner for north west Wales, Dewi Pritchard Jones, said the circumstances were something he had never come across before.
"He was trying to get at something in that drain. What he was trying to get, we can't say," he said.
"Once he got to a certain point he slid in and there was no way out."
