[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sex accused teacher Christopher Hird banned from schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A science teacher who had sex with a pupil and had "sexually-motivated" interactions with other female students over several years has been banned from teaching indefinitely.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Hird, 51, who had worked at Longcroft High School in Beverley and South Holderness Technology College near Hull, did not attend the hearing.
The disciplinary panel heard he repeatedly touched some female pupils.
In 2013 Mr Hird was cleared of sex assault charges at Hull Crown Court.
In a ruling published by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, the panel said Mr Hird had made "serious departure from the personal and professional conduct elements of the Teacher's Standards".
The panel said: "It has considered that Mr Hird's conduct seriously affected the well-being of pupils.
"The underlying incidents giving rise to the allegations were not isolated and involved a number of pupils and events over a period of several years.
"Mr Hird's conduct involved an abuse of his position or trust and his conduct involved a violation of the rights of pupils.
"In addition some of Mr Hird's actions were sexually motivated."
Announcing its judgement, the disciplinary panel said: "This means that Mr Christopher Hird is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England.
"Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against him... Christopher Hird shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach."
