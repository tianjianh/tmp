Rio 2016: GB Boxing rejects Chris Eubank Jr Olympics approach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
GB Boxing has rejected an approach from Chris Eubank Sr about his son competing at the Rio Olympics this summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Eubank Jr, the 26-year-old British middleweight champion, is eligible for Rio after a rule change allowed professionals to compete.
But GB Boxing said amateur middleweight Anthony Fowler, 25, would represent Team GB in that weight category.
Fowler secured his place at Rio 2016 by beating German opponent Xhek Paskali at the European qualifier in April.
Eubank Jr will make  the first defence of his British title against Welshman Tom Doran at The O2 in London on 25 June.
