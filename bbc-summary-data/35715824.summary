Former Liverpool owner David Moores beaten by burglars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Liverpool owner David Moores has been attacked during a violent burglary at his home in west Lancashire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was taken to hospital with head and leg injuries after two men forced their way into his house in Halsall.
The raiders ran off with jewellery and watches, said police, who described it as an "isolated, targeted attack".
Mr Moores, 69, a member of Merseyside's Littlewoods Pools dynasty, sold the Anfield club to American duo George Gillett and Tom Hicks in 2007.
Fenway Sports Group bought the club from them in 2010.
Mr Moores was taken to Aintree hospital after the break-in on Wednesday night.
Anyone with information about the burglary is urged to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers.
