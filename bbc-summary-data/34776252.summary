Taylor Swift 'settles Lucky 13 logo row'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pop star Taylor Swift has settled a legal disagreement with a US clothing company over her use of its Lucky 13 name, reports have said.

Blue Sphere accused Swift of copyright infringement after she branded some of her products, such as t-shirts, with the same phrase.
She has famously said in the past that 13 is her "lucky" number.
Representatives for both sides said they had made an undisclosed settlement out of court on Friday.
Legal papers were filed in 2014 and a trial date had been set for January 2016, prior to the settlement being reached.
US clothing firm Blue Sphere claimed in May last year that the pop star had began marketing and selling her own clothing line bearing the Lucky 13 phrase and a shamrock.
It also said she had used it in a "Lucky 13" sweepstake deal made with a greeting card company, said Hollywood Reporter.
Swift told MTV in 2009: "I was born on the 13th. I turned 13 on Friday the 13th. My first album went gold in 13 weeks. My first number one song had a 13-second intro," she said. "Every time I've won an award I've been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter."
Swift said she was being harassed by the company after it said it wanted to question her about her use and understanding of trademark rights and sponsorships.
She also said she would not be able to submit to demands that she give evidence at a trial due to her busy tour schedule.
Blue Sphere began investigating Swift's deals with big brand companies including Elizabeth Arden and Coco-Cola.
It also wanted the right to examine photographs and videos of Swift in which her buttocks or breasts were at least partially visible in order to understand her personal control over her brand and image.
Blue Sphere's argument was that Swift's image was relevant to the Lucky 13 case and the company's doubt over the pop star's understanding of consumer impact.
In August, a federal judge denied Swift's harassment claim and request for a protective order to prevent her being forced to answer questions and the trial date was set.
The Lucky 13 case is the third recent legal case involving Swift.
Earlier this month legal papers were filed against her for damages of $42m (Â£27m) for Swift's alleged theft of the lyrics to US R&B singer Jesse Braham's hit 2014 song Shake It Off.
Braham claimed in legal papers Swift stole the words from a song he wrote in 2013 called Haters Gone Hate.
And last month, Swift filed a counterclaim against a US radio DJ who is suing her over allegations he groped her backstage at a concert in June 2013.
