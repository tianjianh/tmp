The 34-year-old made 412 appearances in all competitions for 12 different clubs, including Wolves, Blackburn and Bolton, who released him in May.
He also had two spells with MK Dons, helping them win the League Two title and Johnstone's Paint Trophy in 2008.
Andrews earned 35 international caps for the Republic, scoring three times.
He had a brief loan spell at Stadium:MK towards the end of last season, but the club confirmed he would not be registered as a player for 2015-16.
Instead he will work alongside Dons boss Karl Robinson and head of coaching Richie Barker for the club's first season in the Championship.
"I absolutely love my new role and this is the perfect place for me to start learning," he told the MK Dons website.
"I'm just obsessed with football. I never switch off for a second - even when I'm watching a game at home on the sofa, I'm analysing it.
"I'm just looking to evolve as I go along and it certainly won't be through a lack of effort if I don't get to where I want to go to."
