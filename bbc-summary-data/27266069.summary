Police were called to Cwmcarn High school, Caerphilly county, on Thursday after concerns were raised about the behaviour of two children.
A 15-year-old girl from Newbridge and a 14-year-old girl from Risca were arrested and bailed.
The teacher, Alison Cray, 46, said she had been working as normal since.
"It was all handled before it got to me," said the maths teacher.
"I know very little about it. It all happened elsewhere and I wasn't directly involved at all.
"I've very lucky that I'm at Cwmcarn and that they have handled it so well. I've been working as normal and I'm fine."
Ms Cray has been at the school for more than 10 years.
Gwent Police officers were called just before lunchtime on Thursday but there was no physical confrontation when officers arrived.
Nobody was harmed as a result of the incident and the matter was resolved peacefully.
Police said the 15-year-old pupil was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill, possession of a bladed article on school premises and conspiracy to commit murder.
The second girl was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
Both have been released on bail while the police continue their investigation.
A statement on the school's website from head teacher Jacqui Peplinski following the arrests said: "Please be assured that the concerns were dealt with swiftly.
"There was no risk to any staff or learner and the relevant support services were contacted as a precautionary measure.
"Cwmcarn High is a caring and safe environment and we are committed to everyone's safety. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns."
A spokesman for Caerphilly council and the school said support had been put in place for pupils and staff.
"We would like to assure parents that all appropriate steps were taken to respond effectively to the situation. We are now helping the police with their inquiries," the statement added.
