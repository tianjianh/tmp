Leyton Orient defender Mathieu Baudry has turned down a new contract, while the League Two club have released seven other players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielders Lloyd James and Bradley Pritchard and wingers Jobi McAnuff and Blair Turgott have not been retained by the east London club.
Goalkeeper Gary Woods and defenders Frazer Shaw and Connor Essam will also leave the O's when their deals expire.
However, Orient have taken up an option in defender Nicky Hunt's contract.
The 32-year-old former Bolton, Bristol City and Accrington right-back will remain at the Matchroom Stadium until the summer of 2017.
Centre-back Baudry, 28, scored 10 goals in 157 appearances for the O's after joining from Bournemouth in the summer of 2012, while James, also 28, netted 11 times in 138 outings.
Former Gillingham boss Andy Hessenthaler remains in interim charge of Orient, who finished eighth in League Two, after player-boss Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial responsibilities in mid-April.
Midfielder Nolan, 33, has two years remaining on his contract with Orient but did not feature for the first team after being stripped of his coaching duties.
