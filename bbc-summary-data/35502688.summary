A lorry driver called rescuers at about 12:00 on Thursday after spotting the blue and tan Yorkshire terrier underneath a bridge near the Checkbar roundabout in Bonnybridge.
Community safety officer Paul Crawford waded into the river to save the dog which is now in the care of a shelter.
It is not known how long it was stranded.
Animal rescue officer Ashley Griffin said:  "The dog is male, around one to three years old, and was wearing a rusty orange-coloured collar.
"He was a little frightened at first but is doing well.
"We'd like to thank the kind man who helped rescue the dog and hope that we can reunite him with his owner soon."
The dog was said to be in good condition. It is being cared for at Bandeath Stray Dog Shelter in Stirling.
Anyone who recognises it is asked to contact the Scottish SPCA.
