Stuart Hogg's 16th Test try gave the Scots an early lead but Gael Fickou's try put France 13-5 clear before two Finn Russell penalties made it 13-11.
Tim Swinson's try regained the lead for the injury-hit visitors before Camille Lopez's third penalty tied it at 16-16.
Remi Lamerat had a try ruled out before two late Lopez kicks sealed victory.
Scotland salvaged a bonus point despite suffering a host of injuries, with captain Greig Laidlaw, flanker John Barclay, his replacement John Hardie and hooker Fraser Brown all trooping off.
They must now regroup for the visit of Wales on 25 February (14:25 GMT), while France head to Dublin to face Ireland on the same day (16:50 GMT).
This was a surreal Test, a day when Scotland's scrum was routinely demolished - it gave France six penalties and a free-kick - and when the visitors lost one captain, Laidlaw, to injury, lost his deputy, Barclay, then lost Barclay's replacement Hardie.
The Scots dropped like flies and yet they hung on gamely. They lived off scraps and yet were still banging away at the death hoping against hope for an opening that never came.
It all began with a Lopez penalty quickly cancelled out by a Hogg try when Huw Jones drew in Lopez and off-loaded to the full-back, who fixed Baptiste Serin and went over in the corner. Laidlaw's conversion hit the crossbar and stayed out.
Lopez put the French back in the lead at the end of the first quarter and it was then that Laidlaw went off, a cruel blow for Scotland, a setback that was only added to when Fickou scored on the half-hour.
It had been coming. France had threatened and had wasted some opportunities beforehand, but when the Toulouse centre went in under Hogg's tackle there was no stopping him.
The conversion was added and the gap stretched to eight points. Credit Scotland. Tommy Seymour won the restart and the Scots forced a penalty, which Russell put over.
Then he banged over another one just before the break. Quite how they were only two points down was a mystery.
The second injury blow had landed by then, the stand-in captain, Barclay, exiting with a head knock.
Hardie came on and went off again within minutes of the second half beginning. Another head knock. Poor Hardie. The man has suffered badly with concussions in his career.
Remarkably, Scotland brushed off that upset and hit the front again a few minutes later. A brilliant offload from Russell released the razor-sharp Seymour up the right touchline, chipping and chasing and getting the benefit of a kindly bounce in his tussle with Scott Spedding.
Seymour found Swinson steaming downfield on his lonesome and no sooner had he come on the field for Hardie, he scored.
Even more remarkably, Russell missed the conversion from almost touching distance of the posts. The kicking tee took too long to reach him and when it did he lost composure, with someone - believed to be Scotland resource coach Nathan Hines - urging him to 'Take it, take it'.

The ball was placed unsteadily on its mark, then flopped over as Russell was about to kick it. His effort had a dead duck quality, going under the posts instead of over.
Scotland had precious little ball after that. The French took control and those scrum horrors carried on. The visitors were clinging on from a long way out.
Lopez made it 16-16 with the boot and as Scotland became ragged under pressure, and started making some poor decisions, the fly-half steered them home. Two more penalties - in the 71st and 76th minutes - gave France their win.
On a monstrously testing day, Scotland contented themselves with a losing bonus point.  In the circumstances, it was an achievement.
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: "It was a physical encounter. Quite a few times we came off second best.
"The boys stuck in defensively and defended our line well. But a couple of times maybe we weren't accurate enough."
On Finn Russell's missed conversion: "It was only two points and it didn't really matter. At the end it was a six-point game."
France full-back Scott Spedding: "It was a scrappy affair and we made a lot of mistakes in the first half. We couldn't get our game-plan into place.
"But we desperately needed a win. We are disappointed with our performance but happy with the win."
Former Scotland international Andy Nicol: "There was a lot of good stuff from Scotland. They were up against a huge French pack, there was some really courageous defence, but ultimately they lost the game.
"This is where Scotland are at the moment, they have the confidence and ability to win these tight games now. They didn't today, but it will come."
