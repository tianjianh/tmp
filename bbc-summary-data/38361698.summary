Solihull Moors 3-2 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull Moors came from behind to end 10-man Chester's unbeaten seven-match National League run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elliott Durrell fired City ahead, just two minutes after team-mate Jonny Hunt's disputed early straight red card for a slide tackle on Shepherd Murombedzi.
But the Moors levelled just before half-time when Omari Sterling-James curled in a free-kick after Tom Shaw had been harshly penalised for handball.
Harry White then volleyed in on 56 minutes before Sterling-James rounded the keeper 13 minutes later to score from a narrow angle.
City substitute Kane Richards pulled one back in injury time but, by then, the strain of playing a man short from the 16th minute onwards had told.
The two sides meet again at Bumpers Lane on New Year's Day, for which Hunt is now automatically suspended.
