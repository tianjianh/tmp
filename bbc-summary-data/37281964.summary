Wales v Moldova: Player ratings after World Cup qualifier

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales swept Moldova aside with a comprehensive 4-0 win at the Cardiff City Stadium to get their World Cup 2018 qualifying campaign off to the perfect start.

Manager Chris Coleman began with nine of the 11 players who started their Euro 2016 semi-final defeat by Portugal in July - but who impressed and who had a quieter evening?
The Crystal Palace keeper could have taken a seat in the stands and the outcome of the game would probably have been much the same.
Helped Wales press Moldova high up the field with an energetic attacking display and could have won a penalty when he was tripped in the area in the first half.
With Moldova sitting deep, the Aston Villa defender saw a lot of the ball and used it wisely.
One of the captain's easiest evenings in a Wales shirt, barely troubled by Moldova's attackers and comfortable on the ball.
Confident in possession, the Tottenham defender showed no signs of rust despite not playing for his club this season.
Like Gunter, pushed forward to good effect and might have added to his tally of one international goal had his shooting been more accurate.
The heartbeat of Wales' midfield capped another industrious and creative display with his first goal for his country.
Typically neat on the ball, forming a solid midfield partnership with Allen, for whom he provided a first international goal with a well-taken corner.
One of the Leicester midfielder's better performances for Wales, playing some razor-sharp passes and breaking into promising attacking positions.
The Real Madrid forward was not at his absolute best but he intimidated Moldova's defence with his direct running and took his first goal ruthlessly.
Finished well with his head to break Moldova's stout resistance and led Wales' attack with energy and physicality.
The new Cardiff City signing filled Ledley's role with a similarly tidy range of passing.
Missed a good chance late on but a lively performance considering the new West Brom striker had been without a club until Wednesday.
One shaky moment when his clearance was blocked in the Wales penalty area but that aberration did not prove costly.
