Research involving 1,000 children in Northern Ireland has suggested that one in five parents were "problem drinkers".

An apparent link between alcohol abuse and suicidal behaviour was also identified.
In all, three studies into the suicide and alcohol abuse were commissioned by the Public Health Agency.
Key findings on suicide showed rates were higher in Belfast and other larger towns and cities.
Almost half of those who take their own lives in Northern Ireland have made a previous attempt or have had a history of suicidal thoughts, the research suggests.
When it comes to alcohol abuse, families often felt a stigma when trying to get help and GPs said time and a lack of coordination led to problems accessing services.
A study carried out over 10 years from 2001, involving 1,000 children and 1,097 parents, found that one in five parents were "problem drinkers".
Those families experienced more separations and divorces. Their children were found to spend more time outside the home and felt less attachment to school.
The report also showed that children developed clear strategies to help them cope with their parents' drinking.
It stresses that schools and teachers should be more aware of these problems.
The three research studies were carried out by teams at the University of Ulster and Queen's University, Belfast.
Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was "vitally important" that policy makers listened carefully to the messages in the research studies.
"Doing so will ensure that future service delivery improves the care of people impacted by either of these devastating problems," he said.
"More importantly, we must all ensure we work together towards eliminating these problems from society altogether."
Dr Janice Bailie from the PHA said: "The research we are publishing today is testament to the commitment in Northern Ireland of individuals and organisations trying to understand more about these emotive and important issues.
"For anyone who has been affected by the suicide of a loved one or by the misuse of alcohol we hope that today's conference reinforces the message that we are all committed to tackling these issues and in ensuring that all the invaluable information being gathered is available and being used to translate into visible and beneficial actions."
