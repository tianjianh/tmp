Tweedbank welcomes the Queen for Borders Railway opening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Just head to the top of the hill and then follow the noise."

You might think those directions are a little bit vague but they actually turned out to be perfect.
On any other day, I am sure, there would not have been the same hubbub around Tweedbank station.
But this was the official opening of the Borders Railway and the Queen was coming to town in a steam train.
So, having taken a scenic stroll around Gunknowe Loch, it really was just a case of following the crowds - and the noise they provided.
They are a patient bunch in the Borders, that's for sure.
For such a large gathering, there was relatively low-key groan when it was announced that the royal party would be an hour or so late.
There were still bands to perform, a very detailed history of the railway to be recounted and - whisper it - the odd sneaky glass of wine to be consumed.
It all helped the time to pass beneath a grey sky which threatened rain but never, thankfully, delivered it.
A cheer went up at the news that the royal train had made up a little time and was leaving Newtongrange and, not too long afterwards, there was excitement at a signal from the skies that a regal arrival was imminent.
"You'd think they'd never seen a helicopter before," quipped one spectator.
It heralded the arrival of the train, with a large puff of steam appearing along the line from Galashiels.
The flags were waved with a little more fervour as a first glimpse of a blue hat appeared.
Cameras, mobile phones and selfie-sticks flew up into the air in an effort to capture the historic moment.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon thanked the Queen for carrying out the official opening and also offered congratulations on becoming Britain's longest serving monarch.
And then the Queen herself delivered words of recognition of both the significance of the railway and the kind messages she had received on reaching such a landmark.
As is traditional on such occasions, a small plaque was unveiled and then the royal party moved on.
The crowd, too, began to filter away having seen the official opening of the 30-odd mile rail link between this part of the Borders and Edinburgh.
Passengers have already been travelling along the route for a few days but a visit from the Queen seemed to bring the reality of the significance of the project home to everyone.
The crowd drifted away and the noise died down but, after all the ceremony, the station will remain.
The 46-year wait for the return of rail services to the Borders has officially ended - and that is of major importance to this region and neighbouring Midlothian.
It might be a while until the route carries such a famous passenger again but it will now get on with the job of delivering the benefits that many hope and believe it can deliver.
