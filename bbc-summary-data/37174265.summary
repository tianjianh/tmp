The 30-year-old 6ft 6in enforcer, born in Montreal, played 136 games for Colorado in the NHL between 2012 and 2015.
"He was sold on everything this organisation and city has to offer," said Devils player coach Andrew Lord.
"Patrick Bordeleau brings an awesome dynamic of size, energy and physical play."
Lord added: "Despite having some good interest from teams in North America, Patrick was looking for a new opportunity overseas.
"This signing shows just how far the Cardiff Devils have come over the last two seasons and I'm so proud to see the hard work of our organisation and the undying support from our fan base get rewarded with this massive addition."
The Devils begin their season at Manchester Storm on Saturday, 10 September in the Challenge Cup.
