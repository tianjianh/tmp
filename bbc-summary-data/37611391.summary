Marc Warren has thanked a £30 golf training aid he stumbled upon while surfing the internet for saving his European Tour card for next season.

The 35-year-old Scot finished fifth at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday to ease his fears.
"I actually saw a training aid online and I found one, believe it or not, at the range I practise at - Mearns Castle," Warren said.
"I tried it, bought two of them online and I warmed up every day using it."
Warren was ranked 48th in the world last year and had slumped to 214th before the latest event played over three courses in his homeland.
"Technically, there were a few things I wasn't happy with with my swing and, if they didn't get better, I would never be as consistent as I was inside the top 50 in the world," he said.
"You look back, a year ago I was top 50 in the world and it all snowballs and leads to frustration, but I feel like I've found something now that can really help me technically.
"I felt as if I could just go on the golf course and swing without really thinking about it, which was a big difference."
Finishing fifth behind Tyrrell Hatton, and picking up a cheque for £155,832, at St Andrews has not only lifted Warren to 176th in the world but meant a jump of 55 places to 70 in Europe's Race To Dubai.
It means that, instead of fighting to retain his tour card, Warren can chase a place in the 60-strong field at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in the Middle East.
"It proves the fact that, when I do get that feeling for it, I can hold my own in some really good competition like this week," he added.
"I can set my sights on some better things than just trying to keep my job I suppose."
