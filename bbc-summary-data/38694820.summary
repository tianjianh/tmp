England: Alex Hales to miss rest of India tour through injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England opener Alex Hales will miss the remainder of the tour of India after scans showed he has suffered a hand fracture.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old damaged his right hand during the second one-day international defeat by India on Thursday in Cuttack.
Right-hander Hales sustained the injury after attempting a catch in the outfield and jarring his hand on the ground.
He will return to England on Saturday and will see a hand surgeon next week.
The ECB said England will announce Hales' replacement in the Twenty-20 squad for the three-match series against India, starting on January 26, in "due course".
England play the final one-day game of their three-match series with India in Kolkata on Sunday.
They are yet to win on this tour, having lost four and drawn one of the five-match Test series that came before.
