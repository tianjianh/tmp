[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wiltshire pay and display car park 'never been used'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council-run pay and display car park in Wiltshire has never been used, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The county council, which is reviewing all of its car parks and ticket prices, made the announcement but declined to divulge the location.
John Thomson, who is responsible for the review, said: "There's one car park that has never had anybody park in it."
The council has identified 20 car parks as being "of non-strategic importance... or of low viability".
Five of these car parks are in Bradford-on-Avon, four are in Warminster, there are two in Devizes, two in Trowbridge, two in Westbury, and one each in Amesbury, Chippenham, Malmesbury, Marlborough and Melksham.
Cabinet member Mr Thomson said suggestions for the car parks, gained via a three-month public consultation, included having them grassed over, leased to town or parish councils or sold for other uses.
The council is expected to publish its report next month and has declined to comment further.
BBC Wiltshire breakfast show presenter Ben Prater has been searching for the one unused car park and has so far eliminated 11 - in Amesbury, Bradford-on-Avon, Warminster and Malmesbury - with the help of listeners.
Wiltshire Council receives Â£7.5m a year from parking fees, and invests a Â£2.75m surplus into transport and highways schemes.
In 2011 the authority increased parking costs as part of wider changes, but in October admitted mistakes had been made and said a county-wide review would be carried out.
