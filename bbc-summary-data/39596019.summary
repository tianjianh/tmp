Kevin Finch admitted attacking the 18-year-old in Niton on 7 October as well as assaults in 2003 and 2015.
The 36-year-old, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life in prison and told he must serve a minimum of 10 years.
He will also remain on the sex offenders register for life.
Hampshire Constabulary said following the attack in the car park off Old Blackgang Road, detectives were able to link Finch to further crimes.
In 2003 he indecently assaulted a woman in Newport and in 2015 he sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl in East Cowes.
He pleaded guilty to both attacks on 17 February.
Appearing at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday, Finch was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years for the Niton rape.
He was also sentenced to 32 months for the Newport assault and 24 months for the East Cowes attack, to be served concurrently.
Det Ch Insp Dave Brown said: "Finch pleaded guilty to all three offences. I hope the admission of guilt and life sentence can provide all of the victims with closure, so that they can move on with their lives.
"Thankfully these type of incidents are rare and I would like to reassure the community that the Isle of Wight remains a safe place to live and to visit."
