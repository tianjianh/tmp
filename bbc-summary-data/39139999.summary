The 23-year-old midfielder sat out last season's final defeat by Barnsley because he was suspended.
But after the U's 3-2 win at Luton Town on Wednesday, Oxford are heading back to Wembley to face Coventry City.
"I am just over the moon that I can finally get the chance to go and put it right this year," said Lundstram.
"Last year was disappointing for us, even me in the stands, so if we can go there this year and do one better than that would be perfect," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
Oxford, who also reached the FA Cup fifth round before losing to Premier League side Middlesbrough. will face the Sky Blues at Wembley on 2 April.
"You do not play at Wembley at often, so to get the opportunity again twice in two seasons, we want to try and make sure that we do it this time around," said head coach Michael Appleton.
