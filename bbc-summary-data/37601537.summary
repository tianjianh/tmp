Crofting Commission convener Colin Kennedy 'will not stand down'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The convener of Scotland's Crofting Commission has reiterated he will not stand down amid a heated public dispute over common grazings - unless he is forced to by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, the board of crofting's regulatory body apologised for its handling of the dispute with crofters.
It also asked convener Colin Kennedy to resign.
But Mr Kennedy told BBC Scotland's Sunday Politics Scotland he was staying in the post.
The dispute relates to the running of common grazings, including at Mangersta and Upper Coll on Lewis.
Mr Kennedy said: "I have no intention of resigning.
"As matters stand, I believe the commission have acted wholly within the law at all times and until such times as we have legal advice to the contrary, I will maintain my position."
Last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish government ministers had the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled commission.
She said ministers would not ordinarily get involved in the internal operations of the commission.
However, during First Minister's Questions in Holyrood on Thursday, she said legislation did give them the power to intervene if required.
