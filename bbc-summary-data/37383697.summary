Torquay United players drive themselves to away game to save costs

Torquay United's players are driving themselves to Saturday's away trip to Boreham Wood as the club cannot afford both a coach and a night in a hotel.

The cash-strapped National League club is still looking for new owners.
With finances tight, Nicholson asked the players whether they would prefer to be driven or have an overnight stay.
"Obviously it's not perfect but it's the position we are in where every penny counts at the club right now," Nicholson wrote on Facebook.
"I'm proud that the players are willing to do whatever it takes to give themselves the best chance of winning and that how it looks comes second to what's most important."
It takes just over four hours to drive the 227 miles between Torquay and Boreham Wood in a car, and up to two hours more in a coach - something Nicholson felt was not ideal ahead on the morning of a game.
"I asked if I could use the budget for the coach for a hotel instead, which the chairman kindly agreed to," added Nicholson.
"I then put it to the players as it is their preparation and their petrol money to get there. To a man they all went for, what I fully believe, to be the best preparation and took the hotel stay."
Devon-based Torquay have some of the longest away trips over the course of a season - their closest away trip is 125 miles to Forest Green Rovers - and cut costs on away travel last season when Nicholson drove a minibus with the players in to away matches.
