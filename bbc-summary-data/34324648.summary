[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who fantasised about "putting a bullet in Prince Charles's head" has been convicted of plotting a mass cyanide attack from his bedroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Colborne, 37, of Southampton, was found guilty of preparing terrorist acts after a retrial. A previous jury failed to reach a verdict.
The trial heard how Colborne had felt "belittled" for being ginger and white.
Judge John Bevan accepted a majority verdict at the Old Bailey and will sentence Colborne on 3 November.
The verdict was reached by a majority of ten to two jurors after more than 14 hours of deliberations.
They found him guilty of possessing handwritten notes and books related to making recipes for lethal poisons such as cyanide.
He bought the ingredients over the internet, and stockpiled dust masks, metal filter funnels, plastic syringes and latex gloves at his home in Butts Road, jurors were told.
However, Colborne was cleared of intending to use the chemicals and paraphernalia as part of the terror plot.
The court heard Colborne felt alienated and marginalised for being a white, ginger-haired man and also suffered from agoraphobia and depression.
In his notebook, he wrote about carrying out the assassination of Prince Charles so that Prince Harry could be king.
"I don't want to be a serial killer. I'm more of an Anders Breivik. I have left potential targets open.
"I was waiting for an opportunity to kill one of them. Let it be Prince Charles which would be good," he wrote.
He added he wanted a "silent rifle...take up a good position and put a bullet in Charles's head".
Prosecutor Annabel Darlow said Colborne's notes expressed hatred for "non-Aryans" whom he referred to as "blacks and Caucasian idiots".
Judge Bevan said: "It is a very strange case involving, if I may say it, a very strange person."
Colborne was arrested on 3 June last year after his half-brother and mother uncovered chemicals and papers detailing his racial hatred stashed in his bedroom.
