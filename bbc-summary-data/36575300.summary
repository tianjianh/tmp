Yaya Toure: Inter Milan keen on Manchester City player

Inter Milan are keen to sign Manchester City's veteran title-winning midfielder Yaya Toure.

The 33-year-old Ivorian has a year remaining on his contract at the Etihad.
He was sold to City, then managed by current Inter boss Roberto Mancini, for £24m by Pep Guardiola in 2010, when the pair were at Barcelona.
Terms are still to be agreed and a source said it was '50-50' whether the transfer would go through.
New City boss Guardiola is not due to be unveiled by the club for another fortnight.
He is working hard on reshaping his squad, though, with midfielder Ilkay Gundogan - a £20m capture from Borussia Dortmund - unlikely to be his last signing.
Speculation about Toure's future has been rife, given his previous discarding by Guardiola, although the Ivorian has indicated a willingness to work with the man who selected him in central defence for the 2009 Champions League final win over Manchester United.
Inter see Toure as the kind of big name that would push them back into Europe's elite.
The club have struggled since winning the 2010 Champions League final under Jose Mourinho and failed to qualify for this season's Champions League following a fourth-place finish in Serie A.
However, manager Mancini now has the extra financial backing supplied by Inter's new Chinese owners, the Suning Commerce Group.
The company has taken a 70% stake in Inter as part of an overall 750m-euro (£590m) deal.
