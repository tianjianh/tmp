In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 2% at 22,888.17.
Earlier, the benchmark Shanghai Composite closed up 2.32% at 3,338.07.
Analysts said that investors were hoping for new stimulus moves after disappointing economic data from China this week.
"There seem to be considerable expectations of further economic stimulus, which could mitigate some of deflationary pressures," said analysts Gerry Alfonso from Shenwan Hongyuan Securities.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei index closed up 1.15% at 18,096.90 boosted by speculation the US Federal Reserve will put off raising rates for the moment.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.63% at 5,230 points, even after disappointing unemployment numbers which showed 5,100 jobs were lost in September. Economists had predicted a gain of 9,600 jobs.
However, Australia's unemployment rate held steady at 6.2%.
After closing lower on Wednesday, South Korea's benchmark Kospi index closed up 1.18% at 2,033.27.
