[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of murdering a suspected drug dealer in an alleged "contract killing".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Dosiuk, 33 was shot dead at his home in Laneham Avenue, Nottingham, in November 2013.
A jury at Nottingham Crown Court found Michael Furniss, 50, guilty after more than a week of deliberations.
During the six week trial, the court heard Furniss, of no fixed address, had gone to Mr Dosiuk's home on 11 November last year and shot him three times.
The prosecution claimed that Furniss had been hired as a hit man by his friend James Stacey, 30, who was under increasing pressure to pay Mr Dosiuk Â£7,000 as part of a drugs debt.
A third man, Stuart Hall, 23, had acted as a middle man, said prosecutor David Herbert.
Mr Hall of Forest Road, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire and Mr Stacey of Seeley Avenue, Nottingham, were cleared of murder charges.
Furniss's barrister Icah Peart said 33-year-old Mr Dosiuk had many enemies.
He said Mr Dosiuk had also been awaiting trial for the supply of cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine and ketamine but was killed days before it was due to start.
Furniss will be sentenced on Thursday.
