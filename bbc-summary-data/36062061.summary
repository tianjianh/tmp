[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Rio 2016 Olympic Games opening ceremony takes place on Friday evening with Wales boasting a record number of athletes at an overseas Olympics.

London 2012 champions Jade Jones and Geraint Thomas lead the 23-strong Welsh contingent spread across 11 sports.
"They include current and former World, European and British champions," said Sport Wales chief Sarah Powell.
A record 30 Welsh athletes competed in London while the previous record for an overseas Games was 17 at Athens 2004.
The most successful Olympics for Welsh athletes was the 1920 Antwerp Games where Christopher Jones and Paulo Radmilovic won water polo gold while John Ainsworth-Davies and Cecil Griffiths were in the title-winning 4x400m relay team.
London 2012 was the largest overall Welsh medal haul of seven, when taekwondo star Jade Jones, cyclist Geraint Thomas and rower Tom James won gold, boxer Fred Evans, rower Chris Bartley and sailor Hannah Mills claimed silver, while Sarah Thomas won bronze in the hockey.
Sport Wales - the body responsible for developing and promoting sport and physical activity in Wales and distributing Lottery funds - has a rolling medal target of six to 10 medals across two Olympic Games cycles.
Taekwondo's 57kg class world number one Jade Jones is the only Welsh athlete defending their title.
Double team pursuit track champion cyclist Thomas will compete in the road race at the 2016 Games and he is set to be the first Welsh athlete in action in Rio on Saturday, 6 August - the day after the opening ceremony.
Here are the Welsh athletes who have qualified for the 31st Olympic Games in Brazil:
