Latest news on the fire and other stories
Harry Hodgson, who was on a train which pulled into St Erth station, said the "huge black smog" could be seen from a mile away.
"It just erupted and basically took a huge building out within minutes and all of a sudden it was just an uncontrollable inferno, a massive blaze", he said.
Mr Hodgson said "the general mood was excitement" because no one had been injured and people were "enjoying the power and the beauty of the fire".
Great Western Railway said the St Erth station and the St Ives train branch would be closed all day. Disruption is expected on services between Truro and Penzance until the end of service.
People living in the area have been advised to close windows and remain indoors owing to the large plumes of thick, black smoke.
