Ann Maguire stabbing: Student 'admits killing teacher'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 16-year-old student has admitted killing his teacher in her classroom, a defence lawyer has told a court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager is accused of murdering 61-year-old Spanish teacher Ann Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds on 28 April.
Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the boy did not admit murder, but added: "It does amount to an admission he's guilty of manslaughter."
A trial on the murder charge was set for 3 November at Leeds Crown Court.
No formal plea was entered, but Richard Wright QC, defending, said: "He has accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing of the deceased".
The student, who was 15 at the time of the killing, cannot be named for legal reasons. He appeared in court via video-link.
Mrs Maguire, a mother-of two from Moortown, Leeds, was due to retire in September after working for more than 40 years at the school.
Members of her family watched the proceedings from the public gallery.
The court heard that expert psychiatric reports would now be prepared before the trial.
The boy was told he would appear again for a hearing on 26 September. He was remanded in custody.
Both the judge and Mr Greaney asked the public to be extremely careful about using social media to discuss this case and stressed there could be heavy penalties for naming the defendant or giving other details about the case before the trial.
