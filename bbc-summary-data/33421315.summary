Budget to propose longer Sunday trading hours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shops in England and Wales could be allowed to open for longer on Sundays, under plans to be unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.

The proposal expected in Wednesday's Budget could give elected mayors and councils powers to relax laws locally if it might boost economic activity.
Current laws allows smaller shops to open all day, but restrict those over 280 sq m (3,000 sq ft) to six hours.
The Association of Convenience Stores said some small shops could struggle.
The Treasury pointed to research by the New West End Company - which represents more than 600 businesses in London - that suggested two extra hours of Sunday trading could create nearly 3,000 jobs in the capital.
It said such a move would also generate more than Â£200m a year in additional sales in London.
The proposal comes after larger stores and supermarkets were allowed to open for longer on Sundays during the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Mr Osborne said decisions on similar relaxations of the law should be taken at a local level - if officials think longer opening hours would boost economies.
The chancellor said there was a "growing appetite" for shopping on a Sunday.
"There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday.
"The rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend.
"But this won't be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities," he added.
High Street shops have been coming under growing pressure from online retailers, which now account for 11% of retail sales overall - rising to 17% in the month before Christmas of last year.
A review of the 1994 Sunday Trading Act by the then Labour government in 2006 resulted in no change to the law, despite protests.
Welcoming the chancellor's proposal, Adrian Pepper, from the Open Sundays campaign group, said restricting Sunday opening hours "makes no sense".
"The current Sunday trading laws do not preserve any valuable cultural aspects of our way of life. They just make life more inconvenient.
"If you want to go out early on a Sunday morning looking for a wide range of fresh produce to cook for a family Sunday lunch, you cannot.
"If you want to go to church on a Sunday morning, there is even less time to get the shopping done," he said.
But chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, James Lowman, said giving local authorities responsibility for setting Sunday trading hours could lead to "inconsistency and confusion" for businesses and shoppers.
He said the same amount of trade would be spread over more hours and would shift from small shops to larger stores.
"The short period of time that small stores are open while large stores are shut is a crucial advantage for convenience stores, most of which are owned by small businesses.
"Liberalising Sunday trading hours would make some small stores unviable," he added.
