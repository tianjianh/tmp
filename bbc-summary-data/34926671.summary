Anthony Steel, 74, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was driving a Vauxhall Zafira which was involved in the collision with a Vauxhall Astra in Corwen on Saturday.
Three young men from Corwen who were in the Astra died at the scene.
Mr Steel, who has been described as caring and loving, had been on his way to a church meeting, his family said.
The grandfather-of-six who had been married to wife, Joan, for 43 years, "always had a massive smile and was kind to everyone he met, whether it be a stranger or his close friends," they said.
"Tony loved to play golf but this became hard for him to walk the 18 holes, so he took up playing the Xbox and enjoyed playing games and beating everyone at Fifa."
Astra driver Jacob Hocking, 22, along with passengers Adam Richards, 21, and Jackson Edwards, 20, also died in the crash at Druid traffic lights.
Friends have also paid tribute to the men while community leaders said the town was in a state of shock.
A passenger in Mr Steel's car was taken to hospital seriously injured.
