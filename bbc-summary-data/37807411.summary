The Glovers looked to be cruising into the second round after Ryan Hedges and Otis Khan fired them into a two-goal lead, but a careless red card for Kevin Dawson and a quick-fire brace from Jack Byrne earned the Midlanders a spirited draw.
It took Yeovil just eight minutes to go in front as Hedges fired past goalkeeper Danny Lewis from inside the box.
Ben Whitfield came close to doubling the hosts' lead, before Khan did score Yeovil's second goal early in the second half when he curled home a delightful free-kick.
The game turned when Dawson, already on a yellow card, was dismissed for a needless foul on Jamie Osborne as Yeovil lost their heads.
Byrne took advantage and pulled a goal back with a well-taken shot from the edge of the box, and he found space from a near-identical position six minutes later to pull Solihull level.
Substitute Akwasi Asante had a late chance to earn Solihull a famous cup upset but he fired his shot over the crossbar.
