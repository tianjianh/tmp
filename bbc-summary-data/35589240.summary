HM Prison Leicester 'has high violence rate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High levels of violence, regular assaults on staff and increasing levels of self-harm have been found in an inspection at Leicester prison.

Staff did not always know where inmates were, alcohol and drugs were available and access to toiletries and clean clothes was poor, the report said.
The overcrowded prison had 325 inmates - 50% above capacity - when it was visited unannounced in September.
The prison service said it hoped a new governor would "drive improvement".
The watchdog found conditions at the adult male prison had deteriorated since the previous inspection in November 2013, when it had felt problems were being addressed.
In December prisoners smashed through their cell walls and staged a four-hour stand-off with guards.
Martin Lomas, of HMIP, said: "Over half of prisoners indicated that they had felt unsafe in Leicester... These findings were significantly worse than we would expect.
"The prison was aware of the problems... but there was no strategy and no plan to reduce violence and intimidation.
Mr Lomas also identified there had been three deaths in custody, two of which were self-inflicted.
"Levels of self-harm had increased by 50% over the same period and were now five times the number in other local prisons," he said.
The deputy chief inspector added that "too little was done to disrupt supply" of drugs and alcohol to the "overcrowded and shabby" prison, where access to basic necessities required improvement.
The report said there was a "high degree of prisoner need, plainly evident to anyone walking around the wings".
Inspectors described basic procedural security as "poor", adding: "Staff often could not account for prisoners and we routinely found prisoners where they were not supposed to be."
Michael Spurr, head of the prison service, said the report was "disappointing".
"Leicester's performance has deteriorated unacceptably and this cannot be allowed to continue," he said.
"A new governor has been appointed, who will provide the leadership required to rapidly drive improvement."
Earlier this month, David Cameron announced six "reform prisons" were to be created in England and Wales as part of a pilot to tackle high levels of violence and reoffending.
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "Leicester's report is an example of how our ageing prisons need reform.
"We take our duty of care to staff and prisoners extremely seriously and tackling violence and drugs must be a priority."
