Drivers caught using hand-held mobiles could face tougher penalties under new plans being considered by ministers.

A Department for Transport consultation proposes increasing both penalty points and fines for offenders, which it says is the government's "preferred option".
Launched on Tuesday, it cites research suggesting 9% of motorists regularly take "selfies" when behind the wheel.
The consultation will look at whether technology could put motorists' phones into a "drive-safe mode" automatically.
"These proposals ultimately aim to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads," says the government.
The measures relate directly to England and Wales but the document notes that its impact may apply in Scotland.
Under proposals being considered, the number of penalty points given to a motorist using their phone while driving could rise from three to four.
Drivers of Heavy Goods Vehicles could be handed up to six points on their licence.
The offence would also carry a fine of up to £150 - a 50% increase on the current financial penalty.
The document makes clear that increasing both fines and penalty points is the government's "preferred option".
But it admits that a previous increase in the fine in 2013 - which took it from £60 to £100 - had "no statistically significant change to the number of drivers observed using a hand-held mobile phone from 2009-2014".
First time offenders could continue to be offered the chance to attend police safety courses to avoid an endorsement on their licence.
The government's consultation cites research from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which suggested that 9% of drivers regularly take "selfies" while driving.
Its director of policy and research, Neil Greig, said: "For many, smartphone use has become an addiction that we can only start to cure through some form of therapy.
"The IAM does not object to tougher penalties but we do believe that the real deterrent is fear of being caught. That fear can only be increased by increasing the numbers of traffic police on our roads."
The consultation closes on 15 March 2016.
