The major broadcasters are offering additional programmes with just over a week left in the general election campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn will twice take part in 90-minute programmes, separately facing an audience of voters.
On Wednesday, the BBC is hosting a 90-minute debate fronted by Mishal Husain.
That will have SNP, Plaid, Green, UKIP and Lib Dem leaders, plus Conservative Amber Rudd and a Labour figure.
On Monday evening, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn will separately face Jeremy Paxman and an audience for 45 minutes each, in a joint programme between Channel Four and Sky News.
And for a Question Time leaders' special on Friday, the Conservative and Labour contenders for PM, will again be facing an audience - this time from York for BBC One.
That programme will be in addition to a traditional Question Time on Thursday evening from East Barnet at 22:45 BST.
And it will be followed by another QT special next Sunday teatime with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron.
Andrew Neil is in the middle of a series of five interviews with party leaders.
Those with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have already aired, but can still be viewed on iPlayer.
He will be speaking to Nicola Sturgeon on Sunday from 18:00, Paul Nuttall from 19:30 on Monday, and Tim Farron from 19:00 on Thursday.
And Jo Coburn will host Election Questions next Sunday evening with UKIP's Paul Nuttall and Jonathan Bartley for the Greens, followed by an interview with Leanne Wood.
Viewers in Wales will see the same programmes but in reverse order.
And the last major pre-election broadcast will be The Newsbeat Youth debate in Manchester on 6 June with an audience of 16 to 34-year-olds. That will air on BBC Radio 1, BBC News Channel and BBC One.
As well as these additional programmes, the Daily Politics returns after the bank holiday and will run every weekday at 12:00 on BBC2, Andrew Neil presents This Week on Thursday from 23:45 and Sunday Politics from 11:00 next weekend, with Newsnight on weeknights from 22:30, and Radio 4's Any Questions from 20:00 on Friday.
