A man who repeatedly raped a girl from the age of 12 and sold her for sex at dogging sites has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karl Barker, 69, groomed the child before sexually assaulting and raping her on "many occasions", Lincoln Crown Court heard.
He took her to dogging sites around Lincoln, where he sold her to strangers for sex for up to Â£50 a time.
Jailing him for 22 years, Judge Michael Heath said it was hard to find words to reflect his "loathsome depravity".
"It almost beggars belief that you could do what you did. You groomed her and sordidly abused her and allowed other men, for money, to sordidly abuse her."
"It is plain to see the effect that has had on that poor girl who is now a young woman," the judge said.
Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, said the victim was "a normal, happy child" until she came under the influence of Barker.
"She found he was affectionate and always very generous.
"He would provide her with alcohol, cigarettes and money. It was a gradual process of grooming her for a sexual relationship," he said.
The girl moved away but later returned to Lincoln and was contacted by Barker who continued to abuse her.
Mr Aspden said: "He was taking her to dogging sites. She would have sex with strangers for money and there was associated voyeurism."
The abuse came to light in December 2012 when the victim made a complaint to police.
Barker, of Lamb Gardens, Lincoln, admitted rape of a child under the age of 13 as well as sexual activity with a child and arranging prostitution.
The court heard that during a period when the victim left Lincoln, Barker paid two other girls, aged 15 and 16,  for sex after plying them with vodka at his flat.
