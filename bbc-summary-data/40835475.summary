[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 2-0 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient made it two home wins in a week as they overcame Maidstone at Brisbane Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors could easily have led early on when Delano Sam-Yorke stabbed the ball home from close range, but he was adjudged to have fouled keeper Charlie Grainger.
Joe Pigott was then denied by the home goalie before Tom Wraight smashed over, as Maidstone continued to threaten.
The O's, coming off a 3-1 win over Solihull in midweek, perked up and David Mooney opened the scoring for the hosts in the second half with a fine header from James Dayton's cross.
Orient doubled their lead in added time when substitute Romuald Boco took on Charlie Lee's pass to finish under Lee Worgan.
