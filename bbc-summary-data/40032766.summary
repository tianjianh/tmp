Golf star Billy Horschel's wife reveals her alcoholism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When US golfer Billy Horschel won the FedEx cup in 2014, it looked as if a golden career was about to take off.

And then: nothing.
For three years, Florida-born Horschel failed to make a mark - until last weekend, when, seemingly out of the blue, he took victory in the AT&T Byron Nelson USPGA.
The question on everybody's lips was, what happened?
"I'm not able to talk about it right now," Horschel told reporters on Sunday, after breaking down in tears.
But wife Brittany decided she was ready, and on Monday took to Twitter to reveal she was an alcoholic - but that her husband, to the detriment of his career, had helped her remain sober for a year.
"One year ago, I began a journey to a healthy me; mentally and physically," she wrote. "I will keep this simple, 'I am an alcoholic.' I say that now without shame."
The realisation not only saved her marriage, but also her life.
But, she said, it meant Horschel was left juggling training and competitions with raising their then 18-month-old little girl while she spent three months in rehab last year.
It was, she acknowledged, a "hard-fought year" for Horschel.
"He silently battled through... a very sad, scary and trying time," Mrs Horschel wrote.
"He deserves to soak in the glory of his win yesterday, throw his feet up and just let out a long deep breath."
And it seems Horschel is just as proud of his wife as she is of him.
Retweeting her statement, he wrote: "Proud of the journey that my wife is on! She is an amazing mother and unbelievable wife!"
