Westwood finished with two successive birdies on Friday, after Thursday's round had been curtailed by bad weather, to card a three-under 67.
He is tied with American Dustin Johnson who had a bogey-free round.
Rory McIlroy closed with three bogeys to post seven over, while Masters champion Danny Willett ended five over.
World number one Jason Day was four over after nine and eventually signed for a six-over 76, while defending champion Jordan Spieth played his remaining seven holes in one over par to finish two over.
Ireland's Shane Lowry holed a couple of birdies to move two off the lead on two under, alongside Sergio Garcia of Spain.
The 2013 US Open champion England's Justin Rose, who is returning from a back injury, had four bogeys and two birdies to finish two over par.
Northern Ireland's world number three McIlroy resumed his first round on four over par after 13 holes and began with two pars but then dropped shots on each of the last three holes to fall 11 behind the lead.
"It was hard getting into any kind of rhythm," said the 27-year-old, who last missed the cut in a major at the 2013 Open.
"I am missing shots left, I am missing shots right. I need to go to the range and work on a few things if I'm going to be here for the weekend.
"I am just not in a good place with my swing."
World number one Jason Day, who started his round on Friday, was moving along nicely until he double-bogeyed the seventh hole, after taking two shots to get out of a plugged lie in a greenside bunker. He followed that with another bogey on the eighth as he drifted to four over par.
A fluffed chip out of greenside rough on the 11th led to another dropped shot and he missed a birdie putt from a dozen feet after an excellent tee shot on the short 13th.
Day picked up the solitary birdie of his round on the par-four 14th but gave that shot back on the 16th and missed a four-foot par putt on the next to drop to six over.
Landry, 28, strolled onto the ninth green early on Friday morning to knock in the birdie putt he was unable to attempt on Thursday because play was halted by the threat of storms.
His four-under-par 66 is the lowest first-round score in a US Open at Oakmont, which is hosting the tournament for a record ninth time.
American Scott Piercy briefly drew level with Landry but bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes saw him finish on two under.
Spaniard Garcia mixed five birdies with three bogeys, also posting 68, while playing partner Johnson, who three-putted the last hole to lose last year's US Open, hit 16 greens in regulation to sit one off the lead.
Six-time US Open runner-up Phil Mickelson was one under after nine holes but with successive bogeys on the 10th and 11th his challenge faltered and a pulled par putt on the last led to a four-over 74.
Sweden's Henrik Stenson had one bogey and one birdie in his opening 12 holes and then eagled the par-five fourth to shoot up the leaderboard.
Stenson was one of only three players to birdie the 258-yard par-three eighth as he posted a one-under 69.
South Africa's Ernie Els, who won the first of his two US Open titles at Oakmont in 1994, was two under after seven holes, but two double bogeys and three more dropped shots in a back nine of 41 saw him finish on five over.
