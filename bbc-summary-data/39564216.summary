A man detained at an immigration removal centre in Dorset has died, the Home Office has said.

The 43-year-old, who has not been named, died at The Verne, Portland, on Sunday. An investigation is under way.
His death comes a month after campaigners raised concerns about the effects of detention on the 500 men held at The Verne.
The Verne Visitors Group said many detainees had no indication about how long they would be held there.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that a 43-year-old man who had been detained at the Verne Immigration Removal Centre died at the centre on 9 April 2017.
"Our thoughts are with his family at this very sad time. A full independent investigation will be conducted by the prisons and probation ombudsman."
Following last month's criticism, the Home Office said it detained people for the "minimum time possible" and that individuals could challenge their detention in the courts.
