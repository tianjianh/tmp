Children in harmful situations 'let down' by authorities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children were left in harmful situations by Jersey care services, according to two damning reports seen by the BBC.

The documents show half of children assessed were not taken away from harmful situations in good time.
Two similar reports were released last week that found the service "failed to consider" the needs of young people.
They were written in 2015 but details only came out during the Independent Jersey Care Inquiry in April.
The reports - released after a Freedom of Information request - claim children left in the community received care below minimum standards in some cases.
They were commissioned by the then temporary head of children's services Jo Olsson and produced by former Ofsted inspector Mary Varley.
Jersey's minister for health and social services, Senator Andrew Green, said there would be an increase in funding for children's services.
"I'm investing and the Council of Ministers is investing Â£5.5m alone this year into children's services, but chucking money at it is just not the answer on its own.
"We must make sure that we get something different for that."
The Jersey Care Leavers Association said the reports highlighted lessons that should have been learnt a long time ago.
