Artists on their musical highlights of 2014

From headlining Glastonbury to selling out Wembley Stadium, it's safe to say it's been a pretty good year for British musicians.

The last 12 months have seen UK acts setting the bar for Grammy nominations and making chart history in the US (no points for guessing which boyband).
For some, meeting an idol was the most memorable moment of the year while for others it was all about awards season.
Here are some of the UK's biggest acts' highlights of 2014.
It's an obvious one for these boys right? Glastonbury headliners at last? Well, another show was just as big a highlight in 2014 for Tom, Serge and co.
"The home show in Leicester and then Glastonbury," says Serge Pizzorno.
"One was just like an emotional 10-year trip to play in front of that many people where we were born and inspiring the next generation of kids from our town.
"And the weekend after was closing the greatest festival in the world, there's not really anything else to say."
Actually, they had a few more things to say on the matter.
"I've never quite been as high as that - for two weeks I was on the ceiling of every establishment I went in to," says the guitarist.
"[It was] just pure emotion," said frontman Tom Meighan.
"The summer was a wonderful time, I think it was probably the best year of us as a band, we won't ever top that forever, that was our moment."
Ahhhh.
Sam Smith certainly has plenty to choose from; this time last year, we hardly knew who he was.
In fact this time six months ago, we still weren't entirely sure - (watch this nonsense for further explaination...)
So despite having a number one album and single, and breaking America, his top moment is all the fun times he's having now he's a massive pop star.
"I think one of the highlights would be the MTV VMAs," he explained.
"I watched that as a kid every year and being there and performing, sitting in the seat I was sat in was very, very surreal."
He was sat perched in between Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, with Ariana Grande and the Kardashians nearby and they all knew who he was.
"It's really odd what's happened over there [America] in such a short space of time, it's incredible.
"But do you know what? I do miss the UK when I am there and I can't wait to be back when I am gone."
We miss you too.
Foxes is another new artist who has had a stellar year and picked up a few famous fans along the way.
Her highlight was supporting Pharrell Williams on tour and meeting a couple of other huge, sorry, gargantuan stars.
"Supporting Pharrell, it was scary but it was an honour," she told Newsbeat.
"To be on that for 30 days was just mind-blowing. I learnt so much, made so many friends. I am sad to not be on it now."
As for Pharrell?
"He was lovely, he treated me and my team like family," she explained.
"It was just the most amazing tour to be on. I kept having to look around and be like, 'Oh my God there's Jay Z and Beyonce and Pharrell' and they are all there."
Actual Beyonce?
"I talked to her for about 15 minutes about make-up and I just didn't even know what to say," said Foxes.
"She asked me what mascara I use and I felt really silly because it is like Beyonce, you probably have your own mascara and so it was a moment."
He performed at the O2 arena in London, virtually on his own, while six different couples got engaged.
He had another number one album, hung out with the cast of Friends, Taylor Swift and everyone else in the world and announced he'd perform at Wembley Stadium.
But it was meeting his idol that really stood out for Ed Sheeran.
So who is this musical hero Ed?
"Van Morrison," he told Newsbeat.
"Growing up as a kid, he was the person I listened to starting off, so being able to chat to him for two hours, it kind of made my job feel very, very surreal.
"We chatted about music and what is happening now in the digital age.
"From the looks of things on the media forefront people might not think anyone likes me.
"So it's nice to see people I look up to and admire say good things."
This time last year, Ella Eyre was that girl, with awesome hair and incredible voice on Rudimental's Waiting All Night.
Now she is an artist in her own right, with a Mobo for best newcomer under her belt and her debut album on the way in 2015.
But let's not forget, she already has a Brit Award to her name as Waiting All Night was named best British single and that is her highlight of 2015.
"I was one of my first and biggest award ceremonies to be a part of," she said.
"It is such a highlight for it to be so early on in my career to have won a Brit Award and to be performing on the first world streamed Brit Awards.
"Also releasing my solo stuff after being known as a featured artist for quite a while now, it's just nice for people to know me on my own."
