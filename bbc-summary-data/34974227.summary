A new lifeboat is to be named after a former taxi driver who funded it with a £1m donation from compensation he received after medical blunders.

The Antony Patrick Jones will be the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's fastest lifeboat - capable of speeds twice that of their existing fleet.
Mr Jones died in 2002, leaving a £1m donation to the RNLI in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in his will.
The craft will be housed in the town's new lifeboat station.
Mr Jones received compensation after mistakes during an operation left him paralysed and blind.
As well as the lifeboat charity, he left money to the RSPCA and the Riding for the Disabled Association when he died at the age of 46.
Richard Dunk, chairman of the Bridlington RNLI, said Mr Jones' interest in the charity was mainly through his late mother, Terri, who was a member of the station's fundraising guild.
Mr Dunk said: "It is very sad that Terri will not be here to witness the arrival of the new lifeboat named after her son, but she knew that we were all incredibly grateful for Antony's legacy, and that the new lifeboat will be a fitting and long-lasting tribute to his memory.'
Mr Jones' cousin, Jackie Powell, said she was proud his legacy would help to save lives at sea for "decades to come".
Work has begun on the new lifeboat station on Spa Promenade, which is to replace the old building on South Marine Drive.
