County Championship: Rory Burns puts Surrey in control against Hampshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Burns' first Championship ton of the summer put Surrey in command on day one of their game against Hampshire.

Burns and Dominic Sibley put on 208 for the first wicket before the former was caught at first slip off home leg-spinner Mason Crane just before tea.
Zafar Ansari then went for five before Sibley fell just one run short of his second-ever first-class ton.
Aaron Finch (56 not out) and Steven Davies (21 not out) closed out the day as Surrey look in charge on 332-4.
That is despite England one-day opener Jason Roy being out leg before for a duck to Gareth Berg as the Hampshire seamer took his second victim of the day, following the dismissal of Sibley.
Burns' century was not only a personal landmark, but one for his county, as his century was the 2,000th by a Surrey player in first-class cricket.
Hampshire bowler Gareth Berg told BBC Radio Solent:
"The weather played a massive part. It was muggy, sweaty and took a lot out of us as a bowling unit.
"We thought we were in with a chance of taking some early wickets but to be fair they batted very well. We didn't hit our straps early so we gave them the momentum.
"We tried our best but when you're chasing the eight-ball after a few overs when they've set themselves some runs, it's difficult to come back from that. We brought it back toward the end with the new ball, taking a couple of wickets."
Surrey batsman Rory Burns told BBC Radio London:
"I am delighted to be able to contribute for the first time this year really. We have spoken about starting matches well, so being 332-4 is where we want to be,
"If I was asking for a ball to get to a hundred it was the one I got, so I was pretty happy.
"I was pretty disappointed to get out when I did, I felt as though I may have left a few runs out there.
"The ball swung most of the day and the pitch looks dry so there may be a little bit there for the spinners as the match goes on."
