The 25-year-old has 13 goals in 23 appearances for Lokomotiv this season and has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the Goodison Park club.
"We're delighted as Oumar is a player we've been following for a long time," Toffees boss Roberto Martinez said.
"He brings a real hunger and desire to be successful into what is already a strong squad."

Everton's top target was Dynamo Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko but their move for the Ukraine forward was unsuccessful.
Niasse joins after forward Steven Naismith left Everton for Norwich and winger Aiden McGeady departed the club in a loan deal to Sheffield Wednesday.
"I started to watch Everton more since the beginning of October because I had heard about their interest," said Niasse.
"I was interested to see how they play. If you see players who are aged 20 or 21 and see them perform like that, you know you have a good coach."
