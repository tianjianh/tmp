London's calling for James Corden chat show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Corden has had a capital idea - to film three episodes of his late night US talk show on home turf.

The shows will be filmed in early June at Westminster's Central Hall, around 18 miles from where the actor, TV host and Hillingdon native was born in 1978.
"To bring The Late Late Show to the UK is a dream come true for me," said the 38-year-old, who now has to make do with a five-storey property in Malibu.
"We're going to do our best to make this week in London memorable."
The three episodes will air on 7, 8 and 9 June on Sky 1 and will also be available on Now TV.
In a video posted on YouTube, Corden and his bandleader Reggie Watts can be seen packing up his show's Los Angeles set.
Watts ruefully assumes the show has been cancelled, only to learn it's merely heading across the Atlantic.
Corden has been a big hit in the US since taking over the late-night talk show slot on the CBS network in 2015.
His Carpool Karaoke segments, which have seen him pootling around La La Land with such luminaries as Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber, have proved a particular viewers' favourite.
Sky 1's Adam MacDonald said he was "beyond excited" to see "what he and The Late Late Show gang have in store for us".
