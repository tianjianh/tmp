The Bulls were looking to return to Super League at the first time of asking after their relegation to the second tier along with London Broncos last year.
After centre Blythe's diving effort was ruled out, it took until the 15th minute for the first score to come when Kirmond capitalised on some neat interplay between Pita Godinet and Jacob Miller.
In the second half, Moore's quick dart from dummy half set up Mullally from short range before Purtell found Williams with a speculative flick pass to cross at the other end.
After an excellent Jake Mullaney break, Bradford worked it wide where Blythe was able to press down a loose ball.
Another smart line was found by Washbrook to extend the lead, only for the Bulls to respond when Purtell powered over.
Danny Addy missed a late penalty kick to level the game, and a superb break by on-loan Moore secured Wakefield's win.
