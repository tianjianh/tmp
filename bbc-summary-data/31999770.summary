The medal, stolen from her home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, in February was found by postman Martyn Siviter earlier this month.
Sotherton's medal was returned to her by West Midlands Police on Friday.
More medals stolen during the burglary are still missing. Anyone with information should contact police.
Sotherton had appealed on Twitter for help to find her missing medals and an appeal also featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.
Also found with the Commonwealth gold in a postbox in Sutton Coldfield was Sotherton's English Schools "AA" medal.
Sotherton said she was "really thankful" the medals had been found.
The medal, won at Melbourne in 2006, was the only major championship gold of her career.
She won bronze at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the World Championships in Osaka in 2007.
