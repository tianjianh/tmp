The France international is the Reds' fifth signing of the summer and will compete with Jose Enrique at left-back.
"I think we have a great team and great fans and together we can achieve big things," said Cissokho.
Cissokho made 25 league appearances and scored two goals for Valencia last season after signing from Lyon for around £5m in August 2012.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had wanted to sign another left-back, Guilherme Siqueira from Spanish club Granada, but the clubs failed to agree a fee.
Cissokho joins goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, defender Kolo Toure, midfielder Luis Alberto and striker Iago Aspas as a summer arrival in Rodgers' squad.
Liverpool are keen to bring in one more attacking player before the transfer window closes, but their hopes of bringing in Anzhi Makhachkala forward Willian appear to be at an end.
The Brazilian is in talks with Tottenham about a £30m move to White Hart Lane.
