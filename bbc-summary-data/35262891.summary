East Midlands brothers at odds over European Union

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Go back in time to 1975 - the last time we were given a referendum vote on whether to stay members of the growing club of nations that is the European Union.

I remember the excitement at getting my first polling card and trotting down to vote at my village hall in Rutland.
Joy was immediately followed by disappointment at being turned away because I was too young to vote and the polling card was a blunder.
On the TV at that time was a BBC drama called The Brothers - a tale of sibling rivalry in a haulage company.
Fast forward to today and I have found a 2016 version in Nottingham where the plot centres around the EU referendum.
Two brothers, each with their own haulage business, divided by a footbridge over the ring road and divided by their views on whether to leave or remain members.
Nigel Baxter is heading the East Midlands' Vote Leave campaign for the Business for Britain group which represents small and medium sized companies.
The family firm, RH Commercial Vehicles, was set up by his father 46 years ago.
For a time he and one of his younger brothers, Ian, worked there.
Ian Baxter recently set up a new company, Baxter Freight, which organises 30,000 lorry shipments a year, mostly around Europe.
Nigel is fed up with a European Union which he says hinders business and jobs because they are handcuffed to rules and regulations.
For him, who employs 80 people over three sites in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, too much control has been given away to the EU and too much money. More than Â£1bn a year he says, from the East Midlands alone.
"I don't believe the EU now is fit for purpose, it's not what we signed up for and over time has become a redundant organisation in many respects," he said.
But his brother, although admittedly a bit of a euro sceptic, believes it is better to stay a member.
Ian, who employs 60 people and has expansion plans, said being outside the EU would damage business and their customers. New customs controls at EU borders would, he believes, really cost them in time and money.
"The fact is it'll be a drag on growth, it will definitely affect our ability to employ more people in this city," he said.
"It's definitely damaging to our business and that of our customers, more importantly."
Despite their rivalry over Europe, unlike the 1970s soap opera, these brothers still get on well and can laugh about their differences over the dinner table.
The big future test for the Conservatives, now the prime minister has promised MPs and members of the government they can say what they really think, is how they get on when the issue is finally settled.
In 1975, the Labour government went down a similar road of having members such as Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins arguing against each other over Europe.
In the end Labour splintered. Roy Jenkins left to form the SDP and the party were out of power until 1997. Will this be another lesson from history?
