[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 2-0 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln made it 13 games unbeaten in all competitions with a richly deserved home win over Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Predictably it was the Imps who dominated against a Maidstone side reeling from four defeats in a row, but they failed to create a decisive opening in the first half.
After the break, they eased clear. Theo Robinson opened the scoring after Matt Rhead had headed Terry Hawkridge's cross into the danger zone.
Within seconds, visiting goalkeeper Lee Worgan cleared straight into the path of Nathan Arnold, who teed up Rhead to finish.
The win keeps Danny Cowley's side ensconced in second place and ripe for a promotion charge.
