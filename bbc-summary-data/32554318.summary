The TV series is a spin off of the How To Train Your Dragon films, which are based on children's stories written by Cressida Cowell.
The author's tales are influenced by childhood holidays spent in the Inner Hebrides.
The characters in Defenders of Berk have been given Gaelic voices so it can be screened on BBC Alba.
Glasgow-based Solus Productions has produced the 11-part series for the TV channel.
Peppa Pig and Postman Pat have been among other children's adapted for a Gaelic audience.
The How To Train Your Dragon films feature characters voiced by Scottish actors Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson.
