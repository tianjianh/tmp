Gwyneth Paltrow has admitted the term 'conscious uncoupling' is a "kind of a goofy term."

The Hollywood actress also said the split with ex-husband Chris Martin is "working."
"I made a mistake in I didn't give it [the term conscious uncoupling] context.
"I didn't say, 'this is... a philosophy,'" she told Howard Stern on his US Sirius XM Radio show on Wednesday.
Last March, Paltrow, 42, and Martin, 37, announced the split in a blog post titled Conscious Uncoupling.
"It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate," the couple wrote at the time.
The pair, married in December 2003 and have two children together, Apple, 10, and Moses, 8.
Paltrow told Stern the point to splitting up without anger is to keep everyone happy.
"We're always going to be a family," she said.
"But it's a very noble idea, and a great thing to try to do for your kids."
"It's working, but it is kind of a goofy term and I didn't know it was going to cause such a big thing."
And when people who are "consciously uncoupling" spend time with their children, that means doing so without tension, Paltrow said.
"We actually have a really strong friendship and we laugh and have fun," she said.
The actress added that luckily, the two are on the same page with how they want to bring up their two children; calling him "lovely" and a "sweetheart."
When asked how she feels about the possibility of Martin bringing other women to meet their kids, Paltrow said she knows the Coldplay singer loves his children so much that "I don't think he'd be with someone who isn't great."
Gwyneth Paltrow is currently starring in film Mortdecai with Johnny Depp.
