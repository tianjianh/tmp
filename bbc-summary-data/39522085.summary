MacNeill famously attempted to call off the 1916 Easter Rising.
The plaque, marking the 150th anniversary of his birth, is at the politician's former school, St Malachy's College.
It is being unveiled by his grandson and former tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Michael McDowell.
"As a co-founder of the Gaelic League, Eoin Mac Neill assured his place in his country's history, but he was also an eminent scholar, historian, and linguist," Chris Spurr, chairman of the Ulster History Circle, said.
"The Ulster History Circle are delighted to commemorate Eoin MacNeill with a blue plaque at the college he attended.
"The circle would like to thank St Malachy's College for their assistance, and we are also grateful to Foras na Gaelige for their financial support towards the plaque."
Eoin MacNeill was born John McNeill in 1867 in Glenarm on the County Antrim coast.
He boarded in St Malachy's from 1881 until 1887.
