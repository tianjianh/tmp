The partner of a former EastEnders star found dead with her two young sons is set to appear before a court in Ghana.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Simpson-Kent, 48, is being held by police in Accra after his arrest in a beach resort on Saturday.
The bodies of Sian Blake, 43, and the boys were found in the garden of their south-east London home on 5 January.
Ghanaian police cannot hold a person for more than 48 hours without putting them before a judge. UK officers say an extradition request is yet to be made.
Detectives from Scotland Yard, who are in Ghana, have already spoken to Mr Simpson-Kent. They have said an application for extradition will be "made by officers and partner agencies in due course".
Ms Blake and the couple's sons were last seen on 13 December, and a missing persons inquiry was launched on 16 December. The Met Police said they spoke to Mr Simpson-Kent at their house in Erith on the same day.
Ghanaian Police say Mr Simpson-Kent arrived in Ghana on 19 December.
The country's police force became involved on 7 January and arrested him in in Busua, a south-west coastal resort, two days later.
The actress and her two sons had died from neck and head injuries, post-mortem examinations found.
Ms Blake, who had motor neurone disease, had played Frankie Pierre in 56 episodes of BBC TV soap EastEnders between 1996 and 1997.
The Met has been criticised over delays in its investigation and is being investigated by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Speaking in Accra on Saturday, Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn, of the Met's homicide and major crime command, said he was satisfied "there was nothing we or the Ghanaians could have done any quicker", and thanked local police for their help in making an arrest.
