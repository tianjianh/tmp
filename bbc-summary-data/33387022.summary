Samuel Easterbrook, 20, repeatedly kicked and punched 18-weeks pregnant Kira Brooks in the stomach after they split up, Exeter Crown Court heard.
Easterbrook, of Danvers Road, Torquay, admitted causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage and was jailed for 21 months.
Judge Jeremy Griggs told him: "This is as unpleasant as it gets."
Easterbrook went to Miss Brooks' Torbay home on 16 May after they split up, the court was told.
He punched and kicked Miss Brooks and stabbed her in the arm during a struggle in the kitchen.
The attack came after he smashed a television and poured bleach on Miss Brooks' clothes.
Felicity Payne, prosecuting, said: "She was petrified. He began to push and kick her repeatedly in the stomach area and said he was going to get the baby out of her.
"He said if she was not going to be with him she could not have the child."
Judge Jeremy Griggs said the attack "appears to be a deliberate attempt to cause your child to be aborted. Thankfully, that has not happened."
The judge made a restraining order banning Easterbrook from any contact with Miss Brooks and told him he would have to apply through the family courts to see his child when the baby is born.
Ann Bellchambers, defending, said Easterbrook told police he "just went mad" and was now remorseful.
