A woman who killed a fellow hospital patient by suffocating her has been indefinitely detained under the Mental Health Act.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rachel Bowen, 49, pleaded guilty at Bradford Crown Court to the manslaughter of Linda Goswell.
Mrs Goswell, 52, from Halifax, died at the Cygnet Hospital in Bradford on 2 August last year.
Her husband, Stewart Goswell, said both his wife and her killer had been "let down" by the hospital.
A nurse has since been dismissed by the hospital for gross misconduct and NHS England is conducting a serious case review.
The court heard both patients were supposed to be observed by staff every 15 minutes.
CCTV showed Bowen entering Mrs Goswell's room in the early hours, where she remained unnoticed by a nursing assistant making a routine check.
Charge nurse Kudakwashe Masvodza claimed to have checked on Mrs Goswell at 04:45 BST, but the court was told CCTV footage showed that was incorrect.
Following the attack Bowen - who was admitted to the Bierley Lane unit in 2014 after stabbing a friend in the neck with a screwdriver - told a member of staff: "I think I did something bad last night, I killed that lady."
She said she had strangled her with her hands but also alluded to a cushion. She later told police she couldn't remember the incident.
Mitigating, Shaun Smith QC said his client suffered a "severe mental illness" and had not received psychiatric care following a separate incident in 2012.
Giving her an indefinite hospital order, Judge Roger Thomas said the high level of supervision at the hospital should have prevented the incident.
In a statement, Mr Goswell said: "It is clear that Linda has been let down, also I feel that Rachel Bowen has been let down."
The hospital said it has since made changes to its working practices.
