The 23-time winner from Morecambe won last year's senior race and is just three wins away from the late Joey Dunlop's all-time record of 26 wins.
The machines are on display at the TT paddock behind the grandstand in Douglas.
The racer said it celebrates his "incredible journey so far".
He added that the collection he has personally gathered defines his 20-year TT race career.
It features several of his winning bikes from the past two decades, including the Paul Bird Motorsport RS250 Honda that he raced in his debut year.
He said: "I can still clearly remember setting off down Bray Hill on the RS250. It was four seasons in one day - wet, dry, wind, sun, fog and mist.
"The TT means so much to me and it's been an incredible journey so far, a journey that the fans have all been part of, so hopefully people will come down and enjoy the experience."
Other bikes also include the centenary-winning bike on which he became the first rider to break the 130mph mark
McGuinness, who holds the absolute lap record, is the first rider to pass 127, 128, 129 and 131mph.
