Ghana FA threatens legal action over elements of 'ball boys' report

Ghana's Football Association says it is launching a legal challenge to a report into the country's poor 2014 World Cup.

It said a presidential commission report into their group-stage exit was "hideously inappropriate" in parts.
The Dzamefe Report outlined a $100,000 fee paid to Ghana's equipment manager - dubbed a "ball boy" in the report.
Ismail Hamidu did receive the payment but the GFA said his role as "kit manager" was being ridiculed by a commission it accuses of "posturing".
In earning $100,000 (£64,000), Hamidu received the same appearance fee as players and manager James Kwesi Appiah, but the GFA claims his bonus payments would not have been equal to theirs.
"It is apparent that the description of the kit manager as a 'ball boy' is calculated to bring disaffection for the person in charge of the position even though his role is key for the highly-tuned professionals to perform at the top level," a GFA spokesperson told BBC Sport.
"While the commission is seeking to mock the person, the position or his role in the team, it must be made clear that the payment of the appearance fees to the kit manager was made after government vetted and approved it."
BBC Sport reported the commissions' disclosure of the $100,000 paid to Hamidu, players and staff members on Thursday.
The Dzamefe Commission also highlights some payments during qualifying and the build-up to the Brazil World Cup which could not be accounted for.
But the GFA has been left angered by the reaction to the report and said it has been "led to instruct its lawyers to challenge the findings in court".
The GFA added: "We wish to emphasise that we should not waver from our desire of finding out the REAL REASONS for Ghana's early exit from the tournament and the other off-the-field incidents that brought embarrassment to the country."
During the tournament, in which the Black Stars drew their final group game with Portugal, the country's government flew $3m (£1.91m) to South America to settle a pay dispute with players.
