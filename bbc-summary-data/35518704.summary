The 2011 world silver medallist and partner Robert Blair beat Martin Campbell and Julie MacPherson 21-11 21-16 to extend her record in the event.
Hamilton's Kirsty Gilmour made it five singles titles in a row with a 21-13 21-9 win over Edinburgh's MacPherson.
And the Olympic hopeful won her fourth consecutive women's doubles title.
Gilmour partnered Erskine's Rebekka Findlay to defeat MacPherson and Beith's Eleanor O'Donnell 21-17 21-7, leaving MacPherson with a trio of runners-up medals.
Prior to the finals afternoon, Bankier, who has recently moved to Paris on a business venture, received a glass rock tablet from Badminton Scotland president Dan Travers.
She said: "I had nine National titles and I suppose the thought of trying to get 10 was tempting and another Nationals meant that I would be able to play one last time in front of my family and the people who have helped me so much in my career.
"I was really nervous before the final and I don't usually get affected like that. I had a sleepless night."
It was a good day for Blair as he finished with two Scottish titles, having partnered Mauchline's Adam Hall to his first men's doubles title and Blair's third with different partners.
The second seeds beat top seeds and defending champions Campbell and Patrick MacHugh in a high-quality final. The 21-19 21-18 win made up for Blair's defeat in last year's final when partnering Gordon Thomson.
There was also a first National title for Matthew Carder after two years as runner-up to Kieran Merrilees in the men's singles.
The South Queensferry player had to come from a game and 19-17 down against Glasgow's Thomson in the final against to win 18-21 21-19 21-17.
