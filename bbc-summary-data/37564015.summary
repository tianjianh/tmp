[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Principal government relations officer Greg Taylor quit after being interviewed under caution by Lancashire Police and suspended from his job.
Officers investigated tweets sent from the account @elithebarraboy, which has since been taken down.
Labour MP for Barrow and Furness John Woodcock had complained to police.
A City Hall spokeswoman said: "These are serious allegations.
"A member of staff was suspended pending an investigation and has subsequently resigned and has left the Greater London Authority with immediate effect."
A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said: "A report of harassment was initially made to Cumbria Police, who traced the tweets to a Twitter account that was set up in Penwortham.
"Following our inquiries, a 35-year-old man from London was interviewed under caution. The investigation is ongoing."
