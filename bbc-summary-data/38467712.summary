Thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused to about 30 vehicles in Baltic Street on Tuesday after their tyres were slashed.

Two 16-year-old boys, and two other boys, aged 13 and 14, have been traced in connection with both incidents.
They will be reported to the Youth Justice Assessor and procurator fiscal.
