Dame Lowell Goddard preferred to work alone, MPs told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dame Lowell Goddard, the former head of an inquiry into child sexual abuse, kept panel members at a distance and would rather have worked alone, MPs have heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Professor Alexis Jay, her successor, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that despite this, they tried to make arrangements work.
Dame Lowell Goddard, the inquiry's third chairwoman, resigned in August.
The inquiry, set up in 2014, has been beset by controversies.
The committee quizzed Prof Jay, who was previously on the panel, and two current panel members about Dame Lowell Goddard's departure and the inquiry's progress.
Who is Justice Lowell Goddard?
Panel member Ivor Frank, a human rights barrister, was asked whether Dame Lowell Goddard, a New Zealand high court judge, was a "nightmare to work with".
"I would not use that language. I would prefer to say there were challenges," he replied.
He said she was not always present in the UK throughout her 16-month tenure and the panel was able to continue working without very much contact.
"There were times when things were perfectly amicable and perfectly professional, there were other times when it was less the case," he told the committee.
During questioning, Prof Jay denied the inquiry had been "an unhappy ship".
She said a great deal of work had been done, it had always been "open for business" and it was not true to say it was ever in crisis.
But she acknowledged that had Dame Lowell Goddard not resigned, it would have been "very difficult" for the work of the inquiry to be carried out.
Another panel member, Drusilla Sharpling, also a barrister, told the hearing she had reported concerns about Dame Lowell Goddard's leadership qualities to the Home Office in April - more than three months before her resignation.
She told MPs she did not give anyone permission to "spread these concerns amongst anybody else" and did not ask for any action to be taken.
Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary of the Home Office, who also faced the committee, said he had not heard "rumblings" about Dame Lowell Goddard's performance.
He has already said that the first time he was made aware of concerns was on 29 July, six days before she resigned.
"Had I picked up rumblings because we have former (Home Office) staff working on the inquiry?  The answer to that is no," he said.
Prof Jay said that of the 166 employees working on the inquiry, "just over 20%" had previously worked for the Home Office.
The committee suggested this made it harder for abuse survivors to have confidence in the "independence" of the inquiry.
Drusilla Sharpling, from the panel, stressed: "The chair and the panel are the controlling mind of this inquiry."
In her resignation letter from August, Dame Lowell Goddard said the inquiry had a "legacy of failure which has been very hard to shake off".
She has since been accused of using racist language, something she has strongly denied.
Asked by the committee about these reports, Prof Jay said she could not talk about any aspect of HR or personnel experience in the inquiry, saying it was confidential.
Dame Lowell Goddard's predecessors, Baroness Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf, both quit over alleged conflicts of interest.
Senior lawyer Ben Emmerson QC also stepped down.
