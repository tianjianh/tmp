Labour has said Ed Miliband was interviewed by Russell Brand - after he was spotted visiting the home of the comedian and political campaigner.

Mr Miliband's visit to Mr Brand's house had sparked some speculation that Mr Brand may "endorse" the Labour leader.
Mr Brand has repeatedly urged young people not to vote, saying elections change little and direct action is a more effective tool for "revolution".
In contrast, Mr Miliband says 16 and 17-year olds should be able to vote.
A picture of Mr Miliband apparently leaving the comedian's house in east London was posted on Twitter.
It is understood the interview will be broadcast on Mr Brand's YouTube Channel, The Trews, later on Tuesday.
Mr Brand has become a high-profile, alternative voice on the political scene, campaigning against inequality, benefit cuts and corporate tax avoidance and speaking up on behalf of the rights of housing tenants.
He hit the headlines in 2013 when, in a Newsnight interview with Jeremy Paxman, he said he had never voted because of "absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class".
In the same interview, the broadcaster and actor called for people to shun the ballot box and pursue a "revolution" against the political elites.
Since then, he has become a regular commentator on political issues, appearing on the BBC's Question Time earlier this year.
However, Mr Brand's own financial affairs have been questioned by journalists while others have urged him to stand for political office.
Speaking last week, the comedian said people should be "more aware" about politics but claimed the general election was "irrelevant" and "dead".
Labour said Mr Miliband "was doing a media interview like he often does", adding that it "looked forward to it being broadcast".
