Cardiff Blues coach Danny Wilson has promised to stick with playing "high risk" rugby, despite again failing to qualify for the European Champions Cup.

Blues were seventh in the Pro12, which only secured a Champions Cup qualifier.
The first hurdle was Friday's semi-final at Stade Francais, but Blues lost 46-21 in France, ending their season.
"I'm extremely proud of the efforts and you saw the efforts again [at Stade] where we try to stick to the style of rugby we want to play," Wilson said.
"It's a little bit high risk and high tempo, but it's certainly the way forward for Cardiff Blues and it's the way we'll continue to play, we just need to bolster some depth."
Wilson's side will now play in Europe's second tier Challenge Cup in 2017-18 for a third consecutive season.
"We started the season very well and finished the season very well, but there was a patch in the middle where we struggled a little bit in the league," Wilson said.
"We qualified out of our European group to make a quarter-final so we've made some small steps in the right direction."
Wilson was due to be part of Wales' coaching staff for June's matches against Samoa and Tonga, but withdrew and will now step up his efforts to recruit players for the region.
"Yes, I'm looking to strengthen the squad this summer," Wilson said.
"We have to build some depth so we can deal with patches of the season when you get injuries and that's where we've struggled a bit this season."
Wilson was left counting the cost following defeat to Stade, with seven players injured in Paris.
The Cardiff side had led 14-10 at half-time but lost wing Tom James ahead of kick-off, replaced by Rhun Williams who himself departed early with an ankle problem.
Uncapped Williams' ankle problem makes him a doubt for Wales' June tour on which they play Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Against Stade. Wilson also saw backs Ray Lee-Lo, Willis Halaholo and Steven Shingler depart, while hooker Matthew Rees left and his replacement Kirby Myhill did so on a stretcher.
"By 10 minutes into the game we'd lost three players and it carried on in that way," Wilson added.
"We were pretty decimated come the end, but it's where we need to build depth and try to deal with those situations."
