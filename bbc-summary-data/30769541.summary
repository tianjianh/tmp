[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff's Windsor Road bridge rebuild work to start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to rebuild a 102-year-old Cardiff road bridge over south Wales' main railway line will begin on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Windsor Road bridge, which connects Adamsdown with Splott, will be closed until spring 2016 with diversions of up to two miles in place.
The new bridge is needed to accommodate heavier loads and allow to extra headroom needed for the future electrification of the railway by 2017.
Cardiff council said it had worked with Network Rail to minimise disruption.
