[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Ben Williamson and Craig McAllister saw Eastleigh hold off Tranmere at Ten Acres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Jennings came closest to breaking the deadlock in a tight first half, heading against a post for the away side from Adam Buxton's neat cross.
In the second half, Rovers rued a miss from James Norwood, as Williamson went up the other end and found the top corner at the near post with precision and calmness.
Richard Hill's side were always in control, as emphasised in the latter stages when McAllister and Sam Matthews came off the bench, with the latter crossing for the former to head in off the underside of the bar.
