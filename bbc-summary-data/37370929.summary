The five week old cub tries for more than a minute to turn herself over but she doesn't manage to do it.
She probably won't be able to roll over for a little bit longer and her eyes won't open all the way until she's around two months old.
The baby cub doesn't have a name yet but many call her "Xidou's baby" in reference to her Mum, whose name translation is "Little Bean."
