[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A five-year-old girl who lost her hair and eyebrows because of alopecia has won a modelling contract.

Sydney Caraher was signed by Frame agency after coming first in a contest at a Merseyside shopping centre.
Her mother said Sydney often compared herself to a boy after losing all her hair at the age of four, but the win had been a "huge confidence boost".
Frame founder Laura Seymour added the five-year-old, from Upton, Wirral, was "beautiful, with or without hair".
Alopecia is a hair-loss condition, which affects nearly 2% of the UK population.
Doctors believe Sydney's first bout of alopecia, at the age of two, was triggered by stress following a hospital visit to remove a piece of a pen she got stuck up her nose.
Although her hair grew back, she lost her eyebrows and eyelashes when she was three after her parents tried to part her from her dummy.
Her hair started to fall out in clumps at the age of four, following an operation to improve her hearing by inserting grommets.
"Brushing it was like something out of a film - it was coming out in handfuls and, when she woke up in the morning, it would be all over her pillow," Mrs Caraher said.
"She went through a stage of saying she was a boy now. She was so young and just didn't understand so we went along with it.
"However, when Frozen came out she quickly changed her mind and wanted to be a princess again."
The family also had to deal with people staring at Sydney and wrongly assuming she had cancer.
"Sydney winning this should help make people aware of the condition, and that there is support out there if they need it," Mrs Caraher said.
