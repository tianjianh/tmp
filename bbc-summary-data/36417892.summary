The campaign launched with the help of Andy Murray and Great Britain's Davis Cup-winning team with their video on why you should fall in love with tennis.
Former British number one Annabel Croft says: "As someone who has played tennis for decades, the Tennis for Kids initiative is extremely exciting as it offers children who are completely new to the sport an easy way to start getting involved.
"It is also a lovely way to get parents in on the action, as they are actively encouraged to attend the final session."
"After our momentous Davis Cup win in 2015, we wanted to ensure we did something that really focused on the younger generation and inspired them to get involved in a sport that they could continue to enjoy throughout their lives," added LTA chief executive Michael Downey.
