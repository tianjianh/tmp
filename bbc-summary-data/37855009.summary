It encourages people to discreetly ask for help by going to the bar and 'Ask for Angela' - a phrase aimed at alerting bar staff to the cry for help so they can help defuse the situation.
The poster also includes a phone number for Lincolnshire Rape Crisis for anyone who needs to talk.
One of the posters was tweeted by IZ (@iizzzzzi ) and has since gone viral and retweeted more than 28,000 times.
It is the work of Lincolnshire County Council and has even caught the attention of Hollywood.
Hayley Child, who came up with the campaign, was amazed when the poster got Ashton Kutcher's approval.
Hayley, who works as the sexual violence and abuse strategy co-ordinator for Lincolnshire, said: "Angela was a play on the word (guardian) Angel. The posters are up in male and female toilets, and provide reassurance there is support available if needed."
Many people have expressed their support for idea and called for it to be rolled out nationwide.
Others had mixed feelings about the 'Ask for Angela' Campaign.
