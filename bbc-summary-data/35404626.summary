The Wings, who are 22nd in the table, four points from safety, sacked Loui Fazakerley on Monday following a run of 10 league games without a win.
Frost, 39, will be assisted by former Gillingham defender Barry Ashby.
The duo were part of the coaching set-up when Jamie Day was Welling manager from 2009 to 2014, Frost as first-team coach and Ashby as Day's assistant.
"It's a great opportunity for me and I am very much looking forward to the road ahead," Frost told the club website.
"The aim is clear: survival. The club want to remain in the division and that's a challenge me and my staff believe we can achieve.
"I do not underestimate the task ahead and how hard it's going to be. It's going to be a big test of character."
Jamie Turner has joined Frost's backroom staff as goalkeeping coach.
