The remain campaigner debated Conservative MEP and longstanding Brexit supporter Daniel Hannan.
Mr Izzard said the "European project" to live as one continent is the first of its kind.
Mr Hannan, who has represented the South East in Brussels since 1999, claims the EU has been "corrupt and cut-off from the people it purports to represent".
Business Correspondent Alastair Fee reports.
