Storm Doris has caused a further collapse of Colwyn Bay's Victoria Pier.

A section of the lower end of the pier had already partially collapsed into the sea earlier this month.
But high winds and waves on Thursday have caused damage to the seaward end of structure and the local AM has called for the pier to be dismantled.
A Conwy council spokesperson said officers will inspect the pier at low tide. The incident has been reported to the coastguard.
In 2013, Conwy council voted to demolish the Grade II-listed structure but this was refused by the Welsh Government in 2015.
Clwyd West AM Darren Millar has now called for the council to "work quickly" to dismantle it before more damage is caused.
"Today's storm is one of the worst to hit north Wales in recent years so the further partial collapse of Colwyn Bay's pier comes as no surprise," he said.
"Leaving the pier in this state cannot be an option."
Engineers and health and safety officers are monitoring the scene.
