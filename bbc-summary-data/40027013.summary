Oxford United defender Chey Dunkley has rejected a contract offer from the club and become a free agent.

The 25-year-old has been with the club since November 2014 after joining from Kidderminster Harriers.
The news was confirmed by United owner Darryl Eales at the club's AGM, who revealed a new deal had been offered to Dunkley six months ago.
Eales also told the meeting he believes out-of-contract striker Chris Maguire wants to stay at the club.
Shareholders were told in a Q&A after the formal business of the meeting had concluded that United would try and resist selling more than one player this summer.
Maguire's retention may hinge on whether United can recruit forward Conor McAleny from Everton, who scored 10 goals during a loan spell at the end of last season.
