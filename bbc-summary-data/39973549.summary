Police, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Dumfries and Galloway Council are in talks with the owners of the old Interfloor complex.
They hope to tackle safety concerns and see the clean-up of the site at Heathhall near Dumfries.
They have also issued a warning to the public - in particular young people - to stay out of the property.
SFRS Dumfries and Galloway group manager David Broughton said: "We are always concerned about the possibility of anyone accessing any empty premises.
"From experience, we know that derelict and empty buildings can become a target for malicious fires.
"In such cases, we will always take a preventative approach by working with the owners and other local partners to secure such sites and raise awareness of the risks."
He said the fire service tried to educate young people about the dangers of setting fires, both for the benefit of themselves and other members of the public.
"Additionally, the danger of injury due to the environmental risks within such properties is a real concern," he added.
"Unstable footing, broken glass and other hazardous materials are often prevalent."
"Such activity is not only reckless and dangerous, but can divert SFRS resources away from genuine emergencies.
"However, through robust and flexible strategic planning, our crews are always ready to respond to any incident to keep our communities safe."
