The 34-year-old was a free agent following his departure from National League side Forest Green Rovers.
The former Hull and Preston frontman spent 18 months at Cardiff, where he scored two goals in 15 appearances before leaving in 2012.
"Returning to the Football League was a big bonus for me," he told Newport's website.
"I wanted at least another season at this level to challenge myself and hopefully I can score plenty of goals for the team.
"Straight after speaking with Warren [Feeney, Newport's manager] I was interested in signing here and I'm glad that we have managed to get everything signed and over the line."
