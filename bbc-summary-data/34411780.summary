Oxford University Hospitals awarded foundation trust status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four hospitals in Oxfordshire have been awarded NHS foundation trust status with immediate effect.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust can now set its own financial and operational priorities for John Radcliffe, Churchill, Horton and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.
As part of the change local people can become members and serve as governors.
Chief Executive Sir Jonathan Michael admitted it was not a guarantee of success but said finances were good.
He added: "You've still got to run the business effectively, you've got to make sure you deliver the operational performance, you've got to make sure the books balance.
"If you lose control of that, then you get into difficulties as Addenbrooke's Hospital has done."
He said the status, which is granted by Monitor - the regulator of NHS Services in England, was a "recognition of the quality of the services provided and the efficiency of the organisation".
Becoming a foundation trust means decision making is devolved from central government to local organisations and communities, so it can manage its services to suit the specific needs of the local community.
The trust's GMB steward, Mark Ladbrooke, said: "We believe this will give trust directors a number of important freedoms and responsibilities."
GMB claims there is a "horrific problem of low pay and job insecurity" within the current organisation.
It urged the trust to look at this issue as part of its new status, and also "invest heavily in good quality staff accommodation" as well as "deal with the long standing issues around car parking for patients and staff".
