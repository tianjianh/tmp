Six Nations 2016: Kelly Haimona replaces Carlo Canna for Italy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fly-half Kelly Haimona will start Italy's Six Nations match against Scotland on Saturday after Carlo Canna failed to recover from injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Italy coach Jacques Brunel has made four changes to his starting line-up.
David Odiete returns to replace Luke McLean at full-back having impressed in Paris before missing the heavy defeat by England due to a calf problem.
Lock Joshua Furno and experienced hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini also start for the Azzurri in Rome.
Furno will make his first start of the tournament in place of George Biagi, who has been ruled out after suffering a fractured rib against England.
Ghiraldini, who will earn his 81st cap, returns in place of Ornel Gega after he fractured a cheekbone in the last game.
Having seen Italy come close to upsetting France in their tournament opener, Brunel has sought to replicate his starting XV from match at Stade de France as much as possible.
However, he will have to do without Canna, who had earned praise for his performances despite the losses to France and England.
Haimona, who missed last year's World Cup with injury, will partner scrum-half Edoardo Gori, who will earn his 50th cap against Scotland.
The 25-year-old Gori said: "I feel very humble because every opportunity to play for Italy makes you proud."
Captain Sergio Parisse will earn his 117th cap when he starts at number eight, while Italy's leading cap-holder, Martin Castrogiovanni, who has one more appearance, starts on the bench.
Scotland have beaten Italy nine times in 16 previous Six Nations meetings, with Italy winning seven.
However, Scotland arrive looking to avoid a 10th straight Six Nations defeat, including their loss to the Italians at Murrayfield last season.
