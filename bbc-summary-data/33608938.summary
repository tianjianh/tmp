Scotland's accident and emergency departments have met a key waiting time target for the first time since weekly reporting began.

Official figures indicated 95.4% of patients were seen and then admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.
The latest numbers cover the week ending 12 July. The government's interim target set a figure of 95%.
Health Secretary Shona Robison called the news "extremely promising".
The controversial 95% target was introduced by the Scottish government as a stepping stone towards its full target of 98% of patients being dealt with in four hours or less.
When weekly reporting started in February, only 86.1% of A&E patients were treated within four hours.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde missed the target in the latest figures. It met its four hour waiting time target in 93.9% of cases.
NHS Ayrshire and Arran (94.6%), NHS Grampian (94.7%), NHS Lothian (94.7%) were also slightly below the target.
Across the country, a total of 61 patients waited in A&E for more than eight hours, while another seven people waited for more than 12 hours.
Ms Robison said: "It is extremely promising that our core A&E departments are seeing and treating 95% of patients within four hours. NHS staff have been working extremely hard to cut waiting times and deliver a first-class service, and the figures published today are testament to this.
"It is also good to see that every health board in Scotland treated nine out of 10 people within four hours, with 13 reaching around 95%. In addition, long waits continue to remain low.
"We now need to maintain this improvement and continue to achieve 95% nationally throughout the summer to ensure that all health boards are in an optimum position as we head in to this winter."
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: "This is welcome news and Scottish Conservatives congratulate all those who worked hard to make it possible.
"However, as we all know, one swallow does not make a summer and it would be hugely complacent to think that all must now be well when figures improve in a week while many may be away on holiday. Good news certainly, but so much more still to do."
Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume claimed the minister was "spinning" the figures as four out of 14 health boards missed the target.
Mr Hume said: "That it has taken 100 weeks to achieve this interim target demonstrates the scale of the problems faced by many hard-pressed health boards. It has been some 300 weeks since the SNP's original target has been met."
The weekly figures showed that the hospital site with the best performance record was Ninewells in Dundee (99.1%).
The lowest percentage of patients treated within four hours was Inverclyde Royal Hospital (88.2%).
