Donald Trump: Call for degree honour to be stripped by RGU

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A petition calling for Donald Trump to be stripped of an honorary degree awarded by an Aberdeen university has been signed by thousands of people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Republican US presidential candidate Mr Tump was presented with a Doctorate of Business Administration by Robert Gordon University (RGU) in 2010.
There was opposition to the decision to award the accolade at the time.
More than 3,500 people have signed the petition, which accuses the tycoon of  "hate speech".
The online petition states: "We respectfully request that Robert Gordon University strips Donald Trump of the honorary degree it bestowed on him with immediate effect.
"Why is this important? We feel that Donald Trump's unrepentant, persistent verbal attacks on various groups of people based on nationality, religion, race and physical abilities are a huge detriment to RGU.
"Hate speech must not have a place in academia, in politics or on the world stage. We are confident RGU will agree with the petitioners, and act swiftly."
Mr Trump has since said many Muslims nurse a "hatred" towards America.
In a campaign statement, he called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".
There has been condemnation from Mr Trump's fellow Republicans.
At the time of receiving his honorary degree, Donald Trump said  it was "a great university and a great honour".
However, David Kennedy, principal of RGU between 1987-1997, said he was "appalled" that Mr Trump was getting the award.
Mr Trump's golf resort at Menie in Aberdeenshire has divided opinion for many years.
