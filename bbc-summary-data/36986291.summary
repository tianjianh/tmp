Both Wenger and Klopp have been outspoken about the reported Â£100m valuation of United target Paul Pogba.
"They are things that when I do are not ethical, when others do it, everything is normal," said Mourinho.
The United manager added that he would sign a "very good midfielder" within days - potentially Juventus' Pogba, 23.
"We have 22 players now," he said. "We will have 23.
"He is a Juve player until officially he isn't. The market closes on 31 August. We are trying to everything to close market as quickly as possible, before 14 August."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the reported valuation of Pogba was "completely crazy", while Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp said he would not spend that much on a single player even if his funds were unlimited.
But Mourinho said he "did not like" his colleagues' "unethical" criticism, while also defending his treatment of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Former Germany captain Schweinsteiger, 32, has been training alone, prompting a players' union member to say Mourinho should be jailed for "bullying".
"I had to make my decisions. Simple. It happens at every club in the world," said the former Chelsea boss.
United, who won last season's FA Cup, take on Premier League champions Leicester City at Wembley in the Community Shield on Sunday in a match between the winners of English football's top honours.
Mourinho, who has managed in Portugal, Italy and Spain, believes Leicester's title victory is part of what makes the Premier League so special.
"It's the only country where the football structure allows this to happen," he said. "In other countries they don't want to share the money, the television rights.
"In the other countries they want to be comfortable and know they are always the top clubs in the Champions League. They want it to be a competition of two, three, four and, in some cases, they want it to be a competition of one."
He added: "In this country everyone wants a league and this allows an amazing story to happen. That's why the Premier League is the Premier League."
