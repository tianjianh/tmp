The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 225 points, or 1.4%, to 16,617.
The S&P 500 also rose 1.4% to 1,945, while the Nasdaq composite added almost 1.5% to 4,570 points.
Brent crude rose 5.1% to $34.69 a barrel, while US crude was 6.2% higher at $31.48 a barrel after the International Energy Agency predicted US shale output would fall.
The rally in oil drove up shares of petroleum-linked companies. Shares in both Halliburton and ConocoPhillips both rose 4.8%.
"We saw a nice increase in oil prices today, a really substantial increase, and that moved not only energy stocks, but the entire market higher," said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management.
Technology stocks were also up, with Amazon climbing 4.6%, while Facebook rose 2.5%.
Monday's big loser was flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators, whose shares fell nearly 20% after US authorities said its laminate flooring posed a higher cancer risk than previously estimated.
