David Hitchen, from St Helens, died after his bike collided with a Yamaha motorcycle near Belmont, Lancashire on 21 September.
Bob Howden said he was "deeply saddened to learn of Dave's death".
He also urged anyone with information about the collision to contact Lancashire Police.
The 42-year-old rode for Great Britain in the 1990s, winning several national and international races, before illness cut his career short.
Mr Howden said road deaths were "thankfully very rare" adding that British Cycling continues to campaign tirelessly to improve conditions for cyclists.
"This is a tragic incident which will sadden everyone in the cycling community [and] our sympathies and thoughts are with Dave's friends and family."
Lancashire Police have appealed to another motorcyclist who may have filmed the collision on a helmet-mounted camera to get in touch.
