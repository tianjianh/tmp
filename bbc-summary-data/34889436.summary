Hayley Turner, Britain's most successful female jockey, believes her career has helped inspire other women to progress in the sport.

Turner, 32, recently retired after a 15-year career, winning 763 races.
In 2008 she became the first female British jockey to ride 100 UK Flat winners in a year.
"It's nice for the girls putting in the effort and hard work that they can see there's light at the end of the tunnel," she told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It shows what they are working hard for is achievable."
She added: "It is more difficult for women, they need to train harder because men are physically stronger."
Turner rode two Group One winners at the highest level in Britain during her career, but suffered a number of injuries.
She credited the support of trainer Michael Bell for giving her the opportunity to race when she was an apprentice.
"I find with my job it has to be all or nothing," she added. "You cannot pick and choose and have the odd day off.
"I have had so many thrills and had fun and loved every minute and feel the time is now right to try something different."
