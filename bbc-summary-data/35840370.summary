Plans for a £70m project to build new shops, a cinema and restaurants in a Kent town have been backed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tunbridge Wells Borough Council have given planning permission for Royal Victoria Place to be extended by about 173, 000 sq ft.
It will see the corner of Calverley Road and Camden Road redeveloped and the refurbishment of the historic former Friendly Societies building.
Developers hope to make the centre a major "retail and leisure destination".
Three buildings in the conservation area on Calverley Road and Camden Road will be demolished to make way for the extension.
