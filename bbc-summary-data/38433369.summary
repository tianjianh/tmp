[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe and Crewe had to settle for a point each in League Two after two stunning goalkeeping performances in a goalless draw at the Globe Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts came closest to breaking the deadlock when Lee Molyneux hit the crossbar in the 67th minute after being played-in on goal by Aaron Wildig.
The Shrimps were also denied by a superb save from Ben Garratt, who got down smartly to hold a swerving long-range effort by Michael Rose, while Oliver Turton almost put a right-wing cross into his own goal.
Crewe also had their moments in front of goal, with their best effort coming from James Jones on 62 minutes as he ran on to Charlie Kirk's lay-off but saw his shot from 12 yards brilliantly tipped over by Barry Roche.
The Morecambe keeper denied the same Crewe player in the first half with a flying save before the visitors went close with long-range efforts from Turton and Alex Kiwomya flying just wide.
