Saudi authorities put the death toll from last month's crush near Mecca at 769, but foreign media and officials put the figure at more than 1,000.
The club said it wished to extend "sincere condolences" to the player.
Stoke said it would provide Diouf with "all the support he needs at this extremely difficult time".
The club said its thoughts and prayers are with the player, his family and friends following "the tragic death of his mother".
The former Manchester United striker and Senegal forward joined Stoke on a free transfer when his Hannover contract expired in July last year.
The crush in Mina happened as two large groups of pilgrims converged as they were taking part in one of the Hajj's major rites.
BBC Monitoring put the death toll at 1,216, based on official statements and media reports from 34 countries who lost citizens in the stampede.
