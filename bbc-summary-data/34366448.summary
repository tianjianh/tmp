Alex McQueen almost broke the deadlock for the visitors but home keeper Jesse Joronen saved his left-foot effort.
The hosts were awarded a penalty when Brett Williams was fouled by Miller but Mark Gillespie saved Williams' effort.
But Miller sealed it late on for the visitors as he capitalised after Joronen fumbled Danny Grainger's cross.
Carlisle remain in eighth place while Stevenage are now without a win in their last six games and have lost their last four matches.

Stevenage boss Teddy Sheringham told BBC Three Counties Radio:
"It could of gone either way, but yes it was a frustrating afternoon.
(On the penalty miss by Williams) "I like the fact the he got up there and wanted to take it, we've got to score our chances when we get them, he missed, so what, we've all missed penalties.
"Massive improvement from Tuesday that's what you can ask for, they've showed that, the desire is there.
"It's about me getting results and I know that's not good enough from me."
