Mola, 26, clocked one hour 46 minutes 27 seconds to beat Mexico's Crisanto Grajales by 15 seconds.
With the Brownlee brothers absent, Adam Bowden was the highest placed-Briton, finishing 12th in 1:47.24.
American world champion Gwen Jorgensen won the women's event - her fourth successive victory in Japan - in a race featuring no British competitors.
Britons Non Stanford and Jodie Stimpson had claimed the first two places in Cape Town last month.
Both events in Yokohama featured a 1.5km swim, a 40km bike ride and a 10km run.
Mola, who was fourth in Cape Town having won the opening two races in Abu Dhabi and the Gold Coast, withstood the congestion during the swim and bike legs that saw more than 60 men enter the second transition together.
The Spaniard powered away to his first victory in Japan, with Grajales and Kristian Blummenfelt ensuring Mexico and Norway were represented on a World Triathlon Series podium for the first time.
Jorgensen, meanwhile, secured her first win of the season with a run of 32 minutes 15 seconds - the fastest 10km split ever in Yokohama.
The 30-year-old is fourth in the overall standings.
Australia's Ashleigh Gentle and Ai Ueda of Japan had a close contest for second, with Gentle edging home to take silver.
The next event is in Leeds on 12 June.
