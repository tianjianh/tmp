Arsenal must forget about their Premier League defeat at Manchester United and put their title challenge back on track against Swansea on Wednesday, says manager Arsene Wenger.

The Gunners remain third, five points adrift of leaders Leicester, after Sunday's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford.
"We cannot feel sorry for ourselves," said Wenger, whose side host the 16th-placed Swans at Emirates Stadium.
"We dropped important points but we have to show we're up for the fight."

Arsenal are also three points behind second-placed Tottenham, who came back to win 2-1 against Swansea on Sunday, with nine matches left.
Wenger added: "Mathematically, what this defeat means, we will only know at the end of the season."
Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, lost further ground in this year's race after United teenager Marcus Rashford inspired the home win.
But Wenger refused to accept that an under-strength Old Trafford side should have been an easy scalp for his men.
The Red Devils were missing several key players, including captain Wayne Rooney, but still fielded big-money signings such as Memphis Depay, Morgan Schneiderlin and Juan Mata.
"Let's not go overboard - they still had a few millions on the pitch today, from De Gea to the whole of the midfield," said Wenger.
"They spent a lot of money on [Memphis] Depay - you cannot call him a player from the academy."
