The 31-year-old has been replaced in the squad by Sione Molia.
Williams, a two-time World Cup winner, limped off as his side lost 14-12 to Japan in their opening match in Rio.
He took time off from the 15-a-side game to focus on Rio and was expected to rejoin the New Zealand squad for the Rugby Championship later this month.
