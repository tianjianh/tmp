[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tipp led 0-14 to 0-12 at the break but Kilkenny moved ahead when Kevin Kelly netted early in the second half.
That sparked a powerful Tipperary response and they hit back with goals from John O'Dwyer and John McGrath.
Tipperary surged clear and maintained control after Richie Hogan scored Kilkenny's second goal.
It was Tipperary's 27th Liam McCarthy Cup triumph with boss Michael Ryan tasting All-Ireland success in his first season in charge.
A tight first half, with the sides level 10 times, was followed by a more open second period.
Kelly's goal seven minutes after the restart gave the Cats a two-point lead but it was swiftly wiped out by a determined Tipp team.
O'Dwyer rattled a shot into the bottom corner as Tipperary put on 1-4 without reply.
McGrath fired high into the net with nine minutes left and Hogan's three-pointer proved to be a consolation goal.
Tipp forward Seam Callanan slotted over 13 points in a superb display of clinical finishing.
