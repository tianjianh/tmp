Plymouth Argyle manager Derek Adams has criticised the "inconsistent" nature of the refereeing in his side's 2-2 draw with Portsmouth in League Two.

The match was the first time the clubs had met since they played one another in last season's play-off semi-final, which Argyle won.
"I thought the referee booked some of our players for challenges and allowed their players to go free," he said.
"I thought that was a bit inconsistent at times from the referee."
Argyle had Jordan Slew, Ben Purrington and Yann Songo'o yellow-carded as they extended their unbeaten run to 11 games - their best in the league since 2001-02.
"There's got to be a consistent nature to the game and I don't think there was," Adams added to BBC Radio Devon.
"When they scored the goal they went across to our supporters and celebrated in front of our supporters and we knew that was going to incense our supporters.
"It's not right, but nobody got booked in that situation and that's what I'm talking about, consistency, and it wasn't there.
"Portsmouth are a very good side, they're the best side we've played this season and they're always going to be because of the squad they're able to generate this season."
