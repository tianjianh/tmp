Police in Greece have confirmed they will reopen a case into the death of a Derbyshire teenager who died on holiday in Zante almost three years ago.

Matthew Cryer, 17, from Killamarsh, sustained head injuries outside a bar in Laganas on 21 July 2008.
A UK coroner concluded Matthew had been unlawfully killed and criticised the Greek authorities for failing to find out how he was hurt.
It was initially claimed his injuries had been caused by excessive drinking.
Matthew had gone to Greece after completing a college course. He had worked at a Burger King branch in Sheffield to fund his education.
The teenager, from Killamarsh, died outside the Cocktails and Dreams nightclub in Laganas.
Post-mortem examinations were carried out both in Greece and by a Home Office pathologist in Britain.
Matthew had sustained 20 separate injuries and bruising was found on his body.
Witnesses told an inquest in Chesterfield in 2009 that Matthew had been violently thrown on to the street by doormen.
Matthew's mother, Jo Froud, said she was pleased the Greek police were finally re-opening the case.
"The coroner was very critical at the inquest. He said it beggared belief how the investigation was treated in this case," said Ms Froud.
"In this country we would have been looking at a prosecution, there would not have been all these issues."
Matthew's family and friends have campaigned for the case to be re-investigated since his death in 2008, even writing to the Greek ambassador for help and staging a protest outside the Greek Embassy in London.
