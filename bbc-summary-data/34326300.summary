A couple whose personal details were revealed in a data breach by holiday company Thomson have cancelled their Caribbean trip over fears they could be burgled while away.

Mandy and Pete Garland, from Weston-super-Mare, said their home address, phone numbers and flight dates were shared by Thomson in an email.
Thomson apologised for the error.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had investigated and was taking no further action.
Mr and Mrs Garland were among 458 customers whose booking details were shared on 15 August.
The couple booked a two-week trip to the Dominican Republic in January but later received a balance reminder email with a spreadsheet attached which included details of almost 500 customers from "Scotland to Cornwall", Mr Garland said.
"My biggest worry was how many people on that list are going to be prepared to show those details?
"Anybody with a little bit of brains would be able to look at the list and go 'there's a pretty good chance that house is going to be empty for at least a week'.
"So my biggest concern was the security of the house."
A Thomson spokesman said the email was "identified very quickly and recalled".
The couple said they had received "no apology and no money back". They said rescheduling their holiday "was not an option" as their jobs did not give them that flexibility.
