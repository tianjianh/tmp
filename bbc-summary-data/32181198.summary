About 70 firefighters were called to Rollit House, in Rollit Street, Holloway at 02:00 BST and are still at the scene.
London Fire Brigade said 37 people had to be taken to another location until the building was declared safe.
Nobody was injured and road closures are in place.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
London Fire Brigade (LFB) said the fire took two hours to get under control and had affected the roof and part of a top floor flat.
Structural engineers are on site to establish if the building is safe.
LFB station manager Clive Priestly, who was at the scene, said: "Firefighters draped plastic sheeting in the flats to try and protect homes and belongings as much as possible from the water we used to tackle the flames."
Hornsey Road remains closed to vehicles from the A1 Holloway Road to the Emirates Stadium roundabout. It's open to pedestrians.
