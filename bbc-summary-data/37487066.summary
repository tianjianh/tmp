Bob Bradley: Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins meets former US coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has met former United States coach Bob Bradley with pressure mounting on incumbent Francesco Guidolin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradley joins former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs in being linked with the Swansea managerial role.
Bradley met Jenkins at Bristol Airport but it is understood no decision has yet been made to replace Guidolin.
The Swans' American owners have become concerned, with the club currently 17th in the Premier League table.
The Welsh club have not won in the league since the opening day of the season, have collected one point from their past five games and are one place above the relegation zone.
Bradley, 58, spent five years in charge of the US national side, leading them to the 2009 Confederations Cup final in South Africa, where they were beaten by Brazil.
