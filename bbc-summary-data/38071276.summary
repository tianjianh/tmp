World number 127 Figueiredo was struggling at 4-1 down, but then took four frames to leave Ding clinging on.
Ding, ranked fifth in the world, rallied to take the 10th frame and won a tense decider with a break of 74.
The two-time UK Championship winner said: "I missed some easy shots."
The 29-year-old, runner-up at this year's World Championship, added: "He played well and made a few 50 breaks. But at 5-4 down I told myself to carry on and I knew that pressure would come so I was confident in the last two frames."
Barry Hawkins, another former Crucible runner-up, whitewashed Welshman David John 6-0.
Marco Fu saw off Ireland's Josh Boileau 6-2 but the ever-popular Jimmy White was on the wrong end of the same scoreline against Wales' Ryan Day.
White, the winner of 10 ranking events including the 1992 UK Championship, drew level at 2-2 but could not maintain his form after the interval.
The 2011 champion Judd Trump, world number 13 Kyren Wilson, and Scotland's Anthony McGill are all in action in the evening session.
