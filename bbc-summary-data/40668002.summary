British Equestrian: Chief executive Clare Salmon quits over 'serious concerns'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clare Salmon has resigned as chief executive of the British Equestrian Federation over "serious concerns" about its "culture and governance".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BEF said it will conduct an independent investigation in response to Salmon's comments.
Chair Joanne Shaw said the BEF is considering appointing an interim CEO in place of Salmon, who was appointed in February 2016.
UK Sport told the BBC that it endorsed the BEF's independent investigation.
The BEF is one of several national sporting bodies asked by UK Sport to comply with a new Code for Sports Governance by November 2017.
Organisations must adhere to "gold standards" of transparency, accountability and financial integrity, while the code also sets out a target of at least 30% gender diversity on boards.
Shaw said the BEF will review its "cultural values and behaviour" and update its "structure and processes" to ensure it complies with the new code.
