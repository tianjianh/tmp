The court heard Zubair was detained in Pakistan in November 2013 but not returned to the UK until May 2016 after he appealed against extradition, the court heard.
It was the first extradition from Pakistan to the UK in 10 years, police said at the time.
Judge Rodney Jameson QC said the 36-year-old fled the country intending never to return.
Jurors were told Mr Khyel had been having an affair with Zubair's wife Kainat Bibi and the defendant had known about it for some months, the court heard.
Mr Khyel, 35, from London, and his friend Mr Khan, 27, from Bradford, had gone to Zubair's home in Heath Terrace, Bradford. believing it was safe.
But the defendant knew they were coming and went to the property.
Mr Khyel had been struck by at least six "savage blows", most of them with a dumb-bell bar. His skull was fractured and fragments driven into the brain, said the judge.
Mr Khan suffered "not less than 13 blows" and his skull was also fractured, he added.
Det Supt Simon Atkinson, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "Zubair fled the country shortly after he had killed his victims in the belief that he would also escape justice for these horrendous crimes."
