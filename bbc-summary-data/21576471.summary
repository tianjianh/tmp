Match-fixing bans for 58 football officials handed out by the Chinese Football Association (CFA) have been extended worldwide by Fifa.

The officials were banned by the CFA on 18 February following a three-year push to clean up corruption, with some of the offences stretching back 20 years.
The CFA banned 33 officials for life, with 25 more receiving five-year bans.
Fifa said: "The CFA has emphasised its on-going commitment to stamping out all forms of match-fixing and corruption."
China's Xinhua news agency reported last week that the 58 officials included two former football chiefs who were jailed in June for accepting bribes.
Nan Yong, the former head of Chinese football, was sentenced to 10 and a half years for taking bribes worth more than 1.48 million yuan (£157,000), while his predecessor Xie Yalong received an identical sentence and was fined 200,000 yuan (£21,200).
Former CFA deputy head Yang Yimin and World Cup referee Lu Jun, once hailed as China's "Golden Whistle", were also among the 33 banned from football for life.
Four former Chinese national team players, Shen Si, Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming, were jailed for up to six years in June for match-fixing.
