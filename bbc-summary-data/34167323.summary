Rooney scored his 49th goal for England in their Euro 2016 qualifying match against San Marino, equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's record.
Sir Bobby was a member of the 1966 England World Cup winning team, and his goal-scoring record has remained unbroken for the last 45 years.
After the match Rooney said: "To be level with Sir Bobby is a huge honour, a great moment and I am very proud of it,"
"Hopefully I will surpass that and become the outright leader." said Rooney.
England went on to beat San Marino 6 - 0  and are now through to the finals in France next year.
