M3 closure: Water and sand poured onto motorway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water and sand cascaded onto the busy M3 motorway after a water main burst on a bridge during the morning rush hour.

Water ran down the embankment and over the southbound carriageway at Camberley, Surrey.
Motorway lanes were closed for emergency repairs, causing delays of up to two hours for thousands of commuters.
South East Water said it had trouble trying to shut off water from a broken pipe.
It said supplies to customers had returned to normal and hoped pipe repairs on the bridge would be complete "by this evening".
BBC reporter Joe Campbell said:  "A cast iron main supplying north Camberley split overnight. Water poured down the embankment, taking tonnes of sand with it, right onto the M3. The pipe here has split along its length."
Neil Morton, of South East Water, said: "At one stage we were pumping about 320 litres a second to the area. Unfortunately being on top of the motorway, it has caused an issue, but Highways England are dealing with that.".
Highways England said two lanes of the M3 were shut for five hours.
