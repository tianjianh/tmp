[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mablethorpe £95,000 beach hut plan approved by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £95,000 project to build new beach huts and restore others on the seafront of a resort in Lincolnshire has been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East Lindsey District Council is building four new huts near Queen's Garden Square in Mablethorpe.
It is also removing 15 chalets on the South Promenade which are in poor condition and selling off the plots to the public with a 20-year lease.
All other council-owned beach huts in the town will be repainted.
The scheme was approved by the district council's planning committee.
Councillor Craig Leyland, portfolio holder for the economy, said: "Beach huts remain an important part of the seaside experience on our coast and the investment we're making in the new huts will mean they remain so for many years to come."
