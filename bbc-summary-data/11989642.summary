[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On 7 July 2005, Samantha Badham left her car at home and got the Tube to work with her partner Lee Harris.

The change was prompted by her plans to have dinner in London's Soho district that evening with four friends.
So it was a rare commute on the Underground for Ms Badham, a 35-year-old web designer and content editor, from the home she shared with Mr Harris in Tottenham.
It was their tragic misfortune to be on the same Piccadilly Line train as Germaine Lindsay, who detonated his bomb in the front carriage.
Ms Badham was formally identified by police on 16 July, a day after Mr Harris died in hospital.
At the inquest five years on, medics recounted finding the couple lying next to each other on the tracks, in severe pain and with their legs twisted and entwined with each other.
Paramedic Adam Desmond said Miss Badham had smiled at him and squeezed his hand after he whispered that he was about to move her.
"I took that to mean that she had understood what I said," he said.
Philip Nation, another paramedic, said: "She was trying to mouth something to me but to this day I can't really say I heard clearly what it was."
Ms Badham was from Ledbury in Herefordshire and went to Ledbury Primary School and John Masefield High School, where she was head girl.
In a statement to police, her sister Louise Badham said Samantha  did very well at school and excelled at sports.
Ms Badham went on to Birmingham University to study history, and after graduating she returned to Hereford, where she met Mr Harris.
She was on the committee of Hereford Lads' Club and he was a teenager preparing for his Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award.
Her sister told police: "They did not marry, but they were completely devoted to each other."
After Mr Harris found work in London as an architect, the couple moved in together in the Tottenham area, but regularly returned to Ledbury to restore a house they owned.
Mr Harris's mother Lynne told the inquest: "Lee and Sammy were always together."
The couple loved walking in the Welsh countryside and taking photos, she said.
"Sammy was very photogenic. She would always shine when there was a camera about."
She said Ms Badham - who she referred to as her daughter - was a good cook who had mastered jams and preserves, and spoke of her love of sewing and dancing.
While Ms Badham was in her early 20s, she suffered tragic news when her parents died.
On 24 July 2005, relatives paid their respects to the young couple in London, when they bade a silent farewell in Russell Square, above the spot where the Tube train was ripped apart.
They were buried together after a joint funeral service in Ledbury.
