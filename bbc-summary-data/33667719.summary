The 12-year-old, a pupil at Wolfreton School at Willerby, near Hull, fell into a lake near Meymac in the Massif Central region on Tuesday.
She died in hospital in Limoges on Wednesday.
Balloons were released in her memory at the school and special prayers were held at St Luke's Anglican Church in Willerby.
Jessica was one of 24 students and three staff on a five-day trip to the Club Correze adventure centre in France.
It is believed she became trapped under an overturned pontoon, which she and a group of children were jumping from while swimming.
