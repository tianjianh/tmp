Highland councillors criticise boundary shake-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors have criticised a shake-up of ward boundaries with some claiming the changes will damage local communities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inverness's Central ward, which includes Merkinch, Dalneigh and parts of Crown, will lose one of its representatives if the changes come into effect next May.
The boundary changes would mean six fewer councillors across the Highlands.
Central councillors said their busy and deprived ward would suffer.
Changes to council ward boundaries are to be made in most of Scotland's local authority areas.
The Scottish government has accepted proposals for changes in 25 council areas which will take effect next year.
There will be some changes in all mainland council areas apart from Argyll and Bute, Dundee and the Borders.
