[SN]TITLE[SN]
Channel 4 to launch games publishing arm in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Channel 4 is to set up a new publishing arm in Glasgow which aims to "support and showcase" the work of the mobile games industry.

All 4 Games will be led by the broadcaster's current games commissioning editor, Colin Macdonald.
It plans to build a new network of both Channel 4-funded mobile games and games from third-party developers.
The broadcaster said the launch this summer reflected its remit to support new creative talent.
Initially four new roles will be created within the publishing arm.
Once it is up and running, mobile games will be available to download via app stores and all games will be featured on All 4 under the All 4 Games brand.
Mr Macdonald, who was one of the founders of Dundee games company Realtime Worlds, said: "The big challenge for mobile developers is getting their games out there and finding an audience.
"However, the big publishers will only take on a couple of titles at a time, plus they'll take 50% and all the intellectual property rights.
"We want this to be a no-brainer for studios, so we'll take a token share of 15% and, in return, provide the distribution and marketing expertise they might lack."
Jason Kingsley, chairman of games trade association Tiga, said: "We welcome Channel 4's new proposition to support the UK's games industry and, in particular,  helping independent games developers improve how they market themselves and grow successful enterprises."
