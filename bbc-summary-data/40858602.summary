Jai Reason squandered an early opportunity for Maidstone, while at the other end James Kellermann flashed an effort over the bar.
Maidstone goalkeeper Lee Worgan then pulled off an excellent save to keep out a powerful Matt McClure header.
The visitors' pressure eventually told in the second half, with Jake Gallagher scoring Aldershot's goal in the 76th minute after some neat footwork earned him a yard of space in the penalty area.
However, Josh Hare headed an equaliser in off the post in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
