A £15m sports park in Pontypridd will open before the end of the year despite delays when a network of mines was discovered.

Work began on the facility at the University of Wales' campus in Rhydyfelin last year.
But the project, home to the first full-sized indoor 4G pitch in Wales, faced setbacks after "historic mine workings" were discovered.
Developers Pick Everard said the work would be complete by November.
The plans will see a new academic building and training facility, with offices.
Rob Cleaver, regional director at Pick Everard, said the discovery of the mines led to extensive investigations and additional ground works to make it suitable for construction works to begin.
