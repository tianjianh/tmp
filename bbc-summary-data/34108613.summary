Salem High School held a memorial for Adam Ward, 27, who graduated from the school in 2007.
Ward worked for WDBJ7-TV in Roanoke along with Alison Parker, who was also killed on TV by a disgruntled former employee of their station.
He "loved life and was truly kind to people," said the school's principal.
Visitors wore the colours of Ward's favourite sports teams - Salem High School and Virginia Tech University, from where he graduated in 2011.
Ward helped his high school football team to two state championships.
He was engaged to fellow WDBJ7-TV employee Melissa Ott and they were due to marry in July 2016.
"Adam, I will never find a man so happy, selfless, protective, funny, or charming like you. You were the one. My soulmate," she wrote in a Facebook post.
Friends said Mr Ward was very close with his parents and that he and his father were going to cover Salem High School football games for the TV station.
"His smile was the brightest; his heart was the biggest; his enthusiasm was the most contagious; his work was the hardest. Adam was without a doubt the easiest-to-like kid who ever walked the halls of [Salem High School]," the school's principal, Scott Habeeb, wrote on Facebook.
Alison Parker and Adam Ward had been working together as a team at WDBJ7-TV for almost a year.
They were killed by Vester Flanagan, who formerly worked at WDBJ7-TV.
He shot them during their broadcast, along with another woman, Vicki Gardner, who is recovering at a hospital.
