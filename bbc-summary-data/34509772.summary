Both were part of the Puma helicopter force based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire.
Station commander Gp Cpt Simon Paterson said Flt Lt Roberts, 44, from north Wales, and Flt Lt Scott, 32, from London were "exceptional men" who had a "massive impact" on the force.
An MoD spokesman said the crash was "an accident and not the result of insurgent activity".
Three other people were killed when a Puma Mk2 helicopter crashed as it was landing at Nato's training and support mission HQ, in Kabul on Sunday.
Gp Capt Paterson said Flt Lt Roberts, known to his colleagues as "Roly", was "a military man to his core and was the epitome of all that the RAF represents".
Married with two children, he served in Bosnia, the Falkland Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.
His commanding officer, Wing Cdr Toby Sawbridge, said he was "my 'go to' man for all crewman issues and his honest and direct approach was always welcomed".
Friend and colleague Flt Lt Kevin Hare said he "cared about his job so much, constantly pushing the rest of us and never accepting mediocrity".
"On the ground he was equally passionate about his stories of flying experiences and his family," he added.
"He spoke with such joy about his time growing up in north Wales, and strove to ensure he gave his own children the best opportunities and experiences. Our detachment and our squadron will not be the same without him."
Flt Lt Scott, who was married, was undertaking his first operational tour with the Puma before he qualified as a tactics instructor next year.
His wife said her heart was broken that "such a vivacious, young and amazing person can be taken so cruelly and suddenly".
Gp Capt Paterson said he was a "well-respected pilot" whose "experience and level-headed nature made him an ideal pilot to go to Afghanistan on operations".
His commanding officer, Wing Cdr Mark Biggadike, said "Scotty" was "not one to seek the limelight" and was one of the "most dependable and intelligent officers" he had ever worked with.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: "The heartfelt tributes paid to Flt Lt Scott and Flt Lt Roberts demonstrate that they were both highly respected and professional members of the RAF.
"Their untimely deaths are a tragedy and my thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their families at this difficult time."
