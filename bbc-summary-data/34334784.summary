[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 100m gap in the riverbank on the Mar Lodge Estate in Aberdeenshire was filled with a range of materials, including old cars, in 1984.
Many vehicles and tonnes of concrete and boulders are being removed to cut the risk of pollution, due to erosion.
The work is part of a European-funded Â£3.5m Pearls in Peril project.
David Frew, property manager for Mar Lodge Estate, said: "The car embankment has been a blot on an otherwise iconic landscape for many years, and it will be fantastic to see this restoration work finally take place."
