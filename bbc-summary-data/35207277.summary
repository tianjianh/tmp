[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A criminal investigation has been launched after a council leader resigned over criticism concerning his links with a fitness firm owner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire East Council waived its rules when it granted three contracts to Core Fit Ltd, owned by the physiotherapist of former council leader Michael Jones.
A police investigation into misconduct in a public office is under way.
Mr Jones denied any wrongdoing when he stood down on 8 December. He was unavailable for comment.
Core Fit Ltd, which is owned by Amanda Morris, runs fitness classes in schools and was given contracts collectively worth Â£156,000 by the council.
A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said investigators would look into the awarding of contracts and "the involvement of all relevant individuals".
"The purpose of the investigation is to establish what happened and who was involved."
Mr Jones said at the time of his resignation that he was stepping down to avoid infighting within the Conservative group.
