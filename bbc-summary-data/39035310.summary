[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 1-0 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall returned to the League One play-off places with a home win over Peterborough after Lee Gregory redeemed himself from the penalty spot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Playing their game in hand on Southend, Millwall climbed up to sixth as the striker won and scored a penalty during the second half.
Gregory had missed two late spot-kicks in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Oldham, effectively costing Millwall two points in their pursuit of promotion. His response not only secured the two further points he may have felt he owed Millwall, but came as victory began to look beyond their reach.
The hosts started with some promise, when in the opening minutes striker Harry Smith's shot was routinely saved by Luke McGee and then when Shaun Williams struck just over the crossbar.
It was then that Peterborough began to respond. Marcus Maddison tested Millwall goalkeeper Tom King with a 25-yard free-kick, and then the hosts prematurely began to tire.
Playing their eighth fixture in February, Neil Harris' team - who have not conceded a goal since January 21 - also looked short of inspiration until Gregory's show of determination.
The 28-year-old won possession in the 54th minute, broke down the left wing on the counter-attack, and carried the ball into the penalty area until being brought down by Anthony Grant.
A one-time strike partner of Jamie Vardy at Halifax, Gregory then showed admirable belief to again take responsibility, this time beating the diving McGee by finishing into the bottom left corner.
Millwall's defence remained resilient thereafter, securing the result that leaves Peterborough five points behind the top six.
