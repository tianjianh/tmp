[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-radio disc jockey accused of raping a 15-year-old girl with Jimmy Savile raped another teenager after promising her fame, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ray Teret is said to have placed a magazine advert seeking "the next teenage pop sensation", and allegedly raped a girl who responded at his flat.
The 72-year-old, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies 18 rapes and a string of other sex offences.
He is on trial with two other men at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
Alan Ledger, 62, also from Altrincham, denies a series of assaults.
Also standing trial is William Harper, 65, of Stretford, who denies one count of attempted rape.
Mr Teret's alleged victim went "into a bit of lockdown" and submitted to sex with him after he gave her red wine for the first time and she became drunk, the court heard.
Prosecutor Tim Evans said the DJ had earlier collected the 17-year-old from her family home in "a big send off", saying she needed to be in the "bright lights of Manchester".
The attack is alleged to have taken place in the mid-1990s when Mr Teret was in his mid-50s.
After the alleged rape, Mr Teret gave the 17-year-old Â£40 to buy a new dress, the jury was told.
The court heard that, despite his promises, the girl - hoping to make it as a singer - was not found "a jot of work".
The former Radio Caroline DJ also denies an attempted rape, two other serious sexual assaults, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child.
The offences relate to 17 different girls and date back to 1962.
The court also heard how one complainant aged 12 or 13 met Mr Teret regularly at his flat.
Mr Evans said that on one occasion Mr Teret committed a serious sexual assault on her while his co-defendant Alan Ledger, at the time a club DJ, held down her hands.
The complainant later told police of a wall in Mr Teret's flat with graffiti on it which contained names, messages and phone numbers.
The prosecutor said the jury would hear that, years later, the police were able to find such a wall and photographs of it would be shown during the trial.
The court also heard the girl, who is said to have had sex with Mr Teret until she was 15, was encouraged to introduce her friends, also complainants, to Mr Teret.
One of those friends went on to be abused at the age of 13 by Mr Teret and Mr Ledger, according to the prosecution.
Mr Evans said this complainant was another "young, naive, vulnerable" girl who was "to a greater or lesser extent starstruck and charmed".
Another complainant said she was raped aged 13 by Mr Teret and that on a separate occasion Mr Harper - a DJ and presenter who went by the stage name of Tony Grey - attempted to rape her.
Mr Evans said the girl was sent by Mr Teret on "a false errand" to collect a book from the home of Mr Harper who tried to have sex with her before it is said his mother interrupted him.
The prosecution also outlined a string of other alleged offences by Mr Teret, including the rape of a 13-year-old girl he met while compering a talent show and the indecent assault of a 15-year-old in his car.
When interviewed by police following his arrest, Mr Teret said teenage girls did nothing for him, the court heard.
But Mr Evans told the jury: "In light simply of the evidence you will hear in this case, the Crown say that young teenage girls, far from doing nothing for him, were consistently pursued by him through the '60s and '70s."
Some of the three men's alleged victims had had counselling, Mr Evans told the jury, while some had not.
"But each was to a greater or lesser extent affected by what they say Mr Teret and these other defendants, and other men not on trial, did to them all those years ago," he added.
The trial continues.
