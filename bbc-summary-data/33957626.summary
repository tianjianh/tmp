He is thought to have been playing with other children at a house in Mijas, on the Costa del Sol, when he fell into the pool.
Emergency services were called to the property on Sunday evening but he could not be saved.
The Foreign Office confirmed the death and said it was offering support to the child's family.
A spokesman for local authority Ayuntamiento de Mijas said there were 20 people at the property when the child died at the Mijas Golf resort in Las Lagunas, Mijas.
It is understood his parents had been entertaining friends at their rented holiday apartment when the accident happened.
A 15-year-old boy then sounded the alarm, according to Spanish newspaper Diario Sur. The four-year-old died at about 21:00 local time (20:00 BST).
A post-mortem examination was due to take place in Malaga on Monday.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Spain on 16 August.
"We are in contact with local authorities and have provided the family with advice on bereavement abroad, including on repatriation."
