Stevenage 0-4 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peter Crouch scored a hat-trick as Stoke City eased into the third round of the EFL Cup with a comfortable victory at League Two Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-England striker gave the Premier League side an early lead, heading in after Jon Walters' effort hit the bar.
Phil Bardsley made it two before half-time with a stunning 30-yard shot.
Crouch nodded home Marko Arnautovic's cross after the break before adding his third with a clever scissor kick which bounced into the top of the net.
Stoke made five changes from the team beaten 4-1 by Manchester City in the league on Saturday, with Crouch making his first appearance of the season.
Stevenage's defence were unable to handle the 35-year-old's presence in the box as they were thoroughly outclassed by Mark Hughes' men, registering just five shots to the Potters' 25.
While all of the former Liverpool man's goals were from a few yards out, the highlight came from right-back Bardsley who found some room and unleashed an unstoppable left-foot strike into the top corner.
The scoreline could have been worse for the hosts, Crouch seeing his shot blocked before Charlie Adam's follow-up was tipped around the post by Jamie Jones late on.
