Pies, Pints and the Premier League: The cost of football

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of watching football has dropped or remained the same for the majority of fans, according to a BBC survey. You have been telling us about the price of being a football fan:

The report has found that one of non-league football's oldest clubs, Kidderminster, has the unfortunate accolade of serving football's most expensive pie at the cost of £4.50. Many football fans were quick to leap to the club's defence on Twitter.
Scottish League Two side, Elgin City, sells both the cheapest tea (60p) and cheapest pie (£1) in the study.
Southampton supporter Stuart White emails:
I have a season ticket, and used to go to every away game. Now I simply can't afford to go to every game. I stopped buying programmes, food or beverages at the stadium due to the ever-increasing price.
Some fans have been in touch to say they have switched to a local team because the season tickets are cheaper. Gerard Shuttleworth now supports Carlton Town FC who play in the Evo-stik Division One South.
Gerard writes:
The season ticket is £110 compared to over £400 for Nottingham Forest. This has allowed me to spend more money at the club itself, and I will also be looking to sponsor a player which at £60 still leaves me plenty of spare cash from the £400+ it would have cost for the Forest season ticket alone.
Paul Hardcastle now goes to see his local team Dulwich Hamlet. They are a semi-professional team who are currently second in the Ryman Isthmian League Premier Division - a league which stretches across London and the South of England.
Paul says:
Non-league is the future. At my local Isthmian League team it's £10 for a matchday ticket - less if you're unwaged or an NHS employee - you can get a pint from the bar, wander round the stands and get a burger from behind the goal. Compared to the restrictions top league teams put on their supporters in their stadiums, it's a breath of fresh air.
But despite the high cost of some season tickets, many fans still feel that they couldn't live without their football fix. Stephen Davis and his daughter travel to Derby most weekends to see their team in action.
Stephen emails:
I live in Bristol and my daughter and I have a season ticket at Derby. I've been a season ticket holder since 1989 so every other Saturday we travel to Derby from Bristol, plus we buy a programme at the game and then half-time snacks. We also go to away games if we can that aren't too far, this year we have done MK Dons and Reading so far.
It's expensive and certainly takes it toll on the wallet, not to mention the car, but it's worth it. As soon as we get home my daughter wants to watch the highlights and I couldn't imagine not doing it.
Some fans go to extraordinary lengths to see their team in action. Mark Bodwell is a member of the Arsenal Vancouver Supporters Group in Canada.
Mark writes:
Once a year, I'll spend roughly $1,250 (£808) on airfare, $750 (£485) on hotels, $500 (£323) on meals, $500 on touristy activities, $250 (£161) on beer, and $250 on tickets to go to London for a week and watch a couple of matches live at the Emirates. It's the highlight of my year and I spend the other 51 weeks saving up for it.
Those people who actually live in England and get to go to every single match and yet still whine about how much it costs should try being a foreign supporter for a year or two. I would love it - just LOVE IT - if I could have the opportunity to cut my annual outlay in half and be able to attend every match live.
