Birmingham City 1-3 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves came from behind to beat rivals Birmingham City and end the hosts' unbeaten start in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had first-half chances but Blues led at the break when Che Adams turned in Stephen Gleeson's cross.
Wolves equalised with Joe Mason's curling shot and Danny Batth put Wolves ahead after Matt Doherty was denied.
Blues substitute Jack Storer was sent off for a headbutt on Kortney Hause before Iceland international Jon Dadi Bodvarsson fired in Wolves' third.
While Gary Rowett's side slipped to a first league defeat of 2016-17, Wolves are yet to lose a competitive game since Walter Zenga took charge on the eve of the campaign.
Former Sheffield United forward Adams marked his first home appearance for Birmingham with his first goal for the club, which came shortly after Wolves had lost midfielder Lee Evans to injury.
But a revitalised Wanderers hit back immediately after the interval through Mason and then Bodvarsson, who missed a penalty in Tuesday's home draw with Ipswich, rounded off the visitors' display with an excellent shot past Birmingham keeper Tomasz Kuszczak in the closing stages.

Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: "We have to be better at home and how we manage games. The lads did a lot of good things in the first half but we then tailed off.
"We have to make it more difficult for the opposition. We need to show a little more composure as a group. To lose our shape was not good enough."

Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: "The team played very well. They played with heart and passion and had the confidence to stay in the game.
"The second half was amazing and I am very happy for them as they are working very hard.
"I told them (at half-time) they played well in the first half and not to lose confidence as the chances of scoring were very high."
