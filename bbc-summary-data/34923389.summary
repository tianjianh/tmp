Cardigan Bay scallop dredging consultation halted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation over plans for a protected marine area in Cardigan Bay for scallop dredging has been halted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh government blamed "technical issues" but Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said it would restart.
The move follows calls by Whale and Dolphin Conservation, Marine Conservation Society and ClientEarth to pull it.
They said it was unfairly weighted towards dredging, which destroys almost everything".
