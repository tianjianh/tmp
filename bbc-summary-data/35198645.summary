People living and working under Gatwick Airport flight paths are being given the chance to monitor noise from planes with the launch of an online tool.

The Noise Lab provides up-to-date information using live data from a network of on-the-ground sound monitors to produce community noise reports.
Gatwick Airport said it had been modelled on a similar tool introduced by Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam.
Spokesman Tom Denton said it would help to "better understand" noise concerns.
"This noise lab provides up-to-date flight tracking information which will help us to more accurately monitor concerns and, in time, consider options for further noise mitigation measures.
"We recognise aircraft noise is a real problem for some people and we are determined to do what we can to minimise the amount we generate and mitigate against its effects," he said.
Sally Pavey, chairman of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), welcomed any steps that would help residents but said their lives were still being affected by aircraft noise.
"Gatwick Airport is not addressing the real cause of the issue, which is the concentrated flight paths introduced in May last year," she said.
There are an average of 350 daily flights from Gatwick's single runway.
Earlier this year, Ms Pavey joined other groups from across the South East to deliver a protest letter to the government about increased noise from Gatwick should a second runway be approved, saying tens of thousands of people had already had their lives blighted.
