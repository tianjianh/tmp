It follows the company's second round of pilots, in which viewers gave feedback and rated 10 new shows.
The After, written and directed by Carter, and Mozart in the Jungle are joined by cop drama Bosch and dark comedy Transparent, Variety said.
Representatives of Amazon in the US and the UK were not available to comment.
Last year's Amazon pilots saw John Goodman comedy Alpha House and Silicon Valley sitcom Beta commissioned.
The After and Bosch will be Amazon's first drama commissions, following the success of original hit series from rival service Netflix, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black.
The fate of five children's series is still unknown, with Lovefilm and Amazon Prime subscribers voting on Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street, Hardboiled Eggheads, The Jo B & G Raff Show, Maker Shack Agency and Wishenpoof!.
Bosch is based on Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch detective book series and is written by Connelly and Eric Overmyer.
The pilot follows the detective, played by Titus Welliver, pursuing the killer of a 13-year-old boy while also standing trial accused of murdering a suspected serial killer.
Meanwhile Carter's new offering follows eight strangers thrown together by mysterious forces, who have to help each other survive in a violent world.
Light relief comes from Mexican actor Garcia Bernal and British star Malcolm McDowell, who star in comedy drama Mozart in the Jungle, written by Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman.
Based on Blair Tindall's memoir of the same name, Garcia Bernal plays a conductor at the New York Symphony Orchestra.
Arrested Development actor Jeffrey Tambor stars in Transparent - a dark comedy about an LA family which begins to unravel after a series of secrets are revealed.
Written and directed by Jill Soloway, whose credits include Six Feet Under and United States of Tara, it also stars Gaby Hoffmann and Jay Duplass.
Last year five out of 14 pilots were chosen to be produced as series.
