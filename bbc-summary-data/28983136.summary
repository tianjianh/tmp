The 21-year-old winger has been a regular since Ronny Deila took charge of the team, scoring four goals.
And, following his start to this season, he won a call-up to the Scotland squad for next month's match against Germany.
"It was a good boost that the club were looking to secure my future and I'm delighted to be part of such a big club like Celtic," said McGregor.
"I've been here since I was a kid. Hopefully I can repay the faith showed by the club and keep doing well and keep scoring goals for the club."
If he continues, he can be a top-class Champions League player
McGregor returned to Celtic this summer after spending last season on loan at Notts County, where he scored 14 goals.
He marked his Celtic first-team debut with the winning goal in the 1-0 win over KR Reykjavik in July.
Strikes against Legia Warsaw and NK Maribor followed but Celtic were ultimately knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off stage and Deila's side will feature in this season's Europa League group stage.
McGregor also netted in Celtic's opening 3-0 Scottish Premiership victory over St Johnstone.
"It's been a crazy few weeks," McGregor said. "The manager's been brilliant with me.
"I never thought in a million years I'd be sitting eight or nine games into the season and being called up for Scotland and having done so well at Celtic. It's a surprise but it's a pleasant surprise.
"I'm really looking forward to it. It's a new challenge, I've obviously never been involved [with the Scotland squad] so it'll be good to go and meet the manager and meet all the boys as well so I'm raring to go."
Deila is pleased to have tied up McGregor on a new deal.
"He's a player we want to keep of course," said the Norwegian. "He's a very important player for us.
"He's young, very young yet so he can be a very good football player.
"If he continues, he can be a top-class Champions League player. He has unbelievable technique. He nearly doesn't lose any balls."
