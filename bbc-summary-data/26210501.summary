Part of a Dorset beach has been cordoned off following a "large" cliff fall, Portland Coastguard has said.

The landslip at East Beach, West Bay, happened at about 14:30 GMT.
Coastguards, the fire service and police were at the scene and people have been urged to stay away from the cliffs.
It is not yet known if anyone was hurt. A coastguard helicopter was used "to determine the state of the remaining cliffs", Solent Coastguard said.
Watch manager Andy Jenkins said: "We did have a report that two people were missing in the area, but they have now been accounted for."
He added Dorset County Council were sending a geologist to assess the site.
The slip at East Beach is about a mile along the coast from where Charlotte Blackman, from Derbyshire, died in the Burton Bradstock landslip in 2012.
Another slip at Burton Bradstock happened in January.
