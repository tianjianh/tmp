Welsh Water is investing £5m to replace over three miles (5km) of the drinking water main in Llechryd and Cilgerran.
In November 2015 a burst on the network left thousands of customers without water.
The work forms part of a £21m investment to improve the quality of water supply in west Wales.
It will see more than 108 miles (174km) of pipe replaced or cleaned over the next two years.
Other areas to benefit include Hermon and Eglwyswrw in Pembrokeshire and in the Pontsian area in neighbouring Ceredigion.
With some parts of the water network laid over 100 years ago, Ian Christie, Welsh Water's managing director of water services, said "the time has come for us to undertake some essential work".
During the work some customers may experience low pressure or discoloured water.
"We understand that a large refurbishment programme like this can cause disruption in the short-term, but the long term benefits include reduced leaks, less interruptions to supply and high quality drinking water," added Mr Christie.
