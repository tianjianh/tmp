[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust chief Lezli Boswell to retire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) Lezli Boswell is retiring.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her departure was announced at the end of the trust's AGM by chairman Angela Ballatti, who thanked her for her "exceptional leadership".
In a statement, Ms Boswell said it was the "right time" after 14 years as an NHS chief executive to retire.
Andrew MacCallum, who had been Ms Boswell's deputy, will step in as acting chief executive.
Ms Boswell took over as interim chief executive of the RCHT from Peter Colclough in September 2011.
She previously worked for the strategic health authority NHS South West on preparing trusts for foundation applications.
Ms Ballatti said the RCHT would begin the formal appointment process for a new permanent chief executive "who can help us continue on our journey to become an outstanding NHS Trust" in due course.
The announcement came at the same meeting where the trust said its revenue budget was Â£1.83m in the red, Â£3.15m off target.
It blamed "underachievement of savings" and higher than planned costs of delivering non-elective surgeries, such as those for emergencies.
