Football kits quiz: Test your knowledge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reckon you know all about bad football kits and the men who bravely stepped out wearing them?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Well, it's time to put that knowledge to good use. Have a crack at this little quiz we've put together for you to do over a mince pie and a sherry this festive period.
Because some of these kits will hurt your eyes, we have thrown in the odd retro classic too. Enjoy!
