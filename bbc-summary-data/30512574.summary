Southampton's care services face cuts of £1m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Care services are to be cut in Southampton in a bid to save more than £1m.

It includes the closure of Woodside Lodge, a 27-bed care home for older people with dementia, following a vote by Southampton City Council's cabinet.
A wife of one of the residents, who did not want to be named, told the BBC the decision was "upsetting".
Labour leader Simon Letts said users would still have support from charities and the voluntary sector.
Meanwhile, day-care provision will be cut from four centres and four satellite services to two centres.
Mr Letts said: "We need to ensure that service users and the carers are happy with the service."
He said the alternatives would have to be "at least as good" as those that are closing.
But the wife of a Woodside Lodge resident said: "I don't think they have taken into full consideration the disruption and the upset that it causes to the residents and the staff."
The home will close once its residents have been moved to alternative lodgings. The council believes shutting it will save £350,000.
Following a consultation, a report by Paul Juan, cabinet member for health and adult social care, recommended that the council concentrates on supported living and extra care housing instead of residential care.
"For individuals with dementia who require residential care to meet their needs, this can be provided more cost effectively for the same quality in care homes provided by private and third-sector providers," he said.
The council said it wanted to minimise or avoid compulsory redundancies.
The future of the buildings is yet to be decided.
Among the cuts to day services are the closures of the St Deny's and Freemantle centres.
The council claims this will save £990,000.
