[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis says one or two unnamed players are nursing bruises and will be assessed ahead of the visit of Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Should they be passed fit, the Baggies will have a fully-fit squad on Sunday.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expects injured midfielders Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana to return before the end of the month.
Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho should be recalled to the starting XI after being substitutes against Stoke.
Jonathan Pearce: "Liverpool can ill afford any slip-ups in the chase for a Champions League slot but West Brom can cause them real problems.
"It's understandable that the Baggies have stalled since passing the 40-point safety mark. Their tiny squad is exhausted.
"Tony Pulis has worked miracles and needs the reward of a treasure chest of summer transfer funds. This is also the sort of game to kick-start a new charge for a club record Premier League points haul.
"They are so strong in the air at set pieces. Liverpool can't defend them or keep clean sheets. I expect a draw."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "The target is to get as many points as we can. And we want performances. We want the players to go out and put good performances in.
"It's going to be a really tough game because they have a lot to play for."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "West Brom have all our respect and all our concentration.
"We will try to be at our best. West Brom have had an outstanding season. Last two or three matches they didn't score but (that's) nothing we should think about.
"Maybe they are the most experienced team in the Premier League. [They have] a lot of things that cause us problems."
I fancy Liverpool to get a win here. West Brom have just started to struggle for goals again and, with no wins in four, there is a danger their season could peter out.
