Stand-off Jacob Miller ran in a hat-trick of Trinity's six tries.
But Saints, who trailed after five minutes, ran in eight of their own as they won both halves 22-16.
Jonny Lomax scored twice while Mark Percival, Greg Richards, Morgan Knowles, James Roby, Jordan Turner and Matty Fleming all crossed too.
Percival added six goals to end up with an individual 16-point haul.
Wakefield's other three try-scorers were Tom Johnstone, Liam Finn - who kicked four of his six conversion attempts - and Ben Jones-Bishop.
Saints, who had lost four on the spin prior to beating Hull KR last time out, remain in fifth place.
With three games left of the regular league season before the Super 8s, Saints pull four points clear of sixth-placed Wakefield, who have now won only once in five league games.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "We're not worried about a top-eight finish. We can't keep relying on teams below us to keep losing.
"We know we need at least another point and they're not easy fixtures we've got left. We've just got to dust ourselves down and have crack on Friday night at Wigan.
"I was disappointed with the first 40 minutes. We dropped off a lot of tackles and had to do far too much defending.
"I thought we showed some decent character to get ourselves back into the game but we didn't show any patience. We got what we deserved."
St Helens head coach Keiron Cunningham: "From us taking the lead, we looked like we were just doing enough to be in control of the game. A lot of the points were gifted to Wakefield.
"We weren't clinical enough with our discipline and our completion was really poor you've but got to give players credit for keeping finding a way to get in front and holding onto a lead.
"I am sure the spectators got their money's worth. They are always similar games when we come to Wakefield.
"It speaks in bucketloads for the team, that the confidence is coming through, we just have to be smarter in the final third. I would have taken the two points before the game."
