Mr Bryant, from Fife, has not been seen since he left the Styx nightclub in Glenrothes on 3 November 2013.
It is hoped that the video, which is being promoted on social media, will generate new lines of inquiry.
On Sunday evening, Mr Bryant's family held a candlelit vigil outside Styx.
He had been drinking in the nightclub on Caskieberran Road and was last seen outside at about 02:00.
Following his disappearance, police mounted a large search including the use of air support, divers and police dogs, in one of Police Scotland's biggest missing person inquiries.
Allan is described as being 5ft 6in tall, of medium build with short brown hair and blue eyes. He has tattoos on both arms and was dressed in a navy, white and grey striped T-shirt, black or dark denim jeans and grey leather plimsoles.
Police previously released a poster in February 2014 and CCTV footage of Mr Bryant leaving the club in June 2014, which has now been enhanced.
Ch Insp Nicola Shepherd said: "Our investigation into Allan's disappearance has been detailed and thorough, and is ongoing. For the past 12 months officers have been working tirelessly to find Allan, spending many thousands of hours following up dozens of lines of inquiry.
"Despite this, and widespread publicity, we have no more confirmed sightings of Allan after he left Styx.
"This makes the CCTV crucial and we have chosen to focus on it again a year on. These are the best images for people to view online to help them think back to Sunday 3 November last year to remember if they saw him.
"The community has been extremely supportive of the search for Allan and we continue to call on them now.
"We also want people to share our video on social media to raise as much awareness as possible of Allan's case, and then contact police on 101 or through our website if they have any information which may assist, no matter how insignificant it may seem."
Ch Insp Shepherd added: "Experts from across the force have been involved over the past year, carrying out meticulous searches and comprehensively examining every piece of information we have received.
"Our support to Allan's family continues alongside our efforts to reunite them with their son and brother, and our thoughts are with them on this difficult day."
Anyone with information on Mr Bryant's whereabouts should contact police.
