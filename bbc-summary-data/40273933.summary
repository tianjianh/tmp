It's where top game-makers and developers from around the world get the chance to show off some of the cool new games and consoles they have been working on.
It's a massive show which lasts five days and takes place every year.
There have been some huge announcements for gaming fans this year, so we have been taking a look at some of the big ones...
One of the biggest announcements at E3 this year is Microsoft's brand new console: Xbox One X.
The top secret console was previously code-named Project Scorpio.
Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, said it was the: "most powerful console ever made."
It's also the smallest Xbox yet, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in power - six teraflops worth!
It also uses super high quality 4K graphics.
