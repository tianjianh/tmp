The 22-year-old is due to answer bail again on 25 April. It is understood police need more time to examine items seized as part of the investigation.
It follows allegations a fake Twitter account was used to send homophobic messages to Ms Monroe.
The writer, who specialises in budget-friendly recipes, has since closed her Twitter account.
Det Insp Phil Jones, of Avon and Somerset Police, said all reports of hate crime were taken "extremely seriously".
