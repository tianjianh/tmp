[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The best chance of a tight first half was missed by Thierry Audel for the visitors, with his shot being saved by Mitch Walker after a fine run.
Paul Cox's men lit up proceedings early in the second, though with Jordan White peeling off his marker nicely and firmly heading in Bradley Bauress's left-wing cross to break the deadlock.
Dover plugged away for the equaliser and were rewarded when Femi Ilesanmi crossed for Ryan Bird to head in powerfully.
Bedsente Gomis missed a gilt-edged chance to win it for Barrow, hitting over from close range.
