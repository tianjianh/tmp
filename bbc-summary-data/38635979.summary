Paint-polluted watercourses checked for dead animals after M606 motorway crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watercourses polluted by white paint which was spilt in a motorway crash in Bradford are being assessed for dead wildlife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 12,000 litres pooled on to the M606 following an HGV crash on Friday.
The Environment Agency has urged people to report "any problems as a result of pollution, such as dead fish".
It said becks around the motorway were "running clear" and "no significant impacts" had been reported after the incident.
The agency said it had carried out assessments of watercourses downstream and took water samples for laboratory analysis over the weekend with the results expected later in the week.
One witness said they had seen paint in the Spen Beck, which runs close to the M606 and the site of the crash.
