Robert Kerr, 56, attacked the girls, who were aged between 13 and 15 at the time, between July 1991 and November 1992.
The abuse happened at his former home in Thornliebank in East Renfrewshire.
Sentencing him at Paisley Sheriff Court, Sheriff Seith Ireland said the offences were of a "grave sexual nature".
An earlier trial heard evidence from Kerr's first victim, now aged 39, who was sexually abused by him between July 1991 and July 1992.
Her younger sister, now 37, who was abused between November 1991 and November 1992, also gave evidence against him.
A jury found him guilty under Section 5 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 1976 of using lewd, indecent and libidinous practices towards the girls by abusing them.
Sheriff Ireland said: "You were in a position of trust regarding these two young girls.
"Both these offences are of a serious sexual nature.
"Often sexual abuse of young people or children leads to future problems and has an impact on the rest of their lives - as was the case here."
Kerr was originally charged with sexually assaulting two other girls in Barrhead in East Renfrewshire between 2010 and 2014, when they were aged between six and 11, but he was acquitted of these charges with the jury finding them not proven.
