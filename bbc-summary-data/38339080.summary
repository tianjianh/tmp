Newport County: Graham Westley expects Rhys Healey Cardiff return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County manager Graham Westley does not expect on loan striker Rhys Healey will still be with the club in January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Healey, on loan from Cardiff City, has been linked with a loan move to Plymouth Argyle.
But Westley thinks the 22-year-old could be given a chance by Neil Warnock at his parent club.
"I don't expect Rhys to be here in January because he [Warnock] wants to have a look at his player." he said.
"I think the early part of January is going to be about Cardiff seeing whether Rhys has got a role to play at Cardiff.
"Other clubs might have an interest if he goes back out on loan, we may have an interest if he goes back out on loan."
Healey has scored six goals in 18 appearances for the League Two side this season having joined the club on loan before Warnock's appointment as Cardiff manager in October.
The Manchester-born striker revealed Plymouth, who County face in an FA Cup replay on Wednesday, had made an approach for him,
That resulted in Warnock criticising Westley for allowing Healey to speak to the media about interest from Argyle.
