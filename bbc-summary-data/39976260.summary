The men sexually assaulted the victim as she was driven around Coventry in January 2016 after promising her a lift home after a night out.
They then drove to a location where she was repeatedly raped.
Calin Lacatus, Timotei Baran and Constantin Vila were convicted of rape and sexual assault after a three-week trial at Warwick Crown Court.
Lacatus, 28 of Beake Avenue, Coventry, was jailed for 10 years for three counts of rape and one of sexual assault.

Baran, 21 of no fixed abode, was sentenced to nine years for two counts of rape and one of sexual assault.
Vila, 28 of Victory Road, Coventry, was jailed for eight years for rape and sexual assault.
The woman had been at Grosvenor Casino and met Lacatus outside after leaving at about 23:00 GMT, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
After a conversation, he agreed to give her a lift home and as she got into his Volkswagen Golf, the two other men joined them.
After being repeatedly sexually assaulted and then raped by the three men, the woman managed to escape and called a friend who drove her back to the casino where they contacted police.
Jonathan Kelleher, from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's rape and serious sexual offences unit, said: "These defendants are dangerous sexual predators who preyed on a vulnerable woman.
"They subjected the victim to a horrendous sexual assault after luring her into their car under the pretence of giving her a lift home.
"We would like to take this opportunity of commending the victim for her support and helping us to bring these three men to justice."
