[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
June Matthews, 83, who had impaired mobility, used quad bikes to get round her 130-acre farmland at Oxton, near Starcross, Devon.
She was taking out rubbish when the accident happened last November.
Torbay, Plymouth and South Devon coroner Ian Arrow concluded Mrs Matthews' death was accidental.
The hearing was told Mrs Matthews had ridden quad bikes for more than 50 years, but because of problems with her knees, she rode in a side saddle position.
Her daughter Elizabeth said her mother was a "very competent rider" who "rode quite fast".
Neighbours found Mrs Matthews trapped underneath the quad bike the following morning - up to 12 hours after she was fatally injured.
A post-mortem examination revealed she died from vehicle trauma including broken ribs and aortic transection.
The inquest head tyre pressures were overinflated on one side of the all-terrain vehicle and underinflated on the other side, which made it veer when the accelerator was activated.
Neighbours described her as a "fiercely independent and determined lady" who loved the seclusion of her house and land.
