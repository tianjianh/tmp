The 24-year-old was tackled by Didier Ndong and immediately dropped to the turf wincing in pain before being carried off with his leg in a brace.
"It is an ankle injury but we can't say any more until we see a scan," said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.
"Roberto Firmino also got a knock on the calf but it should not be serious."
Ex-Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Final Score: "It's not looking good for Coutinho.
"He was writhing in agony and waved at the bench straight away. It looks like a really bad injury."
Brazilian Coutinho has been in superb form for Jurgen Klopp's side this season scoring five league goals and six assists in the Premier League.
