New signing Joe Mason poked the hosts ahead after Bolton keeper Ben Amos did not hold Bjorn Sigurdarson's shot.
Liam Feeney fired just over as Bolton dominated the rest of the first half.
James Henry cut inside and fired in to double Wolves' lead after the break, before Silva's header and Dobbie's free-kick earned the visitors a point.
Dobbie's goal was fortunate, deflecting off a player in the wall, but Bolton side were good value for the draw having controlled much of the game.
Mason scored on his Wolves debut inside three minutes with the hosts' first attack of the game, reacting quickly to prod home from the centre of the box.
Neil Lennon's side struggled to get shots on target despite having much of the possession thereafter, but Silva tested Carl Ikeme from distance just before the break.
Josh Vela drew Ikeme into another save as Bolton continued to press after half-time before Henry looked to have secured his side three points when he drifted in from the right to shoot left-footed into the far corner.

But an unmarked Silva took advantage of poor defending to head in Vela's cross, and Dobbie's right-footed strike earned the Championship's bottom side a much-needed point.
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett:
"We need a heck of a run [to make the play-offs] and we know that. There are some very good sides ahead of us. So, we're looking at not a point gained, but two dropped.
"Bolton were in the ascendancy for too much of the game and I accept that.
"Having said that we were ahead early on and then we got a very good second goal.
"When you get into that type of position, you should be able to see it out."
Bolton manager Neil Lennon:
"It was an outstanding performance. I thought we dominated the game for long periods and I couldn't believe that we went 2-0 down.
"We thoroughly deserved a point out of the game and I got everything that I wanted from the performance.
"It gives us a huge lift going into a big game against Rotherham.
"It was important that we got something from this game in hand. Now we have to follow it up with hopefully a win at the weekend."
