The Connacht centre is the only new cap in the first fifteen with two uncapped players, Leah Lyons and Chloe Pearse, on the bench.
Former Dublin gaelic footballer Lindsay Peat makes her first start at prop.
It is the first of three November series games for Ireland's women who also face Canada [19 November] and New Zealand [27 November].

Ireland head coach Tom Tierney said the game against England's Red Roses marks the start of "what is arguably going to be the biggest season in the history of Ireland's women's rugby".
"The Women's Rugby World Cup is now less than nine months away, and while there a lot of rugby to be played between now and then the players are very eager to get things underway in our first ever November series," Tierney said.
"We're without some of our more experienced players, but this gives other members of the squad the opportunity to develop their game and get some much needed experience themselves."
Captain Niamh Briggs is one of those side-lined as she continues to rehab an injured hamstring injury she picked up in a recent club game.
Ireland (v England): M Coyne; N Kavanagh, N Fowley, S Naoupu, A Miller; N Stapleton, L Muldoon; L Peat, C Moloney, A Egan; ML Reilly, O Fitzsimons; C Griffin, C Molloy, P Fitzpatrick.
Replacements: L Lyons, F Hayes, F Reidy, K Norris, C Pearse, M Healy, N Caughey, J Shiels.
