Nottingham Forest boss Mark Warburton has challenged his players to believe in themselves as they fight for their Championship survival.

Forest have drawn both of Warburton's first two games in charge but are just two points above the relegation zone.
"They have the quality, they have the ability," the 54-year-old told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"It's now about having the self-belief in how good they can be week in, week out."
After Gary Brazil's spell in interim control of the first team, former Brentford and Rangers manager Warburton was announced as the successor to Philippe Montanier in March.
He said he had been encouraged by the performances in draws against Derby County and Preston North End, but played down his own impact on the squad.
"It's all credit to the players and their approach," Warburton said.
"They're good professionals and if you give quality people like that structure, guidance and simple messages, they respond accordingly.
"We're working hard day in, day out on the training ground. We've got a lot of work to do still, both staff and players, but I've no doubt about their commitment, work ethic and desire.
"To walk away from a place like Preston with a point and be disappointed tells you we're in the right place."
