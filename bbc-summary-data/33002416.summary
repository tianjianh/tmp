A dog that slipped the lead of its blind owner, sparking a search, has found his own way home.

Labrador retriever Toffee was spotted waiting under a hedge near his owner's house on Wednesday evening about two miles from where he went missing.
He was last seen at Oxford railway station on Monday and missing dog service DogLost launched an appeal.
Owner Ian Francis said: "I am over the moon. He walked in through the door as if nothing had happened."
It was thought Toffee, who is being trained as a cardiac alert dog for Mr Francis, had either got on a train or was still in the area of the station.
Mr Francis, who is registered blind and also has heart problems, said: "I just put some food out for him and left the front door open and in he came.
"He looked at me, wagged his tail and lay down on his bed."
