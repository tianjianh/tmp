Chile country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations. It has been relatively free of the coups and arbitrary governments that have blighted the continent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The exception was the 17-year rule of General Augusto Pinochet, whose 1973 coup was one of the bloodiest in 20th-century Latin America and whose dictatorship left more than 3,000 people dead and missing.
Chile's unusual, ribbon-like shape - 4,300 km long and on average 175 km wide - has given it a hugely varied climate.
This ranges from the world's driest desert - the Atacama - in the north, through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a snow-prone Alpine climate in the south, with glaciers, fjords and lakes.
Chile is a multi-ethnic society, including people of European and Indian ancestry.
Population 17.4 million
Area 756,096 sq km (291,930 sq miles)
Major language Spanish
Major religion Christianity
Life expectancy 76 years (men), 82 years (women)
Currency Chilean peso
President: Michelle Bachelet
Michelle Bachelet returned to the presidency in March 2014 after a four-year break, promising to tackle inequality.
During her first presidency from 2006 to 2010, Ms Bachelet won praise for shepherding Chile through the global economic crisis.
A paediatrician, she served in several medical and health roles before studying military defence. In 2002 she became Chile's first female defence minister.
Her father, an air force officer, was detained during Chile's period of military rule and died in prison in 1974.
Arrested and detained herself by the military in 1975, she went into exile in Australia and then East Germany.
Chile's national and local terrestrial TV channels operate alongside extensive cable TV networks, which carry many US and international stations.
Radio is an important source of news; there are hundreds of stations, most of them commercial.
