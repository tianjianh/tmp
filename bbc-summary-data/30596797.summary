Wi-fi, Skype and backing up: Your family's tech support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sorting out your family's technical problems has become as much of a Christmas tradition as pulling a cracker.

Whether it's a phone that "is not working properly" or a laptop that's "crashed again" - you're the one they call.
But there's nothing like a cross-generational tech-support session to strain even the strongest family bonds.
So here's some guidance on dealing with a few of the more common problems.
"How does it work?" "Do I need to be in the same room as the box?" "What happens when it runs out?"
Ok we're exaggerating maybe slightly but the magic of wireless internet can be baffling for some, especially when it comes to actually using it.
Finding the network and entering the password is often the first stumbling block.
To avoid your folks falling at the first hurdle, log on to their ISP account (whether it's BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk or another) and change the password.
Keep it secure with a mixture of letters and numbers, but make it something they're likely to remember. Maybe use the lyrics to their favourite song?
You can also change the name of the wi-fi network by putting the router's IP address into a browser and logging in. You might have to ask the ISP for that information.
To boost the wi-fi signal, make sure the router is off the ground (on a shelf perhaps) and somewhere in the centre of the house, not tucked away in a corner.
Video calling is a great way to keep in touch with your family, and remind them what you look like.
But sometimes it can feel like it's more hassle than it's worth; "I can see you but I can't hear you" etc.
Whilst you're at home, open Skype or FaceTime and make sure the laptop, tablet or phone's internal camera is selected in the settings.
Also test the internal microphone to check it's working as this is what they'll be using to talk to you, all being well.
Add your contact details to the 'favourites' to make sure they can dial you any time they like quickly and easily.
A rehearsal might help, go upstairs and ask them to call you from the living room.
It might sound like overkill but at least you're not far away if there are problems to iron out.
It happens to us all at least once, so spare a thought for the poor family member that calls you in a panic saying they've "lost everything".
Holiday photos, the spreadsheet of metal-detecting finds and gardening club accounts going back 25 years. Everything.
In this case, prevention is better than cure. Get your folks to invest in an external hard drive and use it to back-up their computer.
Both Windows and OSX have built in services which make it easy to ensure those precious files will not be lost for ever if something terrible happens.
On a PC, access Backup and Restore through the control panel or make sure Time Machine is activated if they're using a Mac.
If they have an iPhone or iPad, make sure they're signed up to iCloud and it's set to back-up their data. Just head to the iCloud menu in Settings.
Syncing contacts through Gmail, Hotmail or another web-based email service is the best way to ensure they're safe even if a phone goes missing.
If you've tried all this and you're still stuck for advice - you could try telling them to switch it off and switch it on again.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
