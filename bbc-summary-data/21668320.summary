Bugaled Breizh trawler sinking: Petition calls for debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners for the families of five French trawlermen killed when their fishing vessel sank off Cornwall nine years ago have called for a parliamentary debate over the sinking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After the Bugaled Breizh sank off the Lizard on 15 January 2004, families of the victims claimed a Royal Navy submarine was responsible.
But the Royal Navy has always denied any involvement and has been cleared.
Campaigners believe a debate could reveal what happened.
A petition has been started in a bid to force a parliamentary debate.
Families of the dead crew believe the vessel was dragged under by a submarine caught in fishing gear, and have blamed HMS Turbulent.
The Royal Navy has insisted HMS Turbulent was in Devonport Naval Base throughout the day.
In January, French Judge Brigette Lamy, who was involved in an investigation into whether charges of manslaughter or failing to assist a person in danger could be brought against HMS Turbulent or its crew, said she agreed with reports the submarine was in Plymouth at the time.
Jacques Losay, a relative of the trawler's skipper has made a film shown in Cornwall which disputes the Royal Navy's claims.
Mr Losay said the speed the vessel sunk could only be explained by the involvement of a submarine.
The sinking happened a day before Nato military exercises began in the area.
The 72ft (23m) Bugaled Breizh, which means "child of Brittany" in Breton, was based at the small port of Loctudy.
