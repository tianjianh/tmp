[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two wickets in an over from Colin Ingram proved the turning-point as Glamorgan beat Gloucestershire by 18 runs via the Duckworth-Lewis method.

Chasing 251 in 44 overs, Michael Klinger (78) and Graeme van Buuren (51) were both lbw to the leg-spinner.
Gloucestershire fell 19 runs short of a revised victory target despite a rapid 51 off 37 balls from Jack Taylor.
Jacques Rudolph's 121 was the back-bone of the Glamorgan's earlier total of 277-7 with a perfectly-timed innings.
Rudolph's innings, off 143 balls and including 10 fours and two sixes, took him past 10,000 runs in his List A career.
But Glamorgan's progress was slowed by losing Ingram, on 45, to a mix-up as he was run-out when in full flow.
Gloucestershire lost three cheap wickets before a century stand between Klinger and van Buuren put them in the driving seat.
After two rain-breaks interrupted the home team's momentum, Rudolph's gamble in turning to Ingram paid off.
Taylor's brave hitting then gave Gloucestershire a chance, but the run-rate proved just too much.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport: "It turned out to be a very good game, I think it would have been more difficult if we'd had to go the full 50 overs but our bowlers held their nerve really well, then Colin came at the end and took those three wickets which blew them out of the window.
"It was a good wicket to bat on, if on the slow side, and we had to rebuild the innings after we lost two crucial wickets, Colin and Aneurin Donald- but I thought 280 was a par score and we were just three runs short of that.
"10,000 runs could be a sign I'm getting on a bit, but it's a nice milestone and something I've always wanted to achieve- hopefully I can carry on this form."
