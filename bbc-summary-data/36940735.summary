A leopard broke into a hotel room in northern India over the weekend giving its occupants a nasty shock, local media have reported.

The PTI agency said Sumit Rathore and his wife Shivani were asleep when the leopard broke a window and climbed into the room early on Sunday.
The couple eventually managed to lock the animal inside the bathroom and raise the alarm.
Officials believe that the leopard had been chased by dogs.
It later escaped from the room and ran off into the jungle.
The hill town of Nainital in Uttrakhand state, where the hotel is located, is no stranger to late-night visitors from the forest.
The incident comes weeks after a Himalayan black bear broke the window pane of a hotel room in the same region.
