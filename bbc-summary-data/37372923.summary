James McKenna scored the opener in the second minute, firing home low and hard from just inside the penalty area.
Ryan Morris grabbed the second with a sensational volley from 25 yards which dipped over Aaron Hogg on 35 minutes.
Joe McKinney picked up a through ball and shot into the net from inside the area for Ards' consolation goal on 37.
The result moves Gavin Dykes' side up to ninth in the table ahead of Saturday's programme of five matches.
Ards remain second, one point ahead of Linfield, who have two games in hand over the north Down club.
The hosts had chances to extend their lead in the second half, but Ryan Mayse shot wide and blasted over the bar, while Johnny Lafferty's effort was comfortably dealt with by Aaron Hogg.
For Ards, Keke's attempt was cleared away for a corner.
