Signs on Margate beach warn public of sinking sand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being warned not to venture on to parts of a Kent beach after some people got stuck in sinking sand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strong winds and heavy rain have created sand drifts on Margate's Main Sands, near the clock tower.
Thanet District Council has put out signs to notify the public of the possible dangers.
Mike Humber, technical services manager, said the sand was much softer than usual and people out walking should be aware of a "potential issue".
He said the affected area had been filled in to stabilise the sand.
