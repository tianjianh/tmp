Luke Burgess: Catalans Dragons prop suffers potentially season-ending injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons prop Luke Burgess may miss the remaining six months of the Super League season after suffering a knee injury in Friday's win at Leigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old will have scans to confirm if he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
Burgess, who won a Super League with Leeds, was part of South Sydney's 2014 NRL title-winning side with brothers Sam, Tom and George.
Dragons have also lost Jason Baitieri for up to 12 weeks with a broken wrist.
Loose forward Baitieri is to undergo surgery in the coming week.
