The Australian will be making his first appearance in the class and will ride the bike earmarked for Hudson Kennaugh, who has withdrawn from the meeting.
Lee Johnston, Peter Hickman and Danny Webb will also ride KMR Supertwins.
Brookes, who lies fourth in the British Superbike series, will ride a Norton in the Superbike and Senior TT races.
The 33-year-old will be competing at the TT for the third time but has been keen to extend his 2017 race schedule around the Mountain Course beyond the 'big bike' events.
The bike the 2015 British Superbike champion will ride is the one that Michael Rutter took to first and second places in the Supertwins races at the North West 200.
"When Hudson withdrew from the North West 200 and TT, my immediate focus was on the North West and Michael did an absolutely brilliant job to take a race win after stepping in at the last minute," said Farquhar.
"Michael had already agreed to ride the Paton at the TT though so wasn't available but having had tentative talks with Josh over the winter, I'm now delighted to welcome him on board. Having a ride of that pedigree riding for KMR is a terrific coup and I'm really looking forward to working with him."
"We were a little bit down on top speed at the North West but Michael showed what the bike was capable of, particularly in the handling department, and with four incredibly talented riders on the KMR Kawasaki's, we're confident of having a good TT.
"It's going to be hard work, without doubt, but all four riders are more than capable of standing on the podium so we'll be giving it our best shot."
