Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions.

The 26-year-old England international was instrumental as the Foxes won the title by 10 points last season.
His previous deal was due to expire in 2018, and there had been speculation of a move to Tottenham.
Team-mates Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan and Andy King, and manager Claudio Ranieri, have all signed new deals this summer.
Drinkwater said: "I couldn't be happier. I've loved playing for this club, it's been perfect for me and my career and I want to be here for a long time to come.
"We've been through so much together and I'm sure there's a lot more to come."
Ranieri added: "Since I joined, Danny has been one of our most consistent players. He's a fantastic player and a fantastic man.
"He's an important player for us and a very popular player in the dressing room. I want him to stay with us for a very long time."
Drinkwater, who joined Leicester in 2012 from Manchester United, won three England caps last season, but failed to make the final squad for Euro 2016.
He played in 35 of Leicester's 38 league games last season and formed an impressive midfield partnership with N'Golo Kante, who joined Chelsea in July.
