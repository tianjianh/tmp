Residents' anger over urinating Slough taxi drivers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Angry residents have claimed taxi drivers are ruining their "quality of life" by urinating outside their homes.

People living in Kenilworth Close, Slough, have put up a sign saying, "This is not a public toilet" and photographed drivers caught short.
Colin Davey, who has started a campaign, said drivers were acting like animals urinating in an area where disabled and elderly people live.
One firm suspended a driver and others said behaviour would not be tolerated.
Mr Davey has also gathered dozens of signatures to hand in to Slough Borough Council and Thames Valley Police to tackle the  problem.
"Taxi drivers come into the close, urinate and drive out again," he said.
"The problem is they just urinate in front of our homes. This is a filthy habit and one way or the other we will stop it.
"The majority of housing is allocated to supported housing, so many of the residents are disabled, elderly or unfortunately have terminal illnesses."
He said although the problem has been reported to police, it still occurred.
"Maybe it's not important enough to them but it certainly ruins our quality of life," Mr Davey added.
"If the government and the police want to keep blaming the young ones for anti-social behaviour, maybe they should look at the behaviour of the so-called adults who call themselves professional drivers yet act like animals."
Residents have claimed the drivers appeared to work for the firms 711-711, A4 Cars, Compass and Viking.
David Green, of A4 Cars said: "I know we had an incident a couple of weeks ago where someone phoned and complained.
"We suspended the driver for one week and put a warning out to all of our drivers. It's totally unacceptable and we don't want that going out from our company."
A spokesman for 711-711 said he had not received any complaints but always worked alongside the council and police.
"I would suspend them on the spot. We could never ever tolerate it and we would take action," he added.
Compass Cars said it was aware of the situation but believed none of its cars stopped there.
Viking said one of its drivers may have been caught short before, but it has toilet facilities in its central office and would warn its drivers.
Slough Borough Council said it would investigate the reports and praised residents for capturing evidence.
"As the licensing authority for taxis, the council can apply pressure on both companies and individuals," a spokeswoman said.
"There is no reason why residents should have to put up with such anti-social behaviour."
