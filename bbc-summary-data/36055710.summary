Medical trial extended for fire crews in the North East

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A six-month trial that involves firefighters across north-east England dealing with medical emergencies has been expanded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four local fire services have been working with the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) since January to respond to life-threatening emergencies.
The firefighters are equipped with a medical kit so they can treat people when they are first on the scene.
The pilot has now been widened to include Redcar on Teesside.
Further stations are set to follow the brigades in Cleveland, County Durham and Darlington, Tyne and Wear and Northumberland who have been working as part of the Emergency Medical Response scheme.
NEAS director Caroline Thurlbeck said: "Our ambition for this trial is to improve the survival rate for those people who suffer from a life-threatening illness or injury in the community."
Firefighter responders have attended more than 1,200 incidents since the trial began. It will run until 30 June.
Similar projects are being trialled elsewhere in England.
