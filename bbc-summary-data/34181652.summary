World champions Germany won 3-2 at Hampden on Monday to leave the Scots fourth in Group D - four points behind third-placed Republic of Ireland.
The top two in the nine groups and best third-placed team qualify; the other eight in third face a two-leg play-off.
"We are still in this," said Strachan, whose side host Poland and visit Gibraltar in their final two games.
Unlike group leaders Germany, Poland and Republic of Ireland, Scotland cannot now claim one of the two automatic qualification spots.
The target is third place and a double-header against another third-place team for a spot in the Euro 2016 finals in France.
Republic of Ireland, who beat Georgia 1-0 on Monday, have a home match against Germany before finishing their campaign with a trip to Poland.
"Well played to the Irish for winning," said Strachan. "We've had two chances over the last couple of days to pick up points and we've not done that, so we can't look about and blame anybody else for anything.
"But trust me, we're still in this.
"If we play like that, the same determination with a wee bit luck - when you play the world champions you need a wee bit of luck. You don't need deflections coming off someone's foot and creeping in the back of the net."
Thomas Muller twice put Germany ahead, but Scotland pegged them back on both occasions via a Mats Hummels own goal and a James McArthur strike.
However Ilkay Gundogan slotted home the winner in the 54th minute.
"They're a bit disappointed in there but I can feel within that disappointment that they gave it a good shot," said Strachan.
"We were just a fraction away from it being the perfect performance. We're three or four passes from being a right good side.
"There's a couple of times in my managerial career when I get angry, I get sad, and actually at this point you feel for the players.
"Every one of those guys has got something inside them that drives them on. To go behind against the world champions, go behind again and you keep coming back, keep plugging away - they can be proud of their performances.
"I can't wait to get them back together. I'm really proud of them and they should be proud of themselves."
