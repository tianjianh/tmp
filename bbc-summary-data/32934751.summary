[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-boxer Patrick Hutton guilty of attacking family

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "fit and powerful" ex-boxer has been found guilty of attacking his wife and family over a period of 50 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former coal merchant Patrick Hutton, 71, was found guilty of four assaults on his wife, one on his son and one on his daughter between March 1965 and December 1984.
His ex-wife Rachel, now 70, told Livingston Sheriff Court the violence began when she was just 20.
It escalated over the years to include assaults on their children.
Hutton, from Longridge, West Lothian, had denied a total of 16 charges, of which he was convicted of six following a four-week trial.
The court heard how the couple's son John, now 50, had left home for good at the age of 15 after suffering serious facial injuries.
He told the jury how he escaped through his bedroom window and hid in the woods after one beating.
But his father found him and dragged him home by the hair before nailing the window shut and attacking him.
John Hutton said his father put on steel-capped working boots before kicking him repeatedly on the shins, calling him "worthless" and "good for nothing".
He then stripped all the furniture out of the room, including the light bulb, and made him stay there until his wounds healed.
Mr Hutton also told the court that his father plunged his head under water and slapped, punched and kicked him on the head and body as punishment for doing things wrong.
Once, when he was left to feed his father's chickens at the family coal yard, he threw the entire sack of grain into the compound because he was scared of the birds.
He said the chickens all died from overeating and as punishment his father beat him and locked him in the chicken shed.
Giving evidence from behind a screen, Mrs Hutton said her "fit and powerful" husband trained at a local boxing club and practised judo. He was nearly six feet tall and weighed 14 stone.
The mother-of-four said the attacks on her often happened when they got home after nights out together in a social club near where they lived in Fauldhouse. He would often come home and "give his wife a slap".
She said she had to stare at the floor in pubs because her husband would accuse her of looking at other men and of being unfaithful to him.
One assault left her with a badly-bruised eye and a fractured bone in her nose and she said she nearly lost consciousness on a couple of occasions when he punched her to the floor and tried to strangle her.
She also told how Hutton ripped the trousers off a black suit she had bought to attend her brother's funeral and threw them in the fire.
Another time, she said she needed stitches in a bleeding gash on her head after she struck her head off a stone fireplace.
Despite several numerous referrals to doctors and hospital accident and emergency departments over the years, she said she always lied about the cause of her and her children's injuries on her husband's orders.
In 1983 he had his hands around her throat when their daughter came into the room and told him to leave her mother alone or she would call the police.
Patricia Hutton, 49, said family members had always spoken openly among themselves about Hutton's drunken rages and physical violence but had been too scared to tell anyone else.
Another daughter, Maria Flannigan, said she was also punched on the head when she challenged her father about attacking her mother.
Hutton will be sentenced at a later date.
