A balloon message released in Bristol has been returned after travelling more than 1,000km (621 miles) to Germany.

Melanie Holly released the balloon in July, to mark her son's first birthday, attaching a message asking the finder to contact her.
Within 24 hours, the balloon was spotted in a field near Bilshausen in central Germany by Laetitia Woodruff.
By chance Ms Woodruff's sister was about to travel to a wedding in Bristol and was able to return the message.
Ms Holly said when she sent up the blue star-shaped balloon, a couple of days after her son's birthday, she "never imagined it would get anywhere".
"We just thought it would be a nice thing to do for him," she said.
"We saw it float over the top of the houses and I thought it would just drop in the sea or get stuck in some trees."
The following day, however, the balloon was discovered in a field near the small village of Bilshausen.
"My sister was hiking from school and on the way she found a balloon," said Ms Woodruff.
"She picked it up and saw the message and took it home and showed it to me and it said 'Bristol' and I said: "That's where I'm flying next weekend."
Following an appeal on Facebook to "find the person" who wrote the note - which was shared more than 6,000 times - Ms Holly spotted the post and contacted Sarah-Jane.
"It's incredible really, she was coming to Bristol for a wedding so we met and she gave me the note back," she said.
"It's a brilliant story for my son to tell his grandchildren."
