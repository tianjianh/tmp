Ibrahimovic set the champions on the way to their biggest home win of the season with his 31st league goal.
Blaise Matuidi made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time before Edinson Cavani and Angel di Maria both struck.
Ibrahimovic then made it four goals in 11 minutes before Maxwell's late goal.
Sweden international Ibrahimovic, 34, became the first player to score more than 30 goals in a season in France's top division since Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi scored 37 for PSG in 1977-78.
His total of 32 goals is also the most Ibrahimovic has managed in a league season in what is set to be his last at PSG before ending a four-year spell at the Parc des Princes in the summer.
PSG are still chasing a domestic treble as they play Lille in the League Cup final next Saturday, following a French Cup semi-final at Lorient next Tuesday night.
Paris St-Germain coach Laurent Blanc: "We lifted our heads out of the water.
"But this win did not wipe anything away. It won't allow us to play in the Champions League semi-final. But it's important for the rest of the season."
