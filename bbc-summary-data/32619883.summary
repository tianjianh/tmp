The gang behind the Hatton Garden raid of 56 safe deposit boxes has "ruined the lives" and livelihoods of its victims, a loss adjuster has said.

Rick Marchant told the BBC it was mainly small businesses that had been hit by the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in London over Easter.
He said he was dealing with seven clients who had lost items with an estimated value of £2m in total.
Victims are due to meet later to consider ways of getting compensation.
"We are dealing here with mainly small businesses and they are not making huge profits," said Mr Marchant, from Marchant and Marchant Limited.
"These aren't extremely wealthy people, for a lot of them their livelihoods have gone.
"All of us might be forgiven for thinking how audacious, how clever, but what [the gang has] done is ruin the lives of many people within the Hatton Garden jewellery quarter."
In total, 72 safe deposit boxes were opened and the contents of 56 boxes were taken in the raid over the Easter weekend, at the start of April.
Jewellery, watches and other valuables were removed from the premises in wheelie bins and bags by the burglars.
A £20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gang, but no arrests have yet been made.
"I have been told by individuals I have interviewed that they have had friends and colleagues who work in the quarter with them, grown men, hardened dealers, in sobs - [they] don't know what to do because of course some haven't insured at all," Mr Marchant said.
"Their view was it is in a safety deposit box - the key word is safet - it should be ok and of course they have lost everything."
Mr Marchant said for those who were not insured, the chances of recovering their sums were "pretty remote".
He said their "only hope" would be pursuing a recovery if there was found to have been negligence in terms of the security of their items.
Mahendra Bavishi, the director of Hatton Garden Safety Deposit Ltd, has previously told the BBC he had "no clue" if the multi-million-pound raid could have been an inside job.
He said he was "puzzled and surprised" at how the burglars managed to get past its security measures.
Police are still investigating why officers did not respond when an alarm went off when the intruders were in the building.
The burglars first went into the building after 21:00 BST on Thursday, 2 April and left shortly after 08:00 BST on Good Friday, 3 April, police said.
They returned to the scene soon after 22:00 BST on Saturday, 4 April and were recorded on CCTV leaving the premises at about 06:40 BST on Easter Sunday, 5 April.
