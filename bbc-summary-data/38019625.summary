Margaret Atwood and other Canada authors in university firing row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Canada's literary community is in turmoil over unspecified but "serious accusations" against one of its own.

The seeds of the literary row were planted a year ago, when the University of British Columbia (UBC) suspended author and lecturer Steven Galloway.
He was later fired after a month-long investigation.
Last week, over 80 of Canada's brightest literary talents came to his defence in an open letter to UBC.
In the letter published 14 November, writers including Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Madeleine Thien and David Cronenberg demanded an independent investigation into how UBC handled the allegations against the creative writing professor and bestselling author.
The university has never revealed the substance of the accusations against Mr Galloway or the results of the investigation conducted by a former BC supreme court judge, citing privacy for both Mr Galloway and his accusers.
But media reports have uncovered accusations of bullying and sexual harassment.
The authors now face criticism that, by attacking the lack of due process they saw afforded to Mr Galloway, they are turning a blind eye to "rape culture".
On social media, they were accused of failing to take into account the impact the flawed process had on complainants and in participating in a "court of celebrity".
Thirteen authors, including Camilla Gibb and Miriam Toews, have since removed their names from the letter.
"I may have been inadvertently complicit in contributing to a culture of shaming and silencing," Ms Gibb wrote on Facebook.
A number of others have added their name to the list.
Sierra Skye Gemma, who filed a complaint against Mr Galloway for behaviour she says she witnessed, told the Canadian Press wire service: "I wept when I read those names because I truly believe those writers have no idea the silencing effect this letter has on victims, both of the past and of the future".
Ms Atwood defended her actions in The Walrus magazine on last Thursday.
"My position is that the UBC process was flawed and failed both sides, and the rest of my position is that the model of the Salem Witchcraft Trials is not a good one," she said.
In a follow-up letter to the Globe and Mail newspaper on Monday, writers Joseph Boyden, Susan Swan and Ms Atwood said any inquiry "should be interested in an outcome that provides fair treatment for Mr. Galloway and all those involved, including the women who registered complaints".
For its part, UBC said in a statement last week that it reached its decision to fire Mr Galloway after a "thorough, deliberative process" that followed all labour laws and university and union standards and agreements.
They said a review of the university's decision is already under way.
Mr Galloway faces no criminal charges. An ongoing grievance process means he cannot speak publicly about the charges.
