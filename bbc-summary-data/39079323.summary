Hope Akpan: Blackburn Rovers midfielder has ban extended by FA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers midfielder Hope Akpan has had his three-match ban for violent conduct extended to four, following a Football Association charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Akpan, 25, was dismissed in the 87th minute of Rovers' 2-1 Championship defeat by Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday, 14 February.
The Nigeria international denied the charge, which was upheld by an independent regulatory commission.
Rovers were fined Â£5,000 for their players' response to the incident.
He has already missed one game as part of the ban, with Friday's game against Burton also included, leaving him with two further games to serve.
