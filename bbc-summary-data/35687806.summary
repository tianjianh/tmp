The fifth-round tie on 20 March comes four days before Chelsea start their Women's Super League One title defence at the Yorkshire club.
Last season's losing finalists Notts County face Durham, while Liverpool host WSL 1 rivals Manchester City.
At least one side from the third tier is guaranteed a sixth-round spot, with Sporting Club Albion away at Brighton.
Sporting Club Albion, who are sixth in the Northern Premier League, are the lowest-ranked side left in the competition after overcoming WSL 2 side Sheffield FC in the fourth round, while Brighton beat Blackburn to progress.
Birmingham City and Arsenal meet in the only other all-WSL 1 tie, while Yeovil Town host top-flight side Sunderland after overcoming Birmingham City on penalties.
The Women's FA Cup final will again be played at Wembley in May. A competition-record crowd of 30,710 watched the 2015 final when it was played at the national stadium for the first time.
