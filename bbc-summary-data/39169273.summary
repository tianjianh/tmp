Rose collided with team-mate Nathan Clarke soon after kick-off, causing a 19-minute delay at Greenhous Meadow.
The midfielder was stretchered off in a neck brace and taken to hospital for assessment, but returned for the closing stages of the 0-0 draw.
After the game, Coventry confirmed that Rose had re-joined the Sky Blues' squad and was suffering from concussion.
