Tadas Zaleskas, 26, and Nonita Karajevaite, 24, were both killed on the A47 near Terrington St John, Norfolk, on Sunday.
Ms Karajevaite's death is being treated as suspicious following allegations she was forcibly pushed into the traffic.
Norfolk Police said the footage, taken at Worzals Farm Shop in Walpole Highway, may jog people's memories.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said: "We now believe that prior to her arriving at Worzals, Nonita was wearing black trousers with a black and white patterned round-neck cardigan. She was also wearing yellow-framed designer sunglasses and was barefoot.
"It is thought that when she got to the lay-by on the A47, probably due to the weather, she has taken off her cardigan and rolled up her trousers, which gave them the appearance of leggings.
"A key focus on this inquiry is anyone who may have seen the couple as they made their way along the A47 so, with this new information in mind, I'd be keen to hear from anyone who may have seen Nonita to come forward."
The couple, originally from Lithuania, were engaged and lived in nearby Emneth.
Both died when they were hit by a silver Kia car as they walked along the eastbound carriageway near Terrington St John at 14:15 BST.
At 13:20 they had both separately spoken to an assistant at Worzals Farm Shop and asked them to call the police, but they left soon afterwards with no explanation. Police were not called.
On Wednesday one lane of the eastbound carriageway was closed while officers carried out a detailed search of the grass verge.
They recovered clothing, documents and a pair of sunglasses, believed to belong to the couple.
