Paul McCauley murder: Bishops appeal for information

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Catholic and Church of Ireland bishops of Derry have called on anyone with information about the murder of Paul McCauley to come forward and put the "truth on the table".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McCauley died nine years after he was severely beaten in a sectarian attack in the city in 2006.
He died in a care home on Saturday.
Among those attending his funeral at St Columb's Church on Thursday afternoon were Bishop Donal McKeown and Bishop Ken Good.
Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown said the family had shown "enormous dignity", particularly in the days since Mr McCauley died.
He said the attack had been particularly "savage" and "sectarian".
"I think we need to have some ability to know what happened, why it happened and clearly there are many people who are aware of the background to this," he said.
"This wasn't a secret thing done by one person up a dark alleyway, this was done by a large group of people. Large numbers are aware of what happened.
"I think we all need to have the truth out on the table so that the McCauley family can know what happened and then move on, and that those who were responsible for the death of another human being can accept responsibility for that and take whatever is coming at them."
The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe Ken Good said: "This day has struck a really deep chord in the hearts of the community and in my own heart too.
"There's a lot of soul-searching going on, there's a lot of deep wondering about what kind of society we are and we want to be and I think it is a time for examining of conscience.
"It's a time of grief, it's a time of sadness. I feel particularly for the McCauley family, for Jim and Cathy.
"They have responded to this whole situation with dignity over the years, with remarkable inspiration for all of us and yet now we have to ask the question about our society as we examine our consciences of why have people not been brought to justice.
"Are there people who need to face deep realities about what has happened?
"It's a sobering time."
Bishop Good appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
"It's too late for Paul but it's not too late for the family, nor us as a society for people to come forward," he said.
During the funeral service, Father Michael Canny told mourners that Mr McCauley's life had been cruelly cut short and his death was a poignant tragedy.
Fr Canny said it was only natural that there was an air of denunciation and an outraged sense of injustice.
"There is a pervading righteous anger here, but let it be the anger of a heart of love, a heart broken by the bitter brutality of men," he said.
Mr McCauley was 30 in 2006 when he was attacked by a mob at a barbecue in the Waterside in Derry, and never regained consciousness.
The civil servant suffered multiple injuries, including a brain haemorrhage and a fractured skull, when he and two friends were beaten by a gang of youths.
He also had two heart attacks on the way to Altnagelvin Hospital.
