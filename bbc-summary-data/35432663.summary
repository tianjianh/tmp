A man has been charged with the murder of a bomb disposal expert whose body has never been found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Gale, 39, from Worthing, is accused of murdering Mark Manning, 54, of Brighton Road, Lancing, who was last seen in April 2014.
Two other men who were arrested last year on suspicion of murder have been released without charge, police said.
Mr Gale, 39, of Offington Lane, appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court.
He is due to appear at Lewes Crown Court on Friday.
Mr Manning's family reported him missing on 22 April 2014, and police launched a murder investigation two months later, even though extensive searches had failed to find his body.
Det Ch Insp Max Ashcroft, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said police were still keen to hear from anyone with information about Mr Manning's disappearance or whereabouts.
