How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has been under fire for spending about $23m (Â£13.8m) of taxpayers' money on upgrading his rural home. A report by South Africa's ombudsman says he should repay some of the costs. See how his residence in KwaZulu-Natal has grown:

The government has insisted that upgrades to the president's home in Nkandla were purely for security reasons but the evidence - including satellite pictures, shown below - suggest otherwise, with images showing an amphitheatre, cattle enclosure and swimming pool were all part of the work.
It is believed that President Zuma has occupied the land, which sits about 24km (15 miles) south of Nkandla town, since 2000. This satellite image from 2006 shows a small collection of buildings on the land.
By 2010, the number of buildings on the land had doubled. A security assessment of the property in May 2009, the same month President Zuma was sworn in, confirmed the need for a security upgrade and this increased when three new houses were built on the land later that year.
This satellite image of the land in 2013 shows substantial work had been done since 2010, with a new security fence encircling the entire residence, a football pitch, helipads and swimming pool. Other additions included houses for some relatives as well as a visitors' lounge and an amphitheatre.
The public protector's report said: "The president tacitly accepted the implementation of all measures at his residence and has unduly benefited from the enormous capital investment in the non-security installations at his private residence."
