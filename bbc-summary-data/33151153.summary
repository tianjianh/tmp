Neil Wallis, ex-NoW deputy editor, felt 'persecuted' over hacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ex-deputy editor of the News of the World told police he felt he was being persecuted when they quizzed him about phone-hacking claims for a third time, a jury has heard.

In a statement to the Metropolitan Police in 2013, Neil Wallis accused officers of being "extraordinarily vindictive", the Old Bailey was told.
He also described as "lies" claims he was aware of hacking at the paper.
Mr Wallis, 64, of Chiswick, London, denies conspiracy to hack voicemails.
Prosecutors at the Old Bailey say Mr Wallis was not accused of hacking any phones himself, but he "knew" it was being done and "agreed" to it.
But in his statement to police, Mr Wallis said the reporter Dan Evans - who himself pleaded guilty to phone hacking - appeared to have come up with "scattergun allegations" to "explain and justify his own behaviour and try and escape or mitigate the repercussions".
The court earlier heard how Evans had targeted the phones of people including actress Sienna Miller, designer Kelly Hoppen, Labour politician Tessa Jowell, entertainer Cilla Black and supermodel Kate Moss.
Mr Wallis was deputy editor of the Sunday tabloid from 2003 to 2007. The paper closed in July 2011 after allegations about phone hacking surfaced.
The jury heard Mr Wallis's written statement was provided to the Met Police when he was interviewed by them for a third time, in October 2013. Mr Wallis had previously spent 19 months on police bail before being told he would not face any action.
In his 2013 statement he claimed the police were being "extraordinarily vindictive, continuing such a campaign of persecution against me".
He also accused police of conducting a campaign to "shackle the British press" and described himself as the "pre-eminent and most high-profile campaigner exposing the Metropolitan Police's abuse of the arrest process".
The court heard that he had said in his 2013 statement that his period on bail had caused him and his family "irreparable harm... it cost me my 38 year marriage, my wife is now undergoing mental health treatment. My teenage son suffered a nervous breakdown."
He also said his daughter's relationship had collapsed under the strain.
Giving evidence in court, Mr Wallis told the court that he was receiving treatment for depression.
He said his depression "sort of happened at significant points over the last four years", adding that one of the episodes took place when he was "left in limbo" during the police investigation.
Mr Wallis's barrister, Neil Saunders, went on to question him about phone-hacking carried out by the NoW's royal editor Clive Goodman.
Goodman was arrested in August 2006 and asked whether he had been aware of his practices before this date, Mr Wallis replied, "No, I had not."
