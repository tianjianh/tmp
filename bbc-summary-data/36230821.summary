He said he had "never believed that the UK should be subsumed into an undemocratic bureaucracy".
Mr Davies said he would not campaign for Brexit, saying the opinions of all UK citizens were of "equal value".
The last of the 11 Welsh Conservative MPs to reveal his opinion, Mr Davies is the fifth wanting to leave the EU, with six in favour of remaining in.
He had previously said he wanted to consult local party members before deciding how he would vote in the referendum on 23 June.
Writing on his blog, Mr Davies said he voted for the UK to leave the then European Economic Community in 1975 - having joined it in 1973 - adding that he and would have voted to leave "at any stage over the last 43 years if asked".
"Carrying out many differing responsibilities over last three decades, I have always worked enthusiastically and positively with the European Union in the best interests of whatever organisation I happened to be representing at the time," he said.
"But put simply, I have never believed that the UK should be subsumed into an undemocratic bureaucracy, which is today's European Union - and which I believe has always been the dream of those who have championed European integration from its beginnings in the 1950s.
"I want the UK to work constructively with our European neighbours, but as an independent state, free to trade and engage with the whole world."
