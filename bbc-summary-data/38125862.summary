The former Barcelona player, 33, suffered the injury after his side had made three substitutions and Juve finished with 10 men.
A club statement said Alves "fractured the fibula bone in his left leg".
The Brazil international completed a free transfer to reigning Italian champions Juventus in June after signing a two-year deal.
Defender Leonardo Bonucci, 29, also had to go off with an injury in the first half after "straining the flexor muscles in his thigh".
