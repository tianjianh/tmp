The 23-year-old Uruguayan has made one appearance for the Premier League club, against Dagenham & Redbridge in the FA Cup, since joining them last August.
Rodriguez scored 19 goals in 71 games for River Plate Montevideo prior to his move to Goodison Park.
"Leandro is held in high regard at Everton and is a big prospect," Bees boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London.
"He likes to get in the box and thrives on crosses. He stretches the line well and those are things we need."
Rodriguez is Smith's first signing as Brentford head coach following his appointment at the end of November.
"It's nice to finally bring someone in," Smith added. "We needed a new face around the place and we are thankful Everton are happy for him to come here.
"We have got a good track record with Everton players when they have come here and done well."
