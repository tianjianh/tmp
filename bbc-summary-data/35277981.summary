There are reports that a quarter of the workforce could lose their jobs in a major restructuring at the plant.
Tata Steel Europe, which employs 17,000 in the UK. including 4,000 at Port Talbot, is in the throes of a wide-scale reorganisation of its business.
The moves have been prompted by a slump in the price of steel.
The Port Talbot plant is the UK's largest steel works.
A spokesperson for Community, the steelworkers' union said: "These reports of potential job losses at Port Talbot should serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing steel crisis and the urgent need for government to deliver upon the agreed steps to protect this vital foundation industry.
"We need a level playing field for UK steel makers, especially on issues like business rates and energy costs.
"Community will be meeting with Tata Steel... to discuss these reports and how best we can build a sustainable steel industry together."
Late last year, Tata Steel said it was in talks with an investment firm to sell its Long Products business, which includes plants in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire.
There have been waves of job losses in the steel industry in the UK, which the sector has blamed on cheap Chinese imports and a collapse in prices.
In October, Tata Steel announced nearly 1,200 roles were to be axed in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire.
