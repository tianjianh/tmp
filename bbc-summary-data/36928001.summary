After winning the toss, the hosts batted well, with Scott Borthwick (84) and Michael Richardson (53) putting on 76 for the fifth wicket as they made 281-7 at Chester-le-Street.
In reply, Yorkshire kept pace with the target up until the final few overs.
Tim Bresnan hit a useful 92 but was removed by Chris Rushworth (3-67) late on as Yorkshire ended on 266-8.
Rushworth also claimed Bresnan's England team-mate Liam Plunkett in the 47th over to dampen Yorkshire's hopes of victory.
Durham were indebted to quickfire scores of 27 from Ryan Pringle and Stuart Poynter at the end of their innings to help their cause.
The White Rose county were ahead of Durham's run-rate until the 44th over, but tight bowling, including the penultimate over from Mark Wood which went for just one run, saw Durham home.
