World number one Spieth made eight bogeys as well as a double-bogey on the 18th in the worst opening-round score of his professional career.
Scotland's Martin Laird finished with a three-under 68 alongside Englishman Luke Donald, while Wales' Jamie Donaldson and England's Justin Rose are a shot further behind.
