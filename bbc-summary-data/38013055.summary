John Burton, Simon Loveland and Thomas Tibbs were all jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court earlier this month.
Footage from the incident, which took place in March, shows the bus driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road.
The three men were involved in a 12-mile police pursuit after they were alerted to the vehicle's theft.
