A campaign has been launched to improve lung cancer survival rates in Wales - which are among Europe's worst.

It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Wales, with the Eurocare study ranking Wales 28 out of 29 countries for survival rates.
A cancer centre, a charity and a pharmaceutical firm have joined forces to highlight the importance of early diagnosis.
The Welsh government said an extra Â£1m will be spent on lung cancer projects.
The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, the Cardiff Velindre Cancer Centre and Boehringer Ingleheim have teamed up to increase awareness and to call on the Welsh government and Public Health Wales to improve survival rates.
Welsh rugby legend Jonathan Davies, president of Velindre's fundraising arm, said of Wales' Eurocare ranking: "Just reading that smacks you in the mouth and makes you say: 'Right, we have got to deal with this and sort it'."
Mr Davies, who lost his first wife to cancer, said it is vital people get an early diagnosis.
Symptoms can include shortness of breath, coughing, chest pains and sudden weight loss.
About half of all people with lung cancer in Wales die from the disease within six months of diagnosis and almost three-quarters within a year, the campaign group said.
Lorraine Dallas, director of information at the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said some people avoid getting checked out as they fear a diagnosis is an inevitable death sentence.
"We have to be really honest in health messaging, we have to be positive. We have to see more that there are incredible, inspiring people who are living with lung cancer and living well," she said.
"It was a life-changing experience," she said. "I stress the importance of following up if you do have a persistent cough or any other symptoms."
She did not even realise at the time that she had been coughing and ended up having half of her lung removed.
"You do get these people who have got this strange attitude of 'I would rather not know'," she added.
Ms Dallas added that, while Wales had a historically high level of lung cancer due to industrial exposure, the progress of other European countries in terms of early diagnosis had not been matched.
Dr Jason Lester, of the Velindre Centre, said e-cigarettes are "undoubtedly" a safer alternative for heavy smokers but added vaping has not yet been shown to be "completely safe".
He said he was "comfortable" with the data cited by the Welsh government in its ban on e-cigarettes in public spaces.
The Welsh Government said more people than ever are surviving cancer in Wales, but acknowledged "more needs to be done to reduce mortality from lung cancer".
"Smoking remains the biggest contributor to death from lung cancer and we all have a responsibility to reducing tobacco use," a spokesperson said.
"As a government, we are making significant efforts to tackle the effects of smoking through our Tobacco Control Action Plan and through measures set out in our Public Health (Wales) Bill.
"Earlier this year, we announced that an additional Â£1m will be invested in the cancer delivery plan to support projects to improve outcomes for people with lung cancer, including improving public awareness of the disease and a programme of 'pre-habilitation' to get people ready for surgery, helping to maximise the benefits of their treatment."
