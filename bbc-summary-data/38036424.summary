[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts started the brightest and striker Mangan opened the scoring on 12 minutes as he found the back of the net with a great curling effort from the left side of the penalty area.
Four minutes later, the former Bolton youth player sent home another chance before the referee's assistant chalked it out for offside, but he made no mistake as he fired through Torquay goalkeeper Brendan Moore's legs to double his tally at the start of the second half.
The Gulls pulled one back just after the hour as Lee Vaughan miscued a pass back to Scott Davies and Dan Sparkes took advantage and reduced the deficit, but Rovers held on for maximum points which saw them move up a spot to fourth.
