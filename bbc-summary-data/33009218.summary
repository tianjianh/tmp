Seconds out - world champion drops in on Parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He looks as if he's been in a fight. But to borrow an old joke, you should see the other guy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Selby, from Barry, is the new IBF world featherweight champion, having stopped Evgeny Gradovich at London's 02 arena on Saturday.
On Thursday, he visited Westminster to celebrate his victory with his local MP, Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns.
Lee normally trains three times a day for six days a week but says that after Saturday:  "I'm under strict orders to have a bit of a break."
He doesn't drink but celebrated victory with a slice of cheesecake (the featherweight limit is 9 stones).
Lee, 28, has been boxing for 20 years and has just one defeat as a professional. He says of the sport: "It changed my life. Many of the friends I grew up with are in prison."
And in the blue corner....Alun Cairns discovered that he had canvassed Lee's home during the election campaign - although the boxer was away for polling day and didn't vote.
Lee's next fight will be in Cardiff in early September. This weekend, he'll be taking his world champion's belt on open-top bus tour of his home town.
