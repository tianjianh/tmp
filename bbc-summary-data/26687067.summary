State Attorney Jeff Ashton will not charge the agent in the death of Ibragim Todashev.
The FBI has said Todashev, 27, attacked the agent with a metal pole during an interview in his Orlando apartment.
Todashev had been a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the suspected bombers.
On 27 May, a team of FBI agents were questioning Todashev about his relationship with Tsarnaev when the altercation occurred.
An unnamed agent fired several shots at Todashev, a mixed martial arts fighter, after reportedly suffering a head injury which required stitches. Todashev was killed.
The agent was also cleared of wrong-doing in an internal FBI inquiry, the New York Times reports.
US officials say Todashev had just admitted a role in a September 2011 triple murder near Boston that was unrelated to the bombing, and implicated Tsarnaev in those killings.
Authorities say Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother Dzhokhar, 20, plotted and carried out the 15 April bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon which killed three and injured 264 others.
The two ethnic Chechen Muslims immigrated to the US from Russia as children.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed days after the bombing during an attempt to evade capture. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shot by police but caught and charged with terrorism in connection with the bombing.
Currently jailed in Massachusetts, he faces the death penalty if convicted.
No evidence has emerged linking Todashev to the bombings.
