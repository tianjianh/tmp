[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Cooper, 36, will appear before Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court later.
Mr Arwani, a British national, was believed to be a critic of President Bashar al-Assad.
The father of six was found shot dead in the Greenhill area of the city on 7 April.
Rob Davis, from the Crown Prosecution Service, confirmed it had authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Mr Cooper following an investigation by counter-terrorism officers.
Mr Arwani was found with bullet injuries to his chest in a parked car at the junction of Greenhill and The Paddocks.
He had been an imam at the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, from 2005 to 2011, and is believed to have attended protests against the Assad regime outside the Syrian embassy in London in 2012.
In 1982, he claimed he was forced to flee Syria after being sentenced to death for photographing damage in his home city of Hama following government suppression of a rebellion.
