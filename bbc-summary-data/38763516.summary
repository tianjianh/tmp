Centre-back Racine, 25, had been on loan with York, but will now stay with the Gulls until the end of the season.
Former West Brom trainee Hodgkiss, 30, played with Torquay player-boss Kevin Nicholson at Harriers.
The right-back has also had spells at Aberdeen, Northampton and Forest Green, where he played 164 league games.
"They are both real men, real leaders," said Nicholson. "They are characters that I want. They will both come in and help the group we have got, both on and off the pitch."
