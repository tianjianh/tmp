Helen Birtwhistle, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said 20,000 English patients were registered with Welsh GPs compared to 15,000 Welsh patients with English GPs.

She was giving evidence to the Welsh Affairs committee on Tuesday, in the wake of a bitter political row over Labour's record running the NHS in Wales.
