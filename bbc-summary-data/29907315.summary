Chris Dagnall and Shaun Batt wasted chances for the visitors, while Orient captain Nathan Clarke had a second-half goal disallowed for pushing.

"Make no mistake, that was a really, really tough game and I'm just delighted to be in the hat.
"It wasn't vintage and it was difficult but that's what we're going to get now - we've got this home record, what do you expect?
"Teams are going to come here, sit behind the ball, try and press and squeeze us and deny us place. Maybe last year we would have last that game 2-1 or 3-1 but such is the character of the boys that we've come out with a win and we're in the hat."
