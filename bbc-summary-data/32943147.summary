Anglesey-based Halen Mon, which exports salt all over the world, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EU gives the company access to "one of the largest economies in the world".
The UK government has committed to holding an in-out referendum on the EU.
Halen's Mon's produce has the EU's Protected Designation of Origin status.
The company said its exports a third of its salt, of which three quarters is sold to other EU countries.
Asked if she thought the UK should stay in the EU, Eluned Davies from Halen Mon, said: "Absolutely.  We have access to a market of 500 million people in Europe.
"Europe is one of the largest economies in the world, we can work with that economy to strike trade deals with other nations such as China and the USA."
However, Ken Beswick, owner of the Cwmbran-based printing company Promocorp Ltd, told the same programme a UK exit from the EU would not be "the nightmare some people think it will be".
Mr Beswick, who stood as the UKIP candidate for Torfaen at the general election, said: "Trade will continue and British manufacturers will simply adjust to the new situation as they've always done."
Sunday Politics Wales can be seen on BBC One Wales at 12:00 BST on Sunday.
