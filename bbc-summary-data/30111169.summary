Dzung Nguyen admitted two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm during a hearing at Swindon Crown Court on Tuesday.
Nguyen, of no fixed address, will also remain on licence for four years.
Det Con Nick Bishop, from Wiltshire Police, said the "extremely violent" attack took place in front of people, some of whom were with their children.
He added: "First and foremost, I would like to praise the members of the public that provided us with statements about the incidents.
"One of the witnesses deserves special mention for his bravery in actually intercepting the attack in the Town Gardens."
The 25-year-old victim was seriously injured but has since been released from hospital.
