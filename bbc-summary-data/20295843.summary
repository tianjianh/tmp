A meeting in Jedburgh is to hear about the cause of major flooding in the town - and the action which is being recommended to avoid any repeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Homes and businesses in the town were affected by waters overflowing from the Skiprunning Burn in August.
Local councillor Jim Brown said a study by engineering consultants Halcrow had produced some important findings.
He urged members of the public to turn out to the meeting in the town hall at 19:00 to hear the outcome.
About 50 homes and businesses were affected in the summer incident, prompted by a spell of thundery rain.
Mitigation measures being suggested include new arrangements for reducing a build-up of debris as well as alterations to kerbs and other street features to channel flows away from properties.
