Republic of Ireland Under-21 international Shodipo came through the academy system at Loftus Road, and is under contract until 2019.
The 19-year-old was given his first-team debut in August and has since made a further 13 appearances.
He could play his first game for the Valiants when they host Peterborough in League One on Saturday.
Meanwhile, midfielder Nathan Ferguson has left the club by mutual consent.
The 21-year-old was signed by former manager Bruno Ribeiro in July, but made only one first-team appearance, coming on as a substitute in the 1-0 EFL Trophy win over Derby in August.
