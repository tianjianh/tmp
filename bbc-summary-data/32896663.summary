The hole opened up as the vehicle was travelling down Hogg Lane in Grays at about 12:40 BST, a fire service spokesman said.
A 656ft (200m) hazard zone has been set up around the affected area. No one was trapped in the lorry but the smell of gas has been reported.
Essex Police and Thurrock Council officers are also at the scene.
Firefighters reported the hole exposed two gas pipes on either side of the road, and gas company officials had been called.
Lewis Smith, who works at a nearby Ford car dealership, said he and his colleagues "shot out and had a quick look" before the road was cordoned off.
He estimated the sinkhole could be up to 20ft (6m) deep.
