When you've done 2,000 shows in eight years, we don't think anyone would begrudge you taking a little break.

Example's announced that he's cutting back on his live schedule to focus on, among other things, his family.
"I feel the need to go away for a while so I can come back in 2016 with a new album and a new live show experience," he wrote on Twitter.
The rapper's released five studio albums since 2007 and had two UK number one singles.
"Last year I did 120 shows and didn't spend enough time in the studio or songwriting for myself and other artists," he wrote.
"In 2015 as it currently stands I will be doing 50 shows with DJ Wire overseas (none of them in the UK)."
If you break down those tour stats, it means he's averaged 250 shows a year, performing roughly 20 songs a time.
That's around 40,000 songs in total.
"I'll be back in 2016 with the full live band and lightshow experience for festivals and tours," he said.
"2015 is all about new music and my wife and son."
Example became a dad for the first time in December.
He's married to Australian model Erin McNaught.
