Sandringham: Dozens of privacy warnings issued by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 50 letters have been issued by police on behalf of the Royal Family, warning against intrusions of privacy at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.

In a Freedom of Information request, police confirmed the letters were distributed to members of the public.
The estate houses the Queen's residence and Anmer Hall, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
One letter said the estate "would take intrusions into their privacy, and that of their guests, seriously".
Norfolk Police handed out 13 letters during 2014 and 36 up to the end of November 2015.
It is not known if the letters were distributed for trespass or harassment, as Norfolk Police could not specify the exact reasons due to the manpower costs involved.
They have been given to photographers and media crews in the area.
An example of a letter seen by the BBC reminds people that Sandringham is a private estate.
"The understandable interest to film and photograph the Royal Family needs to be balanced with their rights to a private family life.
"Whilst in residence on the estate, members of the Royal Family and their guests have more than a reasonable expectation of privacy," said the letter.
The media are encouraged to speak to royal communications should they wish to broadcast or photograph on the estate, it adds.
Anmer Hall, a Georgian mansion, is about two miles (3km) east of the Queen's residence.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child, Prince George started attending the local Westacre Montessori nursery close to their family home in Anmer this month, generating much media interest.
Notices warning the media not to harass the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also handed out by Norfolk Police in May, after the birth of Princess Charlotte.
