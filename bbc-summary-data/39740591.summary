Team Sky's Luke Rowe is hoping to take part in this year's Tour of Britain, which will finish in his home city of Cardiff.

Rowe, 27, had not planned to take part in the race, which will be held over eight days in September.
But he says the opportunity to race on the streets of the Welsh capital would be "special".
"It's yet to be decided but it's on the radar and something I would like to do," Rowe told BBC Radio Wales.
"Potentially it's a once-in-a-career moment, racing a professional bike race on the home roads I grew up as a kid racing.
"It would be so special to have the home Welsh support and have my mates and my family out there."
The eight-stage event, won last year by Britain's Steve Cummings, will conclude with a 180km stage finishing in Cardiff on 10 September.
Rowe said he has already held discussions with Team Sky about the possibility of taking part in the race.
"It's all up in the air at the moment," Rowe said.
"Originally the plan was definitely not to ride it as it wasn't in the race programme.
"But once I heard it finishes in Cardiff suddenly a few phone calls were going back and forth and I'm quite interested in racing it now."
Rowe is taking part in the three-day Tour de Yorkshire, which begins in Bridlington on Friday, as he starts his preparations for this year's Tour de France.
The Welshman hopes to be selected for his third Tour de France having been part of the team that supported Team Sky colleague Chris Froome's wins in 2015 and 2016.
"The race in Yorkshire is my first race back," Rowe added.
"I'll have an altitude camp in Tenerife then I'll have the Criterium du Dauphine, which is a week-long stage race in France and after that will be the Tour de France.
"It's not guaranteed I'll ride. I'll have to perform well in the next month, six weeks to gain selection.
"But I'm quietly confident and hopefully I'll bank a place in the team and 'Froomey' can do the business again."
