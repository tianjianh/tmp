The former broadcaster Stuart Hall has been released from jail after serving half of his sentence for sexual abuse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The It's a Knockout presenter was imprisoned in 2013 after admitting indecently assaulting 13 girls - one as young as nine - between 1967 and 1985.
His sentence was extended in 2014 when he pleaded guilty to two counts of indecently assaulting a teenage girl.
Hall previously worked for BBC Radio 5 live and presented the regional news programme North West Tonight.
He was initially sentenced to 30 months, but received an additional two years and six months over the later charges.
The Ministry of Justice said: "Offenders automatically released on licence at the halfway point of their sentence are subject to strict controls.
"If they fail to comply with these conditions or their behaviour indicates it is no longer safe for them to remain in the community, they can be immediately returned to prison."
