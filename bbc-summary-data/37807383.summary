Jimmy Ball had given National League North side Stockport the lead, and added another in the second half, but goals for Joey Jones, Ugwu and Fabio Saraiva sent the side one division above through.
Stockport took the lead in the ninth minute at Edgeley Park after a stunning 25-yard strike from Hatters' forward Ball.
Woking defender Jones levelled the scores nine minutes later when he headed in his side's first corner of the game.
The visitors then took the lead for the first time just after the half-hour mark when Woking striker Ugwu slotted past Hatters' goalkeeper Ben Hinchliffe from six yards out following a smart Woking break.
Ball then scored his second of the match to equalise for Stockport on the stroke of half time, side-footing home from close range.
Woking then punished the Hatters' failure to be clinical early in the second half when they regained the lead just before the hour when Ugwu stroked a low hard shot past the onrushing Hinchliffe.
And substitute Saraiva sealed the victory at the death with a low drive that nestled into the bottom corner.
