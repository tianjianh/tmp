The finance minister has asked the executive to consider an economic stimulus package which would see businesses matching investment money put forward by the government.

Máirtín Ó Muilleoir told the BBC's Inside Business programme the funding could apply to private companies and councils.
"I am of the opinion, we've had a chance to discuss it very briefly at the executive that we should have our own stimulus package sitting at the centre," he said.
"So if we set x million pounds aside or tens of millions of pounds aside each year that we say to the councils in particular, we say to the private sector, could you match this if we set aside x million, can we have a multiplier effect of two or three times that."
Inside Business is on Radio Ulster at 13:30 GMT on Sunday 27 November.
