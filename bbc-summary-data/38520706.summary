A Lincolnshire town's only GP surgery which had its licence suspended over patient safety concerns will not reopen, health bosses have said.

Wainfleet Surgery, near Skegness, closed in November after an inspection by the Care Quality Commission.
Lincolnshire East Clinical Commissioning Group said alternative care would be provided in the town.
Boston and Skegness MP Matt Warman said keeping some form of local service was "a victory for local people".
About 2,200 patients are affected by the closure of the town's only surgery.
The commissioning group's chief nurse, Tracy Pilcher, said they were looking for nearby GP services to take over the provision of health care in Wainfleet but could not confirm what form it would take.
However, she added it was likely to be on a part-time basis.
Commenting on the decision, Boston and Skegness MP Matt Warman said: "What I want to see is a functioning NHS service provided for the people of Wainfleet, and that is what the commissioners say they want as well."
"This is a victory for local campaigners who were concerned they would have to travel to Skegness, or further," he added.
Patients of the surgery previously mounted a campaign in a bid to prevent its permanent closure.
The news comes as four other surgeries in the county, operated by West Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, are set to close, with 11,000 patients told to register with other practices.
Burton Road and Arboretum practices in Lincoln, Pottergate in Gainsborough and Metheringham will all close on Saturday.
