[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burnley 1-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Vokes scored his 10th goal of the season to earn victory over Nottingham Forest and keep Burnley in second place in the Championship table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A resolute rearguard and some fine goalkeeping from Dorus de Vries kept Forest level in the first half.
And despite improving after the break, they trailed when Vokes anticipated a clever Andre Gray dummy and swept the ball in.
Forest pressed late on but the hosts held on without too much alarm.
The Reds struggled to create opportunities throughout against a defence which has now not conceded a goal in winning three of their last four games.
And only Hull's victory at Ipswich prevented Burnley from going top of the table.
They had to be patient after finding De Vries in fine form to deny David Jones, Gray and Vokes in the first period.
Forest could have gone ahead after the break but Jamie Ward shot over when well placed.
And, after Vokes scored from close range after 68 minutes, Burnley were able to close out victory.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"We've been going strong down the leagues since I got my own group together.
"There's a fantastic mind-set, physicality, belief in what we do. We train right all the time, deliver right all the time.
"I have absolute faith in my group getting stronger and stronger.
"The stats now are as strong as they've been all season, physically. I've got no reason to over-think it."
