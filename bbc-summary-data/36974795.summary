[SN]TITLE[SN]
Church holds review into Archbishop of Wales role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review of the role and responsibilities of the Archbishop of Wales has been launched.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A working group, which includes representatives from the church's six diocese, will look at how the position can be supported in the future.
It follows a call by current archbishop Dr Barry Morgan to look at "the demanding role", which involves duties within the church and nationally.
The group is expected to report back by Easter, next year.
Prof Gareth Lloyd Jones, chairman of the group, said: "We need to be sure that what we ask of our Archbishop in future is reasonable, and appropriate for today's Wales."
