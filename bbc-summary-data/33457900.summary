Tax on dividends: Who pays?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor announced reforms to the tax regime for the dividends investors receive from their shareholdings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
For many, holding shares at all might seem a distant prospect, but for those that do, the reforms will see those with a significant number of shares pay a higher amount of tax.
George Osborne said he wanted to simplify the tax rules around dividend income and ensure those that should be paying tax on earnings that they take through shareholdings pay the right amount.
The Treasury forecasts the reforms will raise £1.96bn a year by 2020-21.
The current system is, to say the least, complicated. The Treasury applies a tax credit and then three rates of tax 10%, 32.5% and 37.5% to all dividend income depending on the level of income tax - basic, higher, advanced (top) - you pay.
Under the new rules everyone will receive a £5,000 tax free allowance. Essentially, dividend payments of up to £5,000 a year will not be subject to tax.
But those who receive more than £5,000 in annual dividend payments will have to pay tax on that income. The amount of tax they pay on that income will continue to be decided by which of the three main tax bands they are in, but the amount of tax they pay has been altered.
The new tax bands look like this:
The chancellor pointed out in his Budget speech that in order to receive a dividend income above the £5,000 tax free allowance individuals would need to hold more than £140,000 in shares. Few people are in this category.
He said 85% of those who receive dividends  - around 1 million people -  and pay the basic rate of tax will see no change in the tax they pay on their dividends, or would even be better off under the new tax arrangements.
However, the higher your income the worse off you are under the reforms.
Higher rate tax payers could be as much as 10% worse off under the changes, according to Danny Cox a chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown. Top rate taxpayers, [those who earn more than £150,000 a year], according to Dermot Callinan, head of private client services at KPMG, could be as much as 25% worse off.
Mr Cox told the BBC the reforms could affect anyone from those that receive bonuses in the form of shares to those that inherit wealth in the form of a significantly large portfolio of shares.
A the same time the reforms seem to be designed to encourage those of moderate wealth, who may have some money left over after they have filled their £15,240  Individual Savings Account (ISA) allowance, to invest their remaining spare cash in equities.
Mr Osborne himself said the reforms were targeted at those people who "self-incorporate and pay the lower rates of tax due on dividends".
That appears to refer to small-to medium-sized business owners who often pay themselves, at least in part, in dividends to top up their salaries or to reduce their tax liabilities and national insurance contributions.
Such practices have been in the chancellor's crosshairs for some time now and he gave warning on them in his March Budget.
On Wednesday he said: "The dividend tax system was designed partly to offset double taxation on profits.
"But the system has not changed despite sharp reductions in corporation tax. Lower rates are creating rapidly growing opportunities for tax planning."
If you save regularly up to the annual limits of an ISA and pension that invests in stocks every year but nothing more then you will continue to be able to do so without having to worry about paying additional tax. Tax wrappers as they are known, which include self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) remain free of tax.
The Treasury has said the new dividend tax rules will apply from April 2016.
Reaction to the dividend tax reforms has been mixed with some suggesting it punishes the wealthy and stifles entrepreneurial spirit. Others have suggested they will encourage more people to save and invest.
