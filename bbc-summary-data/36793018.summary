[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cycling group has expressed disappointment at what it claims is a lack of warning about the closure of a key part of the Dumfries bike network.

The Loreburn bridge which spans the River Nith from the Greensands to Sandside has been shut for maintenance.
It is set to remain closed until late September.
Sally Hinchcliffe, of Cycling Dumfries, said a closure notice had been posted online but there had been nothing signposted at the bridge itself.
"We are really disappointed - it is really difficult for us," she said.
"We run summer rides using that bridge and we wouldn't start at Dock Park if we had known about it.
"We would have started at a different place because every single ride goes over that bridge at the moment."
She said the move had "severed" the cycling network in the town and said there should have been notification at the site some time ahead of the works.
"It is closed right through the summer which is peak cycling season," she said.
Dumfries and Galloway Council said that whenever there was work carried out there was "always regretfully a certain amount of inconvenience".
It said it would have been "unacceptable and irresponsible" not to carry out work required work on the bridge.
"Unfortunately, the original notification signs that were placed on the actual bridge were removed by persons unknown which is very disappointing," the council said.
"However, new notices have been placed around the bridge.
"There is a clear alternative route and new diversion signs are being made and are being placed around the diversion route."
