[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alleged member of a New York crime family has gone on trial over an airport robbery immortalised in the gangster film Goodfellas.

Vincent Asaro, 80, is accused over the theft of $6m in cash and jewels from a cargo hold at JFK airport in 1978.
The robbery was depicted in Martin Scorsese's 1990 film Goodfellas.
Mr Asaro is pleading not guilty. His lawyer says the case relies too heavily on witnesses testifying to avoid long jail sentences of their own.
"When necessary, they lie to each other, and they lie to save themselves," Diane Ferrone told jurors at the start of the trial in New York.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Asaro worked as part of the Bonnano crime family alongside the late James "Jimmy the Gent" Burke, who was played by Robert de Niro in Goodfellas.
"He knew Burke was someone he could make money with," Assistant US Attorney Lindsay Gerdes said in court. "For him, the Mafia was literally the family business. The defendant is a gangster through and through."
While Mr Asaro is not accused of directly taking part in the robbery, he is alleged to have delivered gold chains from the heist to a mob leader.
The goods stolen would now be worth close to $20m (Â£13m).
He is also accused over the murder of a suspected informant who was strangled to death with a dog chain.
