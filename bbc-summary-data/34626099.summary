Two men were shot in the legs during attacks on Sandys Street and Armagh Road in the city on 17 September.
The man was arrested after police searched a house at Churchill Park in Portadown on Wednesday.
He has also been charged with kidnapping, possession of a firearm and a number of drugs offences.
Three guns and a quantity of suspected drugs were seized during Wednesday's search.
A 34-year-old man who was also arrested remains in custody.
Last month, a 26-year-old man was charged with two counts of attempted murder, kidnapping and possession of a firearm with intent over the two shootings in Newry.
In the first incident, a man called at a house in Sandys Street and, after an argument, shot the occupant in the leg.
A short time later, another man was taken from a house at Ardfield Avenue, Warrenpoint, by four masked men and driven to the Armagh Road in Newry, where he was also shot in the leg.
