Britain led New Zealand 21-0 at half-time and clung on as the All Blacks responded with three second-half tries.
They go on to face Argentina in the quarter-finals at 22:00 BST.
New Zealand were in danger of going out but qualified after Fiji's 24-19 win over the USA, and the All Black Sevens will play Fiji in the last eight.
The other quarter-finals will see Japan take on France and South Africa play Australia.
Britain's men are aiming to secure a medal in Rio, having seen the women's team play so well to reach the semi-finals, then miss out on bronze after a 33-10 defeat by Canada in the third-place match.
New Zealand, meanwhile, have had a difficult tournament, with 15-a-side World Cup winner Sonny Bill Williams being ruled out of the Olympics after partially rupturing an Achilles tendon during the All Blacks Sevens' shock 14-12 defeat by Japan.
The All Blacks Sevens only made it through to the last eight as one of the two best third-placed finishers in the group stage.
