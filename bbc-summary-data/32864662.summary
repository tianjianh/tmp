A poster urging parents not to use the police to scare their children has been seen more than 3.5 million times.

The poster features an officer and a message to parents asking them not to use the threat of the police when disciplining their children.
Durham Constabulary wants children to see officers as people who can help rather than simply law enforcers.
And the force's poster has been shared more than 47,000 times and liked by almost 35,000 people on Facebook.
A force spokesman said: "Children should be taught from an early age that if they feel like are in danger and they need help, they can approach an officer who will reassure them."
However, the poster has divided opinion on Facebook.
Jeff Rowse said: "Telling them they will go to jail if they are bad is wrong how? Surely that is the major reason for having a police force? And jails?"
In response Paul Parry said: "Telling a three-year-old that if he doesn't eat his dinner the policeman will come and take him to jail isn't true and will only serve to instil fear into that child.
"The police shouldn't be used to reinforce bad parenting."
Others were more taken with the officer, with several people asking for him to be moved to their local force or saying they would happily go to him for help.
