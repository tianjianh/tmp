A pavilion from which famous cricketers have stepped out to the crease has been demolished to make way for housing.

The former Norfolk county cricket ground at Lakenham in Norwich is being redeveloped for new homes.
The last building to go is its distinctive thatched cricket pavilion and changing room block.
England stars like WG Grace, the Edrich brothers and Clive Radley all played on the ground where cricket matches had been held since 1827.
Planning for new homes had been delayed because of local concerns about the historical pavilion.
A final appeal by a planning inspector decided new homes were a higher priority and the pavilion had no historical merit.
Norwich City Council dismissed the original application because it regarded the pavilion as a "heritage asset", but in 2001 English Heritage rejected this status.
Terry Denning, chairman of the Lakenham Cricket Ground Residents' Association, said he was sad to see the building go.
"It's a wonderful building architecturally but the inspector did not agree. Inside, it still reverberates with the history of cricketers, footballers and rugby players.
"I'm no cricketer but I can feel the history attached to the building. It's been neglected for so many years and now has to go."
