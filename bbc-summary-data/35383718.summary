The fire service was alerted at 12:50 and the airport terminal remained open while crews tackled the blaze on the car park's first-floor.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent four engines to the scene to assist crews based at the airport.
An airport spokesman said the incident was not causing any disruption to flights.
A fire service spokeswoman said: "On arrival, crews found three cars on fire producing large volumes of smoke.
"Four firefighters in breathing apparatus were able to bring the fire under control with a high-pressure jet hose.
"Fire services remain at the airport and are making sure the fire is completely extinguished before they leave. Officers from the SFRS fire investigation unit are also at the scene."
An airport spokesman said: "I can confirm that the fire in our multi-storey car park has been dealt with.
"We are currently investigating the cause. We thank passengers for their patience and co-operation as we handled the situation."
