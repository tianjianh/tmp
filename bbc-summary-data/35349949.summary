About 20 people were also wounded in the blast, which took place in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) on the outskirts of Peshawar.
There has been fierce fighting in the region between security forces and the Pakistani Taliban.
No-one has yet said they carried out the attack.
TV footage of the latest attack showed vehicles parked near the blast site on fire after the explosion.
At least five policemen are among the dead. Their vehicle was targeted by the bomber, officials said. Several civilians were also killed, including a child and a local journalist.
The bomb went off near Peshawar's Karkhano Market, The Express Tribune reported.
A suspected suicide attack at a government office in north-western Pakistan killed at least 26 people last month.
That bomb went off outside the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office in the town of Mardan.
The attack was one of the deadliest since the December 2014 massacre by the Taliban of 150 pupils and teachers in Peshawar.
