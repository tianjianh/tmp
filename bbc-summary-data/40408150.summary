The 27-year-old left Dundee for the Championship club last year but failed to score in 26 appearances and could not secure a regular starting place.
The forward becomes the Pittodrie club's third signing of the summer, after Greg Tansey and Ryan Christie.
"Last season was disappointing personally, I didn't play as much and I want to prove to myself what level I can get to," Stewart said.
"I'm at that age where I need to be playing football. Aberdeen is a massive club. The chance to work under the manager [Derek McInnes] as well was always in my thinking. Hopefully he can get the best out of me."
Stewart had "a few options" to consider, and might have stayed at Birmingham for pre-season training to see how manager Harry Redknapp shaped the side for this season.
The striker wanted a period of stability, though, with Redknapp being the third manager he has worked under at St Andrew's in one campaign.
"The way the owners are speaking, they're going to spend a few quid and I didn't want it dragging on and on until late in August and I might not have this opportunity," Stewart said.
"I might have gone somewhere I didn't want to go, so the sooner the better.
"It's always good to feel wanted. Derek's kept in touch, just to see how things are going, and I've kept an eye on Aberdeen.
"They were unlucky last season not to win one and they're going to be aiming for silverware each year, so I don't see why we can't win a cup this season."
Stewart scored 32 goals in 84 appearances for Dundee before moving to Birmingham for around Â£500,000 in August 2016.
Aberdeen are strengthening their player pool after losing Ash Taylor, Ryan Jack, Peter Pawlett, Niall McGinn and Jonny Hayes from the squad that finished runners-up to Celtic in all three domestic competitions last season.
Midfielder Tansey joined from Inverness Caledonian Thistle as a free agent, while Christie signed on loan for the season from Celtic.
"Greg is a player who I have admired for a while and I am delighted he has joined us," McInnes told the club website.
