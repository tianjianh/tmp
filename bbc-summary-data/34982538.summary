Concerns were raised about the A354 Rodwell Road, commonly known as Boot Hill, at a public meeting in the Old Town Hall on Tuesday.
Several residents also complained about resulting health problems and demanded improvements.
Dorset Highways said it plans to make improvements in March.
During the meeting, the road was highlighted as having the worst air quality in the borough according to 2014 figures from Weymouth and Portland Borough Council Public Health.
"The sheer amount of traffic using that road now is unbelievable," said Phil Hoskins, who has lived on Boot Hill since 1970.
"I should be able to park outside my house, but now I've got no chance."
June Pope, who has been a Boot Hill resident since 1956, described the situation as "terrible".
"You can't go in the garden because of the pollution and the noise - you can't hear the television sometimes," she said.
Green Party county councillor for Rodwell, Clare Sutton, who chaired the meeting, said changes to the traffic system in Weymouth prior to 2012 Olympic sailing events held in the town had "exacerbated" the situation.
Dorset Highways said improvements would be made to the layout of the junction at the foot of Boot Hill in March.
Mike Harries, director for environment at the county council, said: "We hope that by changing the phasing of the traffic lights at the junction at the bottom of Boot Hill, we will see an improvement to the overall flow of traffic, a reduction in congestion and, importantly, improve air quality."
