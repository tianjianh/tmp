Etienne Lemieux and Louis-Vincent Lessard, both aged 23, were reported missing on Saturday after failing to arrive home in Quebec on Friday.
A search party of the Fiordland National Park on South Island found one body on Sunday amid avalanche debris.
A second body was recovered nearby on Monday, said police.
The victims have not been named but the men's next-of-kin had been informed. There had been no other reports of missing persons in the area.
The two Canadians had indicated they planned to hike from the town of Te Anau along the Kepler Track, usually about a four-day trek.
A Facebook page set up by the relatives and friends of the missing men said they were on an "outdoor adventure trip" and had last been seen in Queenstown on 6 July.
