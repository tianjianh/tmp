Sundowns beat Enyimba of Nigeria 2-1 in Pretoria whilst Wydad had a 2-0 victory over Zambia's Zesco United, in Rabat.
Walid Karti's header put Wydad in front in the 12th minute, whilst an own goal from David Owino early in the second half gave them the win.
The result puts the Moroccans top of  Group A, with two wins in two matches.
In the other group, Sundowns secured their first points - having had their previous win over Entente Setif annulled after Setif were disqualified following crowd trouble.
That win puts Sundowns level with Zamalek at the top of Group B with one victory each, in a group which is now reduced to three teams.
Enyimba are bottom, still searching for their first points of the group having lost both their opening two matches.
In a tight first half in Pretoria, Sundowns took the lead close to half time through Leonardo Castro.
Enyimba fought hard after the break and were rewarded with an equaliser on 58 minutes when Dare Ojo levelled the score for the Nigerians.
With a draw looking increasingly likely, the home side clinched all three points thanks to a 78th minute goal from Wayne Arendse to win 2-1.
On Tuesday, Ivory Coast's Asec Mimosas secured a valuable away win over newly crowned Egyptian champions Al Ahly.
The Ivorians, who like Ahly had lost their first game of the group stage, secured a 2-1 win in Alexandria - where the Cairo club are playing their continental games.
Goals from Yannick Zakri and Armand Nianke gave them the victory.
Ahly had regained the league title, which they lost to rivals Zamalek last season, with a win at Ismaili on Sunday.
Ahly have been African champions a record eight times, most recently in  2013 when they defeated South African opponents Orlando Pirates 3-1 over two  legs.
Asec can boast of just one Champions League title, beating Zimbabwe's Dynamos 4-2 overall in 1998.
Wydad Casablanca host Zesco on Wednesday in a match that is set to finish around midnight owing to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, during which eating and drinking is  forbidden from dawn to dusk.
Footballers can be excused, but most observe the fast, leading to late  kick-offs of CAF matches in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt.
