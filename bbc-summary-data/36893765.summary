The 33-year-old succeeds Stephen Robinson, who moved to become manager of Oldham Athletic this summer.
McFadden, who will also be registered as a player, started his third spell at Fir Park in December and is relishing working with manager Mark McGhee.
"When I spoke with him about taking the role, I started to get excited about what we could achieve," he said.
"Everyone knows I love the club and will work as hard as I possibly can to make a success of things.
"It's something new and it'll be a change for me, but it's an exciting one and one I think I can handle.
"I want to work with and develop individuals, particularly the younger guys, and hopefully pass on helpful information that will make them better players."
McFadden started his career at Well before being transferred to Everton and also had spells with Birmingham City, Sunderland and St Johnstone before returning to Fir Park.
He had signed a short-term deal in expectation of moving to Philadelphia Union in January, but he agreed a contract until the end of the season after that fell through, only for his campaign to be ended by injury after only four appearances.
However, the Glaswegian, who was capped 48 times for his country, has been progressing through his coaching badges with the Scottish FA.
McGhee, who is himself assistant to Gordon Strachan with the national team, was "thrilled" that McFadden had signed a one-year contract as his number two.
"I think he has fabulous qualities to be an assistant," he told his club website.
"He has played at the highest level, worked with some tremendous coaches and, any time you speak to him, you can appreciate he has a deep understanding of the game.
"Not only that, he is an extremely determined individual, he's young, ambitious and has very high standards.
"He will demand from players and other staff at the club, including myself, and that's exactly the type of individual I wanted.
"He also has an in-depth knowledge of Scottish football, both club and individual players, and will add significantly to the coaching staff at the club."
