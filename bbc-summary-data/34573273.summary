[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Adcock death: Accused doctor 'called off resuscitation'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor accused of the manslaughter of a six-year-old boy has told a jury she called off attempts to save him after mistaking him for another patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock, of Glen Parva, died after being admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with pneumonia in 2011.
Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who denies manslaughter due to negligence, believed he had a "do not resuscitate" order, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Two nurses also deny charges of manslaughter by gross negligence.
Giving evidence, Dr Bawa-Garba, 38, said she was called to a ward where an emergency team was trying to save Jack's life after he had been admitted earlier in the day.
Before entering the room, she said she saw Jack's mother by the door and confused her with the mother of another child, who was marked do not resuscitate.
She told the crash team to stop, but when a doctor told her it was Jack, she ordered resuscitation to start again.
The jury was told the youngster was already beyond the point of no return, but the prosecution said the "remarkable error" showed how he was neglected by Dr Bawa-Garba.
Dr Bawa Garba said there was a lot of miscommunication and afterwards she was "blaming herself a lot."
The doctor also told the court how she missed two abnormal blood tests for Jack.
She said she had called a technician to get the results over the phone after the hospital computer failed, but added she could not remember writing them down.
Asked by her defence barrister if she had missed the abnormal results, she replied: "I have thought and reflected on this and yes I did miss these results."
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and died on 18 February 2011 from a cardiac arrest after sepsis was triggered by a bacterial infection.
The two other hospital workers on trial are Sister Theresa Taylor, 55, and 47-year-old Portuguese-born agency nurse Isabel Amaro.
The trial continues.
