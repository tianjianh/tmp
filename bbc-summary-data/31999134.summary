Dobrev triumphed in the 94kg category in Athens.
He also claimed gold at the 2003 world championships and won two European titles before retiring in 2008.
"I can't stop crying," Bulgaria's former weightlifting coach Plamen Asparuhov said. "He was the best person I ever knew."
Doctors confirmed Dobrev died of a heart attack.
Bulgarian weightlifters have won 11 Olympic titles since 1972, making it one the most successful sports in the Balkan country.
