Dumfries school pupil intake capping levels revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report has revealed proposed pupil intake capping levels as part of plans to overhaul education in Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The numbers are set out in a report to go to the local authority next week.
The council said it would allow the schools to work "more effectively and efficiently" within building capacity.
The report said that secondary pupil numbers in the town had "declined significantly" over the past 20 years while primary schools had room for another 1,400 children.
All four secondary schools in Dumfries are being rebuilt or refurbished under the Learning Town scheme.
A new "learning hub" with room for more than 300 students is also being built.
The proposals would see both Dumfries Academy and Dumfries High School have caps imposed on their S1 intake from next year which would be below average numbers for the last 20 years.
The report said that the caps on intake would be reviewed each year taking into account a range of factors.
It said the new combined capacity of secondary schools would be "more than enough" to meet the needs of the town.
Figures for the primary schools show all of them would have a maximum intake set at or above their 20-year average except for schools planned to move to new sites.
The school rolls at St Ninian's and Lochside will be combined from August 2018 while figures for Loreburn Primary have been based on plans to move it to part of a central campus including Dumfries Academy.
Ae Primary, Caerlaverock Primary, Kirkbean Primary, Locharbriggs Primary and St Teresa's Primary are part of a "low utilisation" review.
