Canada's PM targeted over economy in TV debate

Canadian party leaders attacked Prime Minister Stephen Harper's economic record in a televised debate at the start of a long election campaign.

"Mr Harper, we really can't afford another four years of you," said New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair.
The economy has been hurt by failing oil prices and Mr Mulcair said the country could be in recession.
But Mr Harper, who has called a parliamentary election for 19 October, said there was reason for optimism.
Highlighting good job-creation figures amid a weak global economy, the prime minister said the other parties would raise taxes and bring Greek-style debt to Canada.
The solution, he said, was a "low-tax proven plan", he said.
Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, also on stage, said the governing Conservative Party favoured the rich.
Mr Mulcair is currently leading in the polls. His centre-left New Democratic Party recently made big gains in Alberta - traditionally a Conservative party stronghold.
Green Party leader Elizabeth May completed the quartet of debaters and said Mr Harper's record on tackling climate change was a "litany of broken promises".
Mr Trudeau, the son of a former prime minister, benefits from high name recognition but has been criticised by his rivals for his lack of experience.
Mr Harper's centre-right Conservative Party has been in office since 2006 and analysts say he could struggle to form another majority government.
However, the election season will run for 11 weeks and it is thought a long campaign season could benefit the well-funded Conservative Party.
