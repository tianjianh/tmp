Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew says he hopes Aston Villa can stay up and that the Premier League would not want to lose a club of their "magnitude".

The Premier League's bottom club beat Palace 1-0 to earn Remi Garde his first win as Villa boss.
Despite a rare win, Villa remain eight points from safety with 17 games remaining, but Pardew is keen for them to stay in the top-flight.
"I hope they do, they're a great club," he added.
"The Premier League would not want to lose a club of this magnitude. I hope they can resolve it."
Villa sealed their first league win since the opening day of the season after Wayne Hennessey allowed Joleon Lescott's header to squirm from his grasp and trickle over the line.

However, Pardew said his keeper's error was not solely to blame for the defeat.
"Wayne's first touch puts him in trouble," he said.
"He has been brilliant for us and his mistake cost us the goal but we made mistakes in other areas all night.
"They go unnoticed - as much as the goal is going to be a highlight for everyone else."
Villa goalscorer Lescott was criticised at the weekend after being accused of playing a game involving chewing gum with Brad Guzan while they were substitutes during the 1-1 FA Cup draw at Wycombe.
Former Aston Villa captain Andy Townsend described the pair's behaviour as "immature".
The two received some boos from the crowd before the game, but Garde insisted he needs the former England international in his side.
"I didn't speak with Joleon about this stuff," he said.
"I am pleased with the way he gave an answer but not an answer regarding this fact.

"He is an experienced player and should be very important for the team."
On his side's win, Garde added: "It was a nice feeling to feel the crowd behind the players, it's very important.
"We cannot be happy too long - we have to build on this one."
Villa host second-placed Leicester on Saturday.
Lescott said: "We're not going to get carried away but we can take pride from that performance."
