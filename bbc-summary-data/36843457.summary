They face world and defending Olympic champions USA, France and Colombia in the group stage in Brazil.
The Ferns reached the last 16 of major tournament for the first time at London 2012, before going out to the USA.
"We've always gone as underdogs into these tournaments, but that plays well for us," White told BBC Sport.
"Hopefully we can cause a few upsets and make our way though the group stage and then see how we go".
Only the top two teams from each group and best two third-placed sides progress for the quarter-finals at Rio 2016.
Despite their "tough" draw, White insists the five-time Oceania Women's Nations Cup champions are are capable of reaching the knockout phase.
"I'm absolutely buzzing about it and can't wait," the 23-year-old added.
"It's been such a long build up for the Ferns and everyone's really excited".
White, who has scored 14 goals in 81 international appearances, helped New Zealand reached the last 16 of the competition four years ago and featured at last summer's World Cup, where the Ferns failed to progress beyond the group stage.
The Rio Olympics officially start on 6 August, however, New Zealand kick-off their campaign against defending champions USA on 3 August.
