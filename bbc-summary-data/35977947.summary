Coastguards and police spent more than 10 hours looking for a 46-year-old reported missing at 23:00 BST on Tuesday.
Kent Police said a body was found on the riverbank near the Esplanade in Rochester, Kent.
The land, air and river search for the missing man was called off at about 09.10 BST on Wednesday.
A police spokeswoman said the family of the missing kayaker had been informed.
Formal identification has not yet taken place.
A drifting kayak was found in the River Medway by the Sheerness Inshore Lifeboat at about 23:00 BST on Tuesday, the same time the man was reported missing.
Two RNLI lifeboats, a coastguard helicopter and a police helicopter spent several hours overnight searching the river and estuary, from Rochester to the Kingsnorth Power Station.
A spokesman for the UK Coastguard said the search and rescue operation had been terminated.
