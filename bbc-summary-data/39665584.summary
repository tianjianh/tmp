The former US Open champion from Portrush was one under for his round before picking up birdies at the 13th, 14th and 17th.
McDowell, who is currently 83rd in the world rankings, is part of a 13-way tie for sixth.
Ireland's Seamus Power opened with a 72 in the San Antonio tournament.
McDowell carded seven birdies to go along with three bogeys and his strong finish puts him in early contention.
The 37-year-old missed out on a place at the Masters earlier this month and has set a target of returning to a top 50 ranking in 2017.
South African Grace is one shot ahead of Americans Will MacKenzie, John Huh, Stewart Cink and Australia's Steven Alker.
