[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A moment of madness from Ross County goalkeeper Scott Fox helped Alfredo Morelos to a double and Rangers to the three points in Dingwall.

Morelos had already headed the visitors ahead when the goalkeeper's Cruyff turn foxed the sliding Colombian striker.
But Fox took an age to clear and Morelos stole in to take possession and roll the ball into the empty net.
County recovered after the break, Thomas Mikkelsen headed a reply, but Eduardo Herrera secured Rangers' win.
Rangers' fifth straight away league victory takes them up to fifth in the Scottish Premiership, equal on points with Hamilton Academical and Hibernian.
County's third league defeat in a row ended a run of three draws between the sides and leaves the hosts still waiting for a victory over Rangers in seven meetings.
If Rangers were to be awarded points for the speed and intensity of their starts, they would probably be top of the table already and so it was again in Dingwall.
Inside the first minute, they carved the County defence wide open and Morelos blasted over the bar.
The main danger was coming down the right-hand side as Daniel Candeias toyed and tormented Ryan Dow and whipped in cross after cross.
At this stage, the home side were were simply hoping Rangers would continue to be off target when the chances fell.
The inevitable opener came just after the half-hour mark as James Tavernier looped in a high cross that was met by the head of Morelos and it nestled neatly into the right-hand corner of the net.
Rangers' pressure continued and, while a second was predicted, nobody inside the Global Energy Stadium could possibly have guessed the manner of its arrival.
It was a calamity of quite epic proportions and one from which Fox may take some time to recover.
Marcus Fraser passed the ball back to his goalkeeper, but Morelos anticipated and decided to press.
Fox dummied his pass to leave the striker swiping fresh air, but instead of clearing, the goalkeeper let the ball linger at his feet, forgot the Rangers striker was behind him and, when Morelos nipped in and passed the ball into the empty net, the Laurel and Hardy moment was complete.
Before the break, Rangers had calls for a penalty waved away when Jason Naismith challenged Morelos inside the box and his strike partner, Kenny Miller, took a sore one from a flailing Andrew Davies elbow.
County manager Jim McIntyre had thrown on Mikkelsen for Jamie Lindsay before half-time. The result was an out ball that eased the pressure on his defence but also provided a new focus in the forward areas.
The reward came when the Danish striker ghosted in between the Rangers central defence and guided a header past goalkeeper Wes Foderingham after a great cross from Craig Curran.
After that, the battle won out over the football as the game swung from end to end.
Rangers worked to keep their shape and their patience in the face of a home side buoyed by the goal and now full of fight.
As the home fans started to make their way to the exits, Herrera converted inside the box after neat build-up play involving Bruno Alves and Lee Wallace.
It was a much-needed and deserved win for Rangers, who head into the international break with morale well and truly boosted.
