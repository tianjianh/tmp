A Manchester United fan who had a heart attack outside the club's stadium has made an appeal to find the man who helped "save his life".

Chris Madden, 57, left the Old Trafford ground after the 0-0 draw with Burnley on 29 October when he felt breathless.
He slumped over a car at a nearby showroom when a fellow United supporter, believed to be a doctor in his 50s, came to his aid.
Mr Madden said the man stayed with him for an hour until paramedics arrived.
Mr Madden, a United season-ticket holder from Audenshaw in Greater Manchester, said he remembered becoming "very breathless, sweaty and nauseous".
"It was just a very, very heavy pain on my chest as if someone was sitting on it.
"As I was falling down, I just felt somebody get hold of me and this voice said, 'Are you alright, fella?' and I said, 'No, I'm not mate'."
"As far as I'm concerned, this man saved my life," he added.
Mr Madden was taken to hospital where he had a heart bypass operation three days later. He is now recovering at home.
"I'm just so thankful for this guy who took time out - a fellow Manchester United fan who grabbed hold of me.
"I'd just like to put my arms around him and thank him on behalf of me, my lovely wife and my son."
Mr Madden said he received messages from football fans around the country - "from Manchester City, Liverpool and down south wishing me a big recovery" - after Manchester United sent a tweet about the incident, which has been shared more than a thousand times.
"For people to take time out who don't know me, that's the football family - we all support different clubs but it's the football family."
