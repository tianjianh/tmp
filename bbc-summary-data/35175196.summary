[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents of children at St Andrew's Church of England infant school in Farnham are campaigning to keep it open following a drop in pupil numbers.

They fear South Farnham school, which has an on-site infant school, provides a more secure route to junior education in the town.
Sam Powell, who has twins at St Andrew's, said: "It's the most wonderful school you could imagine."
Surrey County Council said the school needed a link with a junior school.
Mr Powell said: "I've got two girls in year one, twins, and since they've been there they have been thriving.
"The teachers are wonderful, the governors are amazing - it is just the most perfect place."
A spokesman for Surrey County Council said: "There are a number of unfilled places at St Andrew's infant school, primarily because it does not have an established link to a junior school.
"Our preference would be to see the diocese create a formal link between St Andrew's and South Farnham school to address this - something we are urging them to do however we are not the decision maker in that process.
"But failing that residents are not getting value for money from a school which is not full."
A petition has been set up to save the school and has over 1,000 signatories.
The diocese of Guildford, which runs St Andrew's, has urged parents to name the school as their preferred choice for children starting school in 2016 so the school could survive.
Derek Holbird, the director of education, said: "There isn't an easy route through to one particular school and parents wouldn't want that anyway.
"We are working flat out to make sure the school will not close."
