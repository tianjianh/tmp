Australia have included "once-in-a-generation" fast bowler Pat Cummins in their 15-man squad for this summer's Champions Trophy in England and Wales.

The 23-year-old is selected alongside fellow fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and James Pattinson in captain Steve Smith's squad.
Australia are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, New Zealand and England, and former bowler Brett Lee says their opponents should be "scared".
"It's a serious pace barrage," he said.
"What Pat Cummins can bring is pace, aggression, control and anything between that. He is a once-in-a-generation bowler and you have got to harness that amazing talent.
"Hazlewood is more of hitting the good length, day in and day out. With Starc you will be getting full, short, good length, yorkers, the whole thing."
Cummins is capable of bowling at speeds in excess of 95mph.
The 50-over Champions Trophy competition begins with England against Bangladesh on 1 June.
Australia squad: Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Chris Lynn, Glenn Maxwell, James Pattinson, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Adam Zampa.
Australia's group fixtures: 2 June v New Zealand (Edgbaston), 5 June v Bangladesh (The Oval), 10 June v England (Edgbaston).
