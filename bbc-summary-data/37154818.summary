A survey is seeking public views on plans for a museum celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark.

Scottish Borders Council said it was designed to help it advance plans for the scheme in Duns.
The survey on the Â£1.65m project is available via the local authority's website.
Plans were lodged for the museum last week but the council said it now wanted public feedback.
Councillor Vicky Davidson said: "I am delighted that the planning application has now been lodged and we've reached another milestone towards providing a bigger and better Jim Clark museum.
"As part of developing the wider museum we would like to hear ideas from both local people and visitors about what they think about the current memorial room and what new exhibits, fixtures or events they would like to see featured in the new museum in future.
"I would encourage anyone with an interest to take this short survey and help shape the proposals for a museum that will not only attract even more visitors to the area but which will also do justice to Jim Clark's incredible achievements."
