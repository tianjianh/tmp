The Â£9m site of 88 acres (36 hectare) will process up to 120,000 vehicles a year at Stallingborough, North East Lincolnshire, in a 10-year deal.
The operation has relocated from nearby Killingholme, North Lincolnshire and employs about 150 staff.
The new site will allow a "lot more room for growth in the future", said Yaser Shabsogh of Kia.
The proximity of the Humber ports was an important part of the decision to keep the plant in the area, he added.
