[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A timetable for the publication of the Chilcot inquiry report on the 2003 Iraq war must be published "pretty soon", David Cameron has demanded.

It was needed for the sake of "families who want answers", the PM said.
Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot has said he is awaiting responses from those facing criticism in the report.
Meanwhile, Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn has suggested Tony Blair could be made to stand trial for war crimes over the US-led invasion.
The Iraq Inquiry, which was set up in 2009 and had been due to report back in 2011, is looking into the UK's role in the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath.
The UK lost 179 servicemen and women in operations in Iraq.
Mr Cameron said: "Right now I want a timetable. More important than anything is thinking of the parents who lost loved ones in Iraq.
"And for their sake, as well as for the sake of the public, we've got to get on with this."
He added that he could not "make it go faster because it's a public inquiry and it's independent", but the public deserved a timetable "pretty soon".
In June, the prime minister said he was "fast losing patience" with the publication delay and said he was "disappointed"
In June, Sir John told Mr Cameron in a letter that he "wholeheartedly" shared the wish of Parliament, the prime minister and the public that lessons from the conflict be learnt as soon as possible.
He has previously blamed several factors for the hold-up, including the work being "unprecedented in scope" and the report being likely to contain a million words.
Sir John is not expected to announce a publication date until at least after Parliament returns from recess in September.
Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the 2003 conflict had been an "illegal war" and that the individuals who "made the decisions that went with it" should face justice.
Asked on BBC Newsnight if Mr Blair should be charged with war crimes, he said: "If he's committed a war crime, yes. Everyone who's committed a war crime should be.
"Is he going to be tried for it, I don't know. Could he be tried for it? Possibly."
Tony Blair has previously warned Labour members against electing Jeremy Corbyn as leader, saying anyone who said their heart told them to vote for Mr Corbyn should "get a transplant".
