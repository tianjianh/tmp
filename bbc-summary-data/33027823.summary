Yvette Cooper says Labour 'must champion devolution'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper has said her party must "champion" further devolution to win back support in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was in Edinburgh and Glasgow in an attempt to understand the challenge facing her party after its election defeat.
Labour was reduced to just one MP in Scotland as the SNP took 56 seats.
The leadership hopeful, who was born in Inverness, said winning again in Scotland was "close to her heart".
Ms Cooper met party councillors, members and MSPs, including Scottish Labour deputy leader Kezia Dugdale who is bidding to replace Jim Murphy as leader in Scotland.
The shadow home secretary, who also spoke to SNP voters during the visit, set out her ideas for the party's recovery.
She said: "We should be arguing hard for powers to be devolved not just to Holyrood but to our cities, local councils and communities across Scotland - really giving power back to the people.
"And supporting Scottish Labour's strong and distinctive voice standing up for the people of Scotland."
Ms Cooper is standing for the Labour leadership position vacated by Ed Miliband after election, which saw the Conservatives win an unexpected majority.
She joins Jeremy Corbyn, Andy Burnham, Mary Creagh and Liz Kendall in the race to succeed Mr Miliband.
The winner of the contest will be announced before the party's annual conference, in September.
