One man was pushed to the floor and another was pinned against a wall.
South Yorkshire Police were called but no arrests were made.

Residents were furious they could not get in and a second meeting was held later to accommodate them.
On 7 July, HS2 announced it would scrap the proposed station at Meadowhall in favour of a stop in Sheffield city centre.
The meeting was not organised by HS2, but representatives attended.
An HS2 statement said: "We recognise that making sure communities know as much as possible about HS2, and how it may affects them, is extremely important and understand that people will have concerns.
Earlier this month, protests and public meetings were held in reaction to the news that houses will be affected by the new route
"Our community engagement on the new route through Yorkshire has seen us speak with more than 3,000 residents at a series of HS2 public information events over the last two weeks.
"We will continue to hold these events, including one tomorrow in Crofton, to provide information and answer questions about the proposed route and next steps."
A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said officers were called to the Church Lane meeting at about 19:00 BST.
"It was reported that a significant number of people were trying to enter the premises to attend the meeting, which caused some disruption.
"Upon officer arrival, there was a significant number of people at the location but no criminal offences were reported and no arrests were made."
The proposed new route would see up to two trains per hour leave the HS2 line near Clay Cross in Derbyshire and join the existing line into Sheffield before rejoining HS2 east of Grimethorpe.
It will run east towards the M18 before rejoining the original route south of the M62.
High-speed trains would use existing tracks to access Sheffield, stopping at the city's Midland station.
