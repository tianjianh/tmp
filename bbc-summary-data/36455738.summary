MP Sher Wali Wardak was injured in the blast outside his house and died on the way to hospital, officials said.
No group has so far admitted carrying out the attack.
Separately, at least seven people were killed and more than 20 injured when Taliban gunmen - reportedly in police uniform - stormed a court in in Puli Alam, capital of Logar province.
The militant group said the attack was in response to the government's execution of six Taliban prisoners last month.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has pledged a tougher response to the Taliban after an attack in Kabul in April left 64 people dead.
Peace efforts stalled this year after the Taliban refused to participate in new talks with the Afghan government until foreign forces had left the country.
The militants have been waging an insurgency against the Afghan government since being ousted in 2001.
Nato ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December 2014, leaving a 13,000-strong residual force used for training and counter-terrorism operations, including 9,800 US troops.
