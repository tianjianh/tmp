NI snap election: Reaction to secretary of state's announcement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Politicians have been reacting to the news that Northern Ireland will go to the polls on 2 March to elect a new Assembly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The executive collapsed over a botched green energy scheme.
"There was no alternative to an election. We went to the DUP before Christmas, Martin McGuinness spoke to Arlene Foster - we asked her privately to step aside so we could facilitate an inquiry.
The DUP hardened up their position over Christmas and tried to dress it up as an attack on unionism and we ran out of road.
If the institutions don't have the peoples' confidence then it can't function. "
"It's been clear for several weeks now that Sinn Féin have been looking to manufacture a crisis and collapse the institutions here.
"We want to see an RHI investigation. Sinn Féin were the ones who frustrated that. They said Arlene Foster had to step aside - she had done nothing wrong, so why would she have?
"When Martin McGuinness went that impediment was gone. They still didn't want a judge-lead inquiry."
erry Carroll says that "this is a once in a lifetime election"
"It was a sad day to see the Institutions, created after many years of hard negotiations, being collapsed by a combination of political opportunism by Sinn Féin and gross incompetence and arrogance by the DUP.'
"This is a once in a lifetime election-a judgement day for all those who have taken the electorate for granted.
"We call on everyone, irrespective of the community that they come from, to punish the big parties for their failure to deliver anything for ordinary people.
