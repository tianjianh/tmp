Dons assistant Tony Docherty joins the national coaching team for this month's fixtures against Canada and Slovenia.
But there are no players from the Pittodrie club, who sit second in the Scottish Premiership.
"I'm disappointed but I seem to be saying the same thing after every squad, so I'm not totally surprised," said McInnes.
"I think they should be in it, some have a stronger case than others."
Last month, McInnes backed Kenny McLean and Ryan Jack for Scotland call-ups after Aberdeen routed Motherwell.
But Scotland coach Gordon Strachan, a former Dons star, who was at Pittodrie to watch the 7-2 victory, has chosen 15 other midfielders in a 30-man squad for the impending double-header.
"We've really developed Niall McGinn [Northern Ireland] as an international player, Jonny Hayes and Adam Rooney [both Republic of Ireland] have become internationals here," added McInnes.
"Danny Ward [Wales] came here and was an international, so we can provide the platform.
"There are other clubs, lesser clubs, getting their players capped [for Scotland]."
Jack, 25, and McGinn, 29, are both out of contract in the summer, along with defender Ash Taylor, while the manager said that second-choice goalkeeper Neil Alexander would be moving on.
"Hopefully, we'll have news after the international break," said McInnes of the negotiations, adding "conversations are ongoing".
Chairman Stewart Milne has indicated that he would like McInnes to extend to his stay in order to lead the club into a proposed new stadium in 2020.
The Dons boss is under contract until 2019, having been in the post for four years.
"It's clear how happy I am here and I do feel we still have a lot of work to do, we want to finish this season strongly.
"If the chairman wishes to talk about it, I'm happy to sit down with him but we have a lot of challenges ahead of us.
"The chairman is busy trying to drive home the stadium and training ground and I'm busy trying to drive home performances on the pitch."
