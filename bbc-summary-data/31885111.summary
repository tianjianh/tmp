The revived Manor team will not take part in the Australian Grand Prix after failing to run in practice or qualifying at Albert Park.

Manor made it to Australia after an 11th-hour deal with a new investor, the boss of energy firm Ovo, Stephen Fitzpatrick.
But the team were unable to get their cars running and will therefore be unable to race on Sunday as rules dictate teams must have taken part in practice.
Manor blamed software problems preventing the cars running.
They were subsequently summoned by stewards to explain why they did not take part in qualifying.
"We have come such a long way in an incredibly short space of time, so to miss out on qualifying is of course very disappointing," said Manor team principal John Booth.
"One always has to look at the silver lining in these situations and ours is that we have identified, worked through and ironed out a number of very challenging issues in the field and that experience will stand us in good stead as we move forward from here."
