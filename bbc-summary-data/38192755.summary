Newport County v Morecambe abandoned at half time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County and Morecambe saw their League Two match abandoned at half-time after heavy rain in South Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bottom club Newport were leading 1-0 at the break after a strike from Tom Owen-Evans which would have been the teenager's first goal for the club.
But as water started to gather on the Rodney Parade pitch, referee Brendan Malone called the game off.
County have long-standing drainage problems on the pitch, which is also used by rugby's Newport Gwent Dragons.
A match against Barnet was abandoned on 3 September and that was followed by the postponement of a League Two match with Stevenage on 1 October.
Emergency drainage work was carried out on the pitch in early October with a new drainage system due to be installed in the summer of 2017.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told Radio Wales Sport: "Premier League managers moan at having to play 38 games a season, when you are Newport manager you have to play 138 games because a lot get cancelled at half-time.
"It is what it is. It was probably the right decision to call it off. I thought in the first-half we were as good as we've been in a while."
