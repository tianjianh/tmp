PC Matthew Watt, who worked at Reading's Loddon Valley station, sent photos of a detainee on WhatsApp messenger.
He also insulted a male detainee, as well as sending photos of witness statements to friends.
He was sacked from Thames Valley Police at a public misconduct hearing, after committing the offences on 5 March.
"For the public to have confidence in the force, it is vital that our staff and officers manage information in accordance with legislation and policies," Det Ch Insp Matt Stone said.
"Thames Valley Police takes such breaches extremely seriously and investigates incidents of gross misconduct thoroughly, with the outcome being that PC Watt has been dismissed without notice from the force."
