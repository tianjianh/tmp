Homeless man stays with a complete stranger thanks to charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Imagine going to stay with a complete stranger, because you have nowhere to live.

That's what happened to 20-year-old Harry.
He was kicked out of his home after a family dispute earlier this year.
"It was sudden," said Harry.
"I went to my local council to hopefully get some help only to be turned away with just a booklet.
"There was no guidance. Nothing. I felt lost."
Eighty thousand 16 to 25-year-olds experience homelessness in the UK each year, according to recent research from the charity Centrepoint.
BBC Advice: Running away and homelessness
Although Harry was able to spend a couple of nights sleeping on a friend's sofa, he was eventually left with nowhere to live.
So he went to stay with Nancy - a complete stranger with a spare room.
This was all done as a part of a service run by the charity Depaul, an organisation which works with disadvantaged young people.
The service is called Nightstop UK and provides emergency accommodation for 16 to 25-year-olds in the homes of approved hosts.
Volunteers are members of the general public who are trained, vetted and willing to open their homes to help young people in need.
The charity aims to provide a host on the same day as being contacted.
Harry's host Nancy was ready for him to come over within a couple of hours.
"After doing assessments, assignments and checks my host was ready for me," explains Harry.
"I was told [the host] would be ready by 6pm with dinner by 7pm."
Nancy and her family decided to become Nightstop hosts after hearing about the housing crisis for young people.
She says they felt they needed to do something.
"We have a house with three rooms, we don't use them all at the moment. It seemed almost wrong that it was going spare when there are young people sleeping on the street."
Harry says because he felt so vulnerable at the time, when Nancy opened her door to him he felt "overwhelmed".
"My heart sunk, such a nice genuine family, such a warm, welcoming experience."
In 2013 Nightstop provided 11,755 bed nights and volunteer hosts gave more than 176,000 hours of their time.
A placement can be overnight or up to two weeks and can mark the first step out of homelessness for a young person.
Harry stayed with Nancy for just over a week.
He's now back on his feet and living in permanent accommodation.
