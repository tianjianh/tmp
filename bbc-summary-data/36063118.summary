Former Dundee United and Hibs striker Darren Jackson assesses the performances of the Edinburgh side, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller, another member of the Radio Scotland commentary team at Hampden Park on Saturday, rates the United players.
Conrad Logan (goalkeeper) 9
An absolutely wonderful debut. It doesn't get any better than that. He kept his team in the game on a few occasions with some good saves and should be over the moon with his performance.
David Gray (defender) 7
He had a wonderful start for the first half-hour or so and kept on going in the second half,  still trying to get forward. and almost set up a goal for Jason Cummings.
Darren McGregor (defender) 8
I thought he was absolutely brilliant defensively. His pace and strength and reading of the game was excellent.
Paul Hanlon (defender)7
He showed good composure defensively, headed Ryan Dow's effort off the line and scored the second penalty in the shoot-out.
Lewis Stevenson (defender)  7
Always tried to get forward, especially in the first half.  He also had a few good interceptions, nipping in to clear the danger ahead of Henri Anier late in normal time.
Marvin Bartley (midfielder)7
Probably the best of the midfield players.  Showed good strength and reading of the game, winning most of his challenges, and his passing was excellent.
Fraser Fyvie (midfielder) 6
Started the game well and put a good long-range effort just over, but fell out of the game a little bit and didn't stamp his authority on it.
John McGinn (midfielder) 6
Another who made a very good start but looked a little bit tired as the game went on.  Hibs looked a threat when he got on the ball, but it was too infrequent.
Liam Henderson (midfielder) 6
He tried to make things happen and gave everything but probably didn't do as well as he could have done.
Jason Cummings (forward) 5
He will get criticised for the penalty miss and he was never really in the game. But fair play, he stood up to be counted and had the bottle when it mattered in the shoot-out.
Anthony Stokes (forward) 5
He got on the ball a fair amount but the supply dried up in the second half, and he was taken off before the end.  A quite game for the standards he has set.
Farid El Alagui  (forward) 3
Tried to be a physical presence when he came on for Stokes after 78 minutes, but unfortunately got himself injured early in extra-time and had to go off.
Martin Boyle (midfielder) 5
Came on for Henderson with five minutes left, made a couple of good runs and scored a great penalty in the shoot-out.
Chris Dagnall (forward) 4
Replaced El Alagui five minutes into extra-time but wasn't really on the ball a lot.
Eiji Kawashima (goalkeeper) 7
He did everything asked of him, which wasn't a lot in fairness. Looked professional in everything he did without having too much of a workload before the shoot-out.
Kyle Knoyle (defender) 7
The young boy looked nervous early on but grew in influence along with his team-mates. Was an important player in the second half and extra-time.
Coll Donaldson (defender) 6
He didn't impose himself on the game, gave away penalty and had to come off injured. His use of the ball - his best attribute - wasn't too bad.
Callum Morris (defender) 5
He had a poor game. I might look to the manager's decision to play him at full-back rather than the player. He's not known as a left-back and was all over the place. His positional sense was poor and he was a liability Hibs exploited on a regular basis.
Sean Dillon (defender) 7
He's got a lot to offer United even at this stage of his career. Took responsibility and tried to inspire his side during the game. He performed well considering he's not known as centre-half.
Paul Paton (midfielder) 6
Anonymous in the first half but got slightly better after the break. Normally influential but didn't do enough.
John Rankin (midfielder) 6
Initially, he was as culpable as Morris for United's problems and had a big part to play in United's poor first-half display. Improved as the game wore on, but missed a chance in extra-time.
Chris Erskine (midfielder) 5
Full of energy. I'm a bit surprised he featured as he hasn't played a lot under the manager. Despite United not playing well, he put in a good shift defensively.
Blair Spittal (midfielder) 5
Normally influential and I'm not sure what was wrong with him today. He missed his penalty in the shoot-out too and did nothing to hurt Hibs.
Ryan Dow (forward) 5
Anonymous throughout the game but didn't use his pace or offer support quick enough. Either he wasn't fit or didn't have enough energy.
Billy Mckay (forward) 6
The striker had a couple of great chances in the first half - when you're through one on one with the keeper, you have to score. He didn't today, and missed in the shoot-out too.
Paul Dixon (defender) 8
I thought he changed the game completely when he came on. Between the missed penalty and Dixon coming on he showed how a full-back should play. He closed the gap on [Hibs defender David] Gray and put him under pressure defensively. Top man for United in my eyes.
Guy Demel (defender) 7
I've only seen him playing in midfield before but he looked comfortable today.
Henri Anier (forward) 6
Flatters to deceive and had a great chance one-on-one with the keeper but couldn't score. Couldn't repeat his heroics against Ross County.
