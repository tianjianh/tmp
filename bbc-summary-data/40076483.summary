Chelsea's WSL 1 hopes are in their own hands after Gilly Flaherty, Fran Kirby, Ji So-yun, Maren Mjelde, Karen Carney, Erin Cuthbert and Drew Spence's goals.
That came while City lost a league game for the first time since April 2015.
England midfielder Jordan Nobbs' fine second-half free-kick won that match to boost the fourth-placed Gunners' hopes.
Elsewhere, 10-player Reading recovered from having England's Jo Potter sent off just before half-time to earn a 1-1 draw against Birmingham City, with Lauren Bruton's penalty cancelling out Charlie Welling's first-minute opener.
And Yeovil suffered a seventh loss in seven games since promotion, losing 2-1 at home to Sunderland, with Lucy Staniforth and Stephanie Bannon netting for the Lady Black Cats either side of Wales' Angharad James's second-half equaliser for Yeovil.
Liverpool have one match left and lead the table, but they have played a game more than the rest of the top four and second-placed Chelsea have a vastly superior goal difference.
City's rare loss saw them slip to third, level on points with Chelsea and one above Arsenal, with just two points separating first and fourth.
Chelsea's huge win was their final league game at their Wheatsheaf Park home - before their move to AFC Wimbledon's Kingsmeadow ground for September - and they will be crowned Spring Series champions if they win their remaining matches at Bristol City and Birmingham, barring a big swing in goal difference.
