Three Britons injured in Friday's terror attacks on Paris are out of hospital and have returned to the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.

A further 15 were being supported for trauma by the Foreign Office and Red Cross, Mr Cameron told MPs.
Near simultaneous attacks, linked to Islamic State (IS) militants, were carried out on bars, restaurants, a concert hall and the Stade de France.
The 129 people killed included Briton Nick Alexander, from Essex.
The French government has said all the dead have now been identified. A further 400 people were wounded in the attacks, with 221 still in hospital -  57 of them in intensive care.
Mr Cameron said the government would make sure it provided the necessary support to all those left injured or traumatised by the events.
In the aftermath of the attacks, British minsters are increasingly confident they can get MPs' approval to launch airstrikes against IS in Syria, the BBC has been told.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has begun talking to Labour MPs to try to get the vote through the Commons. Downing Street insists there is no timetable for a vote yet but it is thought it could happen before Christmas.

What should you do in an attack?
Stories from Britons caught up in the attacks are still emerging.
One couple from Leeds have described how they escaped through a skylight when the Bataclan concert hall was attacked.
Tony Scott and Justine Merton climbed onto the roof when heavily-armed gunmen stormed the building, during an Eagles of Death Metal concert.
The engaged pair, who first met at a rock concert, usually watched gigs at floor level but they had arrived late so headed up to the balcony for a good view.
Mr Scott told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the "insignificant" decision to go upstairs ended up being "the difference between life and death".
From there, they were able to escape into the stairwell, climb up a grate and out onto the roof. They were then ushered to an apartment where they hid with others, before armed police eventually found them.
Another couple, also at the concert, described how they went back inside to rescue a friend hurt in the crush to escape.
Maria and Patrick Moore, from Southampton, were unharmed but they walked to hospital with their friend, who had a broken collarbone.
"I don't feel different but there's guilt that we got out and other people didn't," Mrs Moore, now back home, told the Southern Daily Echo.
The three gunmen at the concert hall killed 89 people, among them Mr Alexander, 36, who was selling merchandise at the gig.
His friend, David Gray, said Nick "didn't stand a chance of getting out" because his stall was by the front door and the emergency exits were at the sides of the stage.
Band members of Eagles of Death Metal tweeted: "Our thoughts and hearts are first and foremost with our brother Nick Alexander."
They said the band, now back home in the US, were "horrified and still trying to come to terms with what happened".
Friends of Mr Alexander have paid tribute to a clever and charming man.
Meanwhile, the Muslim Council of Britain has taken out an advert in the Daily Telegraph, saying the "barbaric acts" have no sanction in the religion of Islam and British Muslims were united in condemning them.
