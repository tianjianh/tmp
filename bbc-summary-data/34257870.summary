Council officials have stopped referring patients to a care home in Warrington amid concerns over its standards of care.

Warrington Borough Council said Birch Court had been issued with a default notice and ordered to improve following a routine visit.
It criticised staffing levels, "institutionalised practice" and said "basic needs" were not being met.
An improvement plan has been put in place, the council said.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) recently inspected Birch Court and a report is due to be published.
The council said it expected the report to state the home was "breaching a number of their regulations".
Assistant Director for Quality Assurance at the council, Ann McCormack, wrote in an internal email seen by the BBC: "All this together demonstrates that Birch Court is not meeting our contract standards and is therefore in default."
"This means that we will be suspending admissions, paying a reduced fee to Birch Court for residents currently placed there."
A council spokesperson said: "The council will be working closely with the Care Quality Commission to ensure that the care home complies with the relevant health and social care act regulations."
The council will also be supporting residents and families during this period, they added.
Birch Court is run by private health firm Bupa and provides nursing, convalescence, palliative and respite care, as well as nursing or residential care for those living with dementia.
The home was rated as 'good' in a report by the CQC in June this year.
Bupa said the problems are isolated to one unit, adding: "We are absolutely committed to making the required changes highlighted in the recent CQC report, which are isolated to one unit."
"We have acted immediately to ensure we meet the high standards of care that we expect  - putting additional training in place for staff, reviewing our medication management process and all residents' care plans."
