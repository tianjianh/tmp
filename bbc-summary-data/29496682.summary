About 15,000 pre-sale tickets were sold earlier this week and the remaining 120,000 went in just 26 minutes - quicker than the 87 minutes it took to sell them in 2013.
People paid Â£225 for a ticket even though the Somerset festival's line-up won't be confirmed until next year.
There are rumours Fleetwood Mac and Queen could be among those playing at Worthy Farm in 2015.
Music fans all over the country had to be up early to make sure they were online at 9am sharp to try to get hold of a ticket.
They were available to buy only through the official website.
The festival's official Twitter page let fans know that were all gone.
Emily Eavis co-organiser of the festival also tweeted: "We have sold out, thank you to everyone for supporting us and I'm sorry to those of you who have missed out.
"I'm sorry to everyone who missed out, so wish we could get everyone in. There will be a resale in the spring."
People have committed to going to the festival well before the line-up has been announced.
This year Arcade Fire, Metallica and Kasabian headlined.
Glastonbury is famous for having a wide variety of acts going to Worthy Farm to perform.
This year Dolly Parton was one of the most talked about. In the past Jay-Z, Kylie and Beyonce have performed on the same stages as more traditional festival acts.
Muse, Fleetwood Mac and the Stone Roses are the bookies' favourites at the moment to turn up on the Pyramid Stage next year.
