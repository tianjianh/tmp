Stoke made a bid in the summer for the 23-year-old, whose deal expires at the end of the season, while the Baggies made a third contract offer last month.
Potters manager Mark Hughes has said he remains "hopeful" of signing Berahino in the January transfer window.
But Albion boss Pulis told BBC Sport: "This club has looked after Berahino since eight or nine years of age."
Berahino has not played for the first team since 10 September and was sent to a conditioning camp in France to help him lose weight and regain fitness.
"We are interested in him, as a number of other clubs are," said Hughes. "I am hopeful we will be able to get something done."
Former England Under-21 international Berahino's deal at The Hawthorns expires at the end of the season and Albion have been in talks with him since the summer.
Pulis added: "It has to be a two-way situation. We won't sell him unless it is right for the football club. That has always been the situation; we will not sell the lad because it suits him."
