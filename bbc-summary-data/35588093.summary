Lorries 'causing havoc' in Leicestershire village

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Articulated lorries are creating havoc in a village by causing damage to homes and "just missing" people as they drive along a narrow road.

The HGVs travel down High Street as a shortcut in and out of Desford, Leicestershire, residents say.
But people have been "trapped" against walls and houses struck when the large vehicles get stuck trying to negotiate the street.
Haulage experts said weight restriction breaches were a police matter.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Desford resident Juliette Minto was captured during a stand-off with a HGV looking to turn into High Street - which has a 7.5-tonne weight restriction, except for loading.
Councillor David Sprason said lorries were seemingly "ignoring" weight restriction signage - including a sign on the corner of High Street, which residents say has been bent by an HGV.
Mrs Minto, who set up Desford Traffic Watch on Facebook seven months ago to raise awareness of the problem, described the current situation as "horrendously dangerous".
"We have had people trapped against walls, pushchairs that can't get past when the lorries mount the pavement," she said.
"It's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt."
In a statement, Leicestershire County Council said it would be installing additional signage and further reviewing the Desford area.
Chrys Rampley, from the Road Haulage Association, said continual weight restriction breaches must be enforced by the police.
"It's often a mixture of things," she said. "It could be drivers have a sat-nav which has not got truck attributes on it. Basic car sat-navs are not necessarily fit for purpose.
"Some people instructing drivers may not be au fait with the roads around them, and we have had problems with drivers ignoring weight restrictions."
