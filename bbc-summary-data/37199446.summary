The 24-year-old has agreed a three-year contract with the option of a further 12 months with the Championship club.
Gladon has spent his entire career in his homeland and scored four times in 24 league appearances as Heracles finished sixth last season.
"I hope we can be promoted to the Premier League this year," Gladon told Wolves' club website.
Gladon came through the ranks at Sparta Rotterdam, where one of his coaches was former Netherlands international defender John De Wolf, who made 33 appearances for Wolves in the mid-1990s.
"He told me some stories about the club and said if you get the chance to go to Wolves then you must take the first aeroplane - don't think about it," added Gladon.
