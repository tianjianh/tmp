Ciara Mageean to run 800m in Sunday's AAI Games at new National Indoor Arena

European 1500m bronze medallist Ciara Mageean will be among the athletes in action at the AAI Games at the new National Indoor Arena on Sunday.

Mageean will compete over 800m and it will be interesting to see if she opts to chase the European Indoor Championship standard of 2:03.75.
US-based Siofra Cleirigh Buttner achieved the Belgrade mark with a 2:02.97 clocking last weekend.
Kerry O'Flaherty (1500m) and Emma Mitchell (3000m) also run in Dublin.
Mitchell was just over a second outside the European Indoor 1500m standard of 4:15 when she clocked a new personal best of 4:16.20 when winning the Scottish title last weekend.
Hurdler Ben Reynolds and county Derry long jumper Adam McMullen will also be competing at Abbotstown.
North Down's Reynolds will chase the European Indoor 60m hurdles standard of 7.80 seconds while McMullen will need to add six centimetres to his outdoor best set last year to achieve the Belgrade mark of 7.90m.
