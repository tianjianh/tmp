[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bid to boost Fair Isle population launched

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major drive to boost the population of Fair Isle, off Shetland, is being launched.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The population dropped to just 55 last year so a development plan has been prepared in an effort to swell numbers by about a fifth.
It is mostly owned by the National Trust for Scotland, which interviews anyone wanting to move there.
Research into a solution has been funded by Shetland Islands Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
'Securing Fair Isle's Future - A plan for Action' outlines how it is hoped to attract about 10 new people to the island in the next three to five years.
House-building, improving the ferry service and upgrading broadband will all be included.
