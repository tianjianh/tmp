Jose Mourinho: Chelsea boss had no problem with night out

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says he had no issue with a players' night out going on into Thursday morning.

Striker Diego Costa, an unused substitute in Sunday's draw at Tottenham, was one of those pictured leaving a London nightclub.
Costa, who appeared to throw his bib at Mourinho at the weekend, will be in the squad to face Bournemouth on Saturday.
Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is also available after recovering from a knee injury.
Mourinho said the players "needed" the party, which went ahead with his consent.
"The next morning everyone trained very well, they were happy. They told me the dinner was good and the after-dinner was better."
Costa was left on the bench for Sunday's 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane and Mourinho would not say if the Spain striker would start against the Cherries.
"He's been very good, he trained very well," said Mourinho. "Diego is the type of player who always tries. I just need him to be what he is, I don't need a reaction."
Courtois has not played since September after damaging his medial ligaments. Mourinho said the Belgian will return against Bournemouth or in the Champions League game at home to Porto on Wednesday.
"To lose your number one for three months, something like 19 matches without the best goalkeeper in the world, is tough for us.
"Thibaut was our keeper all last season and you know how fundamental he was, it's important to have him back."
