[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish chartered surveyor firms to merge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chartered surveyor firm Allied Surveyors Scotland has announced it is merging with rivals Murray and Muir.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allied said the move would strengthen its market share in Scotland, particularly in the central belt.
The combined firm will have 30 offices across Scotland, employing more than 160 staff and 36 directors, and an annual turnover of Â£10m.
Murray and Muir's 14 staff in Glasgow and Edinburgh will move to Allied offices.
Allied chairman Grant Robertson said: "We are delighted to announce this merger, which we believe signals a positive upturn in the Scottish property market reflected by the increasing demand for our surveying services and expertise.
"As we continue to grow our business, the strength of all our offices across Scotland, combined with Murray and Muir's established network, particularly with solicitors, will ensure we are in a prime position to maximise opportunities and to continue to deliver a quality service to all our clients."
Allied offers a full range of property services, including residential and commercial property valuations.
Its main client base is composed of estate agents, banks, investors and developers.
