[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Collins salvaged a draw for Sutton at Southport with a second-half penalty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors started well, with Ross Stearn heading just wide after 10 minutes, but it was the hosts who got the breakthrough with Andrai Jones profiting from Kevin Amankwaah's mistake to make it 1-0 after 37 minutes.
Magnus Norman kept the home team in front with a fine save low to his left from Nicky Bailey's spot-kick after 55 minutes.
But he was unable to repeat that feat two minutes later when Sutton were awarded a second penalty and Collins made no mistake to score his second of the season.
The point was enough to take Southport off rock bottom and above Guiseley, ending a three-match losing run, while Sutton remain 13th.
