[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham cruised to a comfortable victory against League One Gillingham in the third round of the EFL Cup.

Christian Eriksen opened the scoring with a stunning 25-yard strike and added a second just after half-time.
Dutch striker Vincent Janssen then got his first for the club from the penalty spot since his £17m summer move.
Strikes from Erik Lamela and Josh Onomah completed the rout for Spurs, who are rewarded with a trip to Liverpool in the fourth round.
Mauricio Pochettino made 11 changes from the side that beat Sunderland 1-0 on Sunday, with American defender Cameron Carter-Vickers, 18, and English midfielder Harry Winks, 20, handed a first start.
English attacker Marcus Edwards, 17, was also handed a senior debut from the bench and almost capped it with an injury-time goal, but his stinging shot was palmed over the bar by goalkeeper Stuart Nelson.
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino:
"Now that Harry Kane's injured Janssen is our main striker and it's important for his confidence for the next few games.
"That goal was important for him, to feel the love from the supporters.
"For a striker, always the difficult thing is to create chances but he has a lot of chances to score today. He was unlucky.
"The important thing is that he got into the box and he created a lot of chances and for the future it's important that he feels confidence and for the team it will help a lot for us."
Gillingham boss Justin Edinburgh:
"I had a fantastic time here as a player and I am disappointed because it was not the score I visualised, but the gulf in class came through in the end.
"We thought at 1-0 we might have a chance of staying in it but they put on the burners, got to 3-0 and it was damage limitation from then on."
