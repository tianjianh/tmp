Dover Athletic 2-2 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom club York twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at National League play-off hopefuls Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Jamie Grimes fired in via a post to put fifth-placed Dover ahead in the sixth minute, but Jon Parkin lashed home his first Minstermen goal following Simon Lappin's corner to level before the break.
Striker Parkin, on loan from Newport, rattled an upright from a tight angle early in the second period, before Ricky Miller restored the hosts' lead from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Shaun Rooney.
York, who had won just one of their last 19 league matches, were not to be denied a point though and Rooney made amends for conceding the penalty by heading in Sean Newton's deep free-kick 13 minutes from time.
Newton and Parkin were playing their first games as contracted York players. The duo made their loan deals from Wrexham and Newport respectively permanent on Friday.
