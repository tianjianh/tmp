Crawley Girlguiding campsite to become new cemetery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Girlguiding campsite in West Sussex is to become a new cemetery for Crawley after an eight-year hunt to find suitable land.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12-acre Little Trees site, beside the A264 Crawley bypass, is owned by Crawley Borough Council but has been leased to Crawley Girlguiding group.
The council said the group had agreed to move to a new base at Tilgate Forest Recreation Centre.
The new cemetery will replace Snell Hatch, which will be full by 2017.
The council, which has investigated 40 possible sites, said it would provide enough cemetery space for up to 50 years.
Plans to use sports fields at Ewhurst were dropped last year amid fierce local opposition after a report revealed potential flooding problems.
Councillor Colin Lloyd said he was delighted the council now had agreement to move forward with the Little Trees site.
