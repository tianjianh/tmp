Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will leave it up to the club's board to decide whether he should remain at the club even if he wins the FA Cup.

The Red Devils reached the final of the competition on Saturday by beating Everton 2-1 at Wembley.
Van Gaal, 64, had been expected to leave at the end of the season - one year before his contract expires.
"I'm not looking at anything other than this competition," the Dutchman said when asked about his future.
"We live in the present. For the future, I discuss this with my board."
Progressing to a record-equalling 19th FA Cup final means Manchester United, fifth in the Premier League, have the chance to end a disappointing season with a trophy.
They had to work for their win against Everton, who finished strongly before Anthony Martial struck the injury-time winner.
Van Gaal felt his side should have won by a more comfortable margin, but he accused referee Anthony Taylor of making decisions that "changed the game".
After Marouane Fellaini's opener, Everton were awarded a penalty midway through the second half when Timothy Fosu-Mensah was adjudged to have fouled Ross Barkley.
David De Gea saved Romelu Lukaku's spot kick but the Toffees equalised through Chris Smalling's own goal.
"The referees are deciding the game and not the players any more," Van Gaal told BBC Sport.
"I think we deserved to go to the final. I think the referee... we didn't have any fouls in our benefit. He changed the match I think."
