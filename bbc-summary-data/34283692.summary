[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wildflower meadows to honour the Queen created across Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twelve wildflower meadows have been restored in Wales following a mission to reverse their decline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK-wide scheme was instigated by the Prince of Wales to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation.
Flower-rich grasslands have decreased by 97% in the UK since the 1930s.
New meadows have been created in Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire and work is due to begin in Conwy county.
Flagship "Coronation meadows" are being identified for each county in the UK so seed from them can be used to create new meadows within the area.
The project has received funding from Biffa Award, Natural Resources Wales and Grantscape.
