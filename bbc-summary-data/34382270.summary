A petrol-soaked man died after catching fire when he was shot with a Taser by a police officer, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Pimlott, 32, was holding a match when a police officer fired the electric stun gun at him in Plymouth, Devon in April 2013.
An inquest jury in Plymouth heard two police officers went to a house after Mr Pimlott's father called 999.
His father Kelvin said his son had a can of petrol and was going to set fire to the building.
Mr Pimlott, who was single and unemployed, died in hospital five days after being Tasered.
The hearing was told Mr Pimlott had been served with a restraining order preventing him contacting his parents or going within 100m (330ft) of their home.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission told the inquest Mr Pimlott had a history of depression and issues with alcohol.
A pathologist told the hearing at Plymouth Coroner's Court that it was not possible to say from the medical evidence whether Mr Pimlott had caught fire as a result of being Tasered or from the match he was holding.
Ambulance technician James Dyson, who treated him, recalled a conversation with Mr Pimlott.
"He said he had covered himself in petrol, over his head, and when the Taser was fired it had lit the petrol and clothing that was on him. This was all he remembered," he told the court.
"He said he had wanted to end it all. Mr Pimlott did not say he had lit himself. He stated the Taser had lit the fuel."
Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the inquest jury that Mr Pimlott died as a result of severe burns.
The inquest continues.
