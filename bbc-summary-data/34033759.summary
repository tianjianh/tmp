Appeal for witnesses after three men die in A1 crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have appealed for witnesses of a crash on the A1 in County Down in which three men died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident between two vehicles happened at about 17:40 BST on Sunday on the dual carriageway between Dromore and Banbridge.
The three men, two aged 20 and one aged 19, were travelling in a red Vauxhall Corsa.
It was involved in a collision with a black Volkswagen Tiguan on the northbound carriageway.
A woman travelling in the other car was taken to hospital for treatment for injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.
The A1 was closed for several hours following the crash but has now been fully reopened to traffic in both directions.
SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said poor weather late on Sunday afternoon meant driving conditions were "atrocious".
"It's a dreadful tragedy that three men have lost their lives," she said.
She said she would meet with police on Tuesday to ask if anything more could be done to improve safety on the road that is "well-renowned for bad accidents".
Ulster Unionist MLA Jo-Anne Dobson said: "The weather and road conditions at the time of the accident were poor and once again highlight the dangers which exist on our roads.
"I would appeal to people to take extra caution on our roads."
