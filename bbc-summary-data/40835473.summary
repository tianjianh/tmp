Maidenhead United 2-1 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dave Tarpey scored twice to help Maidenhead to their first ever National League win as they beat Hartlepool at York Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tarpey opened the scoring in the 34th minute when a long ball down the middle was flicked on by Sean Marks and he tucked it past goalkeeper Scott Loach and into the bottom right-hand corner.
It was almost two just five minutes later when Ryan Upward's deflected shot from Harry Pritchard's cross was hacked off the line by a combination of Blair Adams and Loach.
It took until the 43rd minute for Hartlepool to trouble Carl Pentney but he easily gathered Jake Cassidy's weak effort after Adams played him in.
Tarpey doubled the lead in the 58th minute, collecting a poor back-pass from Louis Laing and rifling home a shot off the underside of the crossbar.
Pools finished strongly and pulled one back when James Comley was penalised and booked for a late challenge in the box and Padraig Amond stroked home from the spot, but they left it too late to salvage a point.
