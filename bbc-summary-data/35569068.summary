Both sides had gone into the game level on points in Premier League Two, still in with a chance of promotion but also still not safe from relegation.
Team Jets were 22-15 ahead by half-time and, although Clan narrowed the advantage, the hosts were able to pull away again in the final quarter.
"It was quite a classy win," Jets coach Linda Andrews told BBC Radio Jersey.
"I'm really pleased that we'll move up in the table. There were about four of us within one point of each other so it's really, really tight.
"We know that Clan have got to play [unbeaten leaders] Tameside, and I think the people around us have still got to play Tameside so that might be in our favour.
"We'll just keep on plodding along, one game at a time, and then we'll see where we end up at the end of the season."
