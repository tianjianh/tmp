The Irish lightweight, 31, stopped home favourite Jasmine Clarkson in the third round to record her sixth straight victory since turning professional.
"There were some nerves," said the London 2012 Olympic champion. "I got caught with a few silly shots but overall it was good.
"I hope I made some fans - I loved hearing the Irish in the crowd."
Taylor dominated the contest against her 22-year-old opponent. Clarkson had no answer to Taylor's punches and, after the third round, the American's corner called a halt.
Taylor is expected to challenge Uruguay's WBA world lightweight champion Cecilia Comunales later this year after stopping Nina Meinke of Germany in April's Wembley eliminator.
