The 27-year-old, who joined the Toffees from Manchester United in 2015, has played only twice since 5 November.
An England international, he spent the 2009-10 season on loan with Watford, then in the Championship, and won the club's Player of the Season award.
The Hornets have an option to buy Cleverley, who leaves Everton after they signed Morgan Schneiderlin.
The France international moved to Goodison Park for an initial £20m, rising to £24m.
