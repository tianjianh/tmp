Pearce was sent off and conceded a penalty for tripping Jamie Cureton, but the striker fired over from the spot.
Matt Green slotted in for Mansfield, and the visitors could not rescue a point despite Cureton's late goal.
Dagenham & Redbridge coach Ian Culverhouse told BBC Radio London:

"I thought we were excellent first half. Controlled the game in good parts, scored a well-deserved goal and went into the half deserved winners.
"It's a bit of a blow really to come out on the wrong side of it.
"We're giving away soft goals at the moment and nothing goes for you when you're at the bottom of the league."
