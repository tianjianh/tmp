Carrick put up stiff resistance against the league leaders at Seaview, before Heatley pounced to score his first after latching onto a long bouncing ball forward in the 33rd minute.
Heatley lobbed Brian Neeson for his second four minutes later but Tiernan McNicholl's low shot from the edge of the area against the run of play in the 56th minute gave the visitors hope.
The Crues forward completed his treble by beating Neeson from the edge of the area with seven minutes remaining.
Waterworth put Linfield ahead at Ballycastle Road with a 17th-minute header low into the bottom corner for his fourth of the season and his second in the league.
Brad Lyons and Jamie Mulgrew struck the woodwork for their respective sides, then substitute James McLaughlin restored parity with a headed effort on 54, two minutes after his introduction.
Sixth-placed Glenavon moved to within a point of Ballymena United by trouncing the Sky Blues at Mourneview Park.
Bradley's free-kick, Ciaran Martyn's strike and a Jim Ervin own goal saw the Lurgan Blues go in three goals to the good at the interval and Bradley smashed in his second with 10 minutes remaining.
Greg Moorhouse added the fifth to clinch his side's second victory in seven league outings.
Glentoran gave Gary Haveron his first home win as manager of the Oval club by emerging winners in a keenly fought game against Cliftonville at the Oval.
Jay Donnelly opened the scoring by sidefooting home at the near post after being played in by Jude Winchester five minutes before the break.
Nacho Novo's superb volley from an Aaron Harmon flick-on two minutes after half-time brought the sides level and Steven Gordon headed in the decisive goal from a Harmon cross with six minutes left.
Portadown moved to within eight points of Carrick Rangers at the foot of the table by triumphing at Ballinamallard.
Niall Henderson netted from the penalty spot and Stephen Hughes shot past James McGrath, before Shane McGinty grabbed what proved to be a consolation with a header from six yards.
Carl McComb's goal in injury-time earned a late point for Ards against Dungannon Swifts.
Andy Mitchell broke the deadlock, Michael Ruddy equalised with a penalty, but Cormac Burke nudged the Swifts in front with the first of his two goals.
David McAllister made it 2-2, Burke rolled home his second, but McComb's late intervention ensured the home side salvaged a point.
