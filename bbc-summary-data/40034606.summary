Police Scotland said it was investigating how the panel was recovered.
It was taken from St Giles' Cathedral at about 15:30 on Sunday 7 May by a man who then made off via the cathedral shop.
The tapestry is made of 305 individually embroidered panels. Police are appealing for information.
Two years ago a panel from the Great Tapestry of Scotland was stolen, and has never been found.
Det Con Chris Harding of Gayfield CID said: "We are following a number of lines of inquiry and I am pleased with the progress of the investigation, but I would continue to ask anyone with information about the theft, including the person responsible for the panel's removal and its return, to contact us."
A spokesperson for the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust said: "The Scottish Diaspora Tapestry team are greatly relieved to hear of the missing panel's safe return, as are the volunteer stitchers in the Netherlands who so lovingly created it.
"We are grateful for all the messages of support we have received from around the world and look forward to reuniting the panel with its companion pieces in the near future."
