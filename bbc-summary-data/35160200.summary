Tour de France 2017 to begin in Dusseldorf, Germany

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2017 Tour de France will begin in the German city of Dusseldorf, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London turned down the chance to host the Grand Depart, citing the cost of staging the event - reported to be about Â£35m - as the reason.
It will be the first time since West Berlin in 1987 that Germany has hosted the opening stage of road cycling's premier race.
La Manche in north-west France will host the 2016 Grand Depart.
This 2015 event started in the Dutch city of Utrecht, a year after thousands came to Leeds to watch the cyclists set off.
