US election 2016: Clinton deadpans in Between Two Ferns interview

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hillary Clinton has used a comedy interview to skewer presidential rival Donald Trump, and allowed herself to be the subject of plenty of jokes as well.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Democratic presidential candidate appeared with actor Zach Galifianakis on the online comedy show Between Two Ferns.
She follows in the footsteps of President Barack Obama, who appeared on the show, streamed on the Funny Or Die website, in 2014.
For the most part, the former secretary of state remained deadpan while Galifianakis, star of The Hangover, delivered the punchlines.
Here are some of the notable exchanges between the pair:
Galifianakis: "As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself? Weak?"
Clinton: "You know, Zach, those are really out-of-date questions. You need to get out more."
Galifianakis: "Let's talk about Trump."
Clinton: "Oh let's."
Galifianakis: "When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you ever think to yourself, 'Oh maybe I should be more racist'?"
Clinton: [shakes head, smiles]
Galifianakis: "Are you excited about being the first girl president?"
Clinton: "Well, I mean being president is an extraordinary honour and responsibility, but being the first woman elected president and what that would mean for our country and particularly what that would mean, not just for little girls but little boys too, that's pretty special."
Galifianakis: "Not to take away from the historic significance of becoming the first female president, but for a younger, younger generation, you will also become their first white president, and that's pretty neat too."
Galifianakis: Do you wonder what your opponent might be wearing?"
Clinton: "I assume he will be wearing that red power tie."
Galifianakis: "Or maybe a White Power tie?"
Clinton: "That's even more appropriate."
Galifianakis: "When he is elected president are you going to move to Canada?"
Clinton: "I would stay in the United States, I would try to prevent him destroying the United States."
Galifianakis: "So you are going to lead the civil war?"
Clinton: "No, I would not take up arms, I think that might be a little extreme."
Galifianakis: "Right, because you were saying before we were rolling that you wanted to take away everyone's guns."
(Mr Trump has repeatedly said his rival wants to abolish the Second Amendment, something the Clinton campaign has denied)
Galifianakis: "When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's?"
Clinton: "Umm, I really couldn't see or hear very well, so I'm not quite sure what his vows were. But I'm sure they were 'great' and 'huge' and 'wonderful'."
Galifianakis: "Well, this has been a lot of fun, Mrs Clinton, we should stay in touch. What's the best way to reach you? Email?"
Clinton: [looks annoyed; sighs]

Donald Trump, who has made his own appearances on comedy shows, has not yet responded to Mrs Clinton's jokes.
