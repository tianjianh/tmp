[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A chef accused of murdering four men by giving them fatal doses of GHB has told the Old Bailey that the drug gave him a "hyper high" during sex.

Stephen Port is said to have given his victims GHB so he could have sex with them while they were unconscious.
The chef, 41, who denies murder, said the substance "could knock you out" but users would wake up feeling aroused.
He also told the Old Bailey about the death of his first alleged victim, but denied having given him any drugs.
Mr Port said although Anthony Walgate was "high" during their encounter, he did not know what drugs he had taken and denied having given him anything that could have accounted for his death.
Giving evidence, he said he met the 23-year-old student online and offered him Â£800 to spend the night at his flat in Barking, east London, in June 2014.
While having sex, the student went to the bathroom and when he came back "he was high and very rampant", he told the jury.
After the student was sick, Mr Port suggested he stayed the night.
He told the court Mr Walgate was still sleeping when he went to work the next morning and after he returned later that day.
He said he went to bed that evening then woke up in the early hours to find the student "very rigid".
Mr Port said he "just panicked" and he took Mr Walgate outside and called an ambulance.
The court heard he was later convicted of perverting the course of justice.
When asked why he lied to police about what happened at the time, Mr Port said he had been in "shock".
Earlier, Mr Port described how he began using drugs in 2013 when he was introduced to mephedrone by a boyfriend.
The defendant said he later started taking GHB and eventually took the two drugs every weekend with partners.
The chef described how in one relationship it "became normal" to have sex with his partner "when he was out" because he took so much GHB.
He denies a total of 29 charges, including four murders, as well as offences of drugging, rape and sexual assault.
His three other alleged murder victims are Gabriel Kovari, 22, from Lewisham, Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend, Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham, east London.
The jury has heard that their bodies were found in a churchyard near Mr Port's home.
The trial continues on Friday, when the defendant will continue giving evidence.
