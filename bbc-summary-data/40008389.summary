Here's what we know about the attack so far.
Suspected attacker 22-year-old Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer as crowds were leaving a performance by US singer Ariana Grande just after 22:30 BST on Monday.
The blast, between the main arena and neighbouring Victoria station, blew people off their feet and caused widespread panic. Witnesses described hearing an explosion and seeing a flash of fire.
Pictures of the aftermath show debris and casualties in the foyer area of the arena. Metal nuts and bolts were strewn around the floor among bodies. The smell of explosives was in the air, witnesses said.
The bomb was detonated moments after Grande had performed her final song and fans had started making their way home.
People began scrambling for the arena's exits and were seen fleeing down the stairs from the foyer into the station.
People who had arrived to drive friends and relatives home were forced to go on a desperate hunt to find missing children.
More than 240 emergency calls were made; 60 ambulances and 400 police officers attended.
The foyer where the bomb went off is the busiest exit from the arena - housing the box office and leading to the car park and Victoria Station.
Photos from the scene have been leaked to the US media.
According to the New York Times, analysis of images of the scene reveal how the bomb's shrapnel penetrated metal doors and left marks on brickwork.
The paper says the authorities' review of the blast site shows the bodies of those killed were located in a circle around where the device was detonated - just outside the arena's main exit.
The photos also appear to show bloodstained fragments from the bomb and the backpack used by the attacker.
The images show the remains of a Karrimor backpack, a possible detonator, a 12-volt battery as well as metal nuts and screws.
Salman Abedi, 22, has been named by police as the suspected suicide bomber.
Abedi was born in Manchester on New Year's Eve 1994, the BBC understands.
It is thought that he has at least three siblings: an elder brother who was born in London, and a younger brother and sister who were born in Manchester.
The family, of Libyan origin, has lived at several addresses in Manchester, including at a property at Elsmore Road in the Fallowfield area which was raided by police on Tuesday.
Abedi attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, before going to The Manchester College until 2013 and then Salford University in 2014.
BBC News understands that members of the public called an anti-terrorism hotline after he expressed the views that "he was supporting terrorism" and "being a suicide bomber was ok".
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Abedi was known "up to a point" by security services, and it was believed he had recently returned from Libya.
A Whitehall source said he was "one of a larger pool of former subjects of interest, whose risk remained subject to review" by security services.
The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility, but this has not been verified.
Twenty-one victims have been named so far. The youngest victim to be named is eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, from Leyland, Lancashire.
Elaine McIver, an off-duty officer from Cheshire Police, was also among those killed. She was with her partner, Paul, and two children, all of whom were injured.
In total, 116 people were admitted to hospital in relation to the attack, NHS England said.
Seventy-five people are still being treated in eight hospitals, including 23 patients who are in critical care.
A minute's silence was held at 11:00 BST on Thursday to remember those who lost their lives or were affected by the attack.
Eight men and one woman have been arrested in the UK since Monday night.
They include Abedi's older brother, Ismail, 23. The woman has since been released without charge.
The arrests were made following a series of police raids across Manchester, Wigan and Nuneaton in Warwickshire.
Twenty-year-old Hashem Abedi, Abedi's younger brother, was detained in Tripoli on suspicion of links with the so-called Islamic State group on Tuesday evening.
Reuters news agency has told the BBC that Abedi's father, Ramadan, has also been detained Libya.
Salman Abedi is thought to have been a "mule" using a device built by someone else, the BBC understands.
On Wednesday, police raided a flat in Granby Row, Manchester, that Abedi may have used before the attack on Monday night.
Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the arrests made in the UK over the past few days are "significant".
"Initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation," he said.
He has previously confirmed that Greater Manchester Police is investigating a network.
Meanwhile, police investigating the attack have stopped sharing information with the US after leaks to the media, the BBC understands.
UK officials were outraged when photos appearing to show debris from the attack appeared in the New York Times.
The threat level "will remain at critical and the public should remain vigilant", Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday.
Anyone with information can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321.
The police have also appealed to anyone with images or footage from Monday night to upload it to ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk or ukpoliceimageappeal.com
As a result of the decision to raise the terror threat level - the first time it has been "critical" since 2007 - members of the armed forces will replace armed police at certain "key sites", Mrs May said.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd says 984 servicemen and women have been deployed as part of Operation Temperer - the government plan to put soldiers on the streets.
As the security threat has been raised to critical, she has announced that 3,800 extra troops will be available to patrol UK streets.
Extra armed police officers will be deployed on Saturday at Wembley for football's FA Cup Final and at Twickenham for rugby union's Aviva Premiership final, Scotland Yard has said.
Sporting events and venues in England say they are conducting major security reviews.
Police Scotland said it was reviewing all "significant events" taking place within the next 14 days and has increased the number of armed police on patrol.
And Chelsea FC have cancelled their Premier League victory parade, which was due to take place on Sunday.
Eighteen terror plots have been foiled since 2013, including five since the Westminster attack in March, a senior Whitehall source has said.
