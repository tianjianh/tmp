Leicestershire struggled early on as Ben Sanderson (6-58) took three wickets for nine runs in just five overs.
Eckersley hit 107 in 160 balls, including 11 fours and two sixes, as he helped Leicestershire to reach 519.
The visitors took two early wickets before Rob Keogh put on 91 for the third wicket with Rob Newton, who had made 69 when Northants closed on 142-4.
After his 117 and 104 against Derbyshire, Eckersley became just the third Leicestershire batsman in their history to score a century in three consecutive innings.
Leicestershire batsman Ned Eckersley told BBC Radio Leicester:
"There's been some sticky periods for me where I haven't got the runs I wanted so it's great to come here and put us in a good position.
"Ben and I managed to switch momentum and put them back under pressure. Ben was brave and we got into a good flow and made a big stand.
"The wickets at the end of the day give us something to go into tomorrow. There's definitely some spin there and a couple a turning off the straight so that's positive signs for us."
