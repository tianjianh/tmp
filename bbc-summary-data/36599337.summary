[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"British voters have to know there will be no kind of any negotiation. We have concluded a deal with the prime minister. He got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give, so there will be no kind of renegotiation." (Speaking to reporters in Brussels, 22 June, reported by Financial Times)
"Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe would not be a disaster, a tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because it would be the wrong choice." (Writing in The Guardian, 22 June)
"Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries - or between the two political centres, the European Union on the one hand and the UK on the other - would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st century." (BBC interview, 22 June)
"A strong UK in a strong Europe is good for the UK and it's good for Nato, because we are faced with unprecedented security challenges, with terrorism, with instability and an unpredictable security environment, and a fragmented Europe will add to instability and unpredictability." (Guardian interview, 22 June)
"We hope that the result will show confidence in the future of Europe with Britain." (Speaking to reporters, 21 June, reported by L'Express )
"Considering the big issues of our time - security, climate protection, sustainable economic growth - I find it hard sometimes to fathom how some people can believe that the EU doesn't protect our societies' vital interests and represent them on the world stage more effectively than any one member state could do these days." (Speaking in Bucharest, 21 June, reported by Deutsche Welle )
"Europe is not in good shape. We won't be able to go on as we have done, otherwise people will say 'they haven't understood'. Britain is an important market for the German economy and a British exit would cause considerable damage". (Speaking at a Berlin economics conference, 21 June, reported by Deutsche Welle)
"Sixty percent of Britain's exports go to the European Union or its close trade partners, which shows the importance of Europe for the British economy. To open that up to uncertainty would be a totally fatal result... Britain can't just cherry pick any results by choosing one part and not the other." (Reported by ZDF television, 21 June)
"It's very difficult to foresee... the various dimensions in which the UK vote would impact on the markets and economies of the eurozone. We're trying to be ready to cope with all possible contingencies. It's very, very difficult to more precise than that." (21 June, reported in The Guardian )
"What I'm asking for is a referendum in France. Every EU member should be able to have its say in a referendum." (21 June, reported by RTL radio )
"I count myself among the optimists on this matter. I believe that the European Union is stronger with Britain and Britain needs the EU." (Speaking to reporters in Sibiu, 21 June, reported by Realitatea TV )
