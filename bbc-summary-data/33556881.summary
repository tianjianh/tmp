A daughter trying to raise money to pay for her terminally ill mother to die at a Swiss clinic said she is heartbroken after being forced to cancel an event.

Tara O'Reilly, from Llanelli, has been trying to raise money to send Jackie Baker to euthanasia unit Dignitas.
She said her 59-year-old mother's condition has deteriorated rapidly and she had begged her children to make sure she dies with dignity.
But Mrs O'Reilly said police warned her that she could face prosecution.
Under current UK law, a person encouraging or assisting a suicide or suicide attempt could face up to 14 years in prison, if a decision was taken to prosecute.
Mrs O'Reilly, 40, said: "I've been forced to cancel the night. I don't know what I'm going to do or how I will raise the money.
"The law needs to change. It is inhumane that people should have to suffer in the way that my mother may have to now.
"I'm so upset - the thought of seeing my mum die without her dignity makes me feel sick."
The decision by Mrs O'Reilly and her sister Rose Baker to arrange an Â£8,000 fundraising evening with a drag artist and playboy waiters has led to front-page stories in national and international newspapers.
Mrs O'Reilly said she was aware of the possible risks - but did not anticipate her mother's story would gain global press attention.
She added the threat of being arrested or even jailed while her mother continued to worsen placed her in a very difficult position.
Dyfed-Powys Police said it was "an extremely sensitive and emotive issue" which the force has "carefully considered" as a result of a complaint received.
A spokesperson added: "All parties concerned have been spoken to and support and advice provided."
On Wednesday, Ms O'Reilly told BBC Wales the family had thought long and hard about their mother's wishes.
"My mother spoke to me and my sister about it and she said if it gets worse, which it has, she wanted to go to Switzerland," she said.
"We were distraught, because it's unthinkable.
"But as the months have gone, and we've seen how much she has deteriorated, unable to feed herself, dress herself.
"It's cruel. You wouldn't let your cat or dog suffer, you'd take them to the vets. It's kind.
"This is not kind. Having to wipe your mother's mouth, feed her and give her drinks through a straw."
