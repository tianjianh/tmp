Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala, the Most Valuable Player in the finals series, had 25 points apiece.
LeBron James once again led the injury-hit Cavaliers with a game-high 32 points.
"This is something special. From the start of the season this is what we envisioned," said Curry.
The Warriors were the top-seeded team in the play-offs after having the best record in the regular season and they become the first team since the Chicago Bulls in 1991 to win a title with no players having prior finals experience.
Steve Kerr also becomes the first rookie coach to capture the crown since Pat Riley with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1982.
