North Korea: Goalkeeper and manager of U16 team fined and banned by AFC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A North Korean goalkeeper has been fined and banned for a year for deliberately conceding a goal that helped his side get an easier cup tie.

Jang Paek-ho was beaten by the opposition goalkeeper as North Korea lost 3-1 to Uzbekistan at the AFC Under-16 Championship in September.
The Asian Football Confederation also fined and banned the team's manager.
It said Yung Jong-su and Jang "brought the game into disrepute" with "the deliberate conceding of a goal".
Manager Yung was fined £4,000, Jang was fined £800 and North Korea's football association was fined £16,000.
Jang came rushing out of his area and appeared to duck underneath the Uzbekistan keeper's long kick forward.
As the ball bounced towards his net, Jang clearly still had a chance of preventing a goal, but he threw himself on the ground before he could reach it, allowing the opposition to take a 1-0 lead.
Uzbekistan's victory meant they played eventual winners Iraq in the quarter-finals.
By losing, North Korea finished second in their group - behind Uzbekistan. They went on to beat Oman in the last eight before losing on penalties to Iran in the semi-finals.
The four teams who made the last semi-finals all qualified for the U17 World Cup, to be held in India from 6-28 October 2017.
The AFC will allow North Korea to compete - without Jang and manager Yung - but said they would ban the team from the 2018 AFC U19 Championship if they "engage in similar behaviour" during qualifying for the event.
