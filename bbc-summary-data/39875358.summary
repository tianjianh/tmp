Luka Pibernik punched the air as he crossed the finish line - but the route looped back for another lap in Messina.
He only appeared to realise his mistake after the peloton swept past.
Welsh Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas came home safely in the main bunch to stay second overall - six seconds behind race leader Bob Jungels.
Thomas' fellow Briton Adam Yates remains third - 10 seconds behind Jungels - on the same time as defending champion Vincenzo Nibali and 2014 winner Nairo Quintana.
Jakub Mareczko was second behind Gaviria - who also won Sunday's stage three - with Ireland's Sam Bennett third at the end of Wednesday's 159km route from Pessara.
Pibernik eventually finished 148th, 20 seconds slower than Gaviria.
Thursday's sixth stage is a 217km ride from Reggio Calabria to Terme Luigiane that features a category-three climb and a category-four climb.
