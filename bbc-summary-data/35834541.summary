HighWire Press is a digital publishing platform with its headquarters in Silicon Valley.
It said the jobs will have average salaries of £34,000 and the positions include software developers and support engineers.
Grants of almost £1m are being provided to the company, with most of the money coming from Invest NI.
The firm's chief executive, Dan Filby, said the office was a "dedicated technology centre".
"We are very excited about our investment in Belfast. As well as providing us with a dedicated technology development centre, it will also provide us with a focal point on which to build our continued presence in Europe," he said.
"An outstanding, abundant talent pool was our highest priority when evaluating potential expansion locations."
Welcoming the jobs, First Minister Arlene Foster said: "The total investment as a result of this project, supported by Invest Northern Ireland, equates to nearly £6m and is a great boost to Belfast's reputation as number one in Europe for new software development projects."
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said: "HighWire choosing to locate in the north of Ireland signals the potential of our existing and future IT professionals."
HighWire was founded in 1995, as a spin-out business by Stanford University, and is now owned by a private equity firm.
Its services are used by the British Medical Journal, among others.
The jobs announcement coincides with a trip to the United States by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers.
