Euro 2016 travel ban for 'Pig of Marseille' James Shayler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A football hooligan known as the 'Pig of Marseille' has been barred from travelling to France for England's opening game of Euro 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Shayler, 50, of Wellingborough, was jailed during the 1998 World Cup in France for his involvement in an attack on the police.
His passport was earlier confiscated as part of proceedings at Northampton Magistrates' Court.
The case follows two arrests in Marseille ahead of Euro 2016.
The banning order on Mr Shayler was sought by police in response to alleged comments made in a Sunday Star newspaper article.
In the article, Mr Shayler suggested he intended to join up with Russian supporters to attack Muslims.

Magistrates adjourned their decision on imposing a banning order until 11 July - the day after the Euro 2016 tournament ends.
The Crown Prosecution Service successfully applied to have two bail conditions imposed.
The conditions are that Shayler does not leave England or Wales before the next hearing and continues to surrender his UK passport to Northamptonshire Police.
Mr Shayler was previously convicted for running a cocaine-dealing operation, partly from a prison cell in France.
In August 1998, he pleaded guilty at Northampton Crown Court to conspiracy to supplying cocaine between November 1997 and 3 July 1998. He was jailed for seven and a half years.
