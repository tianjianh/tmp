Water supply has been partially restored in the Indian capital, Delhi, where up to 10 million were affected after protesters sabotaged a key canal.

The army took control of the Munak canal in neighbouring Haryana state on Monday after Jat community protesters, angry at caste job quotas, seized it.
Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra said the "crisis was still not over" and urged people to use water carefully.
The city's schools, which were closed because of the crisis, have reopened.
Sixteen million people live in Delhi, and around three-fifths of the city's water is supplied by the Munak canal, which runs through Haryana.
The anger of the farming communities
Mr Mishra tweeted on Tuesday morning that "some water has been released" from the canal.  This had led to the restoration of partial supplies in north and central Delhi, he said.
He said more than 70 water tankers from these areas had been moved to the western part of the city, where partial supplies would be "hopefully" restored by Tuesday evening.
"The supply will be limited till the time the Munak [canal] is totally repaired. The crisis is not yet over. People should use water carefully," he said.
Prior warnings meant that people had managed to save water, and tankers had been despatched to affected areas of the city, but that this has not been enough to make up for the shortfall.
"My son works as a manager in a hotel so he leaves an hour early to take bath in his office," Nikhat Parveen told Hindustan Times newspaper.
"For cooking and drinking purposes, I am buying packed water bottles."
Vinod Kumar Sharma told the newspaper that his family rented a hotel room to bathe after going without a bath for two days.
The army took control of parts of the canal on Monday morning, but repairs are expected to take time. Eighteen people have been killed and hundreds injured in three days of riots.
Protesters went on the rampage despite a curfew and the deployment of the army, which is reported to have opened fire on them, in the districts of Rohtak and Jhajjar.
