Super League: Hull KR 20-24 Leeds Rhinos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds finished the Super League season by beating Hull KR in a hard-fought contest at the Lightstream Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers took the lead when Matty Marsh gathered in John Boudebza's grubber kick to touch down close to the posts.
Jimmy Keinhorst and Rob Burrow crossed for Leeds, before Maurice Blair went over to make it 12-10 at half-time.
Ken Sio restored the hosts' advantage but James Segeyaro and Ryan Hall crossed to win it for the Rhinos despite Kieran Dixon's late try.
Both sides were already assured of a place in the Qualifiers when the Super 8s phase starts, but the result means Leeds - last season's treble winners - will have an extra home game in the middle eights.
Rovers controlled possession early on and were good value for their lead, but poor tackling allowed Keinhorst and Burrow to run through the defence and put Leeds ahead.
The hosts lost James Green to a shoulder injury shortly before Blair's second try, and Josh Mantellato's missed conversion meant they trailed at the break.
Mantellato missed again after Dixon's last-minute try, as Rhinos climbed to ninth and Hull KR dropped to 11th in the table.
