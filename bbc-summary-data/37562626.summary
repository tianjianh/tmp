Alberto Cavasin: Ex-Sampdoria boss relishes Leyton Orient appointment

New Leyton Orient manager Alberto Cavasin says his appointment by the League Two club came as "a surprise".

The 60-year-old had not coached since leaving Italian club Sampdoria in 2011 following their relegation to Serie B.
Cavasin saw the O's beaten 1-0 by Southend in his first match in charge in the Checkatrade Trophy on Tuesday.
"To return to management after five years, and in this country, is great at this moment of my professional career," the Italian told BBC Radio London.
Except for a brief spell with Swiss side Bellinzona, Cavasin has spent his entire career coaching in his homeland, but he replaced the sacked Andy Hessenthaler at Orient on Sunday.
"I have enough knowledge of the squad but a bit less about the championship [League Two]," Cavasin said.
"This kind of football is perfect for my way [of playing] and my ideas. At the moment I don't know the language but it is a great opportunity.
"It is important to learn English. For five days a week I will have three three hours with a teacher."
Excluding the recent two-game caretaker spell of Andy Edwards, Cavasin is the eighth different manager of the east London club since compatriot Francesco Becchetti bought Orient in the summer of 2014.
Becchetti, 50, has previously been accused of interfering in first-team affairs but Cavasin says he will have control over selecting the side.
"I didn't speak with the president about this topic," he added. "I picked the team against Southend and the first XI is up to me."
