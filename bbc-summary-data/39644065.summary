The 35-year-old led France a record 56 times, taking them to the 2011 World Cup final, before retiring from international rugby in 2015.
Dusautoir is captain of Toulouse, with whom he has won three French league titles and a European Cup.
"It is a very special moment, full of emotion but there is no sadness," he said.
