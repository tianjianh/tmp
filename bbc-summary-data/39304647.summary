Plans for 60m bridge in Mountain Ash given go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new 60m bridge in a Rhondda Cynon Taff town have been given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge in Mountain Ash will be built over the Aberdare-Cardiff railway line and the River Cynon, from the Cwm Cynon Industrial Estate to Miskin Road.
It will offer a link for traffic travelling on the A4059 and the B4275.
Council leader Andrew Morgan called it "a major landmark" after planning permission was granted on Thursday.
Part of the Mountain Ash Cross Valley Link project, it has received more than Â£6m of funding with further preparatory work set to take place on 27 March.
