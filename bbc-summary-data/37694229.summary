Shiyi Ying was given permission to take to the stage towards the end of the ceremony in July 2015 to pop the question to Yu-Yen Ou.
The couple celebrated their marriage in two ceremonies - Tianjin in China and Taipei in Taiwan - to accommodate both families.
Mr Ying said they would "share our love and joy to the world".
He said the ceremonies, attended by friends including fellow graduates from Southampton, were "great fun" and "combined Chinese traditions and western elegance".
His graduation surprise proposal made headlines both in the UK and China last year.
At the time, the university's vice chancellor Professor Don Nutbeam said it was "certainly a first" in his 25 years attending graduations.
Both students were receiving their masters degrees. Mr Ying, from Beijing, had studied for an MSc International Management and Ms Ou, from Taipei, had studied MSc International Financial Markets.
The pair are spending their honeymoon in the Maldives before starting a new life together in Tianjin.
