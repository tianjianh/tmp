'Jihadi Jack' parents to face terror trial in January

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a man thought to be fighting in Syria with the so-called Islamic State will stand trial in January accused of funding terrorism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Letts, 20, dubbed "Jihadi Jack" by some newspapers, is thought to be the first white Briton fighting in Syria.
John Letts, 55, and Sally Lane, 54, have been charged with making money available for terrorism purposes.
The pair are accused of sending money to their son, and will appear in court for a plea hearing on 17 November.
Mr Letts and Ms Lane, both of Chilswell Road, Oxford, were charged on 9 June.
They are accused of three counts of entering into a funding arrangement contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000.
Ms Lane is further charged with attempting to provide money knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used for a terrorist purpose, contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000.
They were remanded in custody but, after appearing at the Old Bailey, Judge Mr Justice Saunders granted the pair bail.
The couple's defence barrister Di Middleton promised they would not attempt to send any more money to their son, and had not done so while on police bail.
Mr Letts and Ms Lane are both accused of transferring £223 on 2 September last year, £1,000 on 31 December 2015 and £500 on 4 January 2016.
Ms Lane is charged with two further counts of attempting to provide money or property knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect it could be used for the purpose of terrorism.
Westminster Magistrates' Court heard she attempted to send two payments of £500 to her son on 4 January 2016.
The pair were both released on bail and a trial has been set at a London court on 9 January 2017, which is expected to last up to four weeks.
