Sherbini won 6-11 4-11 11-3 11-5 11-8 to become the youngest women's world champion at the age of 20.
The Egyptian will replace Massaro as world number one in the new rankings.
"I'm extremely disappointed but she played an amazing match from 2-0 down," Massaro said.
The 32-year-old from Preston added: "I'm just a bit disappointed with the ending. You want it to go your way, but that's sport, you take it on the chin and try again."
Egypt's men have won seven world titles between them but Sherbini, who won the British Open last month, becomes the first female Egyptian world champion.
"I think I'm dreaming right now, I didn't imagine I could do it," she said.
"Laura's one of the toughest players, she's very tough on court. I thought it was the end [at 2-0 down] but my coach kept telling me there's nothing to lose.
"I was trying to forget the two games I lost."
