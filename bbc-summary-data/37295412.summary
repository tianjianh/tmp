[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Dumfries and Galloway has said it is meeting performance targets despite a rise in patients waiting more than three months for hospital admission.

For in-patient and day case admissions, the number waiting longer than 12 weeks was 447 at the end of June.
That was more than five times the total at the same point a year ago.
The health board said there had been an increase against the three-month target but added NHS Scotland targets were based on an 18-week standard.
Hospitals are expected to see at least 90% of patients within that timeframe.
NHS Dumfries and Galloway said the latest data confirmed that it was not only meeting that target but also out-performing the national average.
