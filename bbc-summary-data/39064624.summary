Manager Paul Lambert told BBC WM the 18-year-old will be out for "a good few months" with the injury.
Ronan made his league debut in the 2-0 Championship win at Nottingham Forest in December, and he has since made five further appearances.
"He just needs to come over this little hurdle and we'll get him right for the start of next season," Lambert said.
"In the games he's played he's probably been one of our best players, so he's got a big future and he'll come back strong."
