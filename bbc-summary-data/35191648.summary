[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Phil Taylor won a scrappy encounter against Kevin Painter to reach the last 16 of the PDC World Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor, bidding for his 17th world title, was well below his best but still managed to win 4-1.
Taylor, 55, has now won 31 of 32 matches played against Painter, including the 2004 PDC World final.
Two-time world champion Adrian Lewis thumped Andrew Gilding 4-0, while Scotland's Peter Wright also whitewashed Belgium's Ronny Huybrechts.
Also through to the last 16 are Wales' Mark Webster, England's Alan Norris and Austria's Mensur Suljovic.
PDC darts results and draw
Third seed Taylor averaged less than 90 in the first three sets and missed countless doubles, but Painter's form was even more inconsistent.
Taylor finally hit his straps in the fourth set, in which he recorded a 170 checkout and averaged 111, before making short work of the fifth.
Taylor will play either England's Mervyn King or Dutchman Jelle Klaasen next, both of whom will fancy their chances against him.
Fifth seed Lewis, winner in 2011 and 2012, dropped only two legs, averaged 103 and hit eight maximums in securing a third-round encounter against Suljovic.
Suljovic, the 21st seed, beat England's David Pallett 4-3, with both players missing a double for a perfect nine-dart leg.
Webster demolished Welshman Terry Jenkins 4-0 to set up a clash with former BDO finalist Norris, who registered a 4-1 win over compatriot Joe Murnan.
Fourth seed Wright, runner-up in 2014, will play England's 13th seed Dave Chisnall next.
