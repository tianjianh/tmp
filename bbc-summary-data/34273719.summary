Best's line-out axis with O'Connell has been a key element in Ireland's successes over the past decade.
Hooker Best says O'Connell's "extra professionalism" has been a lesson.
"Paulie will do that bit more in the video room or wherever and you will think: 'That's the extra bit I need to do too'," said 33-year-old Best.
The front row player believes O'Connell's attitude has raised standards throughout the Irish squad as Joe Schmidt's team head into the World Cup after two straight Six Nations title triumphs.
"If I want to succeed personally, even within the team environment, I have to make sure that I have all my bases covered so that I am in a position to perform," added Best ahead of Ireland's World Cup opener against Canada in Cardiff on Saturday.
"It doesn't always go as perfectly as you would like but you have to put yourself in a position to try to play the perfect game."
Brian O'Driscoll's remarkable career marked him out as the icon of Irish rugby in the modern era but Best makes a convincing case for the 35-year-old Munster legend to be placed in a similar category.
"Because of how skilful Drico [O'Driscoll] was, all his moments were in a highlights reel and he [deservedly] got a lot of plaudits.
"But being a front-five forward and having played against Paulie and with him, I understand what he does and what he puts his body through, week in, week out.
"The biggest thing for me to say is that he probably is one of the players in world rugby that I would have the most admiration for."
Best adds that O'Connell's attitude off the field has made him an even more endearing figure.
"He's always been really, really hard and uncompromising on the pitch but he's just a proper gentleman off the field.
"If you ever introduce him to one of your cousins or a brother or your mum or dad, he'll always have time for them and will remember their names.
"Hard as nails on the pitch, never takes a backward step and just wants to win every single moment but off the pitch, he's just a good guy."
