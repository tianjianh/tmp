Monfils, the 15th seed, won 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 6-4 to reach the third round - and leave Britain with four players in the last 32 of the singles.
Andy Murray, Johanna Konta, Aljaz Bedene and Heather Watson will all play third-round matches on Friday.
Jamie Murray and Brazil's Bruno Soares beat Roman Jebavy and Jiri Vesely 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 6-4 in the doubles.
Monfils, 30, goes on to face compatriot Adrian Mannarino, who beat Japan's Yuichi Sugita in five sets.
With 15,000 spectators on Centre Court and the temperature approaching 40C, it was the more experienced Monfils who rose to the occasion.
"Kyle has won a round at Wimbledon and been out on Centre Court, but I think he can improve," said former British number one Tim Henman.
"He's 50 in the world but I think with the weapons he's got, he needs to be more comfortable coming forward, improve his defensive skills and mentally have more belief in himself."
Edmund's first-round win over Alex Ward was his first at Wimbledon, at the fifth time of asking, but the 22-year-old could not pull off a shock on the biggest stage of all.
The world number 50 ended the match with 14 unforced errors off his forehand, a huge shot that is the bedrock of his game.
Edmund, currently without a coach, had his chances against Monfils but could not capitalise on three break points in the ninth game, and then played a poor tie-break.
The fragile Monfils, who has a long history of injury problems, fell heavily as Edmund recovered a break midway through the second set but again the Briton failed to build momentum.
Monfils reeled off three straight games to take the second set, and recovered from 3-0 down in the third as Edmund's challenge faded away after two hours and 12 minutes.
"It was a great match to learn from," said Edmund.
"I got my game out on court, which is something I wanted to do, and just lack a bit of maturity at this stage.
"A few shots in certain points or match situations I just needed to be better on. I'm only 22 years old, I don't know all the answers. That's why it's a great thing to learn from."
Tim Henman, six-time Wimbledon semi-finalist
I just want more from Kyle, and that's because I think he's a very, very good player. I don't think he should be ranked 50, I think he should be knocking on the door of the top 30 and then the top 20.
But there are still areas he can add to his game. He's got such a big forehand, but if he can look to move forward and finish the point occasionally at the net it will give him an extra dimension and put a little bit more doubt into his opponent's mind.
Mentally, his character on the court, he needs to express himself a little bit better. That will help him with his overall belief because he is a very, very good player and I would like to see him back here at the championships next year definitely seeded, and definitely in the second week. For me, he's still scratching the surface.
