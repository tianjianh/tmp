Giant, solar-powered robots have been installed on the roads to help monitor the busy traffic in the capital city.
The robo-cops let drivers know when it is safe to go by using red and green lights on their rotating arms.
As well as this they also have a number of security cameras on them, which allow the police to keep an eye on the roads and make sure there is no trouble.
Three of the newest robots were developed by a team of women engineers, who hope their robots will be used across the rest of the country.
