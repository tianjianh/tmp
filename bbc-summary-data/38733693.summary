Johnson, 35, dismissed openers Rob Quiney and Luke Wright for ducks before having Kevin Pietersen caught for five.
The ex-Australia fast bowler's figures (4-2-3-3) are the most economical completed spell in BBL history.
The Stars posted 136-8 at the Waca but Shaun Marsh's unbeaten 56 took the Scorchers to victory in the 17th over.
The Scorchers, who are attempting to win a third BBL title in four seasons, will play either Brisbane Heat or Sydney Sixers in the final.
The Heat play the Sixers at the Gabba in Brisbane on Wednesday.
The Scorchers' victory completed an excellent day for Perth as the women's team beat Brisbane Heat by nine wickets to reach their BBL final.
