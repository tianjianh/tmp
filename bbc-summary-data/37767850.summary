[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The history of a hospital which was built thanks to thousands of miners donating a penny a week has been celebrated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A bronze plaque was unveiled at Maesteg Hospital on Saturday following a march through the centre of the town in Bridgend county by former pitmen.
The hospital, built in 1914, was originally run by the Red Cross and cared for injured soldiers as they returned from World War One.
It still provides healthcare today.
Staff past and present joined patients and the community for the unveiling of the plaque in Market Square.
It was paid for by the hospital's League of Friends which wanted to mark the contribution made by the mining community.
The League of Friends also funded a second, replica plaque for the foyer of the hospital.
There was music from Cor Meibion Maesteg a'r Cylch, Maesteg Children's Choir and the Curtain Up Youth Theatre and former miner Ian Isaac will share the story behind the hospital and plaque.
