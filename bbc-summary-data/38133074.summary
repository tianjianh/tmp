[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver who hit a low bridge and sliced off the roof of his vehicle failed to notice the extent of the damage and drove on for 10 miles.

The crash happened as the lorry drove under a 19th Century stone bridge known as the Cut in Banbridge, County Down.
The driver spectacularly failed to make the Cut, and peeled off the top of the lorry. However, he continued driving on to Portadown, County Armagh.
Police posted a photo of the damage, saying it was "not the smartest move".
Officers used the image as a warning to drivers of other high-sided vehicles, advising them to know the height and dimensions of their lorries before passing under bridges.
On the PSNI's Facebook page, officers said:  "This vehicle found out the clearance height of The Cut in Banbridge yesterday. It then drove on to Portadown, not realising the damage done."
Police also joked that "only the fire service are qualified to make your motor a convertible by the roadside, but you really don't want that to happen".
They reminded motorists that in the case of a collision with a railway bridge, drivers should alert Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) immediately, using phones installed beside bridges.
"There's no way of telling what structural damage could be caused by a bridge strike, and those trains aren't light."
Bridge strikes have been hitting the headlines across the island of Ireland this year.
In the Republic of Ireland, Irish Rail launched a high-profile and controversial campaign warning lorry drivers to obey height restrictions.
They released a video entitled "Dumb truckers" after a rise in the number of lorries hitting low bridges.
It was a photo montage of "Irish Truckers Greatest Hits", showing the Irish company's best pictures of lorry drivers' worst decisions.
The photos were set to a tongue-in-cheek soundtrack featuring hits like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers' "Under The Bridge" and "Hit Me Baby One More Time" and "Oops... I Did It Again" by Britney Spears.
