Castle on the Hill, released on Friday, has been described as a "love song for Suffolk".
In addition to describing the Framlingham area where he grew up, Sheeran sings "driving at 90 down those country lanes".
Sgt Chris Harris, from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing, responded by tweeting "please slow down".

The new singles are the first to be released since he announced in December 2015 that he would be taking a break from music "to travel the world".
They are taken from his forthcoming album, which is called Ã· (Divide).
On the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Sheeran said he wrote Shape of You with the singer Rihanna in mind.
While in his homage to growing up in Suffolk, Castle on the Hill, he says he "can't wait to go home".
Sgt Harris said: "Know you want to go home but please slow down on Suffolk roads."
And warned to "drive to arrive".
Sheeran is not the first singer to reference excessive speed in his lyrics.
In Crosstown Traffic, Jimi Hendrix sang "ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive".
The BBC has approached Sheeran's representatives for a comment.
