Nottingham tram extension: Residents call for compensation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Compensation for an alleged drop in house values caused by a new tram line is being demanded by some Nottinghamshire householders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £570m project to extend Nottingham's tram to Chilwell and Clifton is expected to finish shortly.
But residents overlooking the tracks in Beeston have claimed property prices have been cut by as much as £40,000.
The city council and tram operator NET insisted experience showed property values would, in fact, increase.
Alison Dobbs is leading a group of about 49 homeowners and landlords on Lower Road & Fletcher Road.
"People have said it will increase the value but when you look, who would want to live this close to a tram track?
"We are being told by our chartered surveyor and other people the average loss is £30,000 to £40,000 per house," she said.
But NET project director, Chris Deas, said: "We are not aware of evidence being available that establishes that the value of properties alongside the new tram lines will fall.
"Experience from Line One and tram networks elsewhere in the UK suggests the opposite where, over time, houses near the tramlines have held or increased their value better than other local properties."
Long-term residents - though not landlords - have already received £1,500 compensation for the disruption during construction.
No claims can be made within the first  year of operation so the impact can be properly assessed.
