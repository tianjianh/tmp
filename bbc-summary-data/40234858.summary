[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the suspect wielded what appeared to be a firearm during the incident at the U Save shop in Hamilton Road, Rutherglen, at about 09:40.
He demanded money from the staff before running off up Hamilton Road, onto Gallowflat Street.
He is believed to have made off with a "two-figure" sum of money.
Officers are carrying out door-to-door enquiries and gathering CCTV footage.
Det Insp Colin Campbell said: "I am appealing for any information on the suspect or the incident.
"The shop is well used by members of the local community.  I'm sure many people will have been out and about at the time of the incident and may have seen the suspect prior to, or following the incident.
"If you have any information or knowledge about the suspect or the incident, please contact us."
The suspect, who was wearing a balaclava, was white, aged 20-25, about 5ft 11in tall and of medium build.
He was wearing a grey coloured Adidas top, grey coloured tracksuit trousers with black trainers with a white sole.
