Councillors are elected by a simple majority.
Mayors and PCCs are elected by voters marking a first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round and are allocated the second preferences of eliminated candidates.
The new mayor of London is expected to be announced on Friday evening, while Liverpool's mayoral result is expected in the early hours, Salford's on Friday afternoon and Bristol's on Saturday.
Registered electors with postal votes who have not yet sent them back can take them to a polling station.
