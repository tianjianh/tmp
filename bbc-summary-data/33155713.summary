India 'Hitchcock house' becomes macabre Kolkata attraction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A house in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) has turned into a macabre local attraction after police found a man believed to have mental health problems living there with the corpses of his sister and two pet dogs.

The police were alerted to the house when neighbours complained of thick smoke coming out of one of its windows on the evening of 10 June. When they entered the place, they found the charred body of the man's 77-year-old father who had allegedly set himself on fire.
The grisly case has gripped public imagination.
Armed with mobile phone cameras, people have been flocking to take selfies and photographs of 31 Robinson Street in central Kolkata (Calcutta), which has been dubbed "horror house" and "Hitchcock house" by local media.
