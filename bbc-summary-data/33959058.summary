She also congratulated Kezia Dugdale and Alex Rowley on their election as Scottish leadership team.
Ms Murray said many of her friends in the party would "strongly disagree" with her support for Mr Corbyn.
But in a Facebook post, she said that like him she wanted to see a "kinder, more inclusive politics".
"He is criticised for breaking the whip - if he is leader he will have to respect and listen to others who don't agree with him," she added.
"He will need to forge consensus within and outside the Labour Party.
"The macho, confrontational style of British politics alienates so many people who care about the issues but hate the rhetoric."
She also welcomed the appointments of Ms Dugdale and Mr Rowley.
"They are brave to put themselves forward at a difficult time for Scottish Labour. They deserve our support and should not shoulder the blame if we don't form the next Scottish government," she said.
"Being a constructive and effective opposition is probably a much more achievable aim."
