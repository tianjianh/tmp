The fire at Oak Farm in Rugeley, Staffordshire, has been smouldering for almost two weeks.
Residents have complained about having to keep their windows shut due to thick smoke.
Staffordshire Fire Service has now mobilised Mark Andrews, the Chief Fire Officer Association's lead on dealing with waste fires.
Firefighter Rob Barber said he had offered advice about different approaches to try.
"Our primary concern is the safety of the public and the environment and, although we have been proactive in dealing with the situation at Oak Tree Farm, our options have been limited," Mr Barber said.
The fire, involving 1,000 tonnes of waste, started on 5 September.
A controlled burn has been taking place amid fears water supplies could be contaminated.
Public Health England has advised residents to keep windows and doors closed.
Firefighter Tim Hyde said: "We acknowledge the frustrations and concerns of the public but would assure them that the normal techniques we would apply in such circumstances could cause issues for other partners."
Cannock Chase Council's environmental health team is looking at deploying equipment to monitor the air quality in the area.
