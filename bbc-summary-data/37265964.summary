Eileen Younghusband, from Sully, died on Friday night in hospital in Cardiff, at the age of 95.
She was part of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and in later life became an author, writing about her war experience.
In 2012, she was awarded the British Empire Medal for helping to campaign against cuts in adult education.
Following the announcement of her death, First Minister Carwyn Jones tweeted: "Very sad to see that Eileen has died. A lovely lady and a real character. She will be sorely missed."
Born in London, Ms Younghusband worked in the filter room during World War Two, the top secret hub of Britain's air defence, which processed information from coastal radar stations to give air raid warnings and enable the RAF to intercept German bombers.
After D-Day, she was sent to Belgium with a small team of women who used their mathematical skills to locate the mobile launchers for V2 rockets being used to bomb London and Antwerp.
After the war, she spent most of her life in hotels and catering. She moved to Wales in 1984 and became known for her campaigning on health and education issues.
At the age of 87, she completed a degree from the Open University and her autobiography, Not an Ordinary Life, was published the following year in 2009.
At the time, she said: "The girls who worked on that section [WAAF], many of them now nearly 90 years of age, have never felt that the work they did has been recognised, so this is one of the reasons that made me write this book."
She began a series of books and talks about her wartime experiences and her work, One Woman's War, won a People's Book Prize.
Her latest book, Eileen's War, was written for children and was completed and published just weeks before her death.
