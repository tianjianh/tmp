British Summer Time arrives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The clocks have gone forward an hour marking the start of British Summer Time.

The change happened at 1am on Sunday 30 March.
It means you've lost an hour's sleep, but the good news is it'll stay lighter for longer in the evenings so there's more time to go outside.
So with longer days, warmer temperatures and sun on its way (hopefully!) we asked what are you looking forward to this summer?

I am really looking forward to having lots of sleepovers and water fights with my friends and family!

I'm looking forward to going to the sea this summer but I've broken my toe.
Joe, Pembrokeshire
I'm most looking forward to when the movie 'Minions' comes out in cinemas as I think the minions from Despicable Me are extremely funny!
Olivia, Belfast
I am going on holiday in a couple of weeks so I am glad - maybe I'll get to stay at the beach for longer!
