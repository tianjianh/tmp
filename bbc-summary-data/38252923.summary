A consultation on plans for a new hospital to serve residents in north Denbighshire begins on Saturday.

Health officials want to provide additional services next to Rhyl's Royal Alexandra Hospital such as a same day care centre for minor ailments.
They hope it alleviates demands on Glan Clwyd Hospital in nearby Bodelwyddan as well as other community hospitals.
The plans are on show at Rhyl Library on Saturday and the town's White Rose Shopping Centre on Tuesday.
The outline business case has to be approved by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in January before it will be submitted to the Welsh Government.
Work on a new hospital could begin in 2018 should the plans get planning consent and final approval.
