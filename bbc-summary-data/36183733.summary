The Hillsborough club won the regular season with plenty to spare, making them hot favourites for the title.
They duly swept into the final with a 3-1 success against Pembroke in Saturday's semi-final and repeated the scoreline at Havelock Park on Sunday.
In the women's final, Anna O'Flanagan netted twice as Dublin side Hermes beat Ulster's Pegasus 3-1.
Banbridge had reached the men's final courtesy of a shoot-out win over Monkstown,  but found the final hurdle too high for a fourth successive campaign.
Michael Watt gave Garvey the lead in the 11th minute and Bann replied when Stevie Dowds converted from a penalty stroke.
Garvey, though, quickly restored their advantage when Daniel Buser scored into the roof of the net.
The third came when a penalty corner fell for Matthew Nelson to dink over Banbridge keeper Gareth Lennox from close range before half-time.
Anna O'Flanagan and Emma Gray inspired Hermes to their first All-Ireland crown since 2008.
They went into a seventh-minute lead when O'Flanagan beat keeper Sammy-Jo Greer from the left edge of the circle.
Only a couple of minutes later, the striker was through again to unleash another cracking shot for 2-0.
Taite Doherty pulled one back but Pegasus suffered a setback when Steph Thompson got a yellow for a foul on Naomi Carroll.
It helped Hermes to completely control the final 10 minutes and their clinching goal came when Nikki Evans deflected in a shot by Sinead Loughran.
The Dubliners closed out the win, giving them their ninth All-Ireland trophy, following four wins in the Irish Senior Cup and four in the old Club Championships.
