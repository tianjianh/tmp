[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Wight schools see improvement in attendance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Attendance records at Isle of Wight schools have improved, according to the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fewer pupils have missed lessons and preliminary test results show an improvement after changes were made following a critical Ofsted report.
In June last year Ofsted called children's services "ineffective", so the government initiated a partnership with Hampshire County Council.
SATs results for Year Six pupils have also improved compared to last year.
In June 2013 Ofsted reported pupils' progress between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 was the lowest in the country and attainment was significantly below the national average in English and mathematics.
"Local authority arrangements for supporting school improvement are ineffective," it concluded.
The council entered a partnership with Hampshire County Council from July 2013 to manage children's services.

In June this year attendance at primary schools was 96%, up from 94.9% in the same month last year.
Over the same period attendance at secondary schools rose from 92.5% to 94%.
The council attributed the improvements to better support for pupils and families and a government ban on absence except under "exceptional circumstances".
Richard Priest, executive member for children's services at Isle of Wight Council, said: "There has been a lot of hard work behind the scenes between various council departments and schools, and the results are now being realised."
Early data shows the figure for those achieving level 4 SATs at Key Stage 2 in reading, writing and mathematics rose from 72% last year to 75%, just one per cent lower than the figure for England.
The island was placed 131 out of 152 local authorities for the results in England for the last academic year.
Full results will be published in September.
