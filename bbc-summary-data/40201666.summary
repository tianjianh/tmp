The 22-year-old, who scored 16 goals for the League Two Robins last season, has signed a three-year contract.
He started his career at Crewe and has made 93 appearances since joining Cheltenham in July 2015.
"He was a key target for us and we feel he will provide a good balance to the other strikers we have at the club," said Northampton boss Justin Edinburgh.
