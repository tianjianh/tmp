A spoof bid to host the football World Cup in 2026 has been launched by non-league club Macclesfield Town.

It predicted the Cheshire town could provide the tournament at "a total cost of £249.99" ($382.30) following Fifa's current woes with corruption claims.
The bid boasts a 6,335-capacity stadium for the opening ceremony, an average June temperature at "a whopping 14.1°C" and free Wi-Fi in the local library.
Fifa is due to select the host nation for the 2026 tournament in 2017.
The Macclesfield bid proposes to host matches at various playing fields across the town, the biggest of which has a capacity for "200 people and 14 dogs".
Training pitches would be available for participating nations but organisers stressed each association must ensure they are "clear of dog foul prior to the start of each session".
"According to Trip Advisor there are up to six hotels in Macclesfield, as well as 16 B&Bs. More than adequate for a World Cup," the club added.
"A budget of £40 has also been set aside for gifts to the FIFA family."
Local resident David Dickinson, best known for presenting TV antique shows and catchphrases such as "cheap as chips", would be on hand to officiate at the opening and closing ceremonies with current Macclesfield Town manager John Askey, according to the bid.
James Beckett, media manager at Macclesfield Town, told BBC Radio Manchester that the spoof proposal had received feedback from Japan and New Zealand after details spread on social media.
"When we finished putting the bid together, it was probably more credible than the Qatar bid.
"We've got a special promotion that anybody who buys a season ticket is going to get special access to [World Cup] tickets if the bid is successful."
