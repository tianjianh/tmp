Police are investigating whether a fire attack on a house in North Lanarkshire is linked to a brawl at a crematorium.

No-one was injured in the blaze, in Wishaw, on Sunday night.
Police want to trace two men who were seen running from the area. They are also examining whether a car, found burned out nearby, was involved.
Officers are not ruling out a link between the fire on Wishaw Road and a fight at Daldowie Crematorium on Thursday in which two men were injured.
The two mourners sustained serious facial injuries in the disturbance, which broke out at the crematorium, off the M74, near Uddingston, at about 12:30 on Thursday.
A 56-year-old man has since been arrested in connection with the incident.
No-one was injured in Sunday's blaze, which a joint investigation by Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded was deliberately started.
Police "refused to rule out" suggestions that the two incidents were linked.
Det Insp Kenny Dalrymple said: "Although we believe this to be a targeted attack, this doesn't make it any less serious.
"Thankfully no-one was injured, however the consequences could have been much worse.
"These locations would have been busy on Sunday evening, and I would urge anyone with information to come forward."
The detective said he wanted to "trace two men who were seen running from the area in Wishaw Road and entering a silver-coloured car around the time the fire was set".
"A short time later a Volkswagen Passat was found burnt out on the A71, Lanark Road near to the Larkhall junction of the M74," he said.
"Inquiries are ongoing to establish if this vehicle is linked to the fire."
Det Dalrymple added: "Officers are currently studying CCTV images in an effort to gather more information on this crime, the vehicle involved and the car that was found burnt out.
"Anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem should contact detectives.
"I would also ask any drivers who were on Wishaw Road or Lanark Road between 1800 and 1900hrs on Sunday evening, who have dashcam footage, to contact officers, as they may have information that will assist our investigation."
