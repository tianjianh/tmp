The black and white photo, which shows the Queen smiling, was taken in March.
She is pictured wearing pearls, and a dress by Angela Kelly, who has served as personal assistant and senior dresser to her since 2002.
Bailey has previously snapped celebrities such as Mick Jagger, and criminals Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
The Queen celebrates her actual birthday on 21 April, and her official birthday on a Saturday in June, which this year falls on 14 June in the UK.
The photograph, taken at Buckingham Palace, was commissioned on behalf of the government's "Great" campaign, which aims to promote trade, tourism, investment and education throughout the UK.
Over the course of his career, Bailey - who was appointed a CBE by the Queen in 2001 for services to art - has taken pictures of The Beatles, Diana, Princess of Wales and models Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss.
The photographer, who grew up in the east end of London, made his name working for Vogue magazine in the 1960s and has also photographed actors Jack Nicholson, Sir Michael Caine and Johnny Depp.
The 76-year-old said: "I've always been a huge fan of the Queen. She has very kind eyes with a mischievous glint. I've always liked strong women, and she is a very strong woman."
Recently-appointed culture secretary Sajid Javid said the portrait would help to support the aims of the campaign, which he said was to "showcase everything that is great about the UK to an international audience".
Fellow photographer Andy Fallon described the portrait as "classic Bailey... it's right back to the types of stuff he was doing in the 60s."
The country's royal heritage is a big attraction for overseas tourists, according to Visit Britain.
Great" campaign director Conrad Bird said the campaign had delivered economic returns worth more than Â£500m to the economy.
