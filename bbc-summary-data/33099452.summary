Demolition of Northampton Saints stand begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Demolition work on a spectator stand has begun at the home of Northampton Saints rugby club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sturtridge Pavilion will be replaced by the Barwell Stand, a move which will increase the capacity of Franklin's Gardens by 1,900 to accommodate more than 15,500 people.
The all-seater stand will include a new hospitality suite, members' bar and improved disability access.
It will be built in time for next season.
The Sturtridge Pavilion has been a feature at the ground for 50 years but the club is keen to expand its revenue from match days after operating at an average of 98% capacity during the past five Premiership seasons.
The new stand also opens up the possibility of Saints hosting a European Champions Cup quarter-final.
To do that, rules state the ground requires a minimum capacity of 15,000.
