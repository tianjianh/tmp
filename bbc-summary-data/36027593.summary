[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glenavy farmer given suspended sentence for 'horrendous' animal cruelty case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer, who was the subject of the biggest ever herd seizure in Northern Ireland, has been given a suspended sentence for animal cruelty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Steele, 46, of Gobrana Road, Glenavy, County Antrim heard a judge say he was "shocked" by the state of animals on his farm.
Steele had pleaded guilty to six counts of causing unnecessary suffering to livestock on his land last spring.
He received a five-month prison sentence, suspended for three years.
Steele was also banned from keeping animals for five years.
The court had heard that inspectors found dead and dying cattle on his farm.
Some of the sick ones had to be put down.
Steele's solicitor told the court that his ability to cope on the farm had been compromised after the breakdown of his marriage.
His wife "had been the glue that held the farm business together", he said.
The court was told he had gone from owning a herd of hundreds of cattle, and assets worth Â£1m to Â£2m, to a man who had virtually nothing.
Officials from the Department of Agriculture seized 153 animals from Steele's farm in January, after a conviction in a separate cruelty case.
Vets had to put down 18 of the animals.
The court heard that when inspectors went to the farm between April and June 2015, they found dead animals in sheds with live ones.
They also found animals that had been injured during calving and given no veterinary help, while others had no access to water.
Danny Gray, the Department of Agriculture's head of veterinary enforcement, said it had been a "horrendous welfare case".
"There were animals that hadn't had feed or water for days, possibly weeks.
"There were animals who had died out in the field trying to give birth and hadn't been given veterinary attention.
"There were other animals lying dead in sheds which had no access to feed, there were other animals in the sheds stepping out over the top of the animals that were lying in the mud."
Mr Gray said welfare conditions on most farms were very good, but on occasion they had to step in to seize animals as had been done in this case.
