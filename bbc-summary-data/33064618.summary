[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Morrison, 31, who had served with the British Army in the Middle East, was stabbed in the leg by Kristian Nelson.
Nelson, 37, originally accused of murdering Mr Morrison, admitted a reduced charge of killing his victim.
He admitted striking him on the leg with a knife at Dumbryden Gardens, in Edinburgh, on August 22 last year.
Police followed a trail of blood from Mr Morrison to his attacker's Wester Hailes home.
A judge told Nelson at the High Court in Edinburgh he had had the chance to throw the knife away but deliberately used it to stab his victim.
Lord Glennie said: "You have an unenviable record, including two offences of assault to injury or severe injury and one assault with a hammer.
"This time it was a knife and the consequences were fatal."
The judge told Nelson he would have jailed him for 10 years, but for his earlier guilty plea to culpable homicide.
Nelson's co-accused Colin Craig, 46, from Edinburgh, had also originally faced a charge of murdering Mr Morrison but the Crown earlier accepted his guilty plea to assault.
Craig tripped Mr Morrison, who fell to the ground, after he tried to run away following a confrontation with Nelson.
He also dumped the knife used to kill the victim along with a bloodstained jumper in a canal. The judge deferred sentence on Craig for a year.
Advocate depute Steven Borthwick told the court Mr Morrison, an only child who had a young daughter, left the Army in 2011 after six years service.
The prosecutor said: "The extent to which the accused and the now deceased knew one another is not entirely clear. The motive for the attack which led to the death of Robbie Morrison is not known."
He added: "There is some information to suggest that the now deceased owed a debt to a third party and the at the confrontation between Robbie Morrison and the accused arose as a result of that debt."
