Barry Manilow, Elvis Costello and Jamiroquai will perform at the Oslo event on 11 December - one day after the prize-giving ceremony.
AR Rahman, Florence and the Machine and Herbie Hancock are also on the bill.
This year's concert will honour jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2010 prize.
The 54-year-old received an 11-year sentence last year for "inciting subversion" after drafting a charter calling for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China.
It is doubtful whether the prize will be handed out this year as China may not allow Mr Liu's family to attend the ceremony.
According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, its prestigious award can only be collected by the laureate in person or by close family members.
Swedish chart-topper Robyn, US singer Colbie Caillat and soul star India.Arie will also perform at the concert, an annual event since 1994.
Will Smith, Tom Cruise and Sir Michael Caine are among those who have hosted the concert in previous years.
