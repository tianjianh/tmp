The unnamed resident died shortly after being injured at Serendipity Care Home in Urmston, Greater Manchester.
Greater Manchester Police and the Health and Safety Executive have launched inquiries.
Families of residents met with managers and the Care Quality Commission to address concerns following the man's death on 30 January.
Det Ch Insp Paul Parker said it would take "some time to establish what caused the lift to collapse".
A spokesperson for Trafford Council said it was helping police in their investigation "as well as supporting the home to manage the needs of the residents during this difficult time".
