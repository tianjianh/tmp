[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamaican Commonwealth Games gold medallist Jason Livermore has tested positive for a banned substance, the country's anti-doping disciplinary panel says.

Livermore, 29, won 4x100m gold - with Usain Bolt, Kemar Bailey-Cole and Nickel Ashmeade - and individual 200m bronze at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
He returned the positive result - for an unnamed substance - in an out-of-competition test in December.
A full hearing is set for 11 September.
Following a preliminary hearing on Friday, Kent Gammon, chairman of the independent three-member panel, said Livermore had violated the rules of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco).
Jadco is a separate body to the anti-doping disciplinary panel, but will be represented at September's hearing.
Livermore is not part of the Jamaica squad for next month's World Athletics Championships in London.
