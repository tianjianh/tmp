Police sent to incident at Tesco store in Glasgow rather than Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police sent to investigate an incident at a supermarket were dispatched in the wrong city more than 140 miles away.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A door had been damaged at Tesco in Aberdeen's Great Western Road, but officers were instead sent to Glasgow's Great Western Road Tesco store.
More than three hours after the initial call on 3 April, officers were sent to the correct store.
The closure of the Police Scotland control room and call centre in Aberdeen happened last month.
Non emergency calls are now handled at centres in Glasgow, Motherwell and Midlothian.
And emergency calls are passed via central service centre responders to the North Area Control Room in Dundee for dispatch.
Supt Matt Richards, of Police Scotland's Contact Command Control Division, said: "A call was received at around 5.30am in relation to damage caused to a door on Great Western Road which had taken place overnight.
"The call was graded appropriately based on the initial information provided and allocated to officers.
"After receiving further information about the location of the store, officers in Aberdeen were in attendance by 8.50am that morning.
"Enquiries into the incident are currently ongoing."
The Scottish Police Authority previously said Aberdeen's emergency control room would only be closed when it was safe to do so.
The move is part of Police Scotland's cost-cutting plan to centralise control rooms.
