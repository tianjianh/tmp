On Wednesday, Joshua, who has a terminal brain tumour, was named on Dale's bench for their Checkatrade Trophy tie at Hartlepool.
He was unable to make the match at Northern Gas and Power Stadium because of his illness.
However, the League One side printed a shirt with his name and number on and presented it to him the next day.
Rochdale boss Keith Hill said Joshua's story had 'touched the hearts' of everyone at the club after the team first met him in February.
"The accolade follows on from the traditional monthly manager and player of the month divisional award winners announced," said a statement.
"And will see a special trophy produced and sent to the club for them to pass on to their youngest-ever signing."
