Southport 2-1 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louis Almond scored twice - including a late winner - as Southport came from behind to beat Woking 2-1 in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennon Lewis put the Cards ahead, collecting the ball in the box to strike low and hard past Tyrell Belford in the 13th minute.
But the lead did not last long as the hosts scored their first goal of the season to level six minutes later.
Striker Almond was fouled inside the box and he picked himself up to send Michael Poke the wrong way from the penalty spot.
The game looked to be heading for a draw until Almond found space inside the area two minutes from time to fire home and give his side their first points of the season following successive 3-0 defeats.
