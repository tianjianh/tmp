[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 0-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emyr Huws scored a late goal to give Ipswich Town a dramatic victory at Aston Villa and end their five-match winless run in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The on-loan Cardiff midfielder turned home David McGoldrick's cross for his first goal for Town to leave Steve Bruce's Villa winless in eight.
Huws' effort came moments after McGoldrick had cleared a header from Villa forward Scott Hogan off the line.
Villa's Birkir Bjarnason earlier hit the crossbar in the first half.
The defeat was Villa's first at home this season and they slipped to 16th in the table.
McGoldrick tried to double the away lead, but although his ambitious curling effort went just over the bar, Ipswich held on for their first league victory over Villa since March 1994, and climbed to 13th.
Bruce gave Neil Taylor, Conor Hourihane, Hogan and Bjarnason home debuts and Hourihane tested Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski early on.
But after a goalless first half, Ipswich improved, with Jordan Spence just wide from a set-piece before McGoldrick cut in from the left to slide a low ball into the middle which Huws finished off.
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:
"It's tough at the minute. We certainly didn't deserve to lose. We had some really good opportunities and didn't take them.
"Once again we made one mistake and we were punished. Hopefully we have fallen as far as we can because the next few games are going to be important.
"It is time to batten down the hatches and face the flak. But we need to take some of the chances we are creating.
"The Ipswich goal was an individual mistake. Unfortunately every time we make a mistake we are punished. We now have to find some form to get a win to restore the confidence in the team."
Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy:
"It was a great win. I have never doubted the character of the team.
"We have always been good at disrupting teams and regaining the ball, as we proved against Villa.
"Huws has made a real difference to the team since he joined us from Cardiff. He wants to play and he took a cut in wages to play football. That tells you a lot about him as there are not too many players who would do that.
"The win is a big boost for me, the team, the club and Marcus Evans, who gets plenty of flak despite sticking in Â£6m a year to keep the club going."
