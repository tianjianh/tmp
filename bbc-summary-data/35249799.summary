The 22-year-old was found dead at a private property in the Forres area of Scotland on Saturday, 2 January after celebrating the New Year with friends.
His cause of death remains unexplained and Police Scotland told the BBC there are no suspicious circumstances.
The Mirror claims Hobden and other guests were star-gazing on the roof.
It said one line of police inquiry was that Hobden fell asleep and became disorientated when he woke, before he fell to his death.
Post-mortem tests have taken place and a file has been passed to the Procurator Fiscal.
The right-arm pace bowler's family said they were "deeply saddened" by his death.
Hobden made his first-class debut in 2014 and represented Sussex in all formats of the game.
On Wednesday, it was announced former Warwickshire fast bowler Tom Allin had died at the age of 28. He was found at the base of a bridge in north Devon.
