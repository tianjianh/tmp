[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Premiership's joint-record try scorer Tom Varndell has signed a new contract with Bristol until the end of the 2017-18 season.

The 31-year-old winger, who equalled Mark Cueto's 90 Premiership tries on 1 January, joined the club in 2015.
He has crossed 26 times in 37 appearances in all competitions for the club so far, helping them win promotion back to the top flight last season.
The former Leicester Tigers and Wasps man has won four senior England caps.
"I'm enjoying my rugby and the attacking brand that we are trying to play, it suits my game," Varndell told Bristol's club website.
"I'm settled in the city and there is a great spirit among the squad which is translating into our performances on the pitch in the Premiership right now."
Interim head coach Mark Tainton added: "When he is at his best, Tom is one of the most dangerous players in the league - he's a major asset.
"Tom wants to break that Premiership try-scoring record and he wants to help establish Bristol as a top-flight club.
"The key for Tom now - as a senior player in our group - is to lead the way with his performances."
Bristol are bottom of the table after 13 league games, one point behind 11th-placed Worcester Warriors.
