[SN]TITLE[SN]
Trains passed over an unsupported rail near Bradford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three trains passed over a dangerous piece of track in West Yorkshire, a report says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incidents happened at Baildon, near Bradford, last June, when flood water washed away part of the embankment leaving a rail unsupported.
A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) report said members of the public reported the problem but it was not acted on quickly enough.
Network Rail has been told to improve its safety procedures.
Although no trains were derailed and no one was injured, the RAIB described what had happened as a "near-miss" incident.
The report said two members of the public contacted the emergency services saying that between three and four metres of track was left unsupported following a rain storm.
Both the police and fire service passed the calls on to Network Rail.
Two trains passed over the damaged area between 16:29 and 17:58 GMT on 7 June.
Services were finally stopped after a driver spotted the washout as his train passed over it and made an emergency call to a signaller.
The RAIB recommended that Network Rail should take "measures to minimise the risk of further washouts at Baildon" and take action on "improving the emergency response to incidents on the track by providing Network Rail responders with accurate location information".
