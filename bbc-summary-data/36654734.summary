Wada suspends Kazakhstan's anti-doping laboratory for four months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kazakhstan's anti-doping laboratory in Almaty has been suspended by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) for four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ban was imposed because it fails to comply with international standards.
Almaty is the seventh laboratory to be sanctioned by Wada in recent months.
Rio, Madrid, Bloemfontein, Beijing and Lisbon have also been suspended from Wada-related activities, while Moscow's laboratory had its accreditation revoked in April.
On 15 June it was announced that four London 2012 Olympic weightlifting champions from Kazakhstan tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.
The International Weightlifting Federation has said Kazakhstan's weightlifting team could be banned from the Rio Olympics for anti-doping violations.
Almaty's suspension took effect on 24 June and prohibits the laboratory from carrying out all anti-doping analyses on urine and blood samples.
The lab may appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within 21 days of receipt of notice.
It can apply for reinstatement at the end of the suspension, if it meets the requirements set out by Wada's disciplinary committee.
