[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reading 1-1 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County missed the chance to secure a second win since Chris Powell took temporary charge as Reading grabbed a late equaliser.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matej Vydra blasted Derby ahead as Cyrus Christie's free-kick hit the Reading wall and fell into his path.
Vydra had a header well saved by Ali Al-Habsi soon after in a game of few clear-cut chances.
George Evans hammered home from six yards in the final minute after Roy Beerens' corner was not cleared.
Former Charlton boss Powell, who served as Nigel Pearson's number two at Derby, has taken over after the manager was suspended pending a club investigation into his behaviour.
He saw his side almost go behind in first-half stoppage time as Yann Kermogant's powerful header was well saved by Scott Carson.
But Vydra scored for the first time since moving to Derby for a club-record fee at the end of August, flicking home after Christie's poor free-kick.
Had Vydra converted his header 12 minutes later, Powell would have been celebrating a perfect record in charge of Derby, having won at Cardiff on Tuesday.
But Evans capitalised after the away defence made a mess of clearing Beerens' corner.
The Rams, who have won only once in their past 10 games, are two points above the relegation zone, while Reading are eighth.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"I was happy with a point at the end. We knew that we would have to be patient and we were patient.
"After going 1-0 down, it was very difficult to get back into the game because we knew Derby would be dropping back even more and waiting for the counter-attack to score a second goal.
"We had to be aware of that and eventually we scored the equaliser, which I think we deserved. I was happy with that.
"We've shown before that we can come back. We're making good progress, I'm sure of that. It's not easy to build a team in three months."
Derby caretaker manager Chris Powell:
"It's been a good week for us in light of what has gone on.
"Yes, it's been a turbulent week. But I will give the players all the credit in the world for how they've responded.
"We've got around the players, we've cajoled them, we've kept their spirits up. Their morale has been first class."
On the future of the managerial situation at the club: "I've had no indications from the chairman about my future.
"My future was take the game on Tuesday and then prepare for today. And that was it.
"Now we have an international break. I'm sure the club will decide what way to go in the next week or two."
