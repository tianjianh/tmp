Substitute Harry Forrester's late strike gave Rangers victory over St Mirren and stretched their lead to 11 points at the top of the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenny Miller missed from three yards in a stodgy, goalless first half and the home side laboured after the break.
With four minutes remaining though Forrester curled a shot past Buddies goalkeeper Jamie Langfield.
With second-placed Hibernian losing at Dumbarton, Rangers are in a commanding position in the title race.
Miller, 36, back in the starting line-up along with midfielder Nicky Law, had Rangers' first real effort on goal in the ninth minute when he curled a shot from the edge of the box just past the post after good set-up play by Michael O'Halloran.
The Buddies' organisation and assuredness was providing a problem for the home side, but they should have taken the lead before the break after Miller blasted over from another penetrating run from O'Halloran.
The Ibrox side stepped up the pressure in the second half but faced a red-shirted wall of St Mirren defenders who dropped deeper while remaining organised and resolute.
In the 67th minute, after St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan had clattered Billy King 25 yards from goal, James Tavernier's free-kick was heading for the top corner before Langfield pushed it round the post for a corner, which was again defended.
Forrester replaced Holt three minutes later before Miller slashed a volley over the bar from 16 yards to more groans from the home support.
In the final, frantic stages, Langfield saved another free-kick from Tavernier which was sneaking in at the far post, but could do nothing to halt Forrester's strike from inside the box.
