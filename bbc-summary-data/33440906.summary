The new movie is to be directed by Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, the men behind the hugely successful Lego movie.
The criminal turned Rebellion hero returns in Star Wars' next instalment: The Force Awakens, this Christmas.
Actor Harrison Ford last played Solo in 1983's Return of the Jedi.
No details or castings have yet been announced but the Hollywood Reporter said the script would be written by father and son team Lawrence and Jon Kasdan.
Lawrence Kasdan co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, the latter with director JJ Abrams.
The untitled Han Solo project is scheduled to be released on 25 May 2018.
