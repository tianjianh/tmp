Poole-Channel Island ferries: Christmas storm warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fast ferry sailings between the Channel Islands and Poole in the run up to Christmas could be cancelled due to stormy weather.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Condor Ferries has warned of a "prolonged period of stormy weather" on 19, 21, 22 and 23 December.
The firm said it would "make every effort to operate sailings", but the conditions in the English Channel could be outside its operating limits.
Its conventional ferry is still expected to operate as scheduled.
However, the company has warned it is "heavily booked" on those services so not all those currently booked to travel on the fast ferry could be transferred.
It has advised passengers "whose travel is essential" to consider transferring to earlier services.
