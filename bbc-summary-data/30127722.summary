[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation into how a small plane narrowly avoided two men and then struck a bungalow on a farm in Lincolnshire is continuing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash happened outside Castle Bytham, south of Grantham, on Wednesday afternoon.
The 73-year-old pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, is being treated for back and leg injuries.
A 52-year-old tanker driver was treated for minor injuries and the 61-year-old occupant of the property was unhurt.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has said it is aware of the incident and is making inquiries.
Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue said the man who lives in the bungalow was in the garden and pushed the tanker driver out of the way, to prevent them both being hit.
The pilot became stuck in the plane, which was embedded in the building, and the aircraft's landing gear broke off and landed on a bed.
A police guard remains in place at the bungalow while recovery work is carried out.
Pete Wiles, from the fire service, said: "If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit.
"It's a fairly miraculous escape... there's an overhead power line nearby which it missed as well."
