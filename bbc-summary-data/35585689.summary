New map to help find way around planet Mars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ever wondered how you'd find your way around Mars if you were there? Well a brand new map of the red planet's been made which might just help...

Mapping agency Ordnance Survey - who usually make maps of the UK - have now made one of Mars, using information from Nasa and showing in detail how high and low different parts of the ground are there.
A special version's been given to a British scientist helping to plan the landing of a rover on Mars in 2019.
The map covers roughly 3.8 million square miles of the planet - that's about a tenth of the total Martian surface.
Chris Wesson, one of the people who made the map, says he could imagine a future astronaut using a copy of the map when exploring Mars.
"You have these large areas that looked flat but they're actually really rocky and uneven surfaces - that was the most difficult bit of the map, to try to show that but put it in proportion to these huge craters," he said.
