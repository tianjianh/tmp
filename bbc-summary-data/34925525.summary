The 19-year-old has made 13 league appearances for Phil Parkinson's side so far, scoring once.
He briefly went back to the Premier League club for treatment on a knee problem, but now returns to Yorkshire.
"We are very pleased Reece is remaining with us. We are going to need everyone over this busy Christmas period," City boss Parkinson told the club website.
