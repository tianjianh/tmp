Mohammed Yousaf was pronounced dead at his home on Granville Road, Accrington, on Wednesday after he was found with serious head injuries.
Police are urging residents to look out for a potential weapon that may have been discarded nearby after the attack.
Muhammed Arif, 44, of Washington Street, Accrington, has been charged with murder.
Det Supt Withers said: "Maybe you saw something or somebody in the area that seemed suspicious in the days before 21 September, or maybe you heard someone discussing Mr Yousaf's death.
"If you have any information - no matter how small - we would urge you to get in touch with us.
"We are also still trying to trace the weapon used and are looking into the possibility that it may have been discarded following the incident."
He added: "We would ask that all residents in the vicinity of Granville Road check gardens and land for anything suspicious."
