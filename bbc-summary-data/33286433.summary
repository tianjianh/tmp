[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrexham prisoner Gary Douglass died in custody

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has reached a narrative conclusion at the inquest of a Wrexham man who died in custody after stabbing himself in the stomach 10 days earlier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They said they could not be certain Gary Douglass, 20, had intended to kill himself with the knife when police tried to detain him in Wrexham in 2013.
Mr Douglass received surgery but died two days after being released from hospital on 10 October.
He died from internal bleeding.
The inquest, which has been sitting for a week in Ruthin, Denbighshire, had been told Mr Douglass, from Llay, suffered from Asperger's syndrome, which led to him becoming obsessed with knives.
On the night he stabbed himself, on 2 October, Mr Douglass had taken the drug MCAT (Mephedrone).
After allegedly making threats at a house in Wrexham, he came across two students, allegedly attacking 19-year-old Sean Doyle and stabbing him in the torso.
Police found Mr Douglass in Crispin Lane, near the Glyndwr University campus, where he inflicted superficial cuts to his own throat.
He then stabbed himself so violently in the abdomen the blade almost reached his spine.
An independent expert witness told jurors that doctors at Wrexham Maelor Hospital saved Mr Douglass and he recovered quickly, being fit enough for release by 10 October.
He appeared before magistrates the next day and was later remanded to Liverpool's Altcourse prison where he became ill the next day.
He died on the evening of 12 October in the operating theatre at the Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, as surgeons tried to stop the internal bleeding.
The jury was told he died of a haemorrhage caused by an infection weakening part of the aorta, which had been operated on following the self-inflicted stab wound.
The coroner John Gittins said no evidence had been presented to show any pressure was placed on medical staff to release him into police custody sooner than appropriate.
Mr Gittins told the jury they could reach one of three possible conclusions: suicide, misadventure or a narrative conclusion.
In giving their conclusion, the jury said that,  while Mr Douglass had stabbed himself and it was "more likely than not he intended to take his own life", they could not, "beyond reasonable doubt, confirm the intent of suicide".
