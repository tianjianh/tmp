Smite pro-gamer: 'Sacrifice' of being top UK e-sportsman

"There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games," Ernest Hemingway is believed to have said.

But an estimated 71 million viewers a year disagree when it comes to e-sports - or competitive video gaming.
Nate "Ataraxia" Mark, of Llanberis, Gwynedd, was Britain's top-earning professional gamer in 2015, winning about £80,000 of prize money in the last year.
The BBC spoke to the 23-year-old to find out about the pleasure, the pain and the pressure of "living the dream".
"There are some downsides to it but, in general, you have got to count your lucky stars," said Mark, who is captain of the five-strong Titan team.
In January, Titan won $500,000 (£335,000) after finishing second at the 2015 World Championships for Smite - a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with professional leagues and tournaments run by maker Hi-Rez Studios.
"Growing up, I played video games, but to actually turn it into a career, however short-lived it may or may not be, is basically the dream," Mark said.
The idea of earning your living by travelling the world and playing video games in front of arenas packed with howling fans sounds, especially to younger ears, like a fantasy.
But the move into e-sports is not without its challenges.
"I'm not going to lie, my university [education] really suffered," Mark said. "It's quite a sacrifice. I decided this is what I want to do and ended up dropping out over it."
Mark, who quit his psychology degree at Liverpool University, now spends up to four hours a day practising with his team mates in the run up to big tournaments.
Smite involves players in two teams taking control of gods or mythological figures which battle it out in arena combat, using powers and heavily drilled tactics.
The level of professionalism is extremely high, with coaches recruited to help teams maximise their performance.
"It's very intensive. You can't completely lose your love of video games but, at some point, you're doing that much and it's all about winning, you can lose some of the fun."
But Mark still plays for pleasure with his brother, Daemon - against whom he sharpened his "mean competitive streak" on Nintendo games like Goldeneye and Super Smash Bros while growing up.
"We were really competitive with each other. I was a really sore loser growing up," he added.

The popularity of e-sports is growing exponentially.
The 2014 World Championships final for another professional MOBA game, the hugely popular League of Legends, was watched on TV and online by an estimated global audience of 27 million.
BBC Three screened this year's championships in October - the corporation's first live streaming of an e-gaming contest.
Top players can earn million-dollar salaries and specialist streaming platforms, such as Twitch, have tens of millions of visitors a month.
Mark is 252nd in the table of all-time top-earning pro-gamers worldwide, with top dog Peter Dager believed to have won more than $2m (£1.33m).
About 2,700 fans packed into Atlanta's Cobb Energy Centre for January's Smite World Championship, which had a prize pot of $2.6m (£1.73m), with 2.3 million people watching via Twitch TV.
However, some people still denigrate pro-gaming as something that's just for "geeks" in school, Mark said.
"People can be really undermining, as if video games are just some outlet for fun, but there is a lot of work, there's a lot of preparation.
"You do have to sacrifice a lot. Not everyone can make a living out of it, you have to practice in the early evening and late at night.
"If all of my friends go to the cinema or go out drinking - I have missed a lot of that because I have to practice."
He added: "You don't get a lot of free time. It's very anti-social just because to win you have to practice. It's very much, if you don't win or play well then the income is going to be really, really little."
With such intense pressure and suggestions that deteriorating reaction times make pro-gaming careers as short as four years, what do Mark's family think about the precarious nature of his chosen profession?
"My mum is very relaxed about this kind of stuff, which I'm really, really thankful for," he explained.
And with some players in their early teens pocketing winnings cheques worth thousands, the temptation for youngsters to snub their careers adviser at all costs is tantalising.
Mark hopes to remain in e-sports in some capacity whenever his professional gaming career ends and he has already done some work as an analyst.
He believes it is only a matter of time before e-sports becomes a mainstream attraction in the UK.
"A lot of countries have already embraced it. I think the UK will be late to adopt it because we love our football so much. But you see countries like South Korea which have e-sports on TV. I definitely see it moving on to TV (in the UK)."
