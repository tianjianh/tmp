The discovery of the body in Northampton is being linked to the disappearance of Adeyemi Olugbuyi, 32, known as "Big Man", in September 2013.
Nigerian Mr Olugbuyi, who was last seen in North Holme Court, Thorplands, had been involved in an "altercation" in the area.
Police said officers were treating the death as murder.
Known as "Baz" or "Big Man", he is believed to have been involved in an altercation in the area just after 08:00 BST on 13 September.

Since that time, he has not been in any contact with family or friends.
A police spokesman said: "Investigators believe the body is likely to have been there for some considerable amount of time, possibly months or years."
Police said formal identification had yet to take place.
Officers have been searching green areas around Billing Brook Road, where the body was found, and were using a dog unit at the scene.
