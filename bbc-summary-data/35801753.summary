The 26-year-old, part of the Proteas' World Twenty20 squad in India, will cover for Umar Akmal, who will leave to play in the Caribbean Premier League.
Elite performance director Andrew McDonald said: "Rilee is a powerful batsman and having another left-hander in our batting line-up will be useful.
"He will be a fantastic addition, in terms of talent and temperament."
Rossouw has hit two centuries for South Africa in one-day internationals - including an innings of 132 off 98 balls against West Indies last year.
His first game for the Foxes will be at home against Derbyshire on Friday, 8 July.
