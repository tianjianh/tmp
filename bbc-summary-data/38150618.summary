The PSNI twice came from behind to level at Seaview before David Cushley's second goal and a late Paul Heatley effort sealed the Crues' win.
Andrew Waterworth and Paul Smyth both hit two goals in Linfield's victory.
Kirk Millar and Mark Haughey were also on target for the Blues.
After his late winner at Dungannon on Saturday, ex-Ballymena United man Cushley put Crusaders ahead in the sixth minute at Seaview after good work by Michael Carvill but Owen Moody levelled on 42 after Sean O'Neill had parried a Lukasz Adamczyk effort.
Carvill nodded the Crues back into the lead before the break but Paul McDowell levelled again on 52 after a superb ball from Andrew Blackledge.
The PSNI held out until 10 minutes from time with Gavin Whyte hitting their woodwork but the Crues pressure eventually yielded Cushley's second goal of the night on 80 minutes and Heatley added a further goal in injury-time.
Goals from Waterworth had Linfield in control at 2-0 up after only 15 minutes at Windsor Park as he tapped in a Chris Casement cross before outpacing the Ards defence four minutes later.
Smyth extended the advantage to 3-0 on 18 minutes after a Niall Quinn cross and Millar chipped in the fourth on 31, although it appeared to take a slight deflection.
Ards improved after the break but their penalty appeared a soft award after Gareth Tommons and substitute Joe McKinney both tumbled in the area, with Michael Ruddy slotting the spot-kick.
Kyle Cherry and Guillaume Keke (twice) went close to pulling another goal back for Ards but Haughey headed in Linfield's fifth on 79 before Smyth completed the scoring six minutes later.
Meanwhile, Warrenpoint Town defeated Glenavon 3-1 at Mourneview Park to book their place in the final of the Mid-Ulster Cup.
The Championship leaders will meet the winners of Wednesday's second semi-final between Armagh City and Loughgall.
Stephen Murray scored Town's opener midway through the first half and a minute later Warrenpoint doubled their lead when John McGuigan headed into the top corner.
Declan O'Brien bundled a Guy Bates cross over the line to pull one back in the 31st minute, but McGuigan ensured Town's passage with the help of a deflection off David Elebert on the hour.
Elebert was twice denied by superb goal-line clearances from Point captain Stephen Moan as Matthew Tipton's side held out.
