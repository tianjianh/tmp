[SN]TITLE[SN]
London Midland leaf-fall timetable services reinstated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rail operator which cut trains from its autumn timetable has reinstated some services after passengers complained.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London Midland had reduced the number of stops on its Cross City line between Longbridge and Redditch.
But after reports of delays and overcrowding, stops on its morning services were reintroduced.
The firm said it had received lots of "constructive feedback" in response to the new timetable.
However, some passengers said the changes, which have seen the 0732 and 0812 trains from Selly Oak to Lichfield call at Longbridge, Northfield, Kings Norton and Bournville, did not go far enough.
Commuter Chris Ivans said: "They reinstated a train which has relieved a lot of the pressure in the morning but in the evenings it's certainly just as bad as they've been."
London Midland said the number of station stops had been reduced because driving conditions were most hazardous when braking and pulling away from stations.
Travelling at a slower speed and calling at all stations could cause delays and lead to further disruption., the firm said.
Head of Cross City Services, David Whitley said "It's important to listen to customers and get the balance right.
"These changes will reduce crowding on board and minimise delays at stations as people get on and off the trains.
