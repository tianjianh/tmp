Christian Pay, 18, of Millom, Cumbria, died following "substance abuse" at the Kendal Calling music festival.
Eight other music fans have been treated in hospital, including a Lancashire woman, 20, and a man from Manchester, 30, who is critically ill.
Four others are "serious but stable". A man and a woman have been discharged.
The family of Mr Pay said he was a "fun guy".
His mother said in a statement: "Christian was small in stature but had the heart of a lion and enough personality for everyone.
"He was studying motor vehicle maintenance at Furness College which he loved."
Cumbria Police urged festival-goers not to take drugs because of the risk that the "powerful and dangerous" substances pose.
Drugs seized that may be linked to the illnesses include a blue tablet with an Adidas logo, yellow powder believed to be MDMA, and an orange oval tablet with a Rolls-Royce logo.
Other seized drugs include green and grey pills with white flecks.
Four people arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to supply have been released on bail.
Supt Justin Bibby, of Cumbria Police, said: "Christian's death, along with the number of people admitted to hospital, underlines the dangers of taking drugs.
"The criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Christian's death is ongoing and I would appeal for anyone with any information to get in touch with police."
The festival ended on Sunday.
