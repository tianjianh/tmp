The 24-year-old scored five goals in 45 appearances for Posh after joining them from Welling in November 2014, but was not in new boss Grant McCann's plans.
He follows defender Gabriel Zakuani in swapping Peterborough for the Cobblers this summer.
"Harry is a very good addition for us," said Northampton manager Rob Page.
"He is a lively character and a player who has a decent amount of experience in League One. He is also a good age, who will get better and better, and I think we are signing him at a good time.
"He is a box-to-box midfielder who creates things, makes things happen and can score a goal or two so he will add to our attacking options."
