The US goalkeeper was also one of several women whose naked pictures were apparently leaked online.
Solo has responded, saying the leak goes "beyond the bounds of human decency".
In a Facebook post she wrote: "I stand united with all the women affected and am exploring every option to protect my privacy.
"It is extremely sad and unfortunate that the rights of so many women were violated by the unauthorised release of private photographs.
Following the latest leak, which appeared to show celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens and Mary-Kate Olsen, the FBI vowed to widen its investigation into the hacking.
It began investigating after a first batch of photos, which included Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, was published in early September.
Kim Kardashian spoke to Newsbeat after the original hack at the start of September, saying: "'I think it's a big wake up call for people to make sure they have every privacy setting".
As well as addressing the latest photos, Hope Solo also referred to her recent legal issues.
She's currently awaiting trial on domestic abuse charges following an arrest at a family event in June. She's pleaded not guilty.
Referring to that, she wrote: "In addition, while I understand that the public desires more information regarding the allegations against me, I continue to maintain my innocence against these charges.
"And, once all the facts come to light and the legal process is concluded, I am confident that I will be fully exonerated."
