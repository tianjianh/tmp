[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northamptonshire murder trial police officer 'stabbed himself'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer accused of murdering his wife has admitted at his trial that he stabbed himself in order to make it look like his wife did it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jill Goldsmith, 49, was found with multiple head wounds at their house in Northampton in March.
Adrian Goldsmith, 49, who denies murder, said he had hit her with a variety of objects in self-defence, because she had been attacking him.
The jury had previously heard evidence about the couple's arguing.
Mr Goldsmith, also known as Otis, had lived with his wife next to Northamptonshire Police's HQ in Wootton Hall Park since November 2012.

While being cross-examined at Stafford Crown Court by John Lloyd-Jones QC, he said that when he got home on the day she died, his wife was "ready for him" and wanted an argument.
Mr Goldsmith admitted he had lied about minor injuries on his body, which were not inflicted by his wife, as he had first claimed when interviewed by police.
"I gave people the impression that I had been stabbed by Jill," he told the court.
He said he had stabbed himself to "mark" where his wife had "come at him".
Asked by the prosecution why he hit the back of her head with a mallet, Mr Goldsmith replied that his wife had grabbed him and he thought she would "rip off his testicles" and he would die from blood loss.
Mr Lloyd-Jones told the jury the defendant had had a lot of martial arts training, while his wife weighed less than 7st (44kg).
The jury was shown a picture of a deep cut to the back of the victim's head and a video of Mr Goldsmith's arrest where his face is covered in blood and there are splashes of blood over his clothes.
The trial continues.
