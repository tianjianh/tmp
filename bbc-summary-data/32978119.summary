Discussions are said to be at an early stage with a potential North American developer.
The plans would also include an adjacent golf course and  "associated amenities".
A report to councillors said the development could be a "truly transformational" development for the region.
Meanwhile, plans have also been revealed to create a visitor centre in the crypt of the memorial church on the estate.
It is part of the latest investment and development strategy for the university and business complex.
The Crichton Trust and its associated development company have identified two priority projects for the next year.
One includes the creation of a visitor centre in the crypt of the church along with a proposed repair programme.
It is part of plans to increase the use of the building.
The other key project is the redevelopment of the south wing of the Easterbrook Hall which used to be a hydrotherapy suite.
It will involve the reinstatement of the pool as part of the development of a spa, bar and restaurant.
The combined cost of the two schemes is £809,000.
Permission is being sought to utilise £650,000 in capital funding previously committed by the council for the development of the campus.
The Crichton Trust said it will fund the shortfall and any future increase in project costs.
