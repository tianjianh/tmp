The Romanians, beaten 42-3 at home by Quins last week, had Randall Morrison sent off in only the second minute for a high tackle on Marland Yarde.
Wales centre Jamie Roberts scored a hat-trick, while England duo Yarde and Mike Brown crossed twice.
Luke Wallace, Tim Visser, Jack Clifford and Tim Swiel also touched down, while Quins had Mat Luamanu sent off late on.
Ruardidh Jackson and Swiel each added five conversions as Quins notched up their record European win, with Gabriel Conache slotting over the visitors' only points from the tee.
The victory moves Quins, beaten Challenge Cup finalists last season, two points clear of Edinburgh at the top of the pool with three wins from four games.
Harlequins have now also won 12 successive home games in the competition in a run stretching back to 2006-07, while Conache's penalty was the first points Timisoara Saracens have scored away from home in this season's competition.
