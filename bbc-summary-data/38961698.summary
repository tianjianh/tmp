About 360kg (793lbs) of the drug was found on Hopton beach, near Great Yarmouth and a beach near Caister, both in Norfolk, on Thursday.
The latest package was discovered on Kessingland beach in Suffolk on Saturday. Police believe it is linked to the other finds.
The National Crime Agency said it was continuing to investigate the haul.
However, it refused to comment on reports of other packages being found, or locations where they had been discovered.
More news from Norfolk and Suffolk
Suffolk Police were called on Saturday after a package was found on the beach near Lowestoft.
"It is suggested that this find is linked to the earlier discoveries at Hopton," a Suffolk Police spokeswoman said.
"UK Border Force Agency and National Crime Agency have both been notified. The parcel has been recovered and the NCA is dealing with it."
Another package also washed up on the Norfolk coast at Happisburgh, the Lowestoft Journal reported.
Mary and Nigel Green, who were walking their dog near Happisburgh, told the BBC they spotted a black parcel in the sand on Sunday morning.
"Alarm bells sounded straight off because of what's happened down the coast," Mrs Green said.
"It was wrapped in gaffer tape but it was waxy sealed, so we knew straight away what it was".
Police refused to comment on the Happisburgh package.
Mr Green said the police told him they had received "quite a few phone calls" about other items being found.
Valerie McGee, another dog walker, made the initial find of the drugs on Hopton beach last week.
She spotted "about 10 sports bags, roped together, with plastic containers that looked like floats".
They were still intact, she said, but she "didn't look as I didn't want to uncover anything unsavoury... I left that to the experts".
