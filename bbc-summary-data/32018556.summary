Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association in relation to exchanges of text messages with a fan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 47-year-old is alleged to have breached five FA rules by sending abusive and insulting words to a Blackpool supporter.
He has previously apologised for sending "unacceptable" texts after his mobile number was put on social media.
Oyston has until 30 March to respond to the charges against him.
An FA statement said: "It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the text message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC.
"It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3 (1) is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability."
The exchange of texts took place in December.
In a statement issued at the time, Oyson said: "I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family.
"Given my position, I should have acted with more responsibility."
He added that he should have "reported the abusive text messages, phone calls and answer phone messages to the police, rather than get embroiled in such an exchange".
The Blackpool Supporters' Trust (BST) criticised Oyston after the texts were made public, while the Blackpool Gazette newspaper decided to drop him as a weekly columnist.
The club were in the Premier League as recently as 2010-11, but are currently 10 points adrift at the bottom of the Championship, with relegation seemingly inevitable.
Oyston has faced numerous protests from supporters about his continuing involvement in the club, with hundreds boycotting Saturday's home match against Leeds, many of whom went to watch AFC Blackpool in the North West Counties Premier Division instead.
