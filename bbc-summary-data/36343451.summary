A group representing hillwalkers and climbers has made a commitment to better support the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

The Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) said it would implement the principles of the Scottish LGBT Sports Charter, which was unveiled last year.
As part of this commitment, it said it would work with LGBT groups interested in hillwalking and climbing.
It said these organisations could become MCofS clubs.
The council also said LGBT youth groups could become partners of Climb Scotland, a body it set up to encourage and support young climbers.
MCofS has outlined the commitment in the latest issue of its magazine, Scottish Mountaineer.
The charter was written by the Equality Network and sets out principles to help make Scottish sports more inclusive.
It followed a study which found members of the community would be more likely to get involved if sport were more LGBT friendly.
The charter was unveiled at Hampden Park, Scotland's national football stadium, last May.
MCofS has also committed to trying to improve opportunities for disabled people.
Last year, it said it believed there was a strong interest among people with disabilities to take up climbing, but who did not know how to.
The 2015's British Mountaineering Council/MCofS Paraclimbing Series saw no Scots reach the final.
