Large crowds turned out for the events, which were led by service personnel, veterans and cadets.
Armed Forces Day was established in 2009 to honour the country's servicemen and women and their families across the Army, Navy and RAF.
It aims to allow the public to demonstrate their support for the forces.
In Glasgow, Lord Provost Sadie Docherty, in her role as Lord Lieutenant, led the city's celebrations in George Square as she took the salute at the march-past at the Cenotaph.
She was joined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as well as senior representatives of all the services.
She said: "It is important that our serving military and our veterans know they have the support of this city and the whole of Britain.
"A highlight for me, as well as the march-past and the music of the Royal Marines Band Scotland, is the opportunity to meet veterans and servicemen and women."
The 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo was marked before events were held in Edinburgh, with the Duke of Kent taking a salute outside the City Chambers.
Later, an Armed Forces Day parade made its way to the Grassmarket area where speeches were held, including from Scottish Secretary David Mundell.
The parade was followed by entertainment including live music, a mobile climbing wall for children and various charity stalls.
Edinburgh's Lord Provost Donald Wilson said the city had a "long and proud tradition of supporting the armed forces and our veterans."
Aberdeen welcomed more than 1,000 serving, veteran and cadet force personnel with a march through the city which also included massed pipes and drums and vintage military vehicles.
It was followed by activities at Queen's Links, with a helicopter, tank, armoured car and other vehicles on show.
Other events were staged in locations including Stranraer, Paisley, Inverness and Dundee.
This year's national Armed Forces Day event is took place in Guildford. Last year it was held in Stirling.
