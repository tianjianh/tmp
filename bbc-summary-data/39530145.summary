[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 100,000 euro (Â£85,000) reward has been offered for information regarding the disappearance of a man in Dublin more than 16 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Deely was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000.
An anonymous donor has offered the reward through Crimestoppers.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have also released CCTV footage showing a man acting suspiciously on the night Mr Deely disappeared.
The man, dressed in black, is seen approaching Mr  Deeley and talking to him at the rear of the offices where he worked.
Detectives at Pearse Street Garda Station never closed the file on Mr Deely's disappearance and hope technological advances in the examination of CCTV images will lead to a breakthrough in the case.
Numerous appeals for information down the years have failed to establish what happened to Mr Deely.
