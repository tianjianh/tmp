The 30-year-old captained the U's to the Football League Trophy final as well as winning automatic promotion from League Two last season.
It is the third time Wright has played under manager Chris Wilder, following spells at Oxford and Halifax Town.
"I have a great insight into what he is about. I've always believed that he can play at a higher level," Wilder said.
"He was captain under me for a number of years; I'm looking forward to working with him again because he is a positive influence in the changing room."
