British number three Evans, 26, won for the first time on clay at ATP Tour level on Monday when he beat Thiago Monteiro in his tournament opener.
He will play world number nine Dominic Thiem next after the Austrian beat Britain's Kyle Edmund 6-1 6-4.
Meanwhile, British number four Aljaz Bedene beat Marius Copil in Budapest.
Bedene was supposed to take on Federico Delbonis, but the Argentine failed to recover from an injury that caused him to retire from an event in Morocco earlier this month.
Instead, Bedene overcame his Romanian stand-in Copil 7-5 6-2 in an hour and 26 minutes.
Bedene has now lost only once in his past 19 matches after three tournament wins on the second-tier Challenger circuit. He will face Dutchman Robin Haase in the next round.
Elsewhere, British world number one Andy Murray will face Bernard Tomic in Barcelona on Wednesday after the Australian beat Dustin Brown in three sets.
