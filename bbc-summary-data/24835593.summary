[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government approves Bristol 'rapid transit' metrobus scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has given its approval to the planned "rapid transit" bus route through Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Secretary of State for Transport rubber stamped a transport and works order for the Ashton Vale to Temple Meads metrobus.
The West of England Joint Transport Executive Committee, made up of local authority partners, has been developing the scheme since 2006.
It is part of a wider plan to improve public transport across the west.
A spokesman for the committee said: "This is a hugely significant milestone for metrobus and a compelling endorsement of the project."
Earlier in the year, Bristol mayor George Ferguson amended the route so that the rapid transit buses no longer run along the Harbourside but along Cumberland Road instead.
He said he did not want to see buses "clogging up" the bridge or compromising the harbourside area "ambience".
This change in the plan will still need planning permission if the Â£50m project is to be delivered by 2016.
