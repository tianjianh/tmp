Sarah Benford, 14, went missing from her care home in Northampton in April 2000. A murder investigation began three years later.
Detectives are looking for her body in woods near Warkton.
A recent review of the case, including interviews with 20 people, led to the decision to search the area.

Sarah's mother, Vicky Benford, said: "Sarah went missing in April 2000, and I have spent the last 16 years wondering where she is.
"[She] should be celebrating her 30th birthday this week. Sarah has a brother and sister who miss her every day and we all need to know what has happened to her."
Sarah lived with her family in Kettering but spent time at a care home in Northampton.
Police described her as a "troubled teenager" with a history of running away.
At the time of her disappearance it was believed she had been taking drugs and was lured into prostitution.
Sarah was last seen by her mother in Kettering town centre on 6 April 2000, two days after absconding from the care home.
She was wearing patchwork dark blue jeans, an orange fleece, black Puffa jacket, cream trainers and was carrying a navy and green rucksack.
Police believe the teenager was murdered "in the early days of her disappearance".
Speaking as the new search for Sarah's body got under way, lead investigator Det Ch Insp Martin Kinchin said he was sure people in the Kettering area may know what happened to her and as allegiances changed over time, he urged them to come forward.
"I would love in my heart to think Sarah is alive and makes contact with us, but my head tells me it is unlikely that she is."
Despite eight people being arrested in connection with the case, no-one has ever been charged.
Officers have reviewed the case ahead of what would have been Sarah's 30 birthday on 19 March.
Sarah's mother Vicky added: "As a family we are looking for closure around her disappearance and somebody must know something. We would ask for people to contact the police if they know anything.
"As a family we need to come to terms with what has happened and won't be able to do this until we know what has happened to Sarah."
