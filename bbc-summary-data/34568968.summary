A Kidwelly writer is in a critical condition in hospital after a hit-and-run driver knocked him down in the Carmarthenshire town on Saturday.

Julian Ruck was hit on New Street just after 19:30 BST and suffered serious head and leg injuries.
He was taken to Swansea's Morriston Hospital following the incident.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver may have been aware of the crash because the car stopped briefly before driving away towards New Street.
Officers want residents with private CCTV systems along the road and Bridge Street to contact them.
Mr Ruck is the author of four books and a columnist for local papers.
