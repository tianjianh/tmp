[SN]TITLE[SN]
Davis Cup: Ottawa to host Canada v GB tie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain's Davis Cup first-round tie in Canada will be held in Ottawa's TD Place Arena from 3-5 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After winning the title for the first time since 1936 in November 2015, Great Britain's defence ended in semi-final defeat by Argentina in September.
Britain's Andy Murray could face world number three Milos Raonic in a repeat of his Wimbledon win earlier this year.
Defeat for Great Britain would mean they have to contest a play-off to remain in the elite-level World Group.
The match will be played on an indoor hard court with capacity expected to be about 8,000.
