Chugai's stock surged by more than 20%  in Tokyo trading on Monday.
Roche, the world's biggest maker of cancer drugs, already owns about 60% of the Japanese firm and is said to be looking to buy the remainder for about $10bn (Â£6bn).
According to various news outlets, a deal could come as early as this week.
Chugai has denied talks with Roche, saying in a statement made over the weekend that it was "in no way in the process of reviewing any plan to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche."
Roche has owned a majority stake in Chugai, which develops oncology and arthritis drugs, for more than decade.
A successful acquisition of the Tokyo-based firm would add to the wave of global deal-making the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical products sector has seen this year.
According to Mergermarket, more than $260bn in deals were made in the first half of this year as drugmakers looked to reduce costs and find new sources of growth.
