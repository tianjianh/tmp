Police divers have resumed their search for missing Dumfries man Bryan Cowie reported to have fallen into the River Nith on Sunday night.

They were unable to continue their operations on Tuesday due to high water levels after heavy rainfall.
The search for Mr Cowie, 41, began near the rowing club beside the river at about 21:00 on Sunday.
It carried on throughout Monday and Tuesday but has so far failed to find any trace of the missing man.
Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Nith Inshore Rescue Service and a coastguard helicopter from Prestwick have been involved in the operation.
