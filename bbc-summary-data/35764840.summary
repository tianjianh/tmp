Sir George was best known for signing The Beatles and producing their music throughout their career.
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown described him as "a musical genius".
"It was a privilege to know someone so incredibly modest, wonderfully courteous, yet universally respected. He helped lift British music into the stratosphere," he said.
"George was often described as the fifth Beatle but he was the number one producer for a whole generation of music fans."
Sir Paul McCartney also released a statement, describing Sir George as being "like a second father" to him.
Elton John posted on his official Twitter account: "So sad to hear about Sir George. It is the end of a wonderful era. He was a delightful, brilliant man."
Queen guitarist Brian May wrote on his personal blog: "So sad to hear of the passing of the great George Martin. Very sad, and sincere condolences to his family.
He added Sir George was "always, always positive, and deeply thoughtful and creative, the man was a gentle giant of popular music".
"George obviously had a real magic, even then. When he later became the 'in house' producer for the Beatles, history was made - and a fabulous catalogue of work."

Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons Sir George was a "massive figure, a giant in popular music, and responsible for tunes that will live on forever more".
Sir George's son, Giles Martin, tweeted: "RIP dad. I'm so proud to have been your son. I'll miss you more than words can say. Thank you for the all times we had together."
He embodied everything I believed was possible with popular music -- you could make rock and roll rock and invite Beethoven and Mozart to join in. George Martin wrote the book on modern record production.
Veteran record producer Tony Visconti, famous for his work with David Bowie, paid tribute on his Facebook account.
"George Martin embodied everything I believed was possible with popular music - you could make rock and roll rock and invite Beethoven and Mozart to join in. He wrote the book on modern record production," he said.
Gary Barlow told BBC Radio 2 Sir George was "a complete legend to us all".
"We're all still copying his work. In his heyday, you've got to remember there wasn't YouTube with all these tutorials, he was literally pioneering music every day he went into the studio."
Sean Ono Lennon posted a picture of Sir George on Instagram, writing: "R.I.P. George Martin. I'm so gutted I don't have many words. Thinking of Judy and Giles and family. Love Always, Sean."
Fellow music producer Mike Stock, of the famous songwriting trio Stock, Aitken and Waterman, said it was "impossible to overstate the impact of George Martin on modern music".
He added that Sir George was "a professional hero of mine. Such an immense legacy of music and love".
Other musicians crediting Sir George with influencing their work included Billy Bragg, Lianne La Havas, and James Bay who said "not many others have done so much for music".
"Goodbye George Martin, thanks for producing the music that changed my world and everyone else's", wrote Bryan Adams on Instagram.
Tim Burgess of The Charlatans added: "The pioneers and originators are leaving us. They did their work and redefined music and performance. Don't let them down kids. Make music!"
Liam Fray of the Courteeners added: "George Martin cultivated & shaped my favourite records. What a talented visionary. His work still stands tall, fresh and relevant today.
Among Sir George's many projects was the soundtrack to the eighth James Bond film Live and Let Die.
Sir Roger Moore wrote: "How very sad to wake to the news Sir George Martin has left us. He made my first Bond film sound brilliant!"
Liam Gallagher, lead singer of rock band Oasis, who modelled themselves on The Beatles, said on Twitter: "Sir George Martin RIP LG X"
Musician Lenny Kravitz wrote: "The legends are really going home! Visionary producer of #TheBeatles, George Martin (1926-2016)."
