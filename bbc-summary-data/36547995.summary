Council halts parking charge plan near Royal Berkshire Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A midwife's campaign against plans to cut free parking on roads around Royal Berkshire Hospital has led to council officials putting the move on hold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clare Goulbourn-Lay said the scheme was "problematic" for staff and patients, and began a petition which has received 8,400 signatures.
Charges would have been placed on 625 spaces in the area, and restrictions placed on a further 741.
However, Reading Borough Council said it had not abandoned the idea.
The online petition opposed the introduction of pay-and-display meters for Addington Road, Erleigh Road and other roads around the hospital in Reading.
Reading Borough Council said it had looked at priority parking for residents, and further investigations would be carried out and finished by September.
