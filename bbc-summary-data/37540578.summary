[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mother of two's deportation over visa delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother of two who was at risk of being deported on Saturday has been given time to try and resolve an issue with her visa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gloria Macleod, who has an Indian passport and is married to a Scot working in Dubai, has been living in Dingwall in the Highlands since July.
The couple's young daughters attend a local school and the family hope to set up home in the area.
Mrs Macleod has been asked to meet immigration officials on 13 October.
The Home Office says she does not have the correct visa, but has been considering representations related to her case.
Ian Blackford, SNP MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, has been in talks with the Home Office about Mrs Macleod's situation, which would see her daughters left in the care of elderly grandparents if she is deported.
Mr Blackford said he would be making further representations and said Mrs Macleod and her husband, Robert, who is originally from Dingwall, were due an apology from the Home Office.
