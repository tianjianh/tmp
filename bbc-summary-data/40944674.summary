Newcastle United 2-3 Nottingham Forest (AET)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest scored in extra time to hand Newcastle a third consecutive defeat in a thrilling EFL Cup second-round tie at St James' Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tyler Walker got the final touch on Jack Hobbs' header in the 97th minute to help Forest knock out their Premier League hosts.
Aleksandar Mitrovic put Newcastle ahead early on before Forest striker Jason Cummings scored twice in two minutes.
Rolando Aarons equalised with a fine drive from outside the box.
However, lax defending from Rafael Benitez's side saw Hobbs rise unmarked from a corner to head on goal, with Walker stealing in to deflect the ball past former Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow.
They were moments of quality from the hosts. Mitrovic's opener was angled powerfully and Aarons drove at pace at the Forest defence before working the ball onto his weaker right foot and firing high past Jordan Smith.
But a side featuring 10 changes from the team that lost 1-0 to fellow promoted side Huddersfield at the weekend were again defensively frail and at times struggled alarmingly against Championship opponents.
For Forest's first, Zach Clough collected a cut-back in space before directing a cross towards Cummings, who easily got between two Newcastle defenders to head in.
Cummings, who joined from Scottish side Hibernian in the summer, then ran on to a ball forward to deftly lift it over the onrushing Darlow.
