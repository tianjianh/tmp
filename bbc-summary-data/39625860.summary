[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 0-0 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln's seven-match National League winning run was brought to an end as they were held to a goalless draw at Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Imps were looking to reach the 100-point mark with victory but could not find a way past home keeper Lee Worgan.
Lincoln started the brighter of the two and a neat one-two between Adam Marriott and Jack Muldoon almost saw them take a 17th-minute lead but the former saw his shot hit the outside of post.
At the other end, Ross Etheridge pulled off a fine save to turn Alex Flisher's shot behind for a corner.
Lincoln came close again six minutes into the second half when Sean Raggett headed a Billy Knott free-kick into the direction of Muldoon but his effort hit the bar.
Raggett almost won it at the death but his header from a corner with two minutes remaining flashed inches wide.
