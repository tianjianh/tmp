[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour leader of Stirling Council, Johanna Boyd, has announced that she will not be standing in next year's local government elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Boyd, who was elected to represent Castle ward in 2012, became the first woman to lead Stirling Council.
She is currently the youngest council leader in Scotland and one of only four women.
She said her decision not to seek re-election was not easy but that it was time to address "personal priorities."
She said: "I am incredibly proud of what Labour-led Stirling Council has achieved over the last five years and I will continue to devote my energy to securing a City Deal for Stirling and the wider region.
"The reason I am not seeking re-election is very straightforward. I made a full time commitment to the role of leading Stirling Council for the past five years and it's now time for me to address some personal priorities.
"The welfare of my young family has always come first and at this time the means of achieving that is the continuing development of my legal career."
She added: "I will miss my role in local government and working with councillors from across the political spectrum as well as council staff who are dedicated to delivering the best public services in very challenging times."
