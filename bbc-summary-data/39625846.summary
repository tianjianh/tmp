Head coach Antonio Conte is likely to recall Diego Costa and Eden Hazard after leaving them out for the FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham.
Southampton midfielder Oriel Romeu is available to face his former side after completing a two-match ban.
Sam McQueen is set to miss the fixture because of a minor groin strain.
Long-term absentees Matt Targett and Charlie Austin will return to training later this week.
Jonathan Pearce: "This is huge. If Chelsea follow up their FA Cup semi-final win with an emphatic victory they'll hold their nerve and land the title.
"But this is a slippery one. They've found Southampton troublesome at home and the Saints have had 10 days to prepare.
"A defeat for the league leaders will open the door for Spurs.
"Chelsea were far too open in the thrilling semi-final. They also haven't gone this long without a league clean sheet in nearly 21 years.
"Southampton may not have beaten a current top-six side all season but they've looked dangerous away recently. Tricky this for the leaders!"
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "I have in my mind the starting 11 but tomorrow I want to check very well the physical consideration of every single player as our last game was an intense one and used energy.
"But we have trained very well this season and we have a lot of energy to face this type of situation.
"It is important for us to win and look at ourselves, but we all know that tomorrow it won't be easy because Southampton is a very good team with a good coach and good players."
Southampton manager Claude Puel on the importance of Oriol Romeu: "I think he's not far off [N'Golo] Kante. He recovers the ball so well and is a technical player.
"He's an important player for this team because he can do fantastic work to recover the ball and start the play. It's difficult for us without him.
"We will see for the future, we are confident in him and, for me, he can look to getting in the selection with Spain, for example."
