The DUP says it is prepared to quit Stormont over IRA claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The DUP has said it would be prepared to bring down Northern Ireland's power-sharing government over claims the Provisional IRA still exists.

DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "it is only the DUP who can deal with this issue now".
He said the party would move to exclude Sinn Féin from the Northern Ireland Executive.
His comments come ahead of a DUP meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers to discuss the IRA's status.
The Northern Ireland Executive is a power-sharing government drawing ministers from the five biggest parties in the assembly.
On Wednesday, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said it intended to leave it.
The announcement came as part of an ongoing political row over the status of the Provisional IRA after the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Mr Donaldson has responded to the UUP's announcement saying the "only people who were punished by what Mike Nesbitt has done here are the people who vote for his party as they are now excluded from the government".
"We are going to move to exclude Sinn Féin from the government," he added.
"In the end, if the other parties are not prepared to support the exclusion of Sinn Féin, then we will act unilaterally, and if that means that we have a period in Northern Ireland where we don't have a government until we resolve and sort out these issues then so be it."
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the cross-community Alliance Party have already met Ms Villiers.
Following their meeting, SDLP members ruled out backing a motion to exclude Sinn Féin from the executive, saying they would require more evidence of IRA involvement in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr.
They said while they had sympathy with the Ulster Unionists over the issue, they believed they had acted prematurely in leaving the executive.
The SDLP leader, Alasdair McDonnell, said his party would not make a "knee-jerk" decision as much more information was needed.
"We will act on facts and when we have clear ground to put our feet on and know what we are doing and why we are doing it," he said.
The Alliance Party said Northern Ireland's political situation was in "a very serious crisis and ever deepening".
Stormont's Employment Minister Stephen Farry, who is from Alliance, said the party would judge its response to any exclusion motion on the evidence available at that time.
On Tuesday, UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said he had chaired a meeting attended by the party's MLAs, MEP, MPs, senior representatives of its councillors association and its party chairman, and they had "unanimously" endorsed his recommendation to leave the executive.
He said the party's ruling body would make a final decision on Saturday and if it was supported then the party would form an opposition.
Sinn Féin has accused the UUP of creating a "crisis". The party's North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, said Sinn Féin was prepared to sit and talk to all parties.
He told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster: "I do not think the executive should fall".
"Mike Nesbitt is trying to push the DUP into following them [the UUP]," he added.
The Ulster Unionist announcement came as part of a political row that has followed the Police Service of Northern Ireland's assertion that members of the Provisional IRA were involved in the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr earlier this month.
The 53-year-old ex-IRA man, was killed in what police believe was part of a "fall-out" in republican circles after the murder of former IRA commander Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May.
Police said an infrastructure exists at a senior level of the Provisional IRA, but that there was no evidence that Mr McGuigan's murder was sanctioned by that hierarchy.
On Sunday, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said there was no reason for armed republican groups, such as the IRA, to exist as the movement was committed to peace.
