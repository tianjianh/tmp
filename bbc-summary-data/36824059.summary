[SN]TITLE[SN]
Highland Care worker faces 'sexual behaviour' inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care worker is to face a disciplinary inquiry accused of "engaged in sexual behaviour" with a resident at a training centre for young people with learning disabilities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Cunningham faces a hearing at the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) over allegations from February 2015.
He is said to have put a woman, identified only as AA, "at risk of harm" at a lodge in Muir of Ord.
A conduct sub-committee hearing will be held next week.
The charge before the SSSC states that, while working as a residential support worker for Nansen Highland, Mr Cunningham told AA to get into bed, before lying down beside her.
He is then said to have cuddled, kissed and touched AA before asking her: "Did you enjoy that?"
The charge alleges that "in doing so you did engage in sexual behaviour with a service user and cause harm and/or risk of harm to AA".
A four-day hearing at the SSSC's headquarters in Dundee is scheduled to begin on 26 July.
As an ultimate sanction if the charge is found proven, Mr Cunningham could be struck off the register of regulated social service workers.
Nansen Highland runs training and residential centres on the Black Isle providing help for young adults with learning disabilities.
