Four Scottish cadets have been stranded at sea after South Korea's biggest shipping company filed for bankruptcy.

Ports around the world are refusing to let Hanjin Shipping vessels dock or unload, fearing they will not get paid.
The ships and cargo are also likely to be seized by creditors if they do dock.
This has left boats and crew stranded around the globe, including Ruairidh Hanna, from Dingwall, and three other Glasgow College sea cadets. The group's ship is anchored east of Singapore.
The four cadets were aboard the ship Hanjin Louisiana during their second sea phase as part of their nautical science course at the college.
Mr Hanna's mother, Rhona MacLennan, said they had been due to arrive home on 2 September, but had been in touch on 31 August to say there was "something funny going on".
"As far as I'm aware they've not had any instruction to go into port," Ms MacLennan told BBC Scotland.
She said she had last spoken to her 22-year-old son on Saturday.
"By this point they'd been told there was a possibility they'd get off the boat on Tuesday - that there was a supply boat going in to supply them.
"So the boys were very upbeat and excited at the thought they'd be getting home. But that never happened - we don't know why."
There is also a reported risk of pirates operating in the South China Sea, where their ship is at anchor, which Ms MacLennan said added to the worry.
"The area they're in is a piracy risk area so that brings a whole different outlook on it," she said.
SNP MP Drew Hendry said the UK government should take "urgent action" to assist them.
Mr Hendry said: "This is a completely frustrating and potentially dangerous situation for the crew and a huge worry for their families - and I really want Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to get on and take action to get them to a place of safety.
''After Ruairidh got in touch, my immediate concern was to get him and his colleagues home to their families. Over the past couple of weeks my office and I have been working with the trade union Nautilus and other agencies to find ways to make this happen."
The MP added that the group faced a "very real prospect" of being stranded for several months.
A spokesman for Clyde Marine Training said: "We currently have four cadets on board Hanjin Louisiana, which is at anchor off Singapore.
"We are in regular contact with both them and their families and understand just how frustrating this situation is for them.
"Their wellbeing is of paramount importance and we remain in close communication with all parties concerned in order to offer any practical assistance we can and to ensure that they are able to return home as soon as is possible."
The troubled shipping group has debts of more than $5bn and has struggled to raise funding to rescue $14bn (Â£10.5bn) worth of cargo stranded round the world following its collapse.
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea in August after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed.
There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors.
