[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An internal council investigation is to be launched in Orkney into claims of workplace bullying within Stromness Academy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move at the area's second largest secondary school comes after a large number of staff at the school raised concerns.
It is understood a letter was signed by about two thirds of the entire school workforce.
The council declined to comment on the letter.
