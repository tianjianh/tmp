Noel Gallagher turns down invite to work with Libertines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Noel Gallagher's revealed he can't produce the new Libertines album because he's working on other projects.

Lead singer Carl Barat had invited The High Flying Birds man to help produce their new record, which is out later this year.
He told NME the band could use his "clarity of vision" on the project.
But, before any further excitement could take hold, Noel revealed their need to record abroad meant he wouldn't be able to sign up.
We know what you're thinking. How did this combo even present itself in the first place?
Well... email.
Yep, the musical powerhouses that are Gallagher and Barat have been bouncing them back and forth recently.
"I'm going to email Noel Gallagher," Carl explained before Noel knocked him back.
"I know he's really busy, but hopefully he's got a bit of time for The Libertines who love him so."
Seemingly not enough time.
Noel told NME: "We've exchanged a few emails but unfortunately they want to do it in Thailand.
"With the best will in the world, I'm on tour and I can't do it. I would genuinely love to be involved but they're going to do it in Thailand and I can't be in Thailand."
So that's, that. The "clarity of vision" will have to wait.
Noel does have some advice for The Libertines though, "as long as they don't over-think it, they'll be alright."
