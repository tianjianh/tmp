The Welsh Premier League side were held to a goalless draw in the first leg, but Callum Morris' first-half winner in Fredrikstad secured a famous victory in the club's first European campaign.
Both sides later had players red carded as Stabæk's Kamal Issah and the Nomads' John Disney were sent off.
Connah's Quay will play Serbian side Vojvodina in the next round.
The second qualifying round first leg will take place on 14 July, with the second leg to follow a week later.
