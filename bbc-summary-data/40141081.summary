Wales will learn from RGC 1404 win, says coach Robin McBryde

Coach Robin McBryde felt Wales' 88-19 win over Welsh Premiership side RGC 1404 was a worthwhile exercise ahead of their two-Test summer tour.

Wales scored 14 tries in a comprehensive win in Colwyn Bay, with Tyler Morgan and Cory Allen each scoring a hat-trick of tries.
McBryde's side play Tonga on 16 June and Samoa on 23 June.
"That game was a better reflection of where we're at rather than training against each other," McBryde said.
"Fair play to RGC, they played their part and asked a few questions of us.
"There were certain aspects of the game that we were happy with and other aspects we know we need to brush up on.
"But all in all it enabled us to look at different combinations attacking wise and I think everybody played some part in the game."
International caps were not awarded for the fixture at a sell-out Parc Eirias, with an experimental Wales side captained by Jamie Roberts.
Five uncapped players started for Wales, who made a host of changes at half time.
"We were able to give time to the players that needed time and time to the players that needed to prove their fitness," McBryde added.
"We were able to look after the Scarlets, Exeter and Wasps players by not over playing them.
"It's good that they've gone through a game together because it's a shared experience and they can all relate back to that game and we can all learn from that game.
"Without doubt it was the right thing to do."
