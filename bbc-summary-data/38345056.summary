The former education secretary pulled out of the show after angering Downing Street by criticising Prime Minister Theresa May's Â£995 leather trousers.
Mrs Morgan herself has raised eyebrows for owning a designer leather handbag.
Programme makers Hat Trick said: "It was decided in the light of her spat with Downing St over expensive leather goods to replace her with a handbag."
Mrs Morgan had been booked to appear on the satirical BBC One show in September.
She hit the front pages after querying why the PM had spent Â£995 on a pair of leather trousers, saying: "I don't think I've ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress."
On Wednesday she pulled out of the programme due to "unforeseen circumstances".
The news quiz's choice of replacement brings back memories of when Labour MP Roy Hattersley was replaced with a tub of lard after he cancelled an appearance in 1993.
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker will host the show on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Friday.
