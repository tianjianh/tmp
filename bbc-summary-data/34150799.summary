[SN]TITLE[SN]
Regiment poised to get Freedom of Highlands next month

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal Regiment of Scotland looks set to be given the Freedom of the Highlands during a ceremony next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highland councillors will be asked to agree that the event be held on 15 October in Inverness.
The event would involve up to 250 soldiers - including pipers and drummers - and the regimental mascot, a pony called Cruachan IV.
The soldiers would march through Inverness city centre to the ceremony in the Northern Meeting Park.
Highland Council agreed last year that the regiment should be given the status.
The City of Inverness area committee will be asked at a meeting on 10 September to approve the holding of the event, and allocating Â£24,401 from the Inverness Common Good Fund towards its cost.
Having the Freedom allows a military unit to parade through the streets with bayonets fixed and colours flying when the situation warrants it.
