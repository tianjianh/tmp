[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspect was detained on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the crash on the A500, at about 04:45 BST on Saturday.
Police said two men, who died at the scene, were both aged 22 and from the north Staffordshire area.
The man, 23, has been released until next month while the investigation continues, Staffordshire Police said.
Part of the road, around Cliffe Vale, was closed for seven hours.
A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said it quickly became apparent to crews arriving at the scene "that nothing could be done to save two men that were in the car".
Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
