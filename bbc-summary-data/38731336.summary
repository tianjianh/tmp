£24m Rhyl Catholic school plan out for consultation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to build a new £24m Catholic school in Rhyl have taken a step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denbighshire council's cabinet have agreed the plan, which means closing Ysgol Mair and Blessed Edward Jones High School, will go to consultation.
The Diocese of Wrexham and Denbighshire council want to build a new school for children aged between three and 16.
The plan is to build the school on the site of Ysgol Main and Blessed Edward Jones and open in September 2019.
The formal consultation will take place from 14 February until 27 March.
"There have been very positive discussions with the Diocese of Wrexham and the schools to deliver this exciting project that would transform Catholic education for pupils in the Rhyl area," said councillor Eryl Williams, Denbighshire's lead member for education."
The council aim to report the findings of the consultation back to Denbighshire council's cabinet in the summer.
Bishop of Wrexham, the Right Reverend Peter Brignall said the proposal was an "exciting venture".
