IPCC investigates death of Jon James in Llantrisant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a 28-year-old man after being detained in the street is being investigated by the police watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to Preston Close at Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff, at 01:25 BST on 24 June, to reports Jon James was shouting for help and behaving erratically.
He lost consciousness as officers tried to restrain him and died at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 27 June.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has appealed for witnesses.
The coroner has been informed and a post mortem examination has been carried out.
IPCC investigators have visited the scene and spoken to neighbours to gather witness statements, including accounts from the South Wales Police officers involved.
No officers are currently under investigation but the IPCC said this would be "kept under review".
