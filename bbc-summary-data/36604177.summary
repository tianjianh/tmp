[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number one Jason Day says he will talk to his family about the risks of the Zika virus before deciding whether to play at the Rio Olympics.

Rory McIlroy is the latest player to opt out of the event over fears of the mosquito-borne virus, which has links to brain defects in newborn babies.
"Family for me is priority number one," said 28-year-old Australian Day, who has two young children.
"I've got to make sure they're happy, then probably I'll make the decision."

Day said he respected McIlroy's decision, adding: "It's a tough one going from trying to represent your country and trying to win a gold medal but also understanding that it's a life decision that you have to make just in case there's a small percentage that it will happen.
"He is looking at getting married soon, and obviously looking to start a family. I'm past that, but also looking to have some more babies."
Fiji's Vijay Singh and Australia's Marc Leishman have already pulled out of the games because of the Zika issue, while major winners Adam Scott and Louis Oosthuizen have chosen not to appear for scheduling and family reasons.
The World Health Organization (WHO) insists there is a "very low risk" of the Zika virus spreading globally as a result of holding the Olympics in Brazil.
BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter:
While McIlroy's concerns over the risk to his and his family's health should be respected, his withdrawal provides worries for the credibility of golf's return to the Games.
With Leishman and Singh also steering clear because of Zika fears and Adam Scott, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel staying away for scheduling reasons, the list of absentees is growing.
There will now be close attention on world number one Jason Day and Masters champion Danny Willett. Both have expressed Zika concerns.
If golf has a higher proportion of Rio absentees than other sports, questions over whether it should have been readmitted to the Games will grow louder.
