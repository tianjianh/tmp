[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dublin explosives were destined for use in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish police have said they believe explosives seized in Dublin on Friday were destined for use in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men, aged 21 and 28, were arrested when armed police stopped a taxi on Spring Garden Street in the Ballybough area at about 18:00 local time.
More than 5kg of plastic explosives, detonators and other military grade items were seized.
A third man - aged 55 - was arrested later on Friday night.
Police have been given extra time to question the two men in their 20s arrested at the scene.
The operation was part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.
Police said it was highly significant as it indicates that dissident groups have now found new sources for commercial explosives, which previously they had removed from IRA dumps.
People were moved from their homes as army bomb disposal experts worked for over three hours to make the area safe.
Residents were allowed back into their homes at about 23:00 on Friday.
