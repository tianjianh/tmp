The artworks are from Dundee's Oor Wullie Bucket Trail, which celebrates one of Scotland's best-known comic strip characters.
Inverness's mini trail will be in place until 14 August.
Four of the sculptures are at Inverness Botanic Gardens, two at the city's library and two at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.
A sculpture has also been placed at Inverness Leisure Centre, one at the Highland Archive Centre and one at Inverness Railway Station.
