Julia Gillard appointed honorary fellow at Aberystwyth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welsh-born former Australian prime minister will be awarded an honorary fellowship with Aberystwyth University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julia Gillard, who was born in Barry, will be made a fellow when she delivers a lecture at the international politics department on 30 June.
Fellowships are given to people with a connection to Wales deemed to have made an "outstanding contribution" to their field.
Ms Gillard became prime minister in June 2010 and served for three years.
She told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme her Welsh roots shaped her politics and stories about her late father's early life in the Neath Valley stayed with her.
