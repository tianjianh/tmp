Mr McMullan, from Hackney, London, was last seen outside the Barrowboy and Banker pub in London Bridge on Saturday.
A bank card belonging to the 32-year-old was found on a body at the scene.
His family said they were "deeply upset" to hear about his death following the terror attack.
"It is with the deepest regret and sadness that we have today been informed that our son and brother has been declared a victim of the terrorist attack on Saturday night," they added.
"While our pain will never diminish it is important for all of us to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who would try to destroy us and remember that hatred is the refuge of small minded individuals and will only breed more.
"We would like to thank all the members of the services who did their utmost to "serve and protect" the population of London from these deranged and deluded individuals."
Mr McMullan's sister said she believed her brother to be among those who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene.
Reading out a statement on Monday, Melissa McMullan said: "From his friends who were with him on the night - they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was.
"Words will never be able to match his essence. There will only ever be one James."
Specially trained family liaison officers are supporting his family now official confirmation has taken place, police said.
Seven other people were killed in the attack.
They have been named as 30-year-old Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, Australian Kirsty Boden, 28, Australian Sara Zelenak, 21, French nationals 26-year-old Alexandre Pigeard, Xavier Thomas, 45, and chef Sebastien Belanger, 36, and Spanish national Ignacio Echeverria, 39.
NHS England said 29 patients remain in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition.
