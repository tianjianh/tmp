[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City Women moved 10 points clear at the top of Women's Super League One with a convincing victory at bottom side Doncaster Rovers Belles.

Scotland's Jane Ross headed City into a first-minute lead and Izzy Christiansen doubled the advantage from close range.
After the break, Christiansen's England team-mate Lucy Bronze headed in a third and Daphne Corboz fired in the fourth goal from the edge of the area late on.
The Belles are six points behind Sunderland but have four games in hand.
City, who have played two games more than second-placed Chelsea, remain unbeaten in the league in 2016.
Manchester City Women defender Lucy Bronze: "It doesn't get much better. But we have to focus on getting three points in our next match.
"It's a good position for us to be in but we have to make sure we're focused and we go out and win those last few home games we have especially."
Doncaster Rovers Belles midfielder Katrin Omarsdottir: "There are positives to take from the last month or so, but sooner or later we need to start winning games.
"We try to go into every game to get three points but obviously people from the outside won't expect us to get something from teams like Manchester City and the bigger teams.
"We just have to keep going, this is football and we're in a bad situation right now but we have to try and win every game we play so we can stay in this league."
