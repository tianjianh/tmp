Disney Pixar chief John Lasseter has said the company wants to make more diverse stories about "female and ethnic characters".

"It's very important to us," Lasseter told reporters at Cannes Film Festival, where the latest Pixar film Inside Out has screened out of competition.
"It's grown in importance over time. As you'll see in future films, we're really paying attention to that."
He had been asked if Pixar would make a film with a black protagonist.
Disney first featured a black princess in 2009's The Princess and the Frog, but Pixar, which was bought by Disney in 2006, has yet to feature a non-white lead character.
"We're trying to reach out and find origins of legends all over the world," revealed Lasseter, pointing to Disney's 2016 film Moana, about a Polynesian princess, adding: "It's pretty spectacular."
Lasseter said animation was becoming more diverse behind the scenes too.
"Animation, when we got started, by and large was mostly guys," said Lasseter.
"But we have seen more and more women and more people from all over the world starting to work in it, which is very exciting. I think it will get reflected in the characters."
Critics have lavished praise on Inside Out, which premiered at Cannes on Monday night.
The film is set in the mind of a young girl who moves to a new home, along with her emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), as well as Anger and Fear.
Director Pete Docter said he was inspired by his daughter Elie, who voiced the girl in 2009 film Up.
Docter said that as she grew older "she was a lot less energetic and reserved," and he had wondered, "What's going on in her head?"
Lasseter revealed they had done "a tremendous amount of research" into scientific data on emotions and thoughts.
He added: "I believe in all of Pixar history, this is one of the most talented and amazing casts that we had."
