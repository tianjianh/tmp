The author is famed for writing much-loved children's books, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, Matilda and The Twits.
The Welsh government wants to build on the success of celebrations to mark 100 years since Dylan Thomas' birth in 2014.
Mr Dahl was born in Llandaff, Cardiff, in 1916 and died in 1990.
Events to mark the centenary of his birth will take place as part of the Year of Adventure - a Welsh government project which hopes to attract more tourists next year.
Deputy minister for culture, sport and tourism Ken Skates said "exciting plans" are in the pipeline.
"We will announce further details shortly, but I can say the ideas being developed contain plans of epic proportions," he added.
