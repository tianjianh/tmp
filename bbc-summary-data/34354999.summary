A body believed to be that of 88-year-old Janet McKay, who had dementia, was found in Clydebank on Thursday.
Police said information from a member of the public the previous Friday was not passed on.
Another report of the same sighting was made four days later, and this time was given to the investigating officers.
Scotland's Justice Secretary, Michael Matheson, told BBC Scotland it was important to establish "all of the facts" relating to the matter. He said the case had been referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC).
Mrs McKay was last seen by her neighbours in the Knightswood area of Glasgow on Wednesday 16 September.
Only in recent days was it established that she had boarded a bus and had been recorded by CCTV cameras in the Clydebank area on the day of her disappearance.
Divisional Commander Ch Supt Andy Bates said on Thursday: "This morning officers discovered the body of a woman in the Clydebank area. Formal identification has yet to take place but we believe it to be Janet McKay who was reported missing last week. Janet's family has been informed.
"Since she was reported missing last Wednesday, an extensive investigation and search has been conducted by my officers throughout the local area.
"On Friday evening as part of our inquiries, a member of the public provided us with information of a possible sighting of the missing person. This information was not passed to the call handling centres nor was it passed to the inquiry team.
"On Tuesday further information about this potential sighting was received through the call handling centre who immediately passed it to the inquiry team.
He added: "Following further extensive inquiry a body was discovered. We have kept Janet's family fully informed.
"I would like to apologise to the family for any distress caused at this difficult time and take this opportunity to express my condolences to the family and friends and thank those members of the public who supported the search for Janet."
The matter has been referred to the PIRC by both Police Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.
The latest incident follows a review of Police Scotland's procedures following the deaths of John Yuill and Lamara Bell, who lay undiscovered for days despite a sighting of their crashed car being reported to a police control room.
Chief Constable Sir Stephen House last month announced he will stand down earlier than expected following sustained public and political criticism over call-centre failings, and controversies over stop-and-search and armed police patrols.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Justice Secretary Mr Matheson, said: "I think it's important to recognise that in the police statement they were very clear that this was information that wasn't actually passed to the call centre in the first place.
"And then when it was eventually passed to the call centre, it was then actioned immediately to the investigation team.
"I think it's important that we allow the investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commission to be taken forward and we shouldn't prejudice that by trying to pre-empt any of the matters around this particular incident."
A Crown Office spokesman said: "The Crown Office is aware of the circumstances relating to the death of Janet McKay and in particular an issue relating to the search for her.
"On this basis the Lord Advocate has referred the matter to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner for investigation under statutory powers."
A post-mortem examination will be carried out on the body found in Clydebank but there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances.
