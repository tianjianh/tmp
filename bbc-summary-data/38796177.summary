Nearly £1m is being given to a town to restore a "messy" street to how it looked in the early 20th Century.

Mansfield in Nottinghamshire is one of only a handful in UK to be earmarked for the cash which marks 50 years of conservation areas.
A grant of £921,600 will be spent restoring buildings around Leeming Street in the town centre.
Heritage consultant Denis Hill said the street had become "a bit of a mess" and the move could boost the local economy.
The Heritage Lottery Fund says it has invested more than £288m of National Lottery money in more than 439 projects conserving and renewing historic town areas, from Denbigh in North Wales to Whitechapel, London.
Natasha Ley, from Heritage Lottery Fund, said selection for the £17m fund been "hugely competitive" with only a third of applications being successful.
"These schemes should aim to halt and reverse the decline of historic townscapes by creating attractive, vibrant and interesting places where in the future people will want to live, work, visit and invest.
"This will be achieved by funding physical works to repair and enhance the historic area in order to encourage business confidence, by providing local people with the opportunity to learn new skills, and by inspiring the local community to take an interest in and get involved with their townscape heritage."
Mr Hill, who had worked with the Mansfield Businesses Improvement District, said: "Owners have made lots of changes to these buildings, particularly with big windows, and frankly it looks a bit of a mess.
"We will restore these frontages and promote their heritage. Once people realise the importance of the area it is easier to market it, visitors come and the economy improves."
Once final plans are approved, the money is expected to become available in spring 2018.
