[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 3-2 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow survived a Chester fightback to bank a deserved 3-2 win at Holker Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bluebirds did the damage in the latter stages of the first half, as firstly Ross Hannah capitalised on a poor back-pass by Elliott Durrell and rounded Liam Roberts expertly to put his side in front.
Just two minutes later, Jordan Williams headed in a second after Roberts failed to parry a Liam Hughes shot to safety.
Williams remained "on fire" after the break, cutting inside before unleashing a spectacular third.
Chester unexpectedly rallied midway through the second period and James Akintunde slid in to pull one back after a goalmouth scramble, before three minutes later setting up Theo Vassell to halve the deficit - but Barrow held on for maximum points.
