[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucestershire v Durham: Paul Collingwood scores 97 for visitors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Collingwood scored 97 for Durham but Gloucestershire fought back to end day three with a small lead in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beginning on 270-4, Collingwood put on 65 runs with Michael Richardson (57) before Craig Miles (5-99) made the breakthrough and Durham reached 419.
Their first-innings lead of 116 did not last though, with Chris Dent (64 not out) and Will Tavare (55) putting on 85 runs for the home side's second wicket.
Durham plugged away but Gloucestershire reached the close with a 59-run lead.
Collingwood suffered a finger injury fielding in the slip cordon on day two, but the 40-year-old showed no ill signs as he hit 10 fours in a 178-ball stay at the crease before being caught off Graeme van Buuren's bowling three runs shy of a century.
His innings gave Durham a handy lead, but after Chris Rushworth pinned opener Cameron Bancroft lbw for 13, the away side's bowling attack were halted as the in-form Dent passed 50 for the seventh time in his past nine innings.
