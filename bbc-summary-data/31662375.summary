New Deepcut inquest into death of Cheryl James delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision over when a fresh inquest can start over the death of Pte Cheryl James at Deepcut barracks in Surrey has been delayed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old from Denbighshire was found dead in November 1995 with a single bullet wound to the head.
A previous inquest recorded an open verdict, however, a new inquest was ordered in July.
During a pre-inquest review at the High Court a barrister for Surrey Police requested the new inquest was delayed.
The force wants the delay in case applications for fresh inquests into the deaths of three other soldiers at Deepcut - Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson - are made.
The hearing has now been delayed for at least four weeks.
Pte James's parents - who believe their daughter suffered sexual harassment and violence - want the new inquest into her death to be held separately and as soon as possible.
