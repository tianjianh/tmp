"Nicky is a fantastic addition," Charlton boss Russell Slade told the club website.
"He's a proven goalscorer, is very strong in the box and has got a great work ethic as well."
Ajose, who began his career at Manchester United and has had spells at Peterborough and Leeds, is Charlton's fourth signing of the summer.
He has also previously spent time on loan at Bury, Scunthorpe, Chesterfield, Crawley and Crewe.
