The 22-year-old has been an ever-present for the Scottish Premiership side this season, playing 21 times.
Ripley told Motherwell's website: "I've always said my preference was to stay and see it out.
"I've really enjoyed my time here. We've had some highs and lows, but I think my experience here is making me a better goalkeeper."
Ripley, who has played three times for Boro, had previous loan spells with Oxford United and Bradford City.
Motherwell currently sit eighth in the Premiership table.
