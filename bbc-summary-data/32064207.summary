Celine Dion is returning to the stage in Las Vegas, a year after she put her career on hold "indefinitely" for health and family reasons.

The singer cancelled all performances from August last year after her husband, Rene Angelil, was diagnosed with throat cancer for the second time.
"It was Rene's wish that I come back," Dion wrote in a statement.
"While my family will always be my priority, my fans are just as important to me."
The Canadian star, best know for the Titanic hit My Heart Will Go On, will be back on stage at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 27 August. She last performed there on 29 July 2014.
The 46-year-old singer has been married to Angelil, who is also her manager, since 1994. The couple have three children.
"I look forward to performing again for all of you... and more importantly having Rene there with me," Dion's statement continued.
"Thank you for giving me this time I needed to spend with my family".
In an interview with US TV's Good Morning America, the singer revealed she had been feeding Angelil through a tube since his surgery to have a cancerous tumour removed in December 2013.
"Rene could not talk and he could not swallow; the surgery was major," she said. "I feed him three times a day, I do it myself."
Dion previously took a two-year hiatus from 2000 to 2002 to help care for her husband, now 73, when he was initially diagnosed with throat cancer.
"We live a day at a time," she told ABC News reporter Deborah Roberts. "Nobody knows what the future is holding for us."
Dion has become a regular fixture in Las Vegas, having performed a near five-year residency there from 2003 to 2007.
Her current residency began in 2011. Although it was originally billed as a three-year event, it was extended through to 2019 last year.
It has been confirmed the singer will resume her residency with 40 performances, to take place between August 2015 and January 2016.
