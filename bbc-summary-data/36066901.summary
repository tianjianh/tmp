The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam for short, began connecting to the station's Tranquillity module at 10.30am (UK time) on Saturday.
It took about four hours for Nasa astronauts to complete the installation.
It looks like a giant pillow and, when its fully inflated at the end of May, it will be large enough to hold a car.
Astronauts will test the module, which is designed by Nasa and Bigelow Aerospace, for two years to see how it holds up in space.
