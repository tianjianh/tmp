Defending Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones could add another medal to the total won by Welsh competitors at Rio 2016 on Thursday.

Jones, 23, became Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion with gold in the -57kg weight category in 2012.
Owain Doull and Elinor Barker are the Welsh competitors who have won gold in Rio with sailor Hannah Mills set to follow and Jones wants further success.
"I'm really hungry for a gold medal," she said.
"There are eight people in my weight that could win the gold medal but I'm confident if I'm relaxed on my day.
"It will be daunting because you've got to be the best you've ever been just on that one day."
Welsh sailor Mills and GB team-mate Saskia Clark are guaranteed gold if they finish the medal race in the 470 sailing.
But they were forced to wait as Wednesday's racing was postponed until Thursday.
Flint-bred Jones beat China's double world champion Yuzhuo Hou in the London 2012 final to become Britain's youngest Olympic champion.
The top seed begins the defence of her -57kg title on Thursday in the round of 16 against Morocco's Naima Bakkal at 14:30 BST.
The quarter-finals, semi-finals and final will be held later on Thursday.
Her main rival is expected to be the second seed Eva Calvo Gomez of Spain, with Jones winning the last two meetings between the pair.
