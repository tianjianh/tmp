[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Myanmar's new parliament will convene on 1 February, two months after voters gave the opposition National League for Democracy a landslide victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The date was announced by the outgoing speaker of parliament Shwe Mann.
Despite the NLD's decisive election win, a quarter of seats in parliament remain reserved for the military, along with key security ministries.
It remains unclear who will be president. NLD head Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the job.
She has said the ban would not stop her "from making all the decisions", and she will sit in parliament as MP for her Kawhmu constituency in Rangoon.
About 30m people were eligible to vote in November's election, which was seen as the most democratic in Myanmar for 25 years.
