The open-air events will be staged at a new outdoor amphitheatre on the marina on 22 July as part of the Hull City of Culture celebrations.
Handel's Water Music will be performed three times at Stage@TheDock theatre.
David Pickard, director of the BBC Proms, said: "I thought it was important, most specifically this year, to mark Hull as a City of Culture."
He said the organisers wanted to make a statement about the Proms being for the whole country.
"I was also looking to expand the initiative we took last year of taking some Proms out of the Albert Hall," said Mr Pickard.

He said he had always wanted to mark the 300th anniversary of Handel's Water Music with "something special".
Hull City Council leader Stephen Brady said: "We are absolutely delighted to have the BBC Proms coming to Hull as part of their 2017 season.
"It is a real honour to have this prestigious event travel out of London for the first time in recent history to our great city during our reign as UK City of Culture 2017.
"The Stage at the Dock will provide a fantastic setting."
The Hull concerts are part of the BBC Prom's new programme called 'Proms at...', which launched in London last year.
This year the annual classical festival at London's Royal Albert Hall will feature music from the Harry Potter films as well as themes from Star Wars, Jaws and Indiana Jones, as part of a concert celebrating the 85th birthday of film composer John Williams.
