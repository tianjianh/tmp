Officials fired tranquillizer darts to control the animal after it damaged dozens of homes, cars and motorbikes.
Local forestry authorities said no-one was hurt in the incident, in the town of Siliguri.
The animal was taken to a park where domesticated elephants are kept and officials have said they hope to return it to the wild.
Eyewitnesses said the animal had strayed into the town from a nearby forest and seemed frightened and confused.
