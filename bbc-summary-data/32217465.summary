Midlothian-based QikServe's Waiter in your Pocket app is being rolled out at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.
It follows a successful pilot scheme at the end of last year.
The rollout is in partnership with HMSHost International, which offers food and drink services to travellers at more than 100 airports worldwide.
The deal means passengers at Schiphol will now be able to order food and drinks in advance while going through security, en route to their gates or when disembarking flights.
Roslin-based QikServe's chief executive and co-founder, Ronnie Forbes, said: "The HMSHost deal is a potentially transformational one for QikServe, adding to our international expansion, and demonstrates the potential for our product to scale."
