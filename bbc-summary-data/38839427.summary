The installation involves people's words being projected on to the barrier's west tower.
Titled The City Speaks, it is the second in a series of temporary commissions marking Hull's year as UK City of Culture.
Hull 2017 chief executive Martin Green said the project celebrated "the voice of the people on an epic scale".
Spectators speak into a microphone at a nearby steel lectern with the words electronically transcribed into text before being illuminated on the landmark.
Artist Michael Pinsky said: "Hull's tidal surge barrier plays a significant role in protecting the city from flooding.
"This installation gives a new voice to the people of Hull and in doing so celebrates resilience and freedom."
Mr Green said the artist had "created an extraordinary visual statement on one of Hull's most prominent landmarks".
The installation runs until 31 December.
