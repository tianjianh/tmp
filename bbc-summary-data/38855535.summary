It had been originally planned that a 24/7 contraflow would be run between Mold Road and Gresford over a six to eight week period.
But the work will now take place at night over five weeks to limit disruption.
The work starts on 13 February, with one carriageway closed at a time.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: "Closing roads for long periods at peak times is never ideal for the economy but is often the only option in terms of delivering the quality infrastructure we need and expect.
"On this occasion, however, I've taken the decision to deliver more medium term improvements to the road, having considered a full closure of this road during working hours to be too detrimental to local communities and the economy."
