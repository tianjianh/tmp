The newsreader, who was also a successful author and playwright, made his first TV appearance as an extra in 1960s satirical series That Was The Week That Was.
He joined ITN in 1965, and was twice voted the UK's most popular newsreader.
Honeycombe went on to spend five years on breakfast show TV-am in the 1980s before he moved abroad.
A statement on the official TV-am archives website said he had been ill for some time.
It said Honeycombe had "spent a few weeks in a specialist care home, but was alert and doing crosswords up to the very end".
The statement added he would "be remembered for his authority, intelligence and wonderful sense of humour and great kindness".
Anne Diamond, Honeycombe's TV-am colleague between 1984 and 1989, said: "I am so sad yet I know he had a great life.
"If you can die having had a brilliant, bright and inspirational life then it can't be a negative thing."
ITV newsreader Mary Nightingale paid tribute on Twitter saying: "Total professional & gentleman with whom I was thrilled to present a programme in 1995."
Newsreader Alastair Stewart added: "Sad to learn of the passing of ITN great Gordon Honeycombe. RIP"
ITN chief executive John Hardie said: "Tonight ITN mourns the passing of one of the UK's most distinguished and revered broadcasters. Gordon Honeycombe, RIP."
Honeycombe was born in Karachi, British India (now Pakistan), in September 1936, but came to Britain with his family after World War Two.
On leaving school, he completed two years of national service, mainly in Hong Kong, where he got his first taste of broadcasting, playing records for fellow soldiers and, later, working as a part-time announcer with Radio Hong Kong.
Honeycombe later graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company, before trying his hand at a TV career.
He joined ITN News in 1965 after a two-minute screen test, and earned Â£25 a week as their main news anchor.
Despite his popularity, he left after 12 years to concentrate on writing, publishing several books and writing TV screenplays, before his five-year stint on TV-am.
Speaking to the Daily Express in 2013, Honeycombe said: "In 1989, I decided to change my life. Although my career was going well, it struck me that I was 53 and time was passing me by.
"Fed up with the British climate, I quit TV-am and emigrated to Perth. Within a year, I was producing and directing a play in the city and incredibly happy."
