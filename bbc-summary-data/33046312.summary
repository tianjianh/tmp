Rail workers on the First Great Western (FGW) line are to vote on strike action amid a dispute over jobs and safety.

The rail union RMT said the ballot was being held over concerns relating to the introduction of new trains.
The union says it wants assurances over jobs, staffing levels and buffet facilities on the new Super Express Trains and for the maintenance contract to be kept in house.
FGW said it would be increasing the number of staff on the trains.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT has made every effort to secure a series of very basic assurances from FGW over jobs, services and safety as a result of the introduction of the new Hitachi fleet and they have simply ignored us.
"FGW... are crashing ahead with the ripping out of buffet cars and the threat to safety-critical station and train staff purely to maximise the profits from new trains bought for them by the British taxpayer."
FGW operations director Ben Rule said: "We are not removing train managers or customer hosts from these trains, and we will be serving hot and cold food and drink on more trains than we do today.
"We are being very clear from the very start. We need every train manager and customer host we have got - plus at least 100 more over the course of the franchise - for our plans to deliver the very best customer service on our long distance services.
"There will be absolutely no compulsory redundancies for those currently working on board these trains."
He added: "We've also promised no changes to pay or conditions of employment, with retraining and redeployment available for those who do no want to make the switch to the newer trains."
The ballot is due to close on 30 June.
First Great Western serves 19 counties in the south and west of England and South Wales.
It is the primary rail operator in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Bristol, Berkshire, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire.
