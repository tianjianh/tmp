Austria's new chancellor has refused to rule out co-operation with the country's far-right Freedom Party.

However the Social Democrat (SPO) Christian Kern said he could not work with any groups that "incite against people and minorities".
He was sworn in on Tuesday, replacing Werner Faymann who quit after losing the support of party colleagues.
The SPO were trounced in the first round of presidential elections last month by the Freedom Party.
The vote was won by the far-right party's candidate Norbert Hofer, who faces a run-off against the Greens' Alexander Van der Bellen for the mostly ceremonial role.
It was the first time since World War Two that candidates from Austria's two main parties, the centre-left SPO and the centre-right People's Party, did not make it to the run-off.
Mr Hofer has suggested that if elected he could use his power to dismiss the government of the day under certain circumstances.
At a news conference, Mr Kern said working with the Freedom Party was possible if certain criteria were met, without specifying what they might be.
He added: "My plan is not to lead the SPO into opposition, the opposite is true.
"But at the end of the day we need an identity and for us it is absolutely unimaginable to work with parties who incite against people and minorities."
Swearing in Mr Kern at a ceremony in Vienna, outgoing President Heinz Fischer said: "You are taking on a great and beautiful but also difficult role with a lot of responsibilities."
