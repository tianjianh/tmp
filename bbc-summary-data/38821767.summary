The 31-year-old has made just nine appearances in all competitions this season for the Clarets, starting just once in the Premier League.
"I didn't get told I could leave until late last night so it was a bit of a rush," said Kightly.
"But it's nice to get a club like Burton and I'm looking forward to playing some football."
