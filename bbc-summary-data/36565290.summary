Nightly closures of the Brynglas tunnels on the M4 motorway in south Wales are starting as over 18 months of maintenance work is carried out.

The closures from 20:00 to 06:00 BST from Monday should only affect traffic in one direction, although at times both tunnels may be closed.
Newport's A48 Southern Distributor Road will be used for diversions.
Economy and Infrastructure Secretary Ken Skates said there was an "ongoing commitment" to improving the motorway.
The work is due to be carried out mainly at night until February 2018, with the M4 scheduled to be closed between junctions 25A for Caerleon and Cwmbran and 26 at Malpas up to five nights a week.
Diversions will be put in place between junction 24 at Coldra and junction 28 at Tredegar Park for through traffic, although local traffic will be allowed to travel up to junctions 25A and 26 to access local routes.
"The M4 is of vital importance to the Welsh economy and this maintenance to the Brynglas tunnels forms part of our ongoing commitment to improving the motorway," said Mr Skates.
"The timing of this work is designed to ensure that it's carried out safely and as quickly as reasonably possible, with minimal possible disruption to road users."
