Reformed girl band All Saints have missed out on the chart top spot, with their comeback album Red Flag entering the UK chart at number three.

The foursome were beaten by The Lumineers, who scored their first number one with Cleopatra.
The US folk-rockers were just 301 sales ahead of Adele's 25, at number two.
In the singles chart, Drake landed his first UK number one as a lead artist with One Dance, followed by Sia and Mike Posner at numbers two and three.
Once again, this year's winner of The Voice struggled to make an impact on the chart.
Kevin Simm, the former Liberty X star who emerged victorious on the BBC talent show on Saturday, reached number 24 with the winner's single All You Good Friends.
Posner's former number one, I Took a Pill in Ibiza, was the most streamed song of the week, despite sitting behind Drake and Sia's Cheap Thrills in the top three in overall sales.
Fifth Harmony's Work from Home fell to number four, while Zara Larsson completed the top five with Lush Life.
The Lumineers described their number one album victory - overtaking the ubiquitous Adele by the narrowest of margins - as "shocking".
"We didn't ever think this would happen," the trio said. "We feel really great because it means people are still buying records and they're into a whole body of work."
All Saints' last appearance in the album charts was in 2006, when Studio One reached number 40.
The '90s hit-makers reformed in 2013, when they joined the Backstreet Boys on tour, and have subsequently returned to the recording studio.
The Deftones - another midweek challenger for this week's top spot - ended up at number five in the album chart with Gore.
That put them one place behind classical singer and presenter Aled Jones, whose One Voice is at number four.
