Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran has made an offer to recruit former Motherwell defender Louis Laing.

Laing, 23, is a free agent and has other offers after leaving Well, who recently loaned him to Notts County.
He previously played for Sunderland, Wycombe and Nottingham Forest.
"It would be to the end of the season and he has a couple of options, once he hears back then we'll know," said Foran.
"He'd be a good one to bring in as we've got a couple of suspensions coming up."
Caley Thistle, who have defender Josh Meekings out for two months following knee surgery, visit Celtic in Saturday's Scottish Cup tie before resuming their Premiership campaign away to Hearts on 18 February.
The Highlanders are three points adrift at the bottom of the division with 14 league games remaining.
"We go there [to Celtic Park] with no pressure - probably the only Premiership team without pressure," added Foran.
"Celtic are through in most people's minds. You're away from the stresses of the league campaign and the boys are looking forward to it.
"Given where we are in the league, it could be draining for some players. Some it will affect, some it won't. I had a go publicly last week and got the response I was after [in the 2-2 draw with Dundee].
"You've got to keep that mindset positive and your breaks will come.
"Celtic are playing with extra pressure on their shoulders going for the treble."
