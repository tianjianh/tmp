A puffer fish has undergone an operation to remove an eye after developing a cataract.

Mini, who has lived at Bristol Zoo for eight years, developed the cataract and "very swollen" eye last year.
Vets decided to operate to remove the fish's eye but because of the "intricacy of the area" had to perform the surgery out of water.
A zoo spokeswoman said it was a "very unusual" operation but Mini was now "back swimming happily in her tank".
Jonny Rudd, the aquarium's assistant curator, said the team of vets "had to move quickly to help" the 13-year-old fish.
"The eye was very swollen so it became apparent she was going to need an operation," he said.
To keep the fish anaesthetized during the hour-long surgery, medicated water was passed over the gills of the fish and the skin kept wet.
Once the anaesthetic had worn off the puffer fish was returned to a tank and given antibiotics and "treats" including mussels and shore crabs.
"The lack of eye doesn't seem to bother her," said Mr Rudd.
"She's an important part of our aquarium family so it's great to see her settled and doing so well."
