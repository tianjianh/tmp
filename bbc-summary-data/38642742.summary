Plymouth 'tombstoner' filmed falling to his death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "tombstoner" was filmed falling to his death while he was five times over the legal drink-drive limit, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vincent Wagstaff, 39, stepped off a ledge rather than leaping into the sea and struck rocks 10m (30ft) below off the Plymouth coast.
Mr Wagstaff asked a friend to record his jump to put it on social media.
Coroner Ian Arrow recorded an accidental death verdict which had been contributed to by alcohol consumption.

An inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court was shown mobile phone footage of Mr Wagstaff jumping off the wall.
Mr Wagstaff could be heard saying "oh no" as he plunged towards the rocks on Thursday 15 October.
The inquest heard his companions cried out and called for an ambulance, but Mr Wagstaff died from multiple injuries.
Mr Arrow said: "I am satisfied that at the time he was significantly intoxicated. He simply stepped off - it was a serious miscalculation."
The coroner said he hoped the publicity surrounding the death would act as a warning to others that alcohol and jumping off high places do not mix and in Mr Wagstaff's case led to "an extremely sad end".
The inquest heard his blood alcohol reading was 403mg - the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg.  Mr Arrow added that some people would have died from the high alcohol level alone.
Speaking after the inquest, Mr Wagstaff's former partner Nikki Rickard, said: "Vince was a loving and caring family man. He was hard working and adored his children.
"He leaves behind three devastated children, a partner, a brother, and family and friends. We are left with a huge gap in our lives that can never be filled. He will always be loved and missed."
