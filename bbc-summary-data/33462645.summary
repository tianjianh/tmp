Aston Villa have signed former Norwich City goalkeeper Mark Bunn on a two-year contract.

The 30-year-old started his career at Northampton Town before joining Blackburn Rovers, but only made 15 appearances for the Ewood Park club.
He joined Norwich in 2012 and played 31 games for the Canaries, but his Carrow Road contract recently expired.
"Aston Villa is a huge football club and this was too good an opportunity to miss out on," he told the club website.
"I'm looking forward to getting to know my new team-mates over in Portugal at our pre-season training camp and I can't wait to get started."
Meanwhile, Villa keeper Shay Given is expected to complete a move to Stoke City.
With Asmir Begovic linked with a move away from the Britannia Stadium, it is understood Given, 39, will be number two to England Under-21 international Jack Butland, who made several first-team appearances towards the end of last season.
It would be the second time the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper has signed for Mark Hughes, who was in charge at Manchester City when Given joined them from Newcastle in 2009.
