Derby 'police assault' caught on camera: IPCC investigates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alleged assault by a police officer which was filmed on a mobile phone is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The footage appears to show a police officer punching a man while he is restrained by two other officers.
It happened in the Pear Tree area of Derby where the man was arrested on 28 July following reports of a disturbance.
The man has since been charged with criminal damage.
A statement from the IPCC said it was "investigating a complaint of alleged assault by a Derbyshire Constabulary police officer".
"The officers concerned have been informed the IPCC is conducting an investigation."
The IPCC revealed that the footage, which was filmed by an onlooker, was emailed to the police force the day after the arrest happened.
However, the matter was only referred to the IPCC in September after the footage was published by the Derby Telegraph.
Derbyshire Constabulary's own Professional Standards Department has investigated the complaint.
The IPCC said it would look at whether the force's own investigation was "proportionate, thorough and effective".
A police spokeswoman said: "We haven't made public the results of our investigation because of the IPCC involvement."
