County Championship: Snow and rain forces day three washout at Chester-le-Street

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Snow, rain and sleet meant there was no play on day three between Durham and Middlesex at Chester-le-Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a morning flurry, a midday inspection was called off as more sleet began to fall.
Umpires Ian Gould and Graham Lloyd conducted two inspections at 15:00 BST and 16:00 BST, with play abandoned after a second look at the outfield.
Durham will be hoping to claim all five batting points when they resume batting on Wednesday.
