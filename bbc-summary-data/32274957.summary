John Moore Museum received £189,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the Old Baptist Chapel, thought to be the UK's earliest Baptist meeting house.
Curator Simon Lawton said the building was "vital to our local heritage".
The work to regenerate the building starts this month and is due to be completed in May 2018.
Nerys Watts, from the Heritage Lottery Fund South West, said: "We're delighted to support the John Moore Museum as they bring their historic chapel back into use for the community and visitors to enjoy."
Mr Lawton said: "We'll also be opening it up for hire to local groups so that the town gets full use of this important, yet hidden, architectural gem."
The museum and the chapel are run by The Abbey Lawn Trust, which owns 23 properties within the precincts of Tewkesbury Abbey.
