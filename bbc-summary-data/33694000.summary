The man was airlifted to the city's Morriston Hospital where a boy, nine, was also taken by ambulance following the incident at 15:40 BST on Tuesday.
South Wales Police confirmed the man had died after being pulled from the water in the Three Cliffs Bay area.
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said: "We were called to reports that a young male had drifted out to sea."
The condition of the boy is unknown.
Two people in wetsuits had managed to drag them to the beach and lifeboat volunteers searched for an hour for a third person reported to be in the water.
No one was found and the lifeboat was stood down.
Matt Horton, RNLI senior lifeguard manager, said the thoughts and prayers of the RNLI team were with the man's family "at this difficult time".
He issued a warning to other people about the rip currents in the area, adding: "A rip is a strong current of water running out to sea that can quickly drag you out beyond your depth.
"They can sometimes be identified by a channel of churning, choppy water or debris on the sea's surface."
