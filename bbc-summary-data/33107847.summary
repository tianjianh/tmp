Historic Picture House in Campbeltown set for revamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to revamp and reopen one of Europe's most historic cinemas now look certain to go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Picture House in Campbeltown has now raised almost all the Â£3m it needs for a major refurbishment.
The cinema, which opened in 1913, closed last year. It is hoped restoration will begin later this year.
Campbeltown Community Business, which runs the cinema, has secured money from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Creative Scotland and Historic Scotland.
Contributions have also been made from various trusts, foundations and corporate donors as well as Argyll and Bute Council.
In recent months efforts have been made at securing additional funding from other sources.
Now the money has been raised, the work should go out to tender later in the summer.
The A-listed cinema on Campbeltown's waterfront described itself for many years as the "oldest continuously-run purpose-built cinema in Scotland".
The cinema in Bo'ness is older but was closed for many years.
The Picture House closed its doors in August last year so the community business could focus its efforts on raising money for the refurbishment and modernisation of the building, which is in need of repair.
The charity's plans include the building of a small, second auditorium to allow a wider range of films to be shown, along with a cafe and an exhibition area.
The redevelopment of The Picture House comes alongside the wider redevelopment of the Campbeltown area which has suffered years of economic and physical decline.
A major restoration project is currently underway at the Town Hall.
Meanwhile the last year of a three year pilot to test the market for a ferry service to Ayrshire is currently under way.
