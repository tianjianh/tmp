A man who rampaged through a Dundee mosque while on licence for seriously assaulting his sister has been returned to prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Skene grappled with worshippers and headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December.
Skene, 38, was ordered to complete 156 days of the unexpired portion of his jail term for breaching his licence.
He was also sentenced to a year's supervision following his release.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: "I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers", to the Muslim congregation after being arrested.
In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene was seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepared to enter the prayer room.
Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: "His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down."
Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him.
Mrs Gilmartin said: "There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room.
"The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them.
"He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts 'I'm white but I'm one of you'."
Ross Donnelly, defending, said: "He is very apologetic."
Skene admitted charges of breach of the peace and resisting arrest.
Allegations that the offence was religiously aggravated were deleted by the Crown.
The court was told Skene had already spent 10 weeks on remand for the offence.
