A rare lunar rainbow - or moonbow - has been photographed in the skies over northern England.

Ben Gwynne captured the sight on the moors above Skipton, North Yorkshire at about 19:40 GMT.
Lunar rainbows are formed when moonlight, rather than direct sunlight, is refracted by moisture in the atmosphere.
On Sunday, a Hunter's Moon - also known as a blood moon - lit up skies over the UK.

Mr Gwynne had stopped to take some photos of the supermoon when he caught sight of the rare moonbow.
"We'd gone into the Dales to take pictures and stopped on the way back to photograph the moon over some trees," he said.
"I'd never seen one before and getting to photograph it was amazing."

According to National Geographic, the hunter's supermoon is the first of three giant moons that we will see over the next few months.
The next full moon on 14 November will also be the largest full moon in the 21st century so far.
