A Welsh Labour MP has warned air strikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria could radicalise more young Muslims in the UK and Europe.

Islwyn MP Chris Evans told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics Wales he feared strikes would create more refugees.
MPs backed UK military action by 397 votes to 223 on Wednesday.
All of Wales' 11 Conservative MPs supported the air strikes. Leader Andrew RT Davies said they were necessary for national security.
Stephen Doughty, the Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, backed the action but his constituency assembly colleague Vaughan Gething said he was undecided.
Mr Gething said: "I don't think anyone with hand on heart can say we are absolutely guaranteed we are safer for action or that we can guarantee that we are safer than if we don't take action given that we are already a target."
