Football's ugliest spitting incidents after Jonny Evans v Papiss Cisse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spitting is seen by many as the ultimate footballing crime.

Forget about a leg-breaking tackle or even a well placed head butt.
A bit of phlegm leaves a nasty stain on the offenders' character as well as the victim's shirt (or mullet).
As the FA waits to decide whether to hand Papiss Cisse and Jonny Evans a ban for unloading on each other on Wednesday night, Newsbeat looks at five of the best (or worst) football spitting incidents.
Cisse has apologised for his part in the incident.
"I have apologies to make to a lot of people today," he said. "Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny.
"I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry."
The most famous of the lot took place at the Italy World Cup between two countries known to not get along.
Both players were sent off for a bit of argy-bargy - at which point an enduring World Cup image was secured as Rijkaard ran past Rudi Voller and landed a ball of spit which got caught in the German's iconic mullet.
Liverpool fined El Hadji Diouf a couple of weeks' wages for spitting at Celtic fans during a Uefa Cup quarter-final.
A Celtic fan called Anthony painted a grim picture when he told BBC Scotland: "One young lad, about 16, got the brunt of it in the face."
Patrick Vieira was banned for six matches and fined Â£45,000 in 1999 after he was sent off, accused of spitting on West Ham's Neil Ruddock.
Admittedly two games of that ban were for starting on a police officer in the tunnel after the game, but it's the spitting incident that sticks in the memory.
Ronaldo was in his final season at United when he decided he'd had enough of Robbie Savage.
The blonde Derby irritant tackled the Portuguese goal machine and while Ronaldo was on his knees pictures appeared to show him gobbing at Savage.
Robbie was nonplussed saying: "I've got absolutely no problem with him. Nothing happened."
Even the world's greatest player isn't immune from a spot of spitting.
During the match the Argentine had a running battle with Malaga midfielder Duda, which led to the multiple world player of the year winner spitting on his back as he was running away.
The player missed it, the cameras didn't.
