Stephen Carson killing: Man to face gun charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the murder of 28-year-old Stephen Carson have charged a man with possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 39-year-old is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Mr Carson was shot dead in his house in Walmer Street in the Ormeau Road area last week.
Earlier on Tuesday, two west Belfast men appeared in court charged with Mr Carson's murder.
Michael Smyth, 37, from Ardmonagh Gardens, and David Smyth, 32, from Monagh Drive appeared at Belfast Magistrates Court.
A judge was forced to clear the court for a time as police were called in to restore order and move members of the public out during the hearing.
There was shouting when the defendants appeared.
When the court resumed the two defendants were remanded in custody to appear in court again via video link later this month.
