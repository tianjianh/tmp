Firefighters and police were called to the Claire House children's hospice store in Bromborough, Wirral, at about 03:40 GMT.
A passer-by had seen smoke pouring from a broken window and dialled 999.
No one was injured but the building was badly damaged in what Merseyside Police are treating as a deliberately-started fire. The force has launched an appeal for witnesses to come forward.
Det Insp Paul Parry said: "The charity which is based there will inevitably be disrupted and that is a great shame when it does so much good in the local community.
"Someone out there will know who has done this and I would urge them to do the right thing and come forward."
