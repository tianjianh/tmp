The group were among more than 100 from a college in Pune who had gone for a picnic to Murud beach near Alibag, Maharashtra state.
The victims were aged between 19 and 23 and police said they were working to identify the bodies.
Murud beach is popular with locals who prefer the area to the more tourist-focused state of Goa.
Pictures showed the bodies of those who died being dragged from the water.
Police said they were continuing to search for other victims. It is believed those who drowned were surprised by a sudden low tide.
