[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 2-2 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oliver Turton grabbed a late equaliser for Crewe Alexandra as they came from two down to draw with Blackpool at Bloomfield Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crewe started brightly but Blackpool struck after eight minutes when Brad Potts crossed for Nathan Delfouneso, who headed past Ben Garratt from six yards.
But Garratt was on hand two minutes later to prevent the hosts doubling the lead as he denied Kyle Vassell from close range.
The Seasiders were two to the good after 27 minutes, as the ball broke to centre-back Tom Aldred 12 yards out, and he thumped it into the bottom corner.
The Alex continued to threaten and should have scored after 44 minutes, when Chris Dagnall failed to turn home Callum Cooke's cross from a yard out.
David Artell's side did halve the deficit after 62 minutes. A fast counter-attack cut Blackpool open and Dagnall bundled home the rebound after Sam Slocombe saved from George Cooper.
And Crewe snatched their equaliser with two minutes remaining as Jordan Bowery nodded down for Turton to volley past Slocombe from 12 yards.
