Darlington 1883 will return to play in the town for the first time since the end of the old club in 2012, after a move to Blackwell Meadows was passed by the Football Association.

Boxing Day's game against Halifax Town will be the first to be staged at the home of Darlington RFC.
The Quakers' pre-2012 Northern Echo Arena home is owned by the town's other union team, Darlington Mowden Park.
Since reforming in 2012, home games have been played at Bishop Auckland.
"It is the culmination of a lot of hard work," said director Richard Cook. "We are also looking forward to a long and happy working relationship with Darlington Rugby Club."
Mike Wilkinson, chairman of the rugby club who have helped carry out the Blackwell Meadows ground-share, said: "We are delighted that we have now got to the point where rugby and football will be played at Blackwell Meadows.
"It is a good Christmas present for the supporters of both clubs and the town in general. Everyone is looking forward to 2017."
