A 33-year-old man was winched to safety in Llandygai near Bangor, and a woman was helped by firefighters from her stranded car in Beaumaris, Anglesey.
Meanwhile, a river in Llanrwst, Conwy, burst its banks leaving engineers unable to access cables.
Scottish Power is trying to reconnect 700 homes.
Elsewhere, Arriva Trains Wales cancelled services to Chester after a bus shelter blew on to the tracks in Llanfairfechan, Conwy.
Trains have also been cancelled between Bangor and Holyhead because of flooding at several locations, particularly at Bodorgan on Anglesey.
An inspection of the track will be carried out at 08:00 GMT on Sunday, the company added.
North Wales Police said the driver in Llandygai raised the alarm at about 13:15 GMT on Saturday.
He had been swept downstream near the A5 and was found by the coastguard helicopter on the roof of his car and clinging to a tree.
Meanwhile, wind gusts of 83mph were recorded in Capel Curig, Snowdonia.
Scottish Power said engineers were working to restore supplies, with the worst affected areas in Conwy county and Corwen, Denbighshire.
But he added winds were very high, which was making it difficult for engineers to carry out the repairs in some places.
Faults in the electricity supply have also been reported at Bala, Gwynedd, and Trefriw and Llanrwst in Conwy county.
Natural Resources Wales has issued flood warnings and a Met Office yellow "be aware" warning for wind and rain runs until 09:00 GMT on Sunday.
North Wales Police had to close a number of streets surrounding Mostyn Champneys Retail Park, Llandudno, Conwy, after wind damaged Currys and Home Bargains.
The A477 Cleddau Bridge, Pembrokeshire, remains closed to high-sided vehicles and Arriva Trains Wales has warned of possible disruption on routes including Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Shrewsbury to Machynlleth on the Cambrian Line.
The bad weather follows on from Thursday night when fire crews attended a number of flooding incidents across Wales.
In one incident, a man was rescued from the roof of his car after getting stuck in flood water in Swansea, while flooding had closed the A490 in Welshpool, Powys, in both directions.
