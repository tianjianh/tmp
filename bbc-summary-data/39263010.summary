Morecambe 1-2 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shay McCartan took his season's tally to seven goals as Accrington Stanley won at Morecambe in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Accrington had the better first-half chances as Noor Husin hit the inside of the post, while McCartan's 20-yard free-kick saw them lead at half-time.
The hosts, who failed to have a shot on target in the first half, went two down when Alex Whitmore's mistake allowed McCartan to run in for his second.
Andrew Fleming set-up Aaron Wildig's for a Morecambe consolation goal.
Victory for Accrington lifts them above Morecambe into 14th in the table.
Stanley had to wait until first-half injury time to go ahead after seeing Sean McConville and McCartan fire over the bar inside the first 10 minutes.
After scoring once in his first 21 matches of the season, McCartan continued his recent goalscoring spree by taking his tally to six goals in his last nine games.
Fleming's clever through-ball saw Wildig poke in to reduce the arrears, but Accrington held on to extend their unbeaten run to nine matches.
