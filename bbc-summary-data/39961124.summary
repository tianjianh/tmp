Nottingham-born Hawkridge helped Lincoln to the National League title this season and also starred as they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals.
Hawkridge, 27, said: "It was a tough decision to leave Lincoln but I feel I have unfinished business here having been released as a kid.
"It's my home city - I'm originally from Top Valley - so I am buzzing."
Manager Kevin Nolan added: "I'm absolutely delighted. We're looking for him to carry on his form from last season, when he showed tremendous confidence and ability.
"He's an exciting player who will hopefully get the fans off their seats."
