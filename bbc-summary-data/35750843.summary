Six Nations 2016: 'Glasgow will soften Scots rejection'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tim Swinson says turning out for Glasgow Warriors will soften the blow if he is not named in the Scotland side for the Six Nations clash with France.

The lock has had to settle for a place on the bench throughout the tournament so far, with Richie and Jonny Gray forming the second row.
"It's not really a bad decision," Swinson said.
"One is I get to play for my country which is fantastic; the other one I get to play for my club with great guys."
Swinson, who has been capped 20 times by Scotland, is still aiming to force his way into Vern Cotter's team for the remaining matches with the French at Murrayfield on Sunday and away to Ireland the following weekend.
"For me personally I have to focus on training well and hopefully getting picked."
Having made his Scotland debut in 2013 during the summer tour of South Africa, Swinson has not started a match for the national side since the Six Nations defeat to Italy at Murrayfield 12 months ago.
But the 29-year-old says his desire to be picked for Scotland is matched by his ambition to bring success to the Warriors.

"It's not about playing for yourself or trying to impress someone," Swinson explained.
"Its about playing for Glasgow and standing up for your mates.  We're about working hard and moving forward and if you play like that everyone will get better.
"If you enjoy your rugby that's when you play your best."
The PRO12 champions have endured a frustrating defence to their title but have won their last three matches to move within eight points of the play-off spots, with two games in hand on the teams around them.
After beating Cardiff Blues last weekend, Swinson believes Glasgow are starting to show the kind of form that could yet see them retain their title.
"It's still in our own hands.  We've got a good run coming up against teams that we beat last year and this year.
"We know on our day that we are one of the best teams in the league if not the best.  When we play well we are really competitive and if we put that together over the next 10-12 weeks we'll be fantastic."
