[SN]TITLE[SN]
Decode the news in emojis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every Friday we bring you the week's news in emojis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We're being strict on ourselves and only using the standard emoji set approved by the people at Unicode.
This week there are animals, lots of 'em. And some Christmas parcels. Can you work them out?
If you get stuck, check the answers at the bottom of the page.
1 - Lewis Hamilton becomes Formula 1 word champion for the second time (and tells Newsbeat all about his music plans, you can listen to that on Soundcloud)
2 - Animal rights campaigners in Switzerland get angry about the apparent rural tradition of eating... cats.
3 - A stray dog gets so excited by a group of Swedish adventurers' lunch, it follows them for miles and miles AND MILES around Ecuador.
4 - In 2012 politician Andrew Mitchell shouts at a policeman in a row over a gate and a bike. For the next two years everyone, err, argues about what exactly was said during the, err, argument. After yet more arguing, a judge says Mr Mitchell  did use the word pleb (a word used to describe someone of a low social class). It all means the ex Tory minister must now pay Â£1.5m in legal fees.
5 - #BlackFriday is now a thing in the UK as well as America. It's a day where shoppers come together to mark the true meaning of Christmas - by fighting over half-price TVs and bargain computer consoles on the escalators in department stores. (Here's how Black Friday got its name)
