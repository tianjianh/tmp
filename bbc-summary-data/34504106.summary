Amazon, along with Swansea University's new campus and the Bay Studios are on Fabian Way which crosses the Neath Port Talbot and Swansea council boundary.
The planned Â£1bn Swansea Bay Tidal lagoon will also end near the road.
Now, the aim is to attract research, development and technology companies who can fill vacant land and make the most of what is already there.
Swansea and Neath Port Talbot councils are looking at how they can work together more closely on planning for the route.
"There's a game-changing opportunity to transform Fabian Way into an innovation corridor that will greatly benefit local people and the Swansea Bay City region as a whole," said Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration.
Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas added: "Opportunities such as the new Bay Campus only come along once in a lifetime. We are committed to working together to make the most of these developments to benefit communities and businesses in the whole of the region."
Both councils will consider a draft document for working together and then a public consultation will take place.
