Middlesbrough's defensive "naivety" cost them in Wednesday's 4-2 Premier League defeat by Hull City, says head coach Steve Agnew.

Despite taking an early lead the Teessiders were 3-2 down at half-time.
"You can't question the attitude, commitment and effort, it was first class," Agnew told BBC Tees.
"But we were a bit naive at times defensively, not just the back four, as a team. So we all take responsibility for that and look forward to Burnley."
England defender Ben Gibson was culpable for the first two goals having failed to clear, while Hull's fourth goal came as Harry Maguire was unchallenged in the penalty area.
The defeat left Boro in 19th place after 30 games, seven points behind Hull, who are one place above the relegation zone.
Middlesbrough welcome Burnley to the Riverside on Saturday.
