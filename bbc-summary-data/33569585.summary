Welsh Water-owned Elan Valley, near Rhayader, started the process to become an International Dark-Sky Park in 2012.
The Brecon Beacons National Park was the first in Wales to be certified a dark sky reserve in 2013 and is recognised as an ideal site for stargazing in its bid to boost tourism.
More than 200 light readings were taken at 13 sites at Elan Valley over 22 months to show it fits the criteria.
Elan Valley Astronomy said the estate had become the world's first privately-owned but publicly accessed International Dark-Sky Park.
"We now want to expand the dark sky area to cover the whole of the Cambrian Mountains," said Kris Fry, a local amateur astronomer who helped put the bid together with Welsh Water.
