The 24-year-old former Tottenham trainee scored nine goals in 78 appearances during three years with Boro.
"I've liked Dean ever since he was at Spurs," Dons boss Neal Ardley told the club website.
"He's very dynamic, very quick and technically excellent. I think he has goals in him."
Parrett is Wimbledon's fourth signing of the summer following their promotion to the third tier via the League Two play-offs.
The Dons have not disclosed the length of Parrett's deal at Kingsmeadow.
Meanwhile, academy goalkeeper Will Mannion has left south-west London to join Hull City, with a compensation fee set to be decided by a tribunal.
