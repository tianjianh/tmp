Libya: MP wants clarity from Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness over Gaddafi support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott has called on the deputy first minister to give details of what level of support Libya offered the IRA during the Troubles.

Speaking at Westminster, the MP said that it appeared that Martin McGuinness "is not prepared to do that".
Mr Elliott called on Sinn Féin to be absolutely clear on "where they stood and what they have done in the past".
Sinn Féin described his remarks as "stunt politics".
Mr Elliott made his remarks during a debate about Libyan-sponsored terrorism.
The debate was proposed by Conservative MP James Cartlidge.
The DUP MP, Gavin Robinson, said the campaign to compensate families was about "fairness, justice and transparency ".
DUP MP Ian Paisley said those seeking compensation were often frustrated by a lack of information.
The North Antrim MP said getting answers from officials in the Foreign Office was like trying "to catch a slippery eel".
He said the families were "sick and tired of the dilly-dallying of delays".
Ian Paisley also suggested that the British government compensate victims now and then recoup the money at a later date from Libya. He said this would "allow us to expedite compensation".
North Down MP Lady Hermon raised the issue of frozen Libyan assets believed to be in the region of £8bn.
Lady Hermon asked if they could be used to compensate victims and whether the money could be accessed in light of Brexit.
Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said the frozen monies were subject to a "myriad of regulations" and the question of using the assets would have to be approached carefully.
UUP MP Danny Kinahan said openness and speed were required in this matter.
South Down MP Margaret Ritchie told MPs that Libyan behaviour in the past was "immoral, unacceptable and wrong" and that victims rights must be supported by all political parties.
Lawrence Robertson, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs committee,  said that "to leave their pariah status behind Libya have to pay compensation".
In response to the comments from Mr Elliott, a Sinn Féin spokesperson said: "Victims of the conflict and their families have a right to the truth about the past.
"However, it is the British government who are causing the delay by insisting on the continued cover-up of British state murder and collusion through the use of a bogus 'national security' veto on disclosure.
"The British government must honour their commitments from the Stormont House Agreement and offer maximum disclosure to victims and families.
"This latest contribution by Tom Elliott, however, comes straight from the Gregory Campbell school of stunt politics and is the latest example of a unionist MP trying desperately to be relevant from their retirement home in Westminster."
Family members and supporters watched the debate from the public gallery including Andrew Mackinlay the former Labour MP who has campaigned for compensation for victims.
The United States negotiated a significant financial package for victims of the Pan Am jet brought down over Lockerbie and those killed in a Berlin disco bombing blamed on Libyan agents but UK victims were left out of a deal.
Victims of IRA bomb attacks say they are entitled to money from the frozen bank accounts of Gaddafi.
