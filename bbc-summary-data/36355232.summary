County Championship: Middlesex openers Robson & Gubbins dominate Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Robson continued his fine form at Lord's this season as his unbeaten 67 helped Middlesex reached 139-0 at the end of day two against Somerset.

The visitors resumed on 219-2 but soon lost Chris Rogers as Tim Murtagh (5-53) had him caught behind for 109.
Peter Trego and Lewis Gregory's century sixth-wicket stand, after a fiery spell from Murtagh, helped Somerset to 376.
Robson and Nick Gubbins (65no) then batted out the remainder of the day to put Middlesex in a commanding position.
Somerset batsmen Rogers, James Hildreth and Jim Allenby all fell to seamer to Murtagh within four overs and the hosts wrestled back some of the control that the visitors had taken on the first day.
The Ireland international claimed his fourth scalp of the day as he bowled Trego before claiming his first five-wicket haul of the season as Ryan Davies drove him to mid-on.
As Middlesex's innings began Robson timed the ball well, on a ground where he had already scored three centuries in three Championship innings so far this season.
Despite being dropped on 54, Robson rarely looked troubled and Gubbins played equally well at the other end as the pair racked up the runs on a sunny second day.
