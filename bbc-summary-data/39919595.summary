More than 4,000 pipers and drummers from across the UK, as well as Canada, Denmark and Ireland, are to compete in the championships on Saturday 20 May.
It is hoped the free event, which includes a food market and a children's entertainment zone, will help Paisley's bid to be UK City of Culture 2021.
Thousands of spectators are expected at the event in St James Playing Field.
Paisley 2021 Bid Director Jean Cameron said: "Events like this are important for the UK City of Culture 2021 bid as it shows Paisley has the infrastructure and know-how to host large-scale events.
Ian Embelton, of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, said: "We are pleased to be back in Paisley for another year and delighted to have another huge turnout from bands.
