The 21-year-old has signed a performance-related contract and will now link up with the club's Under-21 squad.
Gambian-born Barrow moved to Sweden as a youngster and scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for Ostersunds last season.
"I'm delighted to be here," Barrow said.
"I now can't wait to get going and improve each day in training and try to score some goals.
"I like the way Swansea play football, it reminds me of how I used to play back home. I've watched a lot of their games on TV and I was impressed with what I saw."
