Craig Meschede: John Derrick tips Glamorgan all-rounder for England

Former Glamorgan coach John Derrick has tipped all-rounder Craig Meschede to be the county's next England player.

Meschede, 24, has targeted a place in the second-string England Lions team since joining Glamorgan from Somerset.
But Derrick feels the South Africa-born player, who was on loan with the Welsh county in 2015, can aim higher.
"He could be the next guy from Glamorgan that actually plays for England in any sort of cricket. I liked what I saw last year," said Derrick.
Meschede played in all but one of Glamorgan's matches while on loan last season, across all three formats, scoring 655 runs in first-class cricket and claiming 43 wickets.
He hit the headlines by claiming the wicket of Kevin Pietersen on the former England batsman's county comeback.
But Derrick, who left as Glamorgan coach in November, 2006, believes the Welsh county did not make the most of Meschede's talents.
Fast bowler Simon Jones was Glamorgan's last England player, memorably helping them to win the 2005 Ashes series against Australia.
But Alex Wharf was the last Glamorgan player to play international limited-overs cricket and Derrick sees Meschede as filling a similar role for England.
"Glamorgan started a couple of games with him opening up in T20 stuff," said Derrick.
"But I would have persevered with that and I think looking back to someone like when Wharfy got into that England side and he batted at three and bowled a heavy ball.
"And someone like Meschede can probably look to follow that.
"So I think that's a very, very good signing for Glamorgan and if I was a betting man I think he would be the one I would be looking at to push on for England honours in the next couple of years."
