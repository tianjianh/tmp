Welterweight world champion Brook, 30, is jumping two weight divisions to challenge for Golovkin's WBC and IBF belts in London on Saturday.
At the weigh-in, Brook scaled 159.4lb, just under the 160lb middleweight limit, while Golovkin scaled 158.9lb.
"I'm entering unknown territory but I'm full of energy and will be explosive with the extra pounds," Brook said.
"There's a lot of politics in boxing and it's destroying the game. And if you can't get massive fights at your weight, you may have to jump a division or two."
Brook rejected comparisons with Amir Khan's fight against Saul Alvarez in May, when the Bolton boxer also jumped from welterweight to middleweight only to be knocked out in the sixth round.
"Khan is a small guy and was coming up to the weight. I'm coming down to make middleweight and am feeling fit and strong," said Brook.
"I'm a world champion, I've beaten everyone I've been in with and I want to test myself. I haven't got years and years left so I want to compete against the best."
About 1,000 fans watched Brook and Golovkin weigh in at London's O2, with the usually affable Kazakh looking deadly serious.
Golovkin, 34, has won 32 of his 35 professional fights by knockout, including the past 22, while IBF welterweight champion Brook is unbeaten in 36.
Among his victims were Brook's fellow Britons Martin Murray and Matthew Macklin, although question marks remain over the calibre of his opposition.
"This fight is so huge because it has a certain mystique," said Brook's promoter Eddie Hearn.
"Does Golovkin hit as hard as everybody says he does? Does he deserve his number one pound-for-pound tag? Has Kell Brook got these other levels we haven't seen yet? I believe he has."
Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle believes Golovkin could be complacent, having had it all his own way for so long.
"The fighters who have longevity in the sport are the pure boxers and not the punchers," said Ingle.
"Punchers eventually get beat, because they rely on their power too much above everything else. Their advantage becomes their disadvantage."
Also on a packed bill at the O2 is Lee Haskins' IBF bantamweight defence against fellow Briton Stuart Hall, while Charlie Edwards will challenge John Riel Casimero for the IBF flyweight title in only his ninth paid fight.
