Burnley striker Sam Vokes hopes the club's promotion to the Premier League will seal his place in Wales' Euro 2016 squad.

On Monday Vokes scored the winning goal - his 15th of the season - as Burnley beat QPR 1-0 to ensure an immediate return to the Premier League.
Vokes, 26, has scored six goals in 39 games for Wales since his 2008 debut.
"It's about doing what you can at club level to get the chance to play for your country," he told BBC Radio Wales.
He continued, "Whenever I get the chance to put the shirt on it's a great honour and I look forward to the squad being announced and to a good summer.
"It made it a lot easier getting promoted automatically because we don't have to go to the play-offs but I'll try to get away on a break before the season starts."
The striker scored 22 goals on the way to Burnley winning promotion from the Championship in 2013-14.
But the former Bournemouth and Wolves forward missed much of last season's Premier League campaign after suffering a serious knee injury in March 2014.
"Being a big part of the Championship season the last time we went up, it was gutting to miss most of that Premier League season through injury," he said.
"It is what it is and you come back stronger. Hopefully I get a crack at it next year and it's great to be part of a squad that's gone up this year."
There was more cause for celebration as Vokes' Wales roommate Andy King clinched the Premier League title with Leicester.
"I texted Andy after the videos came through and they found out they were champions so it was a good afternoon for the room," he added.
"He's a great player and a guy. His achievements with Leicester have been massive to get all those promotions and the titles with the same club."
