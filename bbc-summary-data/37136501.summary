The 19-year-old made one league appearance in a loan spell at Kidderminster last season.
He is yet to make his West Brom debut.
"He comes highly recommended by West Brom," player-manager Kevin Nicholson told Torquay's club website. "They got in touch with us to see whether it is something we would be interested in."
