A major route through Dorset is to close for repairs amid fears it could become unstable and collapse.

Temporary traffic lights have been in place on the A30 in Sherborne since 3 May due to culvert drainage works.
However, Dorset County Council said an investigation found "large amounts of material have been lost from the roof of the culvert, leaving it vulnerable to collapse".
A section of the road will close at the end of the month, it added.
A spokeswoman said it was not yet clear how long the closure would be in place.
"Now that we are aware of the condition of the culvert we cannot walk away from it," she added.
The drainage works on the A30 Newell, at the junction with the B3148 Marston Road - which is a major route through the county between Shaftesbury and Yeovil in Somerset - were originally expected to be completed by 17 June.
