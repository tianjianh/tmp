The 31-year-old former Mansfield trainee spent seven years with Derby, scoring 13 goals in 159 appearances.
"Not only will he be an asset to us on the field, but Jake will also add to the great character within our dressing room," said Latics boss Gary Caldwell.
"He's a top professional with over 300 games to his name and he's chomping at the bit to add to his tally."
The defender made only four appearances for the Rams last season, but was a regular under Nigel Clough and Steve McClaren.
He was a key part of the side which reached the 2014 play-off final and is remembered fondly by Derby fans for his stoppage-time winner against Nottingham Forest in March 2012.
"Derby County it's been an honour. Thank you," Buxton tweeted.
Rams manager Nigel Pearson said: "Although I have only been at the club for a short period of time, I have seen first-hand and am well aware that Jake Buxton has been a fantastic servant for Derby County.
"He had limited playing time last season and, given I couldn't assure him of a regular starting place moving forward, the move to Wigan Athletic is a great opportunity for him."
