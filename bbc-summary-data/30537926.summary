[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man seeks to overturn Inverness murder conviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who has twice been jailed for life after separate juries convicted him of the same murder has sought to have the latest conviction quashed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Geddes, 59, was found guilty of killing his cousin Charles McKay in Inverness in March 2003 following a trial in 2005 and a re-trial in 2013.
Geddes, of Inverness, denies the murder and claims he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice.
He has taken his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh.
For more than a decade, Geddes has denied he was responsible for his cousin's death.
High Court juries have heard that ambulance personnel and police were called to Mr McKay's home in East MacKenzie Park, Inverness.
They found the electrician lying at the foot of a flight of stairs. Geddes, who stayed there from time to time, told them he had found his cousin there.
Although the first reaction was that Mr McKay had died from natural causes, suspicions were aroused when a letter emerged seeking to alter Mr McKay's will so that Geddes would inherit Â£25,000.
It was alleged that a pillow which had been in Mr McKay's bedroom was hurriedly thrown into a dustbin as refuse collectors came down the street.
At hearing at the Court of Criminal Appeal on Thursday, Geddes' solicitor advocate John Scott QC told judges: "I invite the court to accept this is one of those must unusual cases, rare cases, where this court can and should intervene and quash the verdict of the jury as unreasonable."
Mr Scott said there was nothing that pointed to the use of a pillow in Mr McKay's death.
Advocate depute Andrew Stewart QC for the Crown said the flaw in the appeal grounds advanced was that they focused solely on the medical evidence and did not take into account the wider evidence.
Judge Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond have reserved their decision.
Lord Carloway said they would give their decision as soon as they could.
