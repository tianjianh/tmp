Mother hopes judicial review will clear sex-abuse carer son

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judicial review is to be heard into the case of a former boarding school worker who was convicted of child sex abuse a day after he killed himself.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Turk, 54, hanged himself while on trial accused of 16 offences against boys at Frewen College in Northiam, East Sussex, between 1996 and 2002.
He was found guilty on 10 counts and was acquitted on six.
His mother Jasmine Botting has maintained his innocence and hopes next week's hearing will clear his name.
"I know for a fact my son is innocent," she said.
"All I would like to think is that this hearing will go some way towards clearing his name," the 76-year-old, from Etchingham, said.

The judicial review follows criticism from Turk's family that the judge at his trial at Lewes Crown Court allowed jurors to return verdicts after he died.
It is believed to be the first time a dead man has been convicted of a crime in England.
At an inquest in January, a coroner heard Turk had been prescribed anti-depressants and had left suicide notes.
His body was found by his stepfather at his home in Fontridge Lane, Etchingham, on 16 June.
Unmarried Turk was a member of care staff and later head of care at the boarding school, but was not a teacher.
