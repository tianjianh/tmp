Hull's Lynton Avenue residents face council tax hike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents of an entire street are facing a council tax rise because one of their neighbours complained of paying more than everyone else.

But instead of the complainant's tax being lowered, valuation officers have raised everyone else's tax on the street by Â£160 a year.
Homes on Lynton Avenue in Hull have been moved from Band A into Band B.
The government's Valuation Office Agency (VOA) said the tax banding had been reviewed following a complaint.
Residents told the Hull Daily Mail the increase was because one unidentified neighbour complained to the VOA that her rates were too high.
A resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: "All the houses on the street are identical, so we should all be paying the same rate.
"One person on the street was paying a higher rate than everyone else so questioned it with the government and I think they've been a bit cynical.
"Instead of admitting that this person has been overpaying all these years and giving them a refund, they have decided to put everyone else up.
"It's just so typical, if you ask me."
Letters were sent out to each house by the VOA, telling the occupants the homes would be evaluated recently, but rates were raised without further notice.
Council tax bands in England run from A to H, with A being the cheapest, and are calculated according to what the value of the property would have been in April 1991.
Accounts manager Kerry Wilson, 45, who has lived on Lynton Avenue for 16 years, said she and her neighbours would be appealing against the decision.
She said: "We have been in Band A as long as we've lived here.
"The move to band B means our houses would have been valued at more than Â£40,000 in 1991, but there is no way that can be true.
"My husband has found all the house prices from that time and none of them were more than that.
"It's caused a right rumpus and we're making sure everyone in the street will send their letter of appeal in."
Pat Garrett, a 72-year-old who has lived on the street for almost 40 years, said: "As a pensioner, my monthly in-comings aren't going up any time soon and I'll definitely feel the pinch.
"The amount doesn't sound like much, but it makes a big difference when you consider everything else is going up in price too."
A spokesman for the VOA said bands could change as a result of one person expressing concerns about the amount they were paying.
He said: "If a taxpayer contacts us with concerns about their council tax banding, we will review it free of charge.
"We might need to review the bands of similar neighbouring properties to ensure they are correct, which can lead to other properties' bands being changed.
"We alter council tax bands only if evidence indicates they are incorrect, or there has been a physical change to a property or its locality."
Hull City Council offered no comment on the row and pointed out it acted on the Valuation Office Agency's instructions.
