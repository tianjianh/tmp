[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa thrashed Australia by an innings and 80 runs in Hobart on Tuesday to win the three-Test series with a match to spare.

It is South Africa's third successive Test series win in Australia, following victories in 2008-09 and 2012-13.
The hosts resumed on 121-2, 120 runs behind but lost eight wickets in under 20 overs on the fourth morning.
"I am embarrassed. We've lost five Tests in a row and that's humiliating," said Australia captain Steve Smith.
"We are not being resilient, we are not willing to tough it out and get through tough periods. It is not good enough."
Smith, who took 40 minutes to score his first runs of the day and was eventually ninth out after moving his score on from 18 to 31, said his players were not "digging in" and "having the pride in our wicket", adding "I'm quite sick of saying it".
South Africa's Kyle Abbott took 6-77 in the second innings, while Kagiso Rabada claimed 4-34 to leave the hosts facing the prospect of a first series whitewash on home soil.
The tourists won the first Test in Perth by 177 runs and captain Faf du Plessis now wants his side to complete the sweep when the third Test starts at the Adelaide Oval on 24 November.
"That's the mission for us now. We want to do that very badly," he said.
"We've got Australia in a position where they're under pressure and won't let that go. It's hard enough to get them in this position so we'll do everything we can to keep them there."
