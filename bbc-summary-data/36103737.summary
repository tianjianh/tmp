The 20-year-old academy graduate, who can play in midfield and at right-back, will now stay at the Banks's Stadium until at least 2018.
"I'm over the moon to get it sorted, it gives me a bit of stability," Kinsella told BBC WM.
"It's been tough getting in the team this year but I'm learning every day."
Kinsella, son of former Walsall and Aston Villa midfielder Mark, has made 13 appearances for the first team since making his debut against Bradford City in August 2014.
With the Saddlers currently third in League One, three points behind Burton Albion in the second automatic promotion place with a game in hand, Kinsella says the club's success has this season has helped make him a better player.
"The guys have been outstanding this season, it's improving me just being around this sort of atmosphere," Kinsella said. "I just need to take my opportunity when I get a shot."
