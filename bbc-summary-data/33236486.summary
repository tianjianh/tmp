Conwy fairground traveller back from Oxford University

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman from a travelling community who has spent much of her life working at fairgrounds has just completed a three-year degree at Oxford University.

Shelby Holmes, from Towyn, Conwy, described the experience as "absolutely marvellous" if "not exactly the norm" for someone from her background.
The fifth-generation travelling showman won a place to study English literature at Trinity College in 2012 after gaining two A*s and a B in her A-levels.
This was despite missing weeks of school every year because of her family's work.
Ms Holmes had no idea  what to expect from university explaining: "Usually the kids go on to do the family business.
"Families in showmen cultures work as a single business unit and everyone pulls their weight."
So, was it difficult for the girl from the fairground to fit into Oxford's notoriously grand cloisters?
Not at all. Ms Holmes explained: "I didn't really know what to expect.
"Everyone has heard about Oxford and about how posh everyone is and how different everyone is but it didn't take long to find friends and fit in. Everyone was brilliant."
And she credits her time at university for opening her eyes to new possibilities.
She said: "I always used to think that showmen were in this very small corner of the world and I didn't think much about letting people know about us.
"Going to Oxford and seeing all these different kinds of people from different backgrounds, from all sorts of different countries and having that wonderful mix of cultures... I thought, you know what, if all these other people can go to Oxford why can't a few more showmen go?"
Ms Holmes now plans to further her studies with a master's degree in history of art in the hope of realising her "big dream" to manage a house for the National Trust.
But this summer you will find her working at the fair as usual, remaining modest about her achievements.
"I'm not anyone particularly special," she said.
"I just did a bit of work and got into a university that plenty of other people get into.
"I didn't do anything particularly crazy or brave. It was just what I wanted to do."
