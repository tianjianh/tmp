The visitor centre at a Roman museum near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has reopened after a £650,000 revamp.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
English Heritage refurbished Housesteads Visitor Centre in Hexham after an overhaul of the museum at the site last year.
Carole Keltie from English Heritage said the centre would host events over the summer focusing on the period when Housesteads was home to the Roman army.
About 100,000 people visit the attraction each year.
The redevelopment was supported by the National Trust and the Northumberland National Park Authority.
