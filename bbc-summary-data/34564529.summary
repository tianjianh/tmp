Kilmarnock 2-0 Inverness: Josh Magennis writing a 'crazy' story

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This is a real "Roy of the Rovers" story.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of a young goalkeeper who makes the change to striker. Moves to a new club and becomes a defender.
Let go by that club but moves away and returns to the striker role before firing in a goal that helps his country make their way into the European Championship finals.
A bit far fetched it may sound, but this is the real life story of Josh Magennis.
"It's crazy!" Magennis told BBC Scotland. "It was Neil Ardley, who was the academy manager at Cardiff and is now the manager at Wimbledon, who helped me make the transition from goalkeeper.
"He said I had the attributes to be a striker. I managed to knuckle down and find my strengths, which are my pace and power and able to run."
Magennis then made the move north to Aberdeen, where he struggled to hold down a regular spot, although he did have an alternative option.
"We had a tremendous striking group there with Chris Maguire and Scott Vernon who were keeping me out of the team," he said.
"Assistant manager Archie Knox said there was a vacant position at right back and I ended up playing around 30 games in that position."
Magennis, though, fell out of favour when Derek McInnes took over and, after a spell on loan at St Mirren, he joined Kilmarnock, where he has found his shooting boots once again, netting as Kilmarnock defeated Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2-0 at Rugby Park.
In addition, he scored his first goal for Northern Ireland in their recent win over Greece in Belfast. A win that took Michael O'Neill's side to next year's finals in France.
Magennis says he will not look too far ahead and just try to concentrate on helping Kilmarnock up the league table and hope that, when the squad is named next year, he will be one of those on the plane.
"I can't get ahead of myself thinking I will be one of the 23 man squad," he added.
"That would just be insulting to the rest of the lads.
"It is up to me to make sure I am in peak condition for my club and hopefully keep scoring goals.
"It is up to myself to show the manager that in the domestic level and then, if I am picked to go away for the upcoming international friendlies, that I am ready to be part of the squad."
