In pictures: Transforming a scarred landscape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
How do you repair a landscape ravaged by years of mining? The people of Lusatia, an area on the eastern side of Germany scarred by years of lignite mining, have come up with a novel plan.

After the reunification of Germany, 12 out of the 17 mines shut down, leaving huge open pits across the landscape.
Since then, however, then has been a programme to flood these quarries, turning Lusatia into Europe's largest artificial lake district.
Over the past three summers, photographer Freya Najade has documented this process of transformation.
Her images capture cheery holidaymakers on their way to swim in the lakes.
However, the past is never far away - billowing cooling towers sit behind newly built parks, and ice cream stalls nestle among colossal mining equipment.
And the burgeoning tourist trade respects this history, with one photograph showing a guided coach tour exploring the industrial areas.
With more than 20 lakes already built, Najade's photographs capture a Lusatia suspended between its past and its future states.
Jazorina by Freya Najade is published by Kehrer Verlag.
