[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was walking along Union Street close to the "four corners" at about 23:25 on Wednesday when he was attacked.
Police Scotland said the suspect then headed off towards Argyle Street where he may have got into a taxi.
Officers believe the attacker had a three-wheel shopping trolley or support frame with him at the time.
It is also thought he was in the company of two other men who were not involved in the incident.
He is described as a white man aged 20-25, of medium height and build. He was wearing dark clothing with white trainers and a Tammy hat.
The victim is being treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where his condition has been described as stable. Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
