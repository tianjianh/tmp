Leyton Orient have removed player-manager Kevin Nolan from his managerial role, placing Andy Hessenthaler in charge of the first team.

Nolan, 33, has won seven of his 15 games since joining the O's in January.
Orient have taken one point from their last four games but remain two points off the League Two play-off places.
"We believe Kevin will be able to make a bigger impact without the distraction of managerial duties," Orient chief executive Alessandro Angelieri said.
Nolan became the youngest manager in the Football League when he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the east London club, who were relegated from League One last season.
Speaking after Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Barnet, Nolan told BBC Radio London his side were "playing with a fear" and "suffering from a lack of confidence".
The former Newcastle and West Ham midfielder has made 14 appearances for Orient, starting 12 times.
"Everyone at the club is fighting hard to make sure we reach the play-offs this season," Angelieri said in a statement on the club website.
"Whilst that aim remains within reach, we have decided that Kevin should focus entirely on his playing contribution until the end of the season. Andy will take charge of the first team in the interim."
Former Dover and Gillingham boss Hessenthaler, 50, becomes the seventh different man to take charge of the side since Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti bought the O's in the summer of 2014.
Earlier on Tuesday, BBC Radio Manchester reported Nolan is being considered for a management or coaching role at his former club Bolton Wanderers.
Nolan spent almost 10 years playing for Bolton, who parted company with boss Neil Lennon in March and have since been relegated from the Championship.
