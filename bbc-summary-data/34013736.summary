Mr Warburton's Peugeot 205 was found at Birkenhead ferry port, near Liverpool.
Police had previously appealed for his lodger David Ellis, 40, to get in touch and now have CCTV footage of him boarding a ferry to Belfast.
Mr Warburton, 59, has not been seen since Friday 31 July.
Mr Ellis boarded a Stena Line Lagan ferry at Birkenhead at 22:30 BST on 5 August, arriving in Belfast at 07:00 the next morning.
Police said he may have been in Dolwyddelan and Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, in the days before he travelled.
Det Supt Paul Hurley of South Wales Police said: "Our investigation and search for Mr Warburton and Mr Ellis has extended from Swansea to north Wales and now to Northern Ireland where we have deployed officers to work alongside the Police Service of Northern Ireland to carry out enquiries.
"Mr Ellis's whereabouts in Ireland are unknown. He may have friends, associates or family in Ireland offering him accommodation. We appeal to anyone who has seen him to come forward.
"I appeal to anyone who has seen Mr Warburton or Mr Ellis to contact the police. I appeal directly to Mr Ellis to come forward as I believe that you hold the information we need to establish the circumstances of Alec Warburton's disappearance.
Police launched a murder investigation and appealed for Mr Ellis to get on touch after Mr Warburton was reported missing from his home in Vivian Road, Sketty, on 2 August.
Officers searched in and around the house where they both lived and a police tent was put up on the street.
