While Oasis may have walked away with the prizes for best album, group and video in 1996, the ceremony was also remembered for Jarvis Cocker's unscheduled appearance at Earl's Court.
The Pulp frontman caused a storm by jumping onstage during Michael Jackson's performance of Earth Song. He was arrested but no charges were brought.
The awards also provided a public farewell to Take That who had previously announced they were to go their separate ways.
