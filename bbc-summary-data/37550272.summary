Plans to replace three sports centres with a new Â£15m complex in Pontefract could have a "massive impact" on fitness, a doctor has warned.

Wakefield Council plans to eventually close Knottingley Sports Centre, Castleford and Pontefract pools.
They would be replaced by the Pontefract Park complex with a 10-lane swimming pool and sports facilities.
Dr Karen Forshaw said: "I do think there will be a massive impact on people's abilities to exercise."
The GP, who lives in Pontefract, said: "Swimming is an excellent form of exercise and physical activity is one of the most important things that we can do to improve our health."
There are fears people would be put off travelling to the new leisure centre.
Steve Tulley, councillor for South Emsall and South Kirkby ward, said although he supported the plans in principle he was worried "some of our poorer people will struggle to get to the new centre".
Knottingley Sports Centre (built in 1969), and Castleford Swimming Pool (1983) would close in January 2017 with Pontefract Swimming Pool (built in 1985) staying open until the new centre was open, said the council.
The new complex would also have a gym, exercise studios, outside tennis courts and five-a-side pitches.
Les Shaw, council cabinet member, said: "Updating the current pools is not an option."
Modernising the existing premises would require major construction works and refurbishment would be "extremely expensive", he added.
A consultation on the plans runs until November.
