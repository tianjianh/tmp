Knox made nine birdies in a flawless round to move to 11 under par alongside American James Hahn and Hideki Matsuyama of Japan, who both shot 64.
American Justin Thomas leads the way on 14 under after a 66, two shots ahead of India's Anirban Lahiri (66).
England's Paul Casey shot a level-par 72 and is seven off the pace.
Knox made four consecutive birdies from the 14th and ensured a bogey-free round after recovering from a wayward tee shot at the last.
"I thought I could shoot maybe five or six under and that would be a great score," said Knox. "But then I just started making putt after putt and got on a nice little roll."
