Ms Fawell travelled to the event on 22 May with friend Caroline Davis Osborne and their children.
The mother-of-two was last seen in the foyer area shortly before the blast.

Family and friends of Ms Fawell attended a funeral service followed by a private function.
Ms Fawell and Ms Davis Osborne were waiting to collect their children when the attack took place.
Her daughter, Charlotte Fawell, 15, was taken to hospital in Oldham, with Ms Davis Osborne left seriously injured.
Adam Fawell, her 29-year-old son, previously said: "Mum was a wonderful woman, she'll be sadly missed.
"I would like to add how much it means to us what everybody at home and in Manchester have done to support us at this time."
Ms Davis Osborne, who wore bright clothing to the funeral in tribute to her friend, described Ms Fawell as "very caring and loving".
She said: "I think about it all of the time, when I go to bed I just see me and Wendy walking into the foyer, that's all I see when I shut my eyes.
"I can't see an end to how I feel at the moment, I'm still finding it really difficult to comprehend what happened and Wendy isn't coming back."
Staff at Oswald's C of E Primary School, in Guiseley, where Ms Fawell had previously worked, posted on Twitter expressing their "deep sadness" after the attack.
