Welshman Williams, world champion in 2000 and 2003, needs to win the event to return to the top 16 and qualify for the Crucible later this month.
The 42-year-old will play world champion Mark Selby in Sunday's final, which is the best of 19 frames.
Selby beat fellow Englishman Kyren Wilson 6-4 in a high quality match.
Iranian world number 76 Vafaei, 22, was in his first ranking semi-final after beating defending champion Judd Trump of England.
Williams went 5-0 up on Saturday after eventually winning a nervy opening frame that lasted 40 minutes.
Vafaei made a break of 98 in frame six, missing the final pink when he looked set for a century, before Williams completed the victory in the seventh.
There was also a 40-minute opening frame in the second semi-final, which Selby took before taking a 3-1 lead.
However, Wilson remained in touch and his 130 clearance levelled the match at 3-3.
Only one frame remained between the players until Selby settled it in the 10th with a break of 93.
