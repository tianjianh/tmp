The MoD announced earlier this year it had been sold for Â£2m to a ship recycling company in Turkey.
It had been hoped the former flagship could be saved as a tribute to the decommissioned Invincible Class aircraft carriers.
Crowds are expected to line the shoreline for the ship's departure.

Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, first commanding officer of HMS Illustrious, said: "I'm very sad indeed to see the last of the three invincible class ships going to the scrap yard.
"Most of us hoped the government's intention to go for a maritime heritage preservation of the ship would come to pass.
"It was a great honour to be appointed as the first captain of HMS Illustrious.  I have many, many happy memories."
The 22,000-tonne ship, also known as Lusty, left service in 2014 after 32 years.
It had been deployed to conflict zones including Bosnia, Iraq and Sierra Leone.
Sir Alan Massey, who captained HMS Illustrious in 2001-02, said he was "hugely sad" to see the vessel leave.
"You never quite knew what the next challenge would be ... It just had amazing capability and flexibility. As a captain, there is no better job - there was a real can-do attitude."
In October 2013, the MoD sought innovative bids to keep Illustrious in the UK.
It had hoped part or all of the ship could be developed for heritage purposes, but earlier this year it was announced none of the bids had been viable and it would follow Invincible and Ark Royal to a Turkish scrap yard.
Its role will be replaced by the next generation of aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, currently being built in Rosyth.
