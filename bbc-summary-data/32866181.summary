[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pleascach wins Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pleascach denied favourite Found to win the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 11-2 victor, ridden by Kevin Manning for trainer Jim Bolger, survived a stewards' inquiry.
Pleascach - the Irish word for explosive - won by half a length, with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Found finding trouble in running.  Devonshire was third ahead of Jack Naylor.
Found's jockey Ryan Moore was seeking a Guineas quadruple after victories in the three previous 2015 Classics.
Bolger is now set to aim Pleascach at next month's Irish Derby.
Earlier, Al Kazeem (3-1) won the Tattersalls Gold Cup for the second time to clock up a 10th career victor.
James Doyle guided home the seven-year-old, who has been expertly trained by Roger Charlton after returning to racing when a stud career was halted by fertility issues.
