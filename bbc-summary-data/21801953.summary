Wales and England rugby: Train cleaners' strike off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cleaners for Arriva Trains Wales have called off a 24-hour walkout over pay on the day Wales play England in rugby's Six Nations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saturday's strike was part of a campaign against a zero pay rise.
But Bob Crow, general manager of the Rail Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said further talks would now take place following an improved offer.
The match is expected to draw 74,000 fans to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium with many coming by train.
The cleaners employed by contractor Churchill originally voted by a margin of 9-1 in favour of industrial action after the union accused the contractors of refusing to offer any increase in pay.
