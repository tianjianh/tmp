A man has set a new world record for the most consecutive bounces on a pogo stick.

Jack Sexty, 25, from Bristol, bounced non-stop on the spot for 10 hours 21 minutes at an event in Philadelphia.
Hopping 88,047 times, he not only beat his two American opponents but broke the previous record of 75,005.
"Five or six hours in I just couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel - it was really hard but I got there in the end," he said.
To land the Guinness World Record, Mr Sexty had to out-bounce world champion Casie Merza and previous record-holder James Roumeliotis.
But eight hours into the Xpogo world championship event both his opponents had "collapsed with exhaustion".
"He [James Roumeliotis] was going at such a pace but I kept steady and stayed on for longer and ended up coming out on top," he said.
"But it just wrecks your whole body."
Bouncing just under two-and-a-half times a second, the multiple pogo record-holder was raising money for Alzheimer's Research UK.
"If bouncing up and down for 10 hours can raise a bit of money towards that then that's great," he said.
"And when I get back I'm going to start training for the fastest mile on a pogo stick and hopefully go for an attempt in September."
In 2014, Mr Sexty became the first person to complete a marathon on a pogo stick.
