The fire raged across the city from 2 to 5 September 1666, destroying more than 13,000 houses and 87 churches.
The stamps are designed by comic book artist John Higgins, who has used a graphic novel style of illustration.
They feature scenes from the start, spread and aftermath of the Great Fire, using a street map design.
Higgins has contributed to titles such as Judge Dredd and 2000 AD.
Philip Parker, from Royal Mail, said: "Despite the terrible devastation caused by the Great Fire, it provided the opportunity for the regeneration of large swathes of the city and shaped the London we know today.
"It was the catalyst of the building of iconic landmarks such as St Paul's Cathedral and dozens of parish churches.
"It is fitting that we mark the anniversary of the fire with an innovative set of stamps that re-imagine the events."
