[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He said there was "a real appetite in Wales" for leaving the European Union, claiming the country was "even keener" on Brexit than other parts of the UK.
Geraint Talfan Davies, chairman of Wales Stronger in Europe, said the pro-EU group looked forward to "engaging with David to give the people of Wales the positive debate they deserve".
The referendum takes place on 23 June.
Mr Jones, Conservative MP for Clwyd West, said: "I have no doubt that there is a real appetite in Wales for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.
"Recent polls, in fact, have shown that Wales is even keener for a 'leave' vote than many other parts of the country."
He added: "Wales, and the rest of the United Kingdom, can look forward to a more prosperous, more outward-looking future, outside the European Union."
