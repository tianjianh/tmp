After losing two presenters in just two months, US show Fashion Police is taking a 'hiatus'.

The E! network says the show will come back in September 2015.
In February, Kelly Osbourne quit following a falling out with a co-presenter. Her replacement, Kathy Griffin, then left after just seven episodes.
E! said: "We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season."
The show offers humorous, often cutting, critiques of what celebrities have been seen wearing.
It was originally hosted by the late comedian Joan Rivers and is executively produced by her daughter Melissa Rivers.
In February, Osbourne left the show after complaining about her co-host Giuliana Rancic's criticism of Zendaya. Rancic had suggested the actor's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana.
Rancic was forced to apologise after Zendaya said the remarks were "outrageously offensive".
After Osbourne left, comedian Kathy Griffin came on board.
But she left after just seven episodes saying she was uneasy being part of the show.
Speaking to US show The View, she said she felt forced to "comment about pictures of beautiful women in perfect dresses and say kind of bad things".
Despite E! saying the new season of the show would go ahead at the end of March - without Osborne or Griffin - it has now been shelved until September 2015.
E! says the show would "evolve" - but that co-hosts Giuliana Rancic and Brad Goreski and executive producer Melissa Rivers will be back.
