Syrians spending first Christmas in UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Christmas is upon us, and the UK government's pledge to resettle 1,000 Syrian refugees in the UK in time for the festive holiday has been met. But in Syria, the relentless civil war rages on. How are the people who recently escaped it settling in their new homes?

The Al-Rahal family are spending Christmas in their small apartment on the outskirts of Bradford, where they have lived for nine months.
The family, who are Muslim, have a Christmas tree "just in case our British friends come over. We want the same joy as them," said daughter Amal.
Their old home in Homs has often been referred to as the "capital of the Syrian revolution."
Their father, Ahmed, 37, knows all too well how quickly that revolution ended.
He was a political prisoner in 2011, after government forces identified him from a photo at a revolution rally.
"I was tortured in prison for 37 days, just for being an activist. I managed to escape when the chaos began," he said.
He fled his home in Homs with his wife Weid, 33 and their three daughters, Raghad, Amal and Ayat, to one of the many overflowing refugee camps in Jordan.
The family were fortunate to be approved by the UN's Vulnerable Person Relocation (VPR) scheme - Amal was in need of weekly injections for her rheumatism and Ahmed had a broken ribcage from the torture in jail.
In September, Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to allow up to 20,000 Syrian refugees into the UK over a five year period under the VPR scheme, with the first 1,000 arriving earlier this month.
Alongside this scheme, the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015, and an additional 216 Syrian refugees were resettled under the government's VPR scheme between January 2014 and mid-2015.
One such Syrian is 39-year-old Jihan, a Muslim Kurd who, like the Al-Rahal family, will be spending her first Christmas in the UK after arriving in Coventry in August.
Jihan is originally from a predominantly Christian area in Aleppo, and came to the UK from Irbil after fleeing her home due to an outbreak of violence.
Each year she says her family, who are still in Aleppo, used to put up a Christmas tree and celebrate New Year's Eve by dancing and eating with friends.
"We didn't know the tree was a Christmas tradition until we were older," she said. "For us it was always just a time of celebration."
Jihan, who was an executive manager of a textile factory in Aleppo before war broke out, says the parties she used to have at New Year are now a thing of the past.
"This year, people can't go out after 6pm and there's no electricity in Aleppo. There will be no New Year's party, but gatherings sometimes happen in the evening."
This year, she says, she will be spending Christmas with her neighbour's parents in Coventry, who have invited her over for lunch.
Dr Al-Ghazal, of the Syrian Association of Yorkshire, thinks the festive period should be a reminder that "people in Syria are still trapped and expecting barrel bombs to come - there's no hope, just constant fleeing from attacks."
"People there have no concept of time or dates anymore. Unlike people with Advent calendars here, there's no countdown to Christmas in Syria, they just have to survive the day-to-day."
For the Al-Rahal family, the day to day has improved since coming to the UK, but difficulties still remain.
The youngest daughter, Ayat, aged eight, is very fragile and is still "very traumatised," her mother explains.
"She's lost the ability to speak properly and has many learning difficulties because of the psychological damage. Loud noises frighten her and remind her of the war."
Yet in the abyss of Syria's despair there are glimmers of hope, says Jihan.
"When the war started everybody and me included thought it would last no longer than two or three weeks. We didn't think it would turn so bad. Even now, when I speak to my friends and family they say 'it will be over next month'. We always have this hope."
She added: "I never thought I would be a refugee in another country. But now I am, what are my hopes for living here? If I had to hope for something for myself it's to get a job. I can't stay like this taking money from the job centre."
Ultimately though, she says, if the conditions permit she wants to go home, back to Syria.
It's a sentiment shared by Mr Al-Rahal.
"We hope so much that one day we can go home and rebuild our destroyed country for our people to have the same joy as you do.
"Christmas represents peace, and this is the first time we have had that in so long."
