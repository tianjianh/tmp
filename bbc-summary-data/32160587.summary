The star was speaking ahead of the premiere of Furious 7, the seventh instalment in the Fast and Furious film franchise.
Walker, who played Brian O'Conner in the films, was killed in a car crash in 2013 while it was being filmed.
Diesel, who plays group leader Dominic Toretto, said he felt the presence of the actor who he often referred to as his brother.
"I don't feel his absence today, that's the irony, I feel he's here today... and the whole objective of doing Furious 7 was to make him proud and something tells me he is going to be very proud."
Diesel, 47, was joined at a Hollywood Boulevard hand and foot ceremony and at the premiere later by co-stars Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Lucas Black and Nathalie Emmanuel, as well as girlfriend Paloma Jimenez and three of their children.
Diesel's newborn baby Pauline, named in honour of Walker, stayed at home.
During his speech outside the Chinese Theatre in front of hundreds of fans, Diesel said he relayed advice his father gave him.
"Teach a child confidence and you don't need to teach them anything else."
Diesel said he felt pressure to say something meaningful to mark the occasion.
"What goes through my mind above everything is what can I say to make this moment worthy?
"I'm being honoured, what wisdom can I impart? What can I say to a future generation? What can I say to our generation?
"That's all that is going through my mind and it's not something I want to write down before I come here, I want it to be pure and organic."
Paul Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody Walker helped to finish filming on Furious 7.
An investigation into the crash, which also killed Walker's friend Roger Rodas, found it was caused by unsafe speed rather than a mechanical failure.
The Porsche Carrera GT, driven by Rodas, was travelling at 94mph in a 45mph zone when it hit a lamp post.
Production on the film was stopped after Walker's death in November 2013 but resumed the following March.
Fast And Furious 7 is released in UK cinemas on Good Friday.
