The wing, 34, scored in the last move of Wales' 24-18 defeat by Australia in Cardiff and was later in tears during a televised interview.
He said: "I couldn't have scripted it any better, really... I managed just to get outside Barnes and cross the line.
"It's an incredible feeling scoring a try, but knowing it's your last chance to score, it is just fantastic."
Williams' wife Gail brought their young children on to the field after the final whistle and the Osprey took them around the field on a lap of honour.
"Gail brought the kids on - Georgie and Carter - and it was fantastic to spend the lap of honour with them," said Williams.

"They mean the world to me and to have them there was fantastic and I'd just like to thank everyone at the Millennium Stadium that made it happen."
He also admitted to being more nervous ahead of his 87th and final Wales appearance than at any time during his career.
And after stretching his Wales try-scoring record to 58 in 87 games with that injury-time try, he said: "For me personally I've just been more excited than I've ever been for a game, certainly more nervous.
"I found it difficult sleeping last [Friday] night. I was up at 0530-0600 and that hasn't happened to me for a while, certainly not in a rugby match sense.
"But I knew there were a lot of eyes on me, but I didn't want the game to be about me.
"I wanted it to be about Wales winning and that was very difficult to come away from.

"But it's been a great week with the guys and knowing it's the last week with the boys, I've had a great time.
"I can't get over it. The crowd's been fantastic and it has been from the first moment I played for Wales and [it was] certainly no different today - probably I've never sensed or felt anything like that in my life.
"And as you can see, it has been very emotional.
"I don't usually cry, but I feel like a blubbering idiot sometimes and I just couldn't stop just now.
"But it's all down to the fans and having my friends and family here has just been a fantastic occasion."
Even a defeat to end his career could not dim Williams' pride at the effort of his team-mates during a game in which the Wallabies profited after full-back Leigh Halfpenny was sin-binned.
"We were under the cosh from the start, but we were playing one of the best teams in the world and the effort was there.
"We found it really difficult when we were down to 14 men, but we never gave up and that's the kind of spirit I like to see in this Welsh side."
