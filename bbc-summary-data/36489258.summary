One-Day Cup: Worcestershire cruise to victory over Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham produced a below-par batting display as they lost by seven wickets to Worcestershire in the One-Day Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 22 overs-a-side game was all that was possible after a long rain delay, but the home side were bowled out for 90.
Mark Stoneman top-scored with 29 and the only other batsman to reach double figures was Paul Collingwood (17).
Chris Rushworth took 3-19 as the visitors began their reply, but Alexei Kervezee (37) and Brett D'Oliveira (20) saw them to 91-3 with 17 balls in hand.
Their unbroken partnership was worth 60 after Kervezee collected the winning single from the bowling of Usman Arshad.
Durham reached 35-1 at the start of their innings after play got under way at 15:30 BST, but then lost four wickets for 11 runs.
D'Oliveira, Ed Barnard, Joe Leach and Chris Russell took two wickets each as they were finally dismissed at the start of the 22nd over.
Durham's total was their seventh-lowest in non-Twenty20 limited-overs matches games.
Rushworth exploited the conditions superbly at the start of Worcestershire's innings, but once he was out of the attack, Kervezee and D'Oliveira were able to settle and complete the formalities.
