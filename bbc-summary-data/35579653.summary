Ashley Williams: Captain rues Swansea City missed chances

Ashley Williams admits Premier League strugglers Swansea City have heaped pressure on themselves by failing to win back-to-back home games.

Swansea are three points outside the drop-zone after a draw with Crystal Palace and defeat by Southampton.
"If we had got the two wins against Palace and Southampton then that would have eased our situation a little bit," said the Swans and Wales captain.
"We are not in the bottom three and it is on us to stay out of that."
The 2013 League Cup champions had won four in a row before their Saints defeat on Saturday and now face daunting trips to title challengers and Premier League favourites Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal.
"We've been making gradual progress since Christmas time, but our run has come to an end and now we need to get on another one," Williams said.
"Tottenham and Arsenal are tough games for obvious reasons, but if you don't win your home games, you have to pick up points from elsewhere.
"We need to move out of a position where we are in danger."
Swansea are one of five teams within five points of each other around the relegation zone and Williams feels it is too difficult to predict the total will be to guarantee Premier League safety.
"The league is crazy this year, everyone usually says you need 40 points, but this season it could be more or it could be less," the Swans defender said.
"It is not the season to be down there like we are because it's been a crazy season.
"Everybody's picking up wins in unexpected places and times. We have to concentrate on what we need to do and get out of trouble."
Swansea Southampton manager Ronald Koeman believes Swansea will win their fight to remain in the Premier League.
"Swansea are too good, too strong to be relegated," he said.
"If I compare Swansea to other teams, I think they have a strong team."
