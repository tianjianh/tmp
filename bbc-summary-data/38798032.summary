A man choked on a bag of drugs which he tried to swallow while being arrested by police, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darran Hunt, 36, was arrested in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on 8 February 2015.
The hearing at Milford Haven Town Hall was told he pulled something from his trousers and put it in his mouth.
He began choking and lost consciousness - attempts by police and paramedics to revive him failed.
The inquest jury heard Mr Hunt was an unemployed drug addict who was known to police.
CCTV footage showed Dyfed-Powys Police officers trying to arrest Mr Hunt in Llanelli's Sunken Gardens when he put the packet in his mouth.
It was later found to have been 8cm (3.1in) long and contained a combination of drugs including cannabis and the heroin replacement drug subutex.
Mr Hunt's mother, Kathryn told the inquest that she loved her son, "but didn't always like the things he did."
She described his police record as "atrocious," saying he had gone off the rails at a young age.
But she said he had been trying hard to turn his life around for his young daughters.
"He really wanted to change," she said.
Ms Hunt went on to explain the frustration her son had faced after constantly being stopped by the police, even after he had stopped taking heroin.
She said he did not deserve to be handled in the way he was and did not understand why the police had used a pepper spray on him if they knew he had swallowed something.
The inquest heard that there is no official guidance for police when faced with someone who has swallowed a packet, and that it is not considered safe for officers to put their hands in somebody's mouth.
The inquest continues.
