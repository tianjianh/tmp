Victoria Floyd-Ellis, 22, will receive a national award for helping the pensioner, who was lost after walking out of a cardiac unit at Bridgend's Prince Of Wales Hospital on 9 February.
Ms Floyd-Eliss, from Bridgend, spotted the OAP and drove her back to hospital where she had received heart surgery.
She has received a Royal Humane Society certificate of commendation.
The Cardiff University student spotted the elderly woman, who was disorientated and cold, walking on the town's International Way.
In addition to the award, Ms Floyd-Ellis also won the praise of Dick Wilkinson, secretary of the Royal Humane Society and further praise from Dr Jeff Allen, her year director at the university.
Mr Wilkinson said: "Given some of the things you hear about these days, I think a lot of women would think twice before stopping in circumstances like this.
"However, Victoria did not hesitate and in view of the treatment this lady had been undergoing it may well be that her 'good samaritan' act saved her life.
"Quite apart from the obvious danger to her health from the temperature and the fact she had undergone heart surgery, she was also in a confused state next to a busy dual carriage way.
"Victoria richly deserves the award she is to receive."
Adding to the praise, Dr Allen said: "We are all extremely proud of Victoria for recognising that the elderly lady was in distress and then going out of her way to help her.
"Her actions demonstrated great courage and compassion, everything we look for in our young doctors."
