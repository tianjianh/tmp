[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers v Chelsea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves' boss Paul Lambert could recall Andreas Weimann, who scored the winner at Anfield in the fourth round.

Jack Price is back in contention but Nouha Dicko's hamstring means he is unavailable, as is Joe Mason.
Chelsea defender David Luiz is rested as he continues to struggle with a knee problem, meaning Kurt Zouma or John Terry could deputise.
Asmir Begovic is set to start, but Marcos Alonso drops out with Nathan Ake a possible replacement.
Steve Wilson: "I'm not sure if Antonio Conte has been versed in just how special the double of league and FA Cup is in England - but this season is a wonderful opportunity for Chelsea to join Manchester United and Arsenal as the only clubs to have achieved it more than once.
"Not being in Europe and having such a cushion at the top of the Premier League offers Conte the opportunity to select a team designed to minimise the risk of an upset.
"Wolves have already done spectacularly well to win at Stoke and Liverpool on their way to this, their first fifth-round tie since 2008.
"They deserve a full house and a cracking Molineux atmosphere to celebrate those achievements, but celebrating another Premier League scalp looks less likely."

Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "We will need to punch above our weight and stay in the game as long as we can.
"We will have to do what we are good at and not get drawn into playing Chelsea's way. We will have to find a way of taking them out of their comfort zone, as we did at Liverpool.
"I'm not going to play the same way that Burnley did. That's taking nothing away from Burnley because they got a brilliant result but when you sit and wait for a team to come at you you've got to hope they have an off-day and don't fire at all levels."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte on Diego Costa's future: "I don't know about this situation. I think now it's very important to be focused on the present and not to look so far forward. At the end of the season we will see the situation.
"Yes, I'm confident (he will stay). I repeat: now it's important to keep the great concentration for the present. The present is tomorrow's game against Wolverhampton. We must go in the next round."
Chelsea looked very good for the first 20 minutes of their draw against Burnley. They may not be involved in any other competitions, but manager Antonio Conte won't want the bother of a replay.
