[SN]TITLE[SN]
Convicted sex offender Damien Midgley arrested in Cambodia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted sex offender who fled the UK has been arrested in Cambodia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damien Midgley, formerly of Aberford, near Leeds, was tried for child sex offences in 2014, but did not attend the hearing.
He was convicted in his absence and sentenced to six years in jail, with a warrant for his arrest also issued.
North Yorkshire Police believe the 39-year-old visited Thailand before Cambodia. Arrangements are being made for him to be deported back to the UK.
Det Insp Jane Guymer said: "Midgley clearly thought that by fleeing the UK he would be somehow immune to the sentence that the courts handed him in his absence.
"However, this case proves that international barriers are no obstacle when it comes to ensuring vile and cowardly child sex offenders are held to account for their actions."
