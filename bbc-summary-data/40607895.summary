Kouame died at the age of 29 on Monday after collapsing during a friendly game with friends in Abidjan.
His colleagues tried to resuscitate him before rushing him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
"It's impossible to live without my son," Kouame's mother Sant'anna Cica Rachel told BBC Sport. "I'm overwhelmed."
A vigil will be held on 21 June for Kouame in his home neighbourhood of Gonzagueville, a coastal suburb of Abidjan.
He will be buried the following day in nearby Grand Bassam.
The death of Kouame, a free agent following previous spells in Turkey and Russia, came just a month after that of fellow Ivorian Cheick Tiote and has plunged the country's football world into mourning once again.
The former Newcastle United star died on 5 June of a suspected heart problem while training with Chinese side Beijing Enterprise.
Media reports suggest that Kouame, a father of five, also died because of a heart-related issue but this has yet to be publicly confirmed by medical specialists.
The forward started out with the famous ASEC Mimosas before a spell with fellow Ivorians Sewe Sports.
He eventually made his way to Turkey, where Kouame played for second-division club Boluspor in the 2011-2012 season.
In a statement, Boluspor club said it was 'deeply sorry' to hear of his death and offered condolences to the family.
Kouame spent 2012-13 with FC SKA-Khabarovsk, who will debut in Russia's top flight next season, and was being linked with an amateur Turkish side, Egirdirspor, at the time of his death.
