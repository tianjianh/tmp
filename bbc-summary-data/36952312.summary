Painter Ceri Pritchard returns to Wales to exhibit work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The eldest son of the late Welsh painter Gwilym Prichard and artist Claudia Williams has returned to Wales to exhibit his own work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceri Pritchard's art, The Strange Edge of Reality: Paintings 2012-2016, is on show at Tenby Museum and Art Gallery alongside his parents' work.
His work brings together human and animal forms.
"When I paint I try to achieve a feeling of some other world, some other type of existence," Mr Pritchard said.
Now aged 62, he was born in Birmingham but the family moved to Anglesey where he grew up.
"Growing up in an artistic environment with well-known painter parents has given me a sense of the importance of 'doing' and 'working'," he said.
Since studying sculpture at Liverpool School of Art, he has worked in France, New York and Mexico, and sees his homecoming as the completion of a circle.
"My work reflects a constant changing life," he said.
"Each country and place leaves an indelible mark, and a continually accumulating wealth of new and diverse influences and experiences."
Mr Pritchard's father, one of the most admired and successful painters of the Welsh landscape, died at his home near Tenby in June last year.
A new display of work by his 83-year-old mother, all produced in the year since her husband's death, went on display in Cardiff in June.
Mr Pritchard's exhibition runs until 18 September.
