An option on Facebook to say you're "feeling fat" is being removed after pressure from a campaign group.

Endangered Bodies had criticised the social media network after it offered the status update along with "I'm feeling optimistic" and "I'm feeling hopeless".
However, Facebook has changed its mind after an online petition and replaced "fat" with "stuffed".
Facebook confirmed the change in a short statement to Endangered Bodies.
"We've heard from our community that listing 'feeling fat' as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders," a statement said.
"So we're going to remove 'feeling fat' from the list of options.
"We'll continue to listen to feedback as we think about ways to help people express themselves on Facebook."
More than 16,000 people had signed the online petition.
The woman who set it up, Catherine Weingarten, wrote: "This success shows us that people together can challenge the cultural messages that are so damaging to our ability to love ourselves and live comfortably in our bodies.
"As someone who struggled with body image, I feel so happy that I've helped eliminate one form of body-shaming hatred on the internet."
