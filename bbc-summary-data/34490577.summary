[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Refugees have guest-edited Friday's edition of a Danish daily newspaper to give their views on Europe's migration crisis.

The 12 are professional journalists, originally from Syria, Somalia and other countries. Some are new arrivals; others have lived in Denmark for years.
The editor of Information, Christian Jensen, said refugees had become "extras in a political debate".
Denmark's centre-right government has promised to get tough on immigration.
Since its election in June it has slashed benefits for new arrivals and restricted the right to residency.
The edition (in Danish) led with an article by a journalist from Iraqi Kurdistan focusing on the plight of women left behind when men migrate.
The initiative drew praise on the newspaper's Facebook page although some readers were disappointed they were unable to find a physical copy of the paper, with the edition selling out in many places.
"We all talk about refugees, but today it is the refugees who talk to us," Mr Jensen wrote in an editorial.
He also criticised Danish Integration Minister Inger Stojberg who he said had not responded to interview requests.
The Information is one of Denmark's smaller newspapers, with a circulation of about 20,000. It was founded during the resistance movement to Nazi Germany during the Second World War.
Denmark's governing Venstre party won power in June after running on an anti-immigration platform and recently tightened citizenship rules.
