It is not known how the swan got trapped on the rooftop of Agatha's Boutique but it could not fly off as it did not have enough space to take enough of a run up.
A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: "Happily we were able to rescue this swan and release it back into the wild just a short distance away."
Staff at nearby soundLINCS managed to record the successful rescue.
