Marshman, 27, will face Canada's Ryan Janes in what will be the Abertillery fighter's third bout in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
"I'm very confident with this fight," Marshman told BBC Wales Sport.
"I feel I'm going to be a far superior fighter and I can't see myself being troubled by this opponent."
Marshman made a winning start to life in the Ultimate Fighting Championship when he beat Sweden's Magnus Cedenblad at UFC Fight Night Belfast in November.
But at his next fight against Brazilian Thiago Santos in Canada in February, the Welshman was knocked down in the second round by a spinning wheel kick.
His opponent at the in Glasgow has also fought twice in the UFC and will be the least experienced opponent Marshman has faced so far.
"I had a tough start (in the UFC) but went in and proved that I belong here," Marshman continued.
"But I think the UFC are probably thinking 'let's maybe step him back a bit and give him two fights like this', against evenly matched guys.
"Then if I come through them, I think they'll start bouncing me back towards that top 15 (ranking)."
