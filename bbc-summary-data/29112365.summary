British Sailing manager Stephen Park wants his team to seize as many Rio Olympics places as possible at the upcoming World Championships.

The event in Spain is the first chance for nations to secure half of the country berths for the 2016 Games.
"We'd hope to qualify in each of the 10 events at this first opportunity and put that to bed," said Park.
"Then we can concentrate on the individual competitions and who we select for Team GB."
Park is also keen that GB's sailors build on their success at August's Olympics test event in Brazil, where they won eight medals in seven disciplines.
"Across the 10 classes we are looking to try and win four medals or more," said Park.
"Following our performances in Rio last month we're feeling fairly confident going into this event."
Giles Scott, who won Great Britain's gold in the Finn class, says the team is keen to improve on their fine Rio showing in Santander.
"The squad's in a very strong place and I'd imagine as a unit we're aiming for more golds," he told BBC Sport.
"If we can get close to the high tally we achieved in Rio that would be good."
The World Championships on Spain's north coast runs between 12-21 September, and Scott is tipping his fellow British sailors for success.
"The guys and girls in the 470 class - Luke Patience and Elliott Willis, and Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark - are always pretty strong," he said.
"The men's 49er event is pretty wide open. New Zealand and Australia have been dominant in that class, but the British squad are closing in on them so that will be interesting to watch.
"There's an incredible amount of depth in the British squad and clearly all of us as individuals are just looking to make sure we round off the season well in Santander."
Scott's own form since returning to compete in the Finn a year ago has been impressive and he goes into the season finale in Santander unbeaten in his last six regattas.
"I feel like I'm in a good position (to challenge for a gold medal in Spain) but it'll still take everything to come away with a victory," he said.
