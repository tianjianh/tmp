Det Insp Fraser Wylie, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, appealed for friends or colleagues of Ms Winning to contact police.
He added: "We're also continuing to ask for anyone who witnessed suspicious activity between Friday 7 and Monday 10 October in and around Essex Close to get in touch.
"We're particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw a black wheelie bin being taken along the street, or anyone who lived nearby who has noticed that their wheelie bin has gone missing."
The man's body was discovered in a wheelie bin on Monday night outside the entrance to the flats. It had been wrapped in cling film and a purple duvet cover.
It is thought the dead man and Ms Winning were partners.
Her baby is being cared for.
