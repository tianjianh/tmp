[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Dawes is being held by French authorities on suspicion of trafficking over a tonne of cocaine worth â‚¬200m (Â£145m).
The 44-year-old, from Nottinghamshire, is also being investigated over a series of murders in the Netherlands.
The international operation has seen a further 50 arrests.
Mr Dawes is accused of running Europe's "largest criminal organisation dedicated to drug trafficking, money laundering and murder", Spanish police said.
The seized cocaine arrived in France hidden in suitcases on a flight from South America.
Police believe he was working with well-known South American drug cartels and the Italian Mafia, and was exporting large quantities of heroin to the UK from Afghanistan and Turkey.
He is also being investigated over a "wave" of drug-related murders in the Netherlands.
Mr Dawes was arrested last month and extradited to France after police raided his home in Benalmadena on the Costa del Sol.
The international police operation has also seized boats and planes.
Mr Dawes, who is originally from Sutton-in-Ashfield, was wanted for international drug trafficking.
He and his brother John were linked to Nottinghamshire kingpin, Gary Hardy, who was jailed for 20 years for drugs offences in 2008.
