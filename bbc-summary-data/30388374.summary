Jo-Jo, a six-month-old white female, had been used to educate Brockenhurst College students as part of its Drive Safe road safety awareness initiative.
The foal died on the B3055 Sway Road in Brockenhurst in November.
Owner Genette Byford is trialling reflective stickers after another of her donkeys was hit by a car.
New Forest National Park Authority said this animal "ran off" following Sunday's collision on the Sway Road and has not been seen since.
Jo-Jo was one of 16 donkeys owned by commoner Mrs Byford, along with ponies, cattle, sheep and pigs, which roam free across the New Forest.
In 2013, there were 182 collisions involving livestock in the national park, resulting in 72 animal deaths.
Mrs Byford said: "I've had a number of donkeys and ponies run over and it is heart-breaking.
"People just don't think about the animals being there."
The park authority said special glue was being used to attach the stickers to the hair of the animals, but added more research was needed to find a reflective material that would remain in place longer.
More than 3,000 people have signed a petition calling for a reduction in the speed limit across the New Forest from 40mph (64km/h) to 30mph (48km/h).
