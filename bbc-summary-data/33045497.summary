The man was trying to stop the lorry from crashing when he fell under the wheels at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, police told BBC News.
Emergency services were called at about 07:15 BST to reports of an incident involving the lorry.  No other vehicles were involved.
The driver - believed to be a 57-year-old - was pronounced dead at the scene.
The vehicle travelled a short distance before coming to a stop, Devon and Cornwall Police said.
Sgt Rob Kelland said: "At this stage it would appear that a driver was hitching his trailer on about 100 metres further up the hill. While he was doing that it would appear the lorry starting rolling away.
"Witnesses are saying that he tried running after the lorry and tried to save it but unfortunately fell and was run over by his own lorry.
"He was taken into A&E where he was pronounced deceased.
"Subsequently, the family has arrived at the hospital and are being cared for by our family liaison officer."
The emergency services remain at the scene and the Health and Safety Executive has been informed.
The Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said it was working with police to support investigations.
Recycling firm Viridor, which employed the man, said: "Our deepest sympathies are with the driver's family, friends and colleagues.
"The company is working closely with the authorities and a full investigation is under way."
