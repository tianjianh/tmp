[SN]TITLE[SN]
Struck-off Clackmannanshire teacher loses court appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher twice struck off for incompetence has lost her latest appeal to win back her place in the classroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janet Garner, 62, claimed the General Teaching Council for Scotland acted illegally when it banned her from teaching, accusing it of bias.
The body acted after hearing how the former Alva Academy and Alloa Academy teacher once saw her entire top-set maths class fail their exams.
Judges at the Court of Session backed the decision of the GTCS.
Mrs Garner was dismissed by Clackmannanshire Council in August 2007, following complaints and parental dissatisfaction about her teaching skills, treatment of individual pupils, pupil attainment and her relationship with colleagues.
The former mathematician and statistician was struck off the teaching register in 2011, but that decision was overturned when a court found the GTCS had not properly considered the allegations.
A new panel then looked at the case, and struck Mrs Garner off again in November 2013, stating that she had "fallen significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher".
Mrs Garner took the case to the Court of Session, arguing that the second panel had acted illegally and was biased against her.
Civil judges ruled that the panel had acted correctly, with Lady Paton stating: "We have found nothing to suggest that the panel demonstrated actual or apparent bias."
The GTCS welcomed the ruling, but noted that it had been a "lengthy and costly" process, with the case costing in excess of Â£210,000 to fight.
The body is insured for the costs of the appeal process, after deduction of an excess, but could potentially pursue Mrs Garner for remuneration.
