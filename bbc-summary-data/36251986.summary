[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour is "not yet doing enough" to win the 2020 general election, leader Jeremy Corbyn will tell MPs.

The Labour leader is expected to highlight positives from last week's elections but say the results were "mixed" for the party.
He will also criticise MPs for "parading on the media to give a running commentary on our party".
"We need, if not across-the-board unity, then at least respect for each other," he will say.

In Thursday's elections, Labour held onto some key councils in England, remained the largest party in Wales and its candidate Sadiq Khan won the London mayoral election.
But it failed to make significant gains in England and slipped into third place behind the Conservatives in Scotland.
Addressing the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn is expected to point to the party's successes before adding: "But let's be clear. The results were mixed. We are not yet doing enough to win in 2020.
"This is only the first stage in our task of building a winning electoral majority, attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising those who have been turned off politics altogether - as we did last week in Bristol and London.
"But overall we have moved in the right direction. And now we have to build on these results."
Following his victory, Mr Khan said Labour could only win elections if it reaches beyond its own activists to a "big tent" of people.
Most MPs did not back Mr Corbyn in last year's Labour leadership contest, and some senior figures have expressed concern about the direction of the party and its prospects following the elections.
Mr Corbyn will say: "I don't expect, or even want, blind loyalty, but members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the Tories - and for our debates to be focused on policy, not personality."
The leader will also say the party is united in its opposition to the government's "failed economic policies", claiming there is a "broad consensus in support of a different kind of politics".
He will add: "Last week's elections showed Labour's recovery has begun in earnest. We now need to work together to turn that into the kind of sustained revival that will deliver an election victory for the whole country in 2020."
