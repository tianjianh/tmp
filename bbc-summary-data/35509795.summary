Chris Stokes and Baily Cargill scored from Joe Cole set-pieces to put the Sky Blues ahead before James Maddison made it 3-0 from the edge of the area.
John Fleck was given time to score the fourth before half-time with a low shot past goalkeeper Ian Lawlor.
Coventry's top scorer Adam Armstrong then helped himself to two goals from incisive passes from Cole and Fleck to close the gap on fourth-placed Wigan.
The Sky Blues' thumping win came less than 24 hours after a celebration of the life of former Coventry manager Jimmy Hill was held in the city.
Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"The talking had to stop really. In the team meeting I could sense a real urgency and responsibility abut the team that we had to get back on the horse and start riding fast again.
"It was a poignant day and I was pleased that the team could find the performance that merited what has happened in the past few days."
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"First thing is to apologise for the performance - apologise for the levels of performance and the unacceptable way we've conceded.
"The way we represented here today is not the way I want my Bury team to represent the supporters, the board and football club. We've got to take that responsibility as a group.
"We need to take that on and understand that it won't happen and it can't happen again.
"It's not disappointment, it's a feeling of emptiness inside that I've got."
