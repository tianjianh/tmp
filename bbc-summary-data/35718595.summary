Nottinghamshire have appointed Australian all-rounder Dan Christian as captain for this summer's T20 Blast.

James Taylor has given up the captaincy of their limited-overs sides because of his likely England commitments.
His decision also means wicketkeeper Chris Read will be captain for the One-Day Cup as well as the Championship.
"Dan brings a great deal of knowledge of how to be successful in T20 cricket," director of cricket Mick Newell told the club website.
"He has leadership experience and it will be good to have a T20 captain who can very much focus on that form of the game."
Taylor led Notts to the One-Day Cup semi-finals in 2015, but they were less successful in the T20 Blast, in which they finished fifth in their group.
"Having recently got back into the Test side, and being around England's team full time in 50-over cricket, it's right that James focuses on his own game this year," Newell added.
