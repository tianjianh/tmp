In the women's C1, European champion Woods, 20, claimed silver with Australia's Jess Fox winning gold.

Woods, who will also race in Sunday's K1 category, said she is "incredibly happy" with her season so far.
"Last year I didn't even make the team so I'm pretty happy to make a comeback onto the team and be on good form," she added.
Woods won bronze in both the Women's C1 and the C1 Team event at this years Under 23 World Championships.
