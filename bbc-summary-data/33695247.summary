A community buy-out could see a former Cold War surveillance station turned into a place where tourists can listen to the sound of whales singing.

Locals at Gallan Head, on the Isle of Lewis, are expected to vote in favour of the plan on Wednesday.
They are also hoping to set up a dark skies space observatory.
The radio and radar station was set up at Aird Uig 60 years ago. It is now hoped a hydrophone could be placed in the sea to pick up the sound of whales.
The site was part of Nato's early warning system against Soviet submarines and aircraft, but the Ministry of Defence has no further use for the derelict buildings on the clifftop site.
The local community is convinced the old base could help transform the economy of the area.
Other attractions include unexplored sea caves and cliff climbs that have never been tackled.
