The CCTV pictures show Ricardo Hunter a few days before his body was found at a mansion in Headley, near Epsom, on 25 July.
Surrey Police said it wanted more party-goers to come forward with information about the death of Mr Hunter, who was also known as 40.
Three people arrested over his death have been released on bail.
A woman was also shot in the leg and a man suffered minor shoulder injuries at the party in Church Lane.
The majority of party-goers were from the London area, a spokesman for Surrey Police said.
Det Insp Jo Sidaway said: "Today marks a month since the murder of 34-year-old Ricardo Hunter.
"We have already spoken to a number of people who attended that evening and are urging anybody who we have not yet spoken to, or anyone with information to contact us."
A 27-year-old man from London arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon was released on bail until 15 September.
A 28-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, and a 30-year-old woman held on suspicion of assisting an offender, have also been bailed until September.
