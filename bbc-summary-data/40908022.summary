[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Edwards' second-half header secured Plymouth Argyle a draw at Southend United in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An early own goal from Pilgrims defender Sonny Bradley put the Shrimpers in front at Roots Hall.
But Edwards' 62nd-minute equaliser ensured the game ended all square.
Southend - beaten 5-0 at Rotherham in their previous outing - bossed the majority of the first half and took the lead when Jermaine McGlashan's right-wing cross was diverted into his own net by Bradley.
The Shrimpers remained on top with Ryan Leonard shooting inches over from 20 yards and Edwards almost putting past his own goalkeeper when he stabbed a left-wing cross from Stephen Hendrie wide of the left post.
But, following a double substitution at the break, Plymouth improved at the start of the second half with Nathan Blissett having a low shot smartly saved by Mark Oxley.
The Pilgrims stayed on top and equalised in the 66th minute when Edwards headed home Graham Carey's left-wing corner before Oxley brilliantly denied Carey late on.
