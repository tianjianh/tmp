Kenneth Ellis, 44, from Edinburgh, told the 40-year-old woman: "I'm going to kill you."
Ellis admitted detaining the woman against her will, threatening to shoot her and placing a gun against her head at a house in Edinburgh
He is due to be sentenced next month at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The court heard that in August this year had Ellis snapped after the woman, who had been in a relationship with him for three weeks, mentioned a former partner.
Ellis began smashing up the flat and when she tried to open the door he produced a small handgun, which he put to her forehead.
His victim later told police she thought she was going to die:
"I thought 'That's it. I am never going to get out of here," she said.
Advocate depute Angela Gray, prosecuting, said: "The woman's ordeal lasted for around two hours."
She told him she loved him in a bid to placate him and he replied: "No you don't."
At one point Ellis went into the bedroom and the frightened woman managed to dial 999 and told the operator: "Please help. He's got a gun."
Eventually, Ellis returned to the living room,  threw the door keys at her and said: "If you want to go, go."
When police arrived they found the woman standing in the middle of the road "shaking uncontrollably".
The court heard the handgun was in working order and capable of discharging ball bearings.
Ms Gray added: "Although ball bearings were successfully discharged from the pistol, they had insufficient energy to be considered 'potentially lethal."
Ellis also admitted a further charge of sending threatening text messages and making abusive phone calls to a 28-year-old woman between March and August.
