Airdrieonians' fan sponsored shirt sells out in 35 minutes after supporter tribute

Airdrieonians have sold out of replica shirts after the club's supporters' trust became the first fans' group in the world to be the main sponsor of their own team's kit.

The shirts are printed with an image of Airdrie fan Mark Allison, who died of pancreatic cancer in June.
All 100 shirts were sold in 35 minutes on Saturday morning.
"There were lots of disappointed people but they understood the situation," said commercial manager Douglas Allsop.
The Scottish League One side would usually sell between 100 and 150 shirts a season, but have already taken orders for a further 200, even though they will not be available until March.
Orders have come from across Britain and even from fans of other Scottish clubs, including Aberdeen, Rangers and Airdrie's Lanarkshire rivals Motherwell.
Allison raised almost Â£80,000 for cancer charities before he died at the age of 49.
"He was well known throughout Airdrie but also outside the town," said Allsop, who is also a member of the supporters' trust.
"Once he was diagnosed, rather than lie down, he wanted to take on projects and I think that was to keep him upbeat and occupied.
"We're quite a parochial, unfashionable club but we all look after our own. That's part of the reason Mark was so successful in his fundraising.
"I was a friend of Mark's and this is a great legacy."
