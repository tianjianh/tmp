[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father accused of murdering his partner has told a court he killed her by hurling an imitation Faberge egg at her after she confessed to an affair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalie Hemming, 31, was found dead in woodland near Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire, on 22 May.
Paul Hemming denies murder but admitted manslaughter at the start of his trial at Luton Crown Court.
He told the jury the heavy egg, made of jade, hit Miss Hemming's head, causing her to fall into a coffee table.
He said he then realised she was not breathing, telling the jury: "I couldn't believe I had done it. I just thought...I'm in trouble. How am I going to explain it to the kids upstairs? So then I thought I am going to cover this up."
When he was asked why, he replied: "Because I knew I had killed her."
Miss Hemming was last seen alive in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on 1 May.
The court was told Mr Hemming drove Miss Hemming to a wooded area 30 miles away from the couple's home in Alderney Avenue, Newton Leys in Milton Keynes, where he left her body in undergrowth.
The jury has been told their relationship was difficult and Miss Hemming had told her partner she wanted to leave him for another man.
In court, Mr Hemming admitted he was "heartbroken" at the prospect of them splitting up, but he denied claims he had been violent towards Miss Hemming shortly before her death.
When asked what he was thinking when he threw the Â£1,000 egg, he replied: "I have no idea what was in my mind."
He said he had not intended to kill her.
The trial continues.
