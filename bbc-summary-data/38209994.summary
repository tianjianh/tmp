The Edinburgh-based free-from bakery was 28th in its list of the most valuable Scottish brands to Scotland's food and drink retailers.
That was 17 places higher than it achieved last year.
The top brand once again was Irn-Bru, produced by Cumbernauld-based soft drinks producer AG Barr.
Stirlingshire-based Graham's The Family Dairy took second place, making it the most valuable Scottish dairy and food brand.
Larbert-based Malcolm Allan, which sells a range of meat products including steak pies and lorne sausage, was third.
The list of the top 50 non-alcohol Scottish food and drink brands was compiled by consultancy Kantar Worldpanel.
The rankings were based on the value of take-home sales within Scotland.

This year saw Edinburgh-based Indian foods producer Mrs Unis enter the top 50 for the first time.
The company makes handmade Indian snacks, nan breads and chapatis for the retail, catering and wholesale market.
Among the biggest risers on the list were meat product firms We Hae Meat, which moved up from 43rd to 30th, and Hall's, which rose seven places to 22nd.
In a separate list, Glens Vodka was the top take-home alcohol brand in Scotland, followed by Tennent's, Famous Grouse, Whyte & Mackay and Bells Whisky.
Johnnie Walker was 25th in the list, just behind BrewDog.
