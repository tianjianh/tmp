The frightened feline is back on its paws thanks to a delicate rescue by firefighters and the RSPCA.
A passer-by spotted the kitten stuck in the bin in Hailes Park Close, Wolverhampton.
A fireman got into the bin to hold the kitten, while a plastic collar, smothered in lubricant, was used to ease its head back through the duct.
The five-week-old stray emerged unscathed and was named Dusty by the RSPCA.
RSPCA inspector Steve Morrall said: "When I arrived, I saw the head of the kitten poking out from this bin - it was so unusual and I have never seen anything like it before.

"It is very likely she was looking for food in the bin, but panicked when the bin was being emptied and got herself stuck.
"The kitten was so stuck that it became obvious I would need extra assistance from West Midlands Fire Service. They were absolutely brilliant."
Mr Morrall said: "It was a very delicate operation and we knew we had to be extra careful as it could have gone seriously wrong.
"We do not know how long the kitten was there for and she was understandably distressed.
"A vet was also on the scene to ensure that the kitten could be sedated if required."
Dusty was given a full check-up at a vets, where - apart from a low temperature - she was given a clean bill of health.
