The song, featuring Charlie Puth, rose 21 places to become the fastest-selling single of the year so far with combined chart sales of 193,000 copies.
It also set a new streaming record with 3.68 million streams in seven days.
The track features on the Fast & Furious 7 soundtrack and pays tribute to cast member Paul Walker, who died while filming the blockbuster in 2013.
It is Khalifa's second number one single after a guest appearance on Maroon 5's Payphone in 2012.
Omi's Cheerleader was another high climber, jumping 25 places to number two, according to the Official Charts Company.
Last week's number one - Hold My Hand by Jess Glynne - slipped down to three, while Spanish house DJ Dr Kucho's collaboration with Gregor Salto, Can't Stop Playing, was the highest new entry at four.
