Barcelona have set up a campaign in support of Lionel Messi after the forward was found guilty of tax fraud.

Messi and his father Jorge were both sentenced to 21 months in jail each by a Spanish court earlier this week.
They will appeal against the decision after being found guilty of defrauding Spain of 4.1m euros from 2007 to 2009.
Neither man is expected to serve any time in jail and Barcelona have launched a social media campaign urging fans to show "unconditional support".
A club statement said: "Using the hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi while posting a photo or message with both hands open, the campaign is encouraging all Barça fans to express their sympathy for the greatest footballer in the world by voicing their unconditional support on social networks.
"By making it clear that #WeAreAllMessi, we want Leo to know that he is not alone. All members, supporters clubs, fans, athletes, media and everyone else are invited to participate."
The 29-year-old Argentine, who has helped the club win the Champions League four times and La Liga on eight occasions, was also fined 2m euros (£1.7m), while his father was fined 1.5m euros.
Under the Spanish legal system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.
The pair were found guilty of using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to conceal earnings from image rights.
By Andy West, Spanish football writer:
The hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi - and its equivalents in the Spanish and Catalan languages - immediately became a hugely divisive issue in Spain.
It enjoyed support from many Barca fans, who believe their club is being politically persecuted by the central Madrid government for its part in the campaign for Catalan independence from Spain.
They point to the fact that Messi's case was pushed through despite one branch of the government recommending it was dropped, and that other sports stars - including former Real Madrid duo Jose Mourinho and Iker Casillas - received much lighter punishments for similar tax offences.
However, the hashtag clearly leaves itself wide open to ridicule and critics have taken full advantage on social media, with a widespread attitude summed up by one tweet which read: "No, I haven't defrauded millions haha."
And even some Barca fans share that opinion, with one tweeting: "I'm a Cule [Barca fan] but supporting someone who has defrauded the tax office seems pathetic. #WeAreNotAllLeoMessi"
