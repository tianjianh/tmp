Bryan Redpath: Yorkshire Carnegie head coach to leave club at end of the season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire Carnegie head coach Bryan Redpath is to leave the club at the end of the season, to be replaced by attack coach Jimmy Lowes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Scotland captain Redpath, who won 60 caps, is leaving the sport for a business position.
The 45-year-old took over at Headingley in March 2015 and led them to the play-offs last season.
Carnegie are currently second in the Championship table, eight points behind leaders London Irish.
Redpath told the club website: "I would like to thank everyone involved in Yorkshire Carnegie; the owners, board of directors, the staff, players and supporters.
"This new challenge has been a massive decision for me to make after 29 years on from starting my career in the Melrose first team."
