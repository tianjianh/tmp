Sunderland: Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes a candidate to succeed David Moyes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes is being considered by Sunderland as a candidate for the vacancy created by fellow Scotsman David Moyes' exit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moyes resigned after one season in charge at the Stadium of Light, his side finishing bottom to exit the Premier League after a 10-year stay.
McInnes' Dons are in Saturday's Scottish Cup final against Celtic.
The 45-year-old's side also finished runners-up to Celtic in the league and lost to them in the League Cup final.
McInnes, who was appointed by the Scottish Premiership club in 2013, has had a previous stint as manager in England's second tier.
He took charge of Bristol City in October 2011 and steered them clear of relegation trouble in his first season.
However, he was sacked in January 2013 with his side again in the drop zone.
McInnes, who led St Johnstone to promotion to Scotland's top flight before moving to the Robins, was heavily linked with the Rangers manager's job after Mark Warburton left Ibrox in February.
Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne announced that he would refuse any approach from Rangers for permission to speak to his manager.
McInnes subsequently had a public disagreement with the man who did succeed Warburton, Pedro Caixinha, saying Rangers should be embarrassed to finish behind Aberdeen in the league considering their superior financial resources.
Sunderland chief executive Martin Bain was at Ibrox during McInnes' five-year spell as a Rangers player.
The former midfielder also played for Greenock Morton, Toulouse, West Bromwich Albion, Dundee United, Millwall and St Johnstone.
Sunderland have had eight permanent managers since Roy Keane parted company in December 2008 and four since Martin O'Neill exited in March 2013.
Whoever is their next manager will face a difficult financial environment, with the Black Cats' last annual figures showing a loss after tax of £33m and a net debt of £110.4m, while relegation from the Premier League will also drastically reduce revenue.
