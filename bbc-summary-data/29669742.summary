Boro, who slip to fifth in the Championship, dominated the first half with Patrick Bamford forcing a fine early save from Jonathan Bond.
The hosts took the lead after the break with Kike finding the top corner, before Deeney levelled from six yards.
Watford, who are now level on points with leaders Derby, also hit the post through Joel Ekstrand's header.
Bamford proved a handful early on for the Watford defence, with the Boro forward seeing one effort saved by Bond and another hacked away inside the six-yard box.

Kike headed just over the bar, while at the other end Matej Vydra's shot from 25 yards was well kept out by Boro keeper Dimitrios Konstantopoulos.
Ikechi Anya also saw a drive from a narrow angle beaten away by Konstantopoulos before the hosts broke the deadlock on 49 minutes with Kike finding the net from inside the box.
Deeney's introduction galvanised Watford and he equalised just after the hour, converting Anya's pass from the byline.
The Hornets then hit the post after Tozser's set-piece was headed against the upright by Ekstrand, before Kike volleyed wide at the other end.
Late on, Konstantopoulos kept out Tozser's free-kick from range as the points were shared at the Riverside.
Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka:  "I'm very happy. It was one of our better games since I arrived at the club.
"If football was fair, we would have won 4-0 because in the first half we were very good and had so many chances.
"If we had taken them, the game would have been completely different.
"But when you don't finish off the game against one of the best teams in this league you can have problems."
Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic: "I expected a little bit more from my players but I can be happy with the result. It is not easy to get one point at this stadium.
"Troy is an important guy for us. He gives us so much in a physical game like this when there were so many challenges and tackles.
"We have used him as a sub in the last three games and he will soon be starting."
