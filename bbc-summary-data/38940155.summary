Burton Albion 2-1 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Kightly's third goal in as many games earned Championship strugglers Burton a crucial victory over Norwich.

Timm Klose's error gifted Albion the lead as Lasse Vigen Christensen nicked possession and squared for fellow Fulham loanee Cauley Woodrow to tap in.
City levelled when Steven Whittaker's wild shot deflected in off Cameron Jerome for his 11th goal of the season.
But Kightly grabbed a stylish winner, flicking the ball past Russell Martin before lifting a shot over John Ruddy.
Norwich came into the game on a six-game unbeaten league run, but were let down again by their poor away record.
The Canaries have lost nine times away from Carrow Road in the league this season, only Forest and Rotherham having conceded more Championship goals on the road.
Both Burton goals came against the run of play, but the hosts could have won by a greater margin, with Lloyd Dyer blasting over and Martin clearing as Jackson Irvine prepared to pounce.
Nigel Clough's side, who have conceded in 16 consecutive league matches, protested strongly against City's sole goal, claiming Jerome had handled.
Yet the Canaries, who had 64% possession in an often scrappy game, felt they should have had a stoppage-time penalty when Wes Hoolahan was bundled over.
Burton's third win in five league matches lifted them to 20th, four points clear of the bottom three, while Norwich slipped to seven points off the play-off places in seventh.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "That's right up there with our best results this season, especially in the context of where we find ourselves in the league playing against a very good side as we did today.
"It was just about pure hard work and the desire to stop the opposition playing. The two goals are great quality from our point of view, especially the second one.
"It was the work-rate today that did it and I thought that was outstanding. There was a real desire at the end to see it through and get the three points."
Norwich boss Alex Neil:  "It's hugely disappointing. We got into good areas at times, but the final ball wasn't good enough when we got it in there.
"We had most of the game and Burton's centre-forward (Cauley Woodrow) gets man-of-the-match.
"When we scored we looked as if we are going to go on and win the game.
"We gave the ball away in a stupid area from our own throw-in and then didn't defend well enough."
