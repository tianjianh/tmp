Wimbledon 2017: Murray crashes out against Querrey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reigning Wimbledon champion, Andy Murray has been been knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murray, the world number one, lost in five sets to American Sam Querrey.
It looked like Andy was struggling with injury, limping around the court between points.
What is a Grand Slam?
They are the four most-important annual tennis events and they're also called majors. They offer the most prize money and media attention. They also contribute most to a players world ranking.
The result is sure to be disappointing for Murray fans.
Querrey now moves on to the semi-finals of the world famous tennis competition.
He is the first American man to reach the semi-finals at a Grand Slam since Andy Roddick finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in 2009.
Johanna Konta is now the only Brit left in the competition.
