Jacques Rudolph (51 not out) steered them home with help from David Lloyd (30) and Craig Meschede (36 not out).
Derbyshire had reduced the hosts to 85-4 at Colwyn Bay, but Meschede blasted Glamorgan home with several boundaries.
Earlier Derbyshire added 123 runs, with Billy Godleman making 106 and Matt Critchley 70 not out, as they made 536.
Glamorgan looked to be easing towards their target after an opening stand of 56 between Mark Wallace and Nick Selman, but lost four wickets for 29 either side of tea.
Derbyshire kept up the pressure removing Lloyd and Graham Wagg in quick succession to try to end their own spell of 12 months without a red-ball win.
But the target proved too modest despite a magnificent fightback from the visitors, who had followed on 341 runs behind.
The match will be remembered for Glamorgan teenager Aneurin Donald's spectacular hitting on day one as he smashed 234 off just 136 balls.
Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman will receive a three-point disciplinary penalty for his reaction when given out lbw in the first innings.
Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport: "There were nervous moments, but Michael Hogan just summed it up as the best win he's been involved with here and I can understand why because it was full graft, we spent over 200 overs in the field.
"You can't put a price on experience and to have Jacques coming in at four - we knew if we had one guy to anchor it, it allowed the other guys to play their natural strokeplay around him.
"The three games leading up to this, we've been playing better cricket and we did it here.
"Full credit to Colwyn Bay Cricket Club for the welcome and the excellent pitch."
Derbyshire head coach John Sadler told BBC Radio Derby: "We are very disappointed, it's never good when you lose so credit to Glamorgan, they worked very hard for this win and they probably deserve it.
"We fought really hard second dig, we said we wanted to bat for two days, to try to put them under pressure so the way we fought back and grafted was superb, I'm proud of them.
"The 20 minutes on day one when we dropped four catches ultimately has put us on the back foot and we didn't apply ourselves first dig, those two things have cost us the game."
