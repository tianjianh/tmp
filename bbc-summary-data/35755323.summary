Ukrainian doctors have been granted access to hunger-striking pilot Nadia Savchenko, on trial in Russia, a Ukrainian lawmaker has said.

A team of "the best Ukrainian doctors" would examine her on Wednesday, said Iryna Gerashchenko, from President Petro Poroshenko's party, on Facebook.
Ms Savchenko is said to have been refusing food and water since Friday.
US Vice President Joe Biden has added his voice to a global campaign for her release.
Ms Savchenko is on trial in Russia after being captured while fighting pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
She is accused of directing artillery fire that killed two Russian journalists - a claim she denies.
In a statement, Mr Biden described Ms Savchenko as having been "unjustly imprisoned in Russia since 2014 - detained and facing trial on trumped up charges".
"Today, as we mark International Women's Day and honour all the brave women who struggle with injustice in this world, we also stand with Nadia and with the Ukrainian people. And we call on Russia to make the right choice - to drop all charges and release her at once," his statement said.
The EU has expressed concern about her wellbeing, and Nobel prize-winner Svitlana Aleksievich is among more than 4,300 signatories to an open letter urging European leaders to act to secure her freedom.
Ms Savchenko has been refusing food and water since Friday - the day after her trial was abruptly adjourned before she had the chance to make a final statement.
Her detention sparked protests in both Ukrainian and Russian capitals on Sunday.
Amid fears that her health could be irreparably damaged ahead of her next hearing, on Wednesday, Ms Gerashchenko said on her Facebook page that Ukrainian doctors would depart for the southern Russian detention centre in which Ms Savchenko is being held.
"Ukrainian diplomats managed to receive a promise from the Russian authorities that our doctors will get to Nadia on 9 March," said Ms Gerashchenko, who negotiates humanitarian issues with Russia on behalf of Kiev.
"The Ukrainian president gave instructions to immediately form a mobile brigade consisting of the best Ukrainian doctors, taking into account the stance and wishes of Nadia's family, mother and sister, in this important issue."
The Ukrainian consul in the Rostov region where Ms Savchenko is being held, Olexandr Kovtun, told the BBC he had seen Ms Savchenko and that she appeared to be well and focused on Wednesday's court hearing.
Ms Savchenko, 34, has become a heroine in Ukraine and is seen as a symbol of the country's resistance against Russia. She was elected to the Ukrainian parliament from prison.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated following Moscow's annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its support for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
