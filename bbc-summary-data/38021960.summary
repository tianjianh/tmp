The 36-year-old departs after five seasons at the MLS side, who he joined from Tottenham in 2011.
Keane, who scored 92 goals in 146 appearances for the club, said the time is right "for a new challenge".
"I still feel as fit and sharp as ever and I am looking forward to my next adventure," he said.
Keane, who has played for 10 clubs in his career including Leeds, Liverpool and Celtic, announced his retirement from international football in August and scored in his final game - a 4-0 friendly win against Oman.
"Having now retired from international football I am ready to focus everything I have on one last major challenge in club football," he added.
"I will be taking time out to consider my options before announcing my next move."
Keane helped LA Galaxy to three MLS Cup victories and was named the league's most valuable player in 2014.
He was named the LA Galaxy player of the year in four straight seasons from 2012.
"It is hard to put into words what Robbie Keane has meant to the LA Galaxy," said the club's head coach Bruce Arena, who will also be without Steven Gerrard next season after the former England captain announced his departure on Tuesday.
"Robbie has been the most successful international signing in this league's history."
