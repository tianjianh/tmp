Jefferson Montero: Swansea winger 'back to his best' for relegation fight

Swansea City boss Bob Bradley wants to get 'exciting' winger Jefferson Montero back to his very best.

The Ecuadorian international started only his second Premier League game of the campaign as the Swans lost 3-1 at West Brom on Wednesday.
When he arrived at the Swans in July 2014, Montero proved a hit and Bradley said the wideman could prove vital as the Welsh club battles relegation.
"We all want to see if we can make more from Jeff," Bradley said.
Originally signed from Mexican side Morelia, Montero put pen to paper on a new deal to keep him at Swansea until 2020 back in September.
He has made 62 Premier League appearances, but half of those have been from the bench and he has just one league goal for the Welsh club, after he found the net against Stoke back in May 2015.
Montero returned to Swansea injured after playing for Ecuador in the Copa America in the summer and has managed just two Premier League starts and seven appearances off the bench this term.
"When I first arrived he wasn't even in regular training," said Bradley.
"We want to make him better, make him more complete, more consistent. Jeff is really well liked by the other players and really well respected. When guys talk about who they like to play with they mention his name.
"There's a lot that's positive, but there are still times when he wants every ball to his feet and he'll try to create havoc. He's good at it, but I think he'd be even more difficult to defend against if he mixed up his movements and at times put the defender on his heels.
"In those areas Jeff needs to improve if he is to get himself to the top, top level. It's exciting for all of us to work with him every day.
"There have been times when he's been a really good wildcard to air in the second-half, but I've always thought, I'm not just going to accept that's his role. I want to see if he can impact a game from the beginning."
The Swans are mired in the relegation places and face another important game on Saturday as they travel to Middlesbrough who are just one place and three points ahead of them.
It remains to be seen if Bradley starts Montero at the Riverside Stadium, but the Swans' boss admits the winger is one of the most dangerous players in his squad when firing on all cylinders.
"Jeff's not a young player, but it's still early in terms of getting to know him," added Bradley.
"We'll try to keep pushing him forwards because he certainly has something about him with the ball at his feet.
"Our supporters love him and it's what opponents are scared of. No one wants to play against him."
