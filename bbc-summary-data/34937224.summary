The recommendations are in a paper published  by the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service (NICTS) which has been given to the justice committee.
Among the recommendations are the closure of Lisburn, Ballymena, Armagh and Strabane courthouses.
A Department of Justice spokesperson said no final decisions had been made.
"The minister [David Ford] will take time to reflect on the views of the justice committee and will make an announcement in the new year," they added.
Among the recommendations are:
Explaining the recommendations, the Department of Justice spokesperson said: "The consultation document set out the challenges facing NICTS in the context of diminishing resources which meant that continuing to operate the current 20 courthouses is no longer sustainable.
"In addition to the financial challenges, business volumes have been falling and many of the court buildings are underutilised.
"It was therefore necessary to reflect on the number of courthouses required."
