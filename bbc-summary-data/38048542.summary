Dominic Doyle, 21, was an innocent bystander who was stabbed during a night out in Denton on 7 June 2015.
His mother, Rhian Jones, is supporting a week-long knife surrender by police to get knives off the street.
She said: "I'm hoping that if I can help somebody else, just one person, then I feel like I've done my bit."
"He was my life, he was my only child and I just exist," she said.
"It's changed me totally and everybody around me. He was my life.
"I just want people to speak to their kids, be honest with them, be open, talk to them, have the conversations about what's right and what's wrong."
Colin McDonald was jailed for 15 years in February after being found guilty of Dominic Doyle's manslaughter following a trial at Manchester Crown Court.
The "Bin the Blade" campaign by Greater Manchester Police sees dedicated bins placed into 11 police stations in Greater Manchester.
Knives - including illegal weapons or any other unwanted bladed instruments - can be dropped off in the bins safely and anonymously until 27 November.
Det Ch Insp Debbie Dooley said: "Knives pose a serious risk within our communities and the more we can take off our streets, the greater chance we have of saving lives."
