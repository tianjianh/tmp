He was due to take up the post of first vice-president, a key part of the peace process aimed at ending more than two years of civil war.
Mr Machar fled Juba at the start of the conflict in December 2013.
More than two million people have been displaced and tens of thousands killed in the fighting.

Rebel spokesman William Ezekiel told journalists waiting for Mr Machar at Juba's airport that the trip had been postponed until Tuesday.
He said that the rebels were still committed to the peace process.
