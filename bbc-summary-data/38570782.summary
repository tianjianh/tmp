The body of Chase Tate, 23, was found on the A1104 at Miles Cross Hill, Ulceby, in the early hours of Saturday.
Lincolnshire Police said it was currently looking through CCTV in a bid to identify the driver involved.
Insp Simon Heads said: "We are systematically working through it until we get to the vehicle which struck him."
He said he was keeping an open mind about whether a driver may have been unaware of hitting Mr Chase.

A post-mortem examination found Mr Tate's injuries were consistent with being struck by a vehicle.
