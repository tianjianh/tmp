[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of cyclists in Northern Ireland have been taking part in a Giro d'Italia spin-off event on Sunday.

The Gran Fondo is run by RCS, the organisers of the Giro cycle race that visited Northern Ireland in May 2015.
It began at Belfast's Titanic Quarter, with two routes: A 173km route taking in the Mourne Mountains and a shorter 58km one that passed Strangford Lough.
Roads were closed along the course, and police thanked motorists who faced delays for their patience.
"This was a significant event for Northern Ireland and yet again we have proved that we are more than capable of hosting international events and doing them well," said ACC Alan Todd.
"Thank you to everyone who worked behind the scenes to make the event a success including the many volunteers and marshals."
Northern Ireland rider Mark Kane was the first to cross the finishing line on the Mournes route, in a time of just over five hours. His brother Paul came in second.
The event for amateurs and professionals is being held in Northern Ireland until 2017 as a legacy of the Giro d'Italia.
Organisers said it was the largest ever mass participation sporting event to be staged in Northern Ireland.
