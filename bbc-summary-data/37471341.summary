[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man on trial over Dunblane bin lorry death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial has begun of a bin lorry driver accused of causing the death of an 80-year-old wheelchair user by dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Hamilton, 44, is said to have collided with Peter Wills' motorised wheelchair on 3 December 2014 on Sheriffmuir Road, Dunblane.
It is alleged that as a result, Mr Wills was so severely injured that he died.
Mr Hamilton, from Bonnybridge, denies causing his death by dangerous driving.
The charge also accuses Mr Hamilton of reversing the bin lorry without taking "adequate steps" to ensure it was safe and clear, and without using a trained banksman provided for the purpose.
The trial, before Lord Ericht at the High Court in Stirling, is expected to last several days.
