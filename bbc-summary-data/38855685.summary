Police could scarcely believe their luck when they found a bungling burglar dangling out of a bathroom window.

Sean Crawshaw, 47, got stranded after trying to break in to the house in Radcliffe, Bury, Greater Manchester.
The homeowner, in her 60s, found him wedged on the windowsill about 15ft (4.5m) off the ground after returning from a trip to the shops.
The long arm of the law plucked Crawshaw to safety and he has now been jailed for the botched burglary.
Crawshaw, of James Street, Radcliffe was sentenced to two years and five months at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court last month.
He had pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal after being caught in the bathroom window in Bank Street  in December.
Sgt Richard Garland of Greater Manchester Police told the BBC: "It was nice of him to hang around.
"He was actually cautioned as he was in mid-air.
"We did all have a chuckle about it later but the homeowner was actually pretty shaken up about it all.
"It's not nice having someone burgle your home and then finding them still there."
It took fire crews 20 minutes to rescue Crawshaw, who hurt his ear in the raid.
GMP officers arrested him at the scene but not before they caught his embarrassing moment on camera.
