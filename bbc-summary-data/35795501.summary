Thunder, helped by debutant Amy Clinton, edged clear in the final quarter for a 65-51 success that moved them to the summit on goal difference.
Mavericks had beaten Celtic Dragons the previous Monday.
Team Northumbria remain a place above bottom side Yorkshire Jets, who were beaten 52-39 by Loughborough Lightning.
The battle between third and fourth saw Surrey Storm beat Team Bath 54-42 to go level on 15 points.
Bath won the Super Saturday battle between the two teams in January but Surrey gained revenge to keep up the pace at the top end of the table.
Storm are back on court in Monday's televised game when they take on Team Northumbria.
