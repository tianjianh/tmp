Â£2.5m is being invested in new facilities at Liberton High where 12-year-old Keane Wallis Bennett died after the "modesty" wall fell on her.
Edinburgh City Council said a permanent memorial was planned as well as a new extension to the PE block.
The Health and Safety Executive is continuing its investigation into the tragedy, which happened on 1 April.
Paul Godzik, Edinburgh City Council's education convener, said: "The overwhelming view from staff at the school, parents and the local community is that the gym should be demolished as soon as possible.
"The proposal is that this will happen at the earliest opportunity, and assuming that the necessary consents are in place, we hope this will be able to take place over the summer break to minimise disruption to the school.
"The tragic incident two months ago has obviously had a devastating effect on the local community and we are determined to work with them and other partners to ensure nothing similar can ever happen again.
"Discussions about a suitable memorial at the school for Keane are continuing and we hope to make an announcement in the near future."
