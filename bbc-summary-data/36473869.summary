At Wolverhampton Crown Court, Daniel Jones, 34, admitted murdering Paul Tompkins in his Stourbridge flat after being invited there for a drink.
He beat his victim in a "horrific attack" before stealing some property to buy more alcohol, police said.
Jones, from Forge Road, was told he must serve a minimum of 18 years.
Police said Mr Tompkins, known as Tonka, "offered the hand of friendship" to his killer after meeting him in the street after Jones had stormed out of his home because of a family argument.
Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin, said Jones launched the "prolonged" on him after the pair spent the afternoon drinking together
Mr Tompkins' neighbours heard a disturbance coming from the flat on Forge Road and raised the alarm, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Jones left the flat and went to a nearby pub where he got a change of clothes from a friend and disposed of his blood-stained clothing in a nearby garden.
The motive for the fatal beating is not known, police said.
Mr Tompkins' family praised the "thorough" police investigation and thanked social services for the daily help they gave him.
"Our brother Paul was a gentle and generous man, who was considered fondly by those who knew him, as was clearly expressed by the many kind comments on social media after his death," they said.
"These comments and the attendance at Paul's funeral have been a comfort to his family."
