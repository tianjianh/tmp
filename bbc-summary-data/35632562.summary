They are up against William Vanderpuye who voices Rastamouse, which is also up for best children's series.
Stick Man is also nominated in the best long form category up against Aardman's Shaun The Sheep Movie.
Also in that category is Children of the Holocaust, a film for BBC Learning.
The Clangers: I am the Eggbot, which won a Children's Bafta is up for best pre-school series, alongside CBeebies' Hey Duggee: The Omelette Badge and Nick Jr's Lily's Driftwood Bay: Goodbye.
Also nominated in the children's series category alongside Rastamouse: School of Rock is The Amazing World of Gumball: The Shell and Scream Street: Resus Rocks.
The public can join in and vote in some of the categories including favourite short film and music video.
The music videos nominated are James's Moving On, Amaro & Walden's Joyride,  and Benjamin Scheuer: Cookie-tin Banjo.
It is the 20th year for the British Animation Awards, and director Jayne Pilling said "the calibre of this year's finalists prove that the animation industry is in better health than ever".
The awards themselves feature sheep and are individually created by leading animation artists. This year they include Oscar-winning animators Nick Park and Daniel Greaves and award-winning author/illustrator David Melling.
This year's ceremony will be held at the BFI on London's Southbank on 10 March.
