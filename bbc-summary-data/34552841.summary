Detectives said the Spanish-born boy's Romanian mother had originally claimed he had died during an emergency operation at a UK hospital.
Police in Spain said they believe the six-week-old may have been sold for up to Â£11,000.
A Spanish couple, aged 25 and 26, were arrested in Cardiff and the child's mother was arrested at Bristol Airport.
The couple were arrested on 8 October in the Rumney area of Cardiff. They had the baby with them at the time.
The child's 19-year-old mother was arrested the following day upon her arrival into the UK.
The woman and the couple have since been released on bail pending further inquiries involving authorities in Spain and the UK.
South Wales Police said the baby is safe and in the care of Cardiff council.
All three people who were arrested originally travelled to the UK from Spain.
Spanish police alerted officers in Britain after suspicions were raised over the birth of the baby and the mother's claims he had died at the age of 15 days following an operation for an injury to a vein.
Her son was born in the Virgen de la Concha hospital Zamora in northern Spain in September.
A hospital spokeswoman said the mother left after three days.
DNA tests are now being carried out to determine who the child's father is.
A Spanish police spokesman said the investigation remained open and they have not ruled out further arrests as they suspect more people were involved in the sale.
