Two helicopters, two lifeboats and six ships searched an area 27 miles south west of Newhaven, East Sussex.
The UK coastguard got a distress call at 18:30 BST on Friday that a member of crew had fallen overboard.
The man was not found.   The coastguard said the search for him would resume if there were any new sightings.
Helicopters from Lydd and Lee-on-Solent and RNLI boats from Newhaven and Shoreham were sent to the scene and several merchant vessels joined the search.
