[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man and woman, aged 21 and 23, was plucked from a red Ford Fiesta on in Alum Rock Road. They have been detained on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts.
Five homes and a business were searched in the city as part of the planned operation, West Midlands Police said.
The arrests are unrelated to last week's attack in Westminster.
Eyewitnesses captured police on camera bringing a man down to the floor.
The footage seemed to show several armed officers swoop in, causing traffic to come to a standstill.
