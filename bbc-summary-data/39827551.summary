Stoke City v Arsenal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke have no new injury worries, with only long-term absentees Ibrahim Afellay and Stephen Ireland sidelined.

Striker Saido Berahino could start after being an unused substitute on his return from illness last time out.
Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain should be fit despite limping off early in the midweek game against Southampton with a hamstring injury.
Laurent Koscielny, who missed that match with a calf problem, will be assessed ahead of Saturday's game.
Simon Brotherton: "With four wins from the last five games, Arsenal appear to be hitting form at just the right time as they try to extend their remarkable run of continuous top-four finishes to 21 seasons.
"They're on the outside looking in at the moment, but the scrap with both Liverpool and Manchester City above them promises to go to the wire.
"They need to keep winning and hope for the best, so I'm sure there are places they would rather be than Stoke this weekend.
"It's seven years since they last won there in the league. The 3-1 victory in February 2010 came thanks to two goals in added time, but it was also the game in which Aaron Ramsey suffered a broken leg."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We know that everything has to go for us if we are to finish in eighth spot, but if we win our two games then we will give ourselves a fighting chance of doing that.
"Things at times maybe haven't gone the way we would have liked this season, and that is for many reasons, but we still have a chance of finishing the season in our highest ever Premier League position.
"We see ourselves as a top-10 club, and if we do fall short this season then we will put our hands up and acknowledge that, but I can assure you we will be far stronger next season."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "Traditionally there is a fierce rivalry and they had always a very direct game against us.
"Overall, I must say as well that they have had good teams. Stoke are now regular participants in the Premier League for years, and that means that anybody who goes there is in trouble.
"We have to show character again. We know we have to play to win the games, so let's keep the focus on the way we want to play and on our team spirit."
The Potters will not roll over, but I think the Arsenal fans can leave their 'Wenger Out' banners at home this weekend.
