Windsor House: New Belfast hotel will cost £30m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Hastings Group says its new hotel project at Windsor House in Belfast city centre will cost £30m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local hotel chain bought Ireland's tallest office block in May for £6m.
But major refurbishment means it will not open as a 200-bedroom, 4-star hotel until 2018.
The company says it will create more than 150 new jobs.
The building will also contain apartments and office accommodation.
It will be called Belfast Grand Central Hotel.
