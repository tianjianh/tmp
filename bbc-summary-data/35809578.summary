[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rapist Luke Grender locked up after sentence reviewed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager rapist has had his suspended sentence replaced by a three-year term in a young offenders institution after the case was referred back to the Court of Appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Grender was sentenced for the rape of a schoolgirl in January but the Attorney-General asked for a rethink.
The judge at that case give him a suspended term due to "exceptional" circumstances caused by the murder of his pregnant sister Nikitta, 19.
He now must serve a three-year term.
Grender, 18, was given a two-year suspended sentence at Newport Crown Court after a judge said his family had been through "heartbreak".
His sister and her unborn baby were murdered in 2011 by Carl Whant, who then burnt down her house.
Whant was jailed for life with a minimum of 35 years.
Grender's trial at Newport Crown Court was told the impact of his sister's death "twisted the thinking" of her brother.
The judge said he could be spared prison because the circumstances were "quite exceptional by any standards".
