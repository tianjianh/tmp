[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hussein Abu, 37, of Whitechapel Road, east London, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the Old Bailey.
Sannah Javid, 26, of Frank Slater House, Green Lane, Ilford, was taken to King George Hospital on 2 December 2014 after officers were called to her flat. She died the next day.
Abu admitted manslaughter on 21 May, halfway through his trial.
The court heard that at the time of her death Ms Sannah had been in a turbulent relationship with Abu for a number of years but by the time of her death the pair were living apart, police said.
On the evening she was killed, officers said Abu was at Ms Sannah's home and initially told them she had collapsed while sitting on her bed, but he later changed his story twice
Det Ch Insp Tim Duffield said: "The police investigation exposed Hussein Abu as a violent and controlling man, a person who, after attacking his partner, was prepared to lie in an effort to escape justice.
"Abu had ample opportunity to admit his guilt earlier but chose to put Sannah's family through the further ordeal of a criminal trial.
"I can only hope today's outcome helps her family begin to come to terms with their loss."
