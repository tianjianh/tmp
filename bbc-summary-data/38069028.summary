Pro12: Ulster v Zebre (Fri)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster flanker Chris Henry is hoping to be passed fit to make his comeback in Friday's Pro12 game against Zebre after being out with a shoulder injury.

The 32-year-old had surgery during the summer and has been working his way back to full fitness.
Ulster head coach Neil Doak said Henry could be available for the Zebre game, along with back Louis Ludik who has recovered from a fractured cheekbone.
However, centre Stuart McCloskey might need another week before playing again.
McCloskey has not played since September because of a foot injury, the 24-year-old having hobbled off in the early stages of Ulster's win away to Glasgow.
Ulster, Pro12 leaders earlier in the season, have slipped to fifth place in the table after three defeats in a row.
They will be expected to beat one-from-bottom Zebre in Belfast, and after that they face Cardiff away on 3 December.
"We are disappointed about the way things have been going recently, after making a good start to the season," said head coach Neil Doak.
"In the last couple of matches we have not been as clinical as we were in earlier games.
"We have had a break and maybe that has done us good.
"We know what Zebre are going to bring with their physicality. We have to match that, but also be smart with our rugby and clinical when we get opportunities in the right areas."
Zebre have one win from their seven games so far, stunning Edinburgh 19-14 at Murrayfield in October.
