The girl, who suffered "extensive dog bite wounds to her face" in the attack in Stoke-on-Trent, is being treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital.
Her condition is "serious" but not thought to be life-threatening. Her family remain at her bedside.
Staffordshire Police said the dog had been taken to specialist kennels.
Emergency services were called to Pretoria Road in Etruria at 10:20 BST.
Officers said they understood the attack took place in the garden of the property.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the girl was airlifted for "emergency care and surgery".
"The girl, who was understandably upset, was given pain relief to help ease her discomfort before ambulance staff assessed her nasty wounds and applied dressings."
"Her condition was said to be serious but stable," the ambulance service said.
