Mr Corbyn will address music fans in the Left Field area, the line-up for which is organised by singer and activist Billy Bragg.
The festival, which has already sold out, runs from 22 to 26 June - coinciding with the in-out referendum on the UK's EU membership on 23 June.
Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has also been invited.
Left Field, which mixes "pop and politics", said Mr Corbyn would be given a platform to discuss issues including social justice, the economy, gender and "and the possibilities for genuine change".
Politicians have taken part in debates at Glastonbury before, such as the Greens' Caroline Lucas and Labour MP Tom Watson - but Mr Corbyn is the first leader of the opposition to do so.
The headline acts at this year's festival includes Adele, Muse and Coldplay.
