[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 2-2 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale snatched a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser as they drew with 10-man Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Jones struck his fourth goal of the season from the penalty spot to haul the Valiants level at the ABAX Stadium after Posh had defender Andrew Hughes dismissed for deliberate handball by referee Graham Horwood.
Jones had earlier opened the scoring in the sixth minute, firing home on the half-volley after Remie Streete nodded Ben Purkiss' right-wing delivery into his path.
Posh's response was impressive and almost immediate as Marcus Maddison picked out George Moncur to fire his first Posh goal just eight minutes into his full debut after arriving on loan from Championship side Barnsley.
The hosts squandered a stack of glorious chances in the second half before Moncur looked like being the matchwinner as he slotted them ahead with six minutes to go after a cross from the left from substitute Paul Taylor broke into his path.
But Posh were denied victory amid the late drama as Hughes saw red and Birmingham loanee Jones kept his cool to convert from the spot and earn Vale their second away point of the season.
