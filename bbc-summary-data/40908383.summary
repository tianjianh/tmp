The U's hit the front in the fifth minute when Ross Lafayette set up Louis John to smash into the top corner before the two sides exchanged goals just before the break.
On 44 minutes, Sutton went 2-0 up when Kenny Davis sent Tommy Wright clear to finish excellently off a post, only for Chester to hit back immediately when Craig Mahon curled in.
Midfielder Lucas Dawson then drew Chester level on 63 minutes only for Sutton to snatch victory in the final minute.
The visitors' two substitutes combined to great effect as Moses Emmanuel fed Cadogan to chip on-loan Burnley goalkeeper Conor Mitchell.
Jon McCarthy's Chester are still to register their first home win this year - in 14 attempts.
