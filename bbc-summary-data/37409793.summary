[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP groped female patients like a teenage boy "grabbing his first pair of boobs", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Robert Lewis, 51, is accused of using routine examinations as a "pretext" to carry out assaults against women applying to join the ambulance and fire service.
Luton Crown Court heard he touched one woman's breasts like he was "polishing headlights".
Dr Lewis denies eight charges involving six women.
Jurors heard the offences took place at the Larksfield Surgery in Stotfold, near Hitchin, Hertfordshire.
Two women alleged he put his hand down their knickers and another described the doctor as being like a 14-year-old boy "grabbing his first pair of boobs" during an examination.
Another claimed he got her to bend over while he pulled out a tape measure and touched her bottom, the court heard.
Prosecutor Mark Fenhalls QC told the jury Dr Lewis had been acquitted of other allegations after a trial last November, but a jury could not decide on some and had found him guilty of others.
He said the new trial involved some of the allegations from the previous case but also new complainants who had come forward since.
"The assaults were subtle and carefully designed to avoid detection," Mr Fenhalls said.
"He was taking advantage of young women who were desperate to pass medicals.
"During some medical examinations, he used the pretext of breast and hernia checks to carry out assaults."
Dr Lewis, of Northbridge Street, Shefford, has pleaded not guilty to five charges of indecent assault and three charges of sexual assault between 1999 and 2007.
When questioned by the police in January 2013, the doctor denied indecently assaulting any patients, saying he always explained what he was doing and would get the patient's consent.
The trial continues.
