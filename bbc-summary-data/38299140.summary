A 17-year-old boy and a girl, aged 16, remain in hospital after the collision on Battersea Park Road on Monday morning.
Their injuries are not believed to be serious, the Metropolitan Police said.
Five other pedestrians - four boys and a girl, all in their late teens - were treated for minor injuries but were later released from hospital.
One victim is understood to have fallen onto the back window of a parked car on the street below the bridge where the accident occurred, the Evening Standard reported.
The 35-year-old driver of the red Ferrari 458 stopped at the scene and was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He remains in custody at a west London police station.
Emergency services, including London's Air Ambulance, attended the incident and road closures were put in place.
It was initially reported that six people were hurt in the crash, but that figure was updated by the Met on Tuesday.
