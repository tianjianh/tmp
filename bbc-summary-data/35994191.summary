The 28-year-old converted from the penalty spot at the Amex Stadium before doubling the hosts' lead by heading in Anthony Knockaert's cross.
Defender Bruno slammed home before Israeli striker Hemed tapped in and Knockaert fired past Marcus Bettinelli.
Brighton moved into second in the table, one point behind Middlesbrough.
Chris Hughton's side are now one point above Burnley, who travel to Birmingham City on Saturday.
He will have been pleased with the way his side dominated after making a slow start against a team that had won their previous three matches.
Once Hemed scored from the spot in the 29th minute, then doubled Brighton's lead five minutes later, Brighton took complete control.
They entertain QPR on Tuesday, while Fulham - for whom this was their worst defeat of the season - travel to play-off outsiders Ipswich Town.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Radio Sussex:

"We probably after the first half performance came in leading 2-0 where we possibly didn't deserve it.
"But, that's what we've got at the moment. We can get goals and get them in different ways.
"Certainly we were a lot better in the second half and I think made it exciting to watch for the supporters.
"At this stage of the season, the pressure is very much on all of us (at the top end of the table). We're all used to either playing early or late and they're just the things you have to cope with."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:
"If we want to be competitive next season, we must not concede so many goals.
"We have four games left this season and we are not completely safe so, after three successive wins, we have paid a very high and very expensive price for our defending.
"It was the 11th penalty we have conceded this season and it was a complete disaster. I don't know if it was a penalty, but we should not give the referee the dilemma.
"We opened all the doors for Brighton after a beginning to the match when we stuck to the game plan."
