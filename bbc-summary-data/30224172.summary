The American actress sings on The Hanging Tree by composer James Newton Howard.
It features on the soundtrack of her new film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.
Mid-week sales figures from the Official Charts Company show the song is at number 29.
The track was co-written by composer James Newton and the folk rock band The Lumineers.
Suzanne Collins, the author of the "Hunger Games" book series, wrote the song's lyrics.
The sales figures also show Band Aid 30's new version of Do They Know It's Christmas could be knocked off top spot after only a week.
The charity single, re-recorded with all the profits from it going towards the fight against Ebola, is currently just over 1,500 copies ahead of Take That's These Days - the group's first song released as a trio since Jason Orange quit.
The rest of the top five is made up of Olly Murs Wrapped Up featuring Travie McCoy at number three, with Labrinth and McBusted at four and five.
