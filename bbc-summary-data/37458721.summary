The visitors took the lead midway through the first half as Lewis Dunk's ball over the top was brought down by Sam Baldock, who chipped goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.
Anthony Knockaert doubled Brighton's lead from close range.
Gary Hooper fired home to pull one back for the Owls in the fifth minute of stoppage time but Brighton held on.

Baldock gave the Seagulls the lead after 26 minutes and Glenn Murray thought he had made it 2-0 with a volley from 12 yards, only to be flagged offside.
The Owls almost drew level when Tom Lees' header following Ross Wallace's corner was cleared off the line by Oliver Norwood.
Knockaert's fifth Championship goal of the season looked to have ensured a comfortable end to the game for Brighton but, after they failed to clear in their own box, Hooper halved the deficit.
However, it was not enough to deny Brighton a fourth victory in six matches as Wednesday suffered just their second Championship loss in their past seven games.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"It was a game that was very balanced, like we expected. It was a tactical game, especially in the first half.
"We had a few chances and Brighton had one or two also, so it was very balanced.
"In the second half, I thought we played better, more offensive and we pressed more. In the moments we pressed more, we created more clear chances and they scored in their solitary moment, the second goal."
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"I thought it was a good win and we were worthy winners, it's nice to send our supporters home happy.
"I think any away win against what you regard as one of the best teams in the division is always a big result.
"But I thought we deserved it and we should've had another goal, when Glenn Murray 'scored'. I thought it was onside, so that was a little bit of a blow.
"But I think to have a percentage of control, in what was such a big game, is credit to our players."
