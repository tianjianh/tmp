St Patrick's Day arrests in Belfast's Holyland

There is a heavy police presence in the Holyland area of south Belfast where hundreds of young people have gathered to celebrate St Patrick's Day.

Officers in a number of police vehicles have patrolled the area throughout Thursday night and Friday.
Eleven people had been arrested in the area over the two days, said Supt Melanie Jones.
The arrests were for "low-level alcohol and disorder-related offences and some low-level assaults", she added.
Behaviour in the area had generally been better than in previous years, police said.
"At the very maximum number, we would've seen a crowd of about 300 or 400," said Supt Jones.
"We've worked very hard to make sure we're getting the messages out early about what sort of behaviour is acceptable."
Both Queen's University and Ulster University asked their students to stay away from the area on St Patrick's Day, and classes were also cancelled on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, many students have remained in the Holyland despite their universities' pleas.
Ray Farley, from the Holyland Residents' Association, said there was a "huge amount of students, young people and non-residents" in the area, adding that it was very noisy.
"If it wasn't for the police presence, it would've been a really bad situation for everyone here," said Mr Farley.
"It's not as bad as last year - police are managing to keep it at a level that, while not acceptable, is not serious."
About 30 staff from the universities have joined police in the area, along with Belfast City Council workers.
Five off-licences in the Holyland have closed "voluntarily" for a number of hours.
Queen's University insists that the majority of those who traditionally travel to the mainly-student area of the city on St Patrick's Day are post-primary pupils or non-students.
There has been no repeat of the overnight disorder in the area on St Patrick's Day last year.
On 17 March 2016, one officer was injured when bottles were thrown at police in Agincourt Avenue as a crowd of about 300 people gathered.
The Holyland, which is close to Queen's University, is dominated by Victorian housing divided into student accommodation.
