The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tried to buy a Glock handgun from an illegal arms dealer in America, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
The boy admitted attempting to import a handgun and offences under the Computer Misuse Act.
He was given a 12-month sentence in a young offenders' institution at Cardiff Youth Court on Tuesday.
The dark web is a series of global networks people use anonymously which hides the operator's identity.
The NCA said when the boy's house was raided, evidence was found to show he had been involved in a cyber attack which shut down web pages, known as distributed denial of service (DDoS).
He must pay more than Â£1,000 to the victim of the DDoS.
Colin Williams, operations manager for the NCA in Wales, said: "The 'dark net' provides criminals with a false sense of security. Some believe they are anonymous online and can act with impunity, whether they operate on the hidden or open internet."
