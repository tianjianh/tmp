[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gary Locke to remain as Cowdenbeath manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Locke has agreed to stay on as Cowdenbeath manager after the Fifers retained their senior status via the play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Hearts and Kilmarnock boss, 41, took over at Central Park in March after being sacked by Raith Rovers during the previous month.
He could not prevent the Blue Brazil from finishing bottom of League Two.
However, Cowden kept their league place after a penalty shoot-out win against Lowland League champions East Kilbride.
