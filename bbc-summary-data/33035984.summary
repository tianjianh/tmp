[SN]TITLE[SN]
Medical regiment gets freedom of the Borough of Chorley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An army regiment has been awarded the freedom of Chorley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 3 Medical Regiment, based at Fulwood Barracks, Preston was presented with a freedom scroll by town mayor Marion Lowe.
Hundreds of well-wishers lined the streets as the regiment marched after the presentation.
Commanding officer Lt Col Adrian Meredith said it meant a "great deal" that Chorley had taken the unit to its heart.
The regiment provides medical support to soldiers on operations and exercises in the UK and abroad.
The honorary freedom role is the council's highest award but is "purely ceremonial", without legal rights or responsibilities.
