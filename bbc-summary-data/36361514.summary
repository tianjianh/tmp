Derry City progressed to the FAI Cup third round thanks to victory against Drogheda in the United Park replay.

Rory Patterson gave City the perfect start when his free-kick hit the bottom corner after just three minutes.
The hosts came into the game after early City dominance and Sean Thornton levelled from a penalty.
Josh Daniels grabbed the Derry winner 10 minutes after the restart, his curling strike finding the top corner and sealing a place in the last 16.
Derry were held to a 1-1 draw by the First Division side on Friday but they were deserved victors on Tuesday night.
Patterson's 25-yard free-kick went through the wall and past keeper Stephen McGuinness for the opener.
However, the striker was forced off with a hamstring injury 10 minutes later to make him a doubt for Sunday's league clash against Bray Wanderers.
Thornton fired a free-kick just over and City stopper Ger Doherty denied Aaron Ashe before the 36th minute equaliser.
Aaron Molloy was pushed by Dean Jarvis as he prepared to strike on goal and Thornton stepped up to drill home from 12 yards.
Austrian midfielder Lukas Schubert was making his first start for the Candystripes and he flashed wide before setting up Daniels for the decisive third goal of the game.
Daniels latched on to Schubert's pass before bending his shot beyond McGuinness.
City pressed for a third goal and McGuinness managed to claw away an Aaron Barry header while Drogheda failed to threaten at the other end.
