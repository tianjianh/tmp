Raheem Sterling: Jamie Carragher fears for Liverpool star's reputation

Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher says Raheem Sterling's reputation is being affected after he asked to be left out of the club's pre-season tour.

The forward, 20, does not want to go on the forthcoming trip to the Far East after Liverpool rejected a £40m bid from Manchester City for him.
The England international missed training on Wednesday through illness.
"He's starting to get a reputation that could be hard to rid himself of in the future," said Carragher.
"Are Man City fans looking at the situation and thinking this could be us in a few years?"
Liverpool travel to Bangkok on Sunday then fly on to Australia and Malaysia.
Through his request, Sterling - who returned to pre-season training on Monday - has once again made it clear to manager Brendan Rodgers that he wants to leave.
He has expressed his desire not to go on the tour in the hope of making a smoother exit from Anfield after an increasingly acrimonious saga in which he has turned down a contract offer of about £100,000 a week.
Manchester City have had two offers for him turned down, but are now expected to return with a third bid nearer Liverpool's £50m valuation.
Whether it comes soon enough to avoid the latest twist in what has become a very public breakdown in the relationship between club and player remains to be seen.
"I think this situation will only make Liverpool more determined to get the fee they feel Raheem is worth, rather than caving in to Raheem's and Man City's wishes," added Carragher.
Liverpool have refused to comment on claims Sterling will refuse to travel, but are expected to demand that every player who is fit and available for selection join up on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Spanish defender Javier Manquillo has returned to Atletico Madrid after his two-year loan at Anfield was terminated early by mutual consent.
Atletico said the 21-year-old has been recalled because he "has not had all the minutes he and our club consider necessary" for his development.
Manquillo made 19 appearances for the Reds last season but did not play for the club after a 1-0 defeat by Besiktas in the Europa League in February.
