The victim, 45, was attacked by men at his home in Barnsley and shot in the legs and abandoned in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 13 March.
The arrest follows a large-scale cross-border investigation.
The arrested man is expected to appear at Hamilton Sheriff Court later.
The victim was allegedly attacked at his house in Strafford Walk, Dodworth, Barnsley, before being driven to East Kilbride where he was shot in the knees and dumped by the side of the road.
Emergency services found the man on a grass verge near the junction of Stewartfield Way and Stewartfield Crescent.
He was taken to the town's Hairmyres Hospital for extensive treatment and has since been released.
Police in Scotland and England launched a large-scale investigation named Operation Draken to trace those responsible.
