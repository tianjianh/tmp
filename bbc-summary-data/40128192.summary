[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Clarke will start his first championship game in two years for Armagh in Sunday's Ulster SFC derby against Down at Newry.

Crossmaglen's Clarke is named at right full-forward in a team that includes five championship debutants.
Blaine Hughes starts in goals while the other newcomers are Clarke's club-mate Oisin O'Neill, Aaron McKay, Niall Grimley and Andrew Murnin.
O'Neill helped St Mary's College win the Sigerson Cup in February.
While Ciaran McKeever, Ethan Rafferty and Stephen Harold are not named in the starting line-up, the side does include experienced campaigners Charlie Vernon, Brendan Donaghy, Stefan Campbell and Mark Shields.

Armagh manager Kieran McGeeney will be banned from the dugout on Sunday.
The 2002 All-Ireland winning captain was handed a 12-week ban by GAA disciplinary bosses after an alleged verbal altercation with linesman Joe McQuillan during Armagh's Division Three League game against Antrim in March.
Down manager Eamon Burns has yet to name his side but injury concerns over the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome and midfielder Peter Turley appear to have eased.
The Mourne County will be without Brendan McArdle and Ryan McAleenan because of long-term injuries but Down's squad looks stronger than it was for much of the league campaign.
Down struggled for much of the league but a gutsy late rally saw them retaining their Division Two place thanks to a draw against Cork, as Fermanagh and Derry suffered relegation.
Armagh missed out on securing promotion to Division Two after suffering a heartbreaking last-gasp defeat by Tipperary in their final Division Three round-robin match.
Armagh: B Hughes; J Morgan, C Vernon, P Hughes; A McKay, B Donaghy, M Shields; S Sheridan, N Grimley; A Forker, O O'Neill, R Grugan; J Clarke, S Campbell, A Murnin.
