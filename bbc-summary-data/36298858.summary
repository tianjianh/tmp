[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire teenager Haseem Hameed led Lancashire's fightback against Durham on day two at Chester-le-Street.

The England Under-19s batsman hit 74, his fourth half century, to help his county rally from 21-2 to reach 205-4.
Earlier in the day, Durham had moved their score on from their overnight 341-6 to be bowled out for 411.
Paul Collingwood added only 12 before holing out in the gully on 97 as Durham missed out on full batting points before Barry McCarthy hit a lively 37.
The Irish tail-ender hit three fours and two sixes in a last-wicket stand of 36 with Graham Onions, Lancashire's Tom Bailey finishing with 5-110.
That came after the loss of Collingwood, slicing a drive off Kyle Jarvis, had earned full bowling points for Lancashire just four balls before the 110-over cut-off.
In Lancashire's reply, Durham paceman James Weighell, brought in to replace the injured Chris Rushworth, made early inroads, having both Karl Brown and Luke Procter caught at third slip.
Hameed and Alviro Petersen (61) then made Durham toil for the rest of the afternoon session in a stand worth 104.
Even after Petersen had been trapped lbw by ex-England seamer Onions, Hameed continued to progress in a 79-run stand with skipper Steven Croft.
Hameed was within sight of a maiden first-class century when he missed an attempted pull off a long hop from leg spinner Scott Borthwick and was bowled.
However, Hameed's efforts have steered Lancashire to within sight their first target - they need 57 more runs to avoid the threat of being asked to follow on.
Durham fast bowler James Weighell:
"The pitch is a bit two-paced and it's not easy for batsmen when they first come in.
"The plan will be to go hard at them with the second new ball.
"If we get a couple of wickets we will be in the box seat."
Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was quite difficult, especially against the new ball, and after losing two early wickets it was important to rebuild. But it was great to have someone of Alviro Petersen's experience in the middle with me.
"I enjoyed our hundred partnership. The message was to make sure we had at least one big stand because we always feel we can catch up later in the innings.
"It wasn't nice getting out to a long hop, but sometimes that happens. Hopefully next time I can press on to a hundred."
