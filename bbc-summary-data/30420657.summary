[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to turn Cirencester's centre into a "shared space" for pedestrians and cars have been approved by councillors.

The town council wants to make the Market Place more pedestrian-friendly by closing it to through traffic and pedestrianising part of it.
The scheme, which could cost up to Â£1.5m, was approved by Cotswold District Council.
Mayor of Cirencester Joe Harris, said: "It's been a long time in the making - so it's great news."
Mr Harris said numerous schemes to regenerate the town centre had been "bandied around" over the past 50 years.
The latest scheme has been nearly seven years in the planning and includes closing the area off to traffic to create a "sizeable open space".
Flagstones and bollards will mark out "pedestrian-prioritised shared space" and the northern side of the square will be pedestrianised.
"What we're doing is making it a nicer area for pedestrians to walk through, with drivers at the mercy of pedestrians and the priority always with the pedestrian," said Mr Harris.
"I'd like to see something start in 18 months' time but we'll need to get the funding together."
