Wayne Rooney: Ronald Koeman would be 'very pleased' to re-sign striker for Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton boss Ronald Koeman would be "pleased" to bring Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney back to the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rooney, 31, has had his future questioned by several newspapers after being dropped from the starting line-up by Jose Mourinho.
"He is a great player, and he has still not finished his career," said Koeman.
Mourinho, however, has insisted that Rooney - currently three goals shy of being the club's leading goalscorer - is part of his plans.
Koeman added: "I do not know how his situation is, and I need to respect that situation. That's not my problem.
"But even when we get one time the possibility that Rooney is an option for Everton, I'm very pleased."
Rooney joined United from Everton for Â£27m in 2004, since when he has scored 246 goals in 532 games for the club.
