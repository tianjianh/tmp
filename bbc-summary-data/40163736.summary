[SN]TITLE[SN]
Harry Arter fully committed to Republic of Ireland cause

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harry Arter says his commitment to playing for the Republic of Ireland has been judged "a little bit unfairly".

The Bournemouth midfielder has managed just four appearances for his country in two years since making his debut.
He missed out on selection for the Euro 2016 finals but is still keen to establish himself as a regular.
Arter was named man of the match in the friendly win over Uruguay but is not expected to start Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Austria in Dublin.
Jeff Hendrick and Glenn Whelan could be manager Martin O'Neill's preferred midfield pairing with Wes Hoolahan in a play-making role, and Arter possibly having to settle for a place on the bench.
International opportunities have been limited, much to the frustration of the 27-year-old, who once had to deny speculation he was about to switch allegiance to England prior to playing his first competitive game.
When asked about his stop-start international career, Arter said: "it's been disappointing".
"I've felt my commitment levels have been judged a little bit unfairly and one thing I've always said to myself is that I won't say too much to the press about being judged on my commitment.
"I'll just try and perform on the pitch and show when I play that I'm one hundred per cent committed."
Arter started in the reverse fixture against Austria which the Republic won 1-0 at the Ernst Happel Stadium, and hopes a niggling injury won't trouble him further this week.
"I've got a slight little problem with my ankle at the moment.
"It probably requires an injection at the end of the internationals, but it's nothing too important. It was just a little bit of soreness.
"I'm mentally strong enough to put niggles like that to one side. In the past, I've unfortunately missed out on a few trips through injuries that I've been unable to play through.
"When I can play through something, I'm more than prepared."
Victory over the Austrians would edge the Republic ever closer to qualification - they and Serbia currently enjoy a four-point advantage over both Austria and Wales in Group D.
He said: "it (victory) would put us in a great position, it will be a long summer individually and collectively if we don't get a positive result, so fingers crossed."
