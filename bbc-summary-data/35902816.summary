Boreham Wood claimed a draw in their relegation battle at Chester, having been stranded in motorway traffic that saw kick-off delayed by 50 minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors' coach was at a standstill for over two hours, meaning the players got changed during the journey.
The action was worth the wait as John Rooney swept Chester ahead before Scott Doe bundled in an equaliser.
Rooney put Chester back in front with a curling free-kick, but Harry White restored parity in a late scramble.
