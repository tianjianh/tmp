Tranmere Rovers saw their unbeaten start to the season end at Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts, themselves looking to keep up pressure at the top, took the lead just three minutes in when Bernard Mensah came out best in a scramble six yards out after Cheye Alexander's cross.
Tranmere levelled on 37 minutes as Andy Cook headed in James Norwood's cross for his fourth goal of the season.
But the Merseysiders were stunned on 77 minutes when Scott Rendall calmly stroked home from the penalty spot following a foul on Iffy Allen, before a superb Will Evans volley made sure of the points five minutes later.
