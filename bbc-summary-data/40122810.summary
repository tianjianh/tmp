GP warned after Newport woman's pill death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP has been given a formal warning over his treatment of a woman who died after taking a contraceptive pill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlotte Foster, 23, from Newport, Shropshire, died from a blood clot in January last year, after seeing GP Sunil Simon.
The General Medical Council (GMC) said he failed to consider a link between her "symptoms and the contraceptive medication".
But no restriction on his registration was required, it said.

Following an inquest last summer Dr Simon was referred to the GMC by the coroner.
Miss Foster went into cardiac arrest at work and died three days later at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital on 25 January, after she went to the doctor with breathing difficulties and leg pain.
In July last year, coroner John Ellery concluded it was more likely than not she would have survived had her pill - Dianette - been stopped and treatment started when she saw a GP.
Miss Foster was presenting symptoms of a pulmonary embolism during her final GP appointment on 4 January but was instead being treated for lower back pain, the inquest found.
She died after a thrombosis caused a "massive" embolism in her lungs.
The warning said on 4 January and in a telephone consultation on 24 December 2015 Dr Simon failed to obtain an adequate history and "consider deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus as differential diagnoses".
It said he also did not "arrange investigations to eliminate/confirm deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus" and formulate an adequate treatment plan including her stopping taking the contraceptive medication.
The warning will be published on the List of Registered Medical Practitioners for five years and disclosed to anyone "enquiring about his fitness to practise history".
It will be disclosed to employers on request after five years.
