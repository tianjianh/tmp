[SN]TITLE[SN]
School entry age in Storrington area may be changed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The age at which pupils enter secondary school in a part of Sussex may be changed under plans being considered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Sussex County Council has proposed changing the entry age for several schools in the Storrington area.
Currently students in the area leave primary at 10 then transfer to a middle school until they are 13, before joining a secondary school.
The council may bring the schools in line with the rest of the county where pupils start secondary school at 11.
Jeremy Hunt, the council's cabinet member for education, said: "Ofsted advised us some time ago that we needed to develop a consistent approach to education across the whole county.
"The aim of this is to ensure children are given the best opportunities to learn and prepare for adult life, while at the same time retaining the first-class system of education in the area."
The consultation will be opened on Monday, with a view to any changes being implemented in September 2017.
