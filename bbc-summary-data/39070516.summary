Swansea City head coach Paul Clement has urged his players to keep gathering points to avoid a battle for survival.

Since his arrival in January, Clement has steered the Swans from the bottom of the Premier League to 15th, four points above the relegation zone.
The Swans face a trip to league leaders Chelsea on Saturday but Clement says his side will not feel daunted.
"The only thing I said to the players is we have 13 games to go now we are in a good position," Clement said.
After three wins in four games, former Chelsea coach Clement questioned how much his side want to avoid a battle to stay in the top flight.
"How hard are we willing to work to make sure we are continuing to improve? How much do we want to avoid suffering at the end of the season?," he continued.
"Unless we keep winning and moving up the table, we will be in a position where two games to go we need four points.
"In those situations the pressure is very high. We want to try and get as much of the work done when the games provide you that opportunity to get points. The next opportunity is on Saturday."
As well as Clement's past career with Chelsea, the Swans also have former Blues midfielder Claude Makelele in their ranks on their coaching staff.
Clement said of his Stamford Bridge return: "It's just nice for me personally. I worked there for so many years I still know people there.
"To get an opportunity to go back and coach against that club its a real honour for me.
"I am excited and the players are - and Claude Makelele is going back there. The rest of the backroom staff are all very excited about this challenge."
Midfielder Ki Sung Yeung and winger Jefferson Montero are ruled out of the trip to Stamford Bridge because of injury but Clement still wants his side to put in a shift against Antonio Conte's side.
He added: "We have to go there confident and try to put on a good performance. We know it's going to be a really difficult task and no one is expecting us to win. That takes the pressure off to a certain degree.
"We want to keep our confidence high and that means putting in a good performance, even if we don't get the result we are really looking for."
