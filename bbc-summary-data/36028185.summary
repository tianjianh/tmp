Solihull Moors: Marcus Bignot's side win promotion to the National League

Solihull Moors have secured promotion to the National League - and they did it with three games still left to play.

Marcus Bignot's side celebrated without having to play a game as third-placed rivals North Ferriby United lost 2-0 on Tuesday at Stalybridge Celtic.
That secured the National League North title, ensuring their rise to English football's fifth division for the first time - nine years after forming.
"You can't underestimate just how big an achievement this is," said Bignot.
"It's a great feeling. It's a bit strange to do it without kicking a ball, but it just shows how good we've been this season that we've won the title with three games to spare," the former Birmingham City youth player told BBC WM's Adrian Goldberg.

"It's a special place and we've achieved something special. It has given us a platform to visit a lot of former Football League grounds, but we now want to become an established National League side.
"We have good people here. Not just the players, but throughout the whole infrastructure of the club, people who put in endless hours free of charge who go above and beyond, like our chairman Trevor Stevens.
"He has given his life not only to this club but also to non-league football over the last decade. What he's achieved is remarkable. And there are others who have been key to this success. Geoff Hood, our club president, who died earlier this year, wasn't here to see it, but I know he was looking down."
The club was formed by Solihull Borough's 2007 merger with Moor Green. If, as expected, the Moors swap places with Kidderminster Harriers - who must win their last three National League matches to stand any chance of staying up - it would now make Bignot's side the highest-ranked non-league club in the Midlands.
