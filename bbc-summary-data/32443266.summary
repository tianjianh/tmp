Armenia marks centenary of 'mass killings' by Ottoman Turks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Commemorations are due to begin in Armenia to mark the centenary of the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tens of thousands are expected to march to a memorial on the outskirts of the capital, Yerevan, to lay flowers.
Later, the presidents of Russia and France will be among foreign leaders attending a ceremony.
Turkey strongly objects to the use of the term genocide to describe the killings and the dispute has soured relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Turkey argues that there were many deaths on both sides during World War One.
A memorial service will also be held in Turkey on Friday and its prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has said the country will "share the pain" of Armenians.
However, he has reiterated Turkey's stance that the killings were not genocide.
On Thursday the Armenian Church canonised the 1.5 million people it says were killed in the massacres and deportations.
It said it wanted to proclaim the martyrdom of those who died for their faith and homeland.
After the ceremony, bells tolled in Armenian churches around the world.
Also on Thursday, German President Joachim Gauck described the killings as genocide, on the eve of a debate in the German parliament on the issue.
Earlier this month, Turkey recalled its envoy to the Vatican after Pope Francis also used the word genocide in a reference at a Mass at St Peter's Basilica.
Friday's commemorations will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and France's President Francois Hollande.
France has been a strong advocate of recognising the killings as genocide and President Hollande has pushed for a law to punish genocide denial.
The issue has strained Franco-Turkish relations.
Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died in 1915 at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, whose empire was disintegrating.
Many of the victims were civilians deported to barren desert regions where they died of starvation and thirst. Thousands also died in massacres.
Armenia says up to 1.5 million people were killed. Turkey says the number of deaths was much smaller.
Most non-Turkish scholars of the events regard them as genocide - as do more than 20 states, including France, Germany, Canada and Russia, and various international bodies including the European Parliament.
Turkey rejects the term genocide, maintaining that many of the dead were killed in clashes during World War One, and that many ethnic Turks also suffered in the conflict.
