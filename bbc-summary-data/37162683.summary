Kedleston Hall plans for 400 homes approved by inspector

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of homes could be built near a Grade I listed estate in Derbyshire after a planning inspector overturned a council's decision to block the scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catesby Estates has been granted permission to build 400 homes near Kedleston Hall following a public inquiry in July.
The original plans were rejected last year. In response, the developer submitted proposals for 200 homes.
The National Trust, which runs the hall, was among opponents of the plans.

Inspector John Gray concluded any harm to the 18th Century mansion would be very limited.
While he acknowledged the hall was a "heritage asset of the greatest importance", he called the plans sustainable and said the 120 affordable homes within the 400 would be of "great public benefit".
Campaigner Isobel Shorrock, from campaign group Kedleston Voice, objected to the plans along with Amber Valley Borough Council.
"In the face of all that, for one man to come along and completely overturn it and not even go for a compromise is not democratic," she said.
"I am furious and I am upset. This isn't a Nimby thing. Kedleston Hall is a national heritage asset and the National Trust and Historic England advised that this should not go ahead... and in the face of all that it has still meant nothing."
Council deputy leader Trevor Ainsworth said the authority will have to get legal advice on whether to seek a judicial review over the inspector's decision.
Catesby Estates said it was not in a position to comment on the decision.
