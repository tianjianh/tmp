The 28-year old midfielder has joined the League One side following a successful trial, following his December departure from Levski Sofia.
He can fill the void left by the likely summer departure of ex-England winger Joe Cole, who is reportedly linked with a move to Tampa Bay Rowdies.
Gadzhev's deal includes a one-year extension option in the club's favour.
Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray said: "Vladimir joined on a two-week trial and we've been really impressed with what we've seen from him.
"It's obvious to me that he has a lot of technical quality with the ball. Looking over his career, he has vast experience in the Greek and Bulgarian top flight and he's an experienced international so he has plenty of pedigree which is a valuable asset to any club.
"Whilst he's available for the rest of this season, it's important that we make sure Vladimir settles in as we continue to build a squad for the future."
Coventry currently lie eighth in League One, two points from the play-offs, having won just twice in 12 games going into the Good Friday night trip to Peterborough.
Gadzhev began his professional career with Greek side Panathinaikos, which included loans to Levadiakos and OFI Crete, before moving back to his native Bulgaria with Levski Sofia in 2008.
Having initially moved on loan to Sofia, he made the deal more permanent in 2009, since when he has scored 25 times in 186 games, which included both the Champions League and the Europa League.
He won the first of his 25 Bulgarian caps in 2010, scoring his only goal for his country in a 2-1 win against Belarus.
