His condition was described as stable on 16 May and he was moved out of intensive care.
The 40-year-old and Dan Cooper came off their bikes on the the Black Hill section of the course.

Cooper was taken to the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine with shoulder injuries but was later discharged.
Farquhar is a well known-figure in motorcycling and has won five races at the North West 200.

However, Farquhar resumed his road racing career in 2014, saying that his family backed his decision to return.
