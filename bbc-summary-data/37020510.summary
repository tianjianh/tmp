Hollyoaks actor Parry Glasspool has been suspended after posting a video in which he mimicked a woman threatening to stab her boyfriend to death.

Channel 4 has also fined Glasspool an undisclosed sum which he will give to a domestic violence charity.
"I am truly sorry to anyone I have upset or offended," he said.
"I would never condone domestic violence in any way and on reflection see that my video was insensitive and inappropriate."
The 24-year-old, who plays Harry Thompson, joined the soap to play student Harry last year and was nominated for best newcomer at this year's National Television Awards.
The clip was posted to the actor's Instagram account in June and featured him waving a knife in front of the camera.
He took on the role of a woman warning her boyfriend about talking to other girls, saying: "I would kill you if you did... With this knife I know exactly how to.
"Done it before and I'll do it again so don't even think about it."
The video has now been deleted.
A Hollyoaks spokesperson said: "Parry Glasspool has apologised and will begin an immediate two-week suspension from Hollyoaks. He will also be donating a fee to a domestic violence charity."
