Nathan Blissett: Torquay United move 'reignites' striker's career

Torquay United forward Nathan Blissett says his move to the National League club has reinvigorated his career.

The 25-year-old, who joined from Bristol Rovers in January, has scored four goals in the last four games - form coinciding with the Gull's best run of results so far this season.
"It's reignited my passion for the game," Blissett told BBC Sport.
"I went a bit wayward and I lost my impetus and drive as I wasn't playing at Rovers."
Blissett, the nephew of former England forward Luther, joined Bristol Rovers in November 2014 and helped the Pirates return to the Football League as they beat Grimsby on penalties to win the Conference play-off final at Wembley.
But he played just three games for Rovers this season and had loan spells with Lincoln City and Tranmere Rovers before making the move to Plainmoor.
"It was a different side of me that I didn't like," said Blissett, of his time out of the first team at Rovers.
"Coming to Torquay, the gaffer has told me 'get your head down'. I just feel that I've got that steel back in myself and that any challenge that comes against me I'm going to be the better man in it."
And Blissett feels he will only get better as he plays more matches for the Gulls, who are now just three points from safety after four consecutive league wins.
"The whole season I hadn't played two games back-to-back, so coming here and having four or five games back-to-back gets that momentum going," he said.
"That momentum carries you through and you get the confidence and everything becomes a lot easier in your game.
"We've got that steel, that backbone in our team now, where if it's not going for us we can step up and match any team."
