They think 350 coins were on the Atlantic sea bed, off the coast of Florida, for the past 300 years.
The coins are thought to be from a fleet of 11 Spanish ships, that sank during a hurricane, while making the journey from Cuba to Spain.
Treasure hunting is a popular activity in the waters around Florida.
The discovery is the second major find by treasure hunters in recent months.
In June, they found about 50 coins worth roughly half a million pounds.
The 350 coins, which were brought to the surface at the end of July, turned up in just a metre of water close to the shore, buried under the sand.
Under law in the US, the government in Florida get to keep 20% of the money from the find.
The diver who discovered the coins, William Bartlett, didn't say what his reward would be.
