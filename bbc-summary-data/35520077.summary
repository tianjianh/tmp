McCullum, who will retire from all cricket after the Test series against the same opponents this month, scored 47 from 27 balls in his side's 246.
Australia regularly lost wickets and were bowled out for 191.
"I feel incredibly lucky to play for 14 years, meet some great blokes and make some great friends," said McCullum, 34.
"Not many people get that opportunity and I want to thank everyone for supporting me and supporting this team over a long period of time.
"The memories will hold for the rest of my life."
McCullum hit three sixes and six fours as he finished his ODI career with 6,083 runs, which included five centuries and a highest score of 166.
He played 228 innings in 260 ODI's, with an average of 30.41 and a strike rate of 96.37.
McCullum also led New Zealand to their first World Cup final in 2015, where the Kiwis lost to Australia.
His final match was not without its share of controversy.
Australia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh took 3-34 during New Zealand's innings and had reached 41 with the bat when he hit a delivery back to bowler Matt Henry.
The bowler's appeal for a caught and bowled was turned down but a replay was shown on the big screen, during which the crowd reacted noisily after the ball appeared to hit the batsman's boot before looping up to the bowler.
Umpires Ian Gould and Derek Walker then asked third umpire Sundaram Ravi to review the incident and Marsh was subsequently given out.
"A bit of controversy there, I don't think there was much of an appeal," said Australia skipper Steve Smith. "And they went upstairs after the replay, a bit disappointing.
"The right decision was made no doubt about that. I don't want to take anything away from the Black Caps, they deserved to win."
