[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Virgil van Dijk snatched a stoppage-time equaliser for 10-man Southampton to deny struggling Sunderland an important victory at St Mary's.

After Saints' Jose Fonte was sent off for hauling down Fabio Borini when the Italian was through on goal, Jermain Defoe put the visitors ahead.
Substitute Defoe finished after good work from Lamine Kone.
Sunderland packed their defence, but Van Dijk still found space in the area to fire in from 12 yards out.
With the bottom three all losing, a win would have taken Sam Allardyce's side three points clear of the relegation zone.
For Southampton, the two dropped home points represent a setback to their hopes of pushing for a place in the Europa League.
Despite the disappointment of conceding so late in the match, Sunderland opened a gap over the bottom three, albeit only one point.
Defeats for Newcastle United, Norwich City and Aston Villa will be some comfort for the travelling supporters, who were just seconds away from witnessing a first clean sheet in 15 Premier League games.
Three points would have been a big lift for the Black Cats, but one could still prove crucial.
Sunderland's next match - in two weeks' time - is a potentially pivotal Tyne-Wear derby against fellow strugglers Newcastle.
The game lacked quality in the final third for the most part, but the final 10 minutes were certainly action-packed.
Once referee Neil Swarbrick decided Saints skipper Fonte had fouled Borini, the 80th-minute dismissal was inevitable.
It boosted Sunderland's hopes of only a third away win of the season, and they took the lead when Defoe scored from eight yards, his 14th goal of the season.
But Southampton were not finished, and Dutch defender Van Dijk hit a sweet left-foot equaliser to snatch a point for his side.

Few people love clean sheets more than Allardyce, and he must have been relishing the prospect of a first shutout since their 2-0 home win over Stoke on 28 November.
It was a much-improved performance from Sunderland, who were beaten 8-0 here last season, with American DeAndre Yedlin playing a starring role at the back and keeper Vito Mannone pulling off some excellent saves.
Republic of Ireland veteran John O'Shea had come on to give the visitors a fifth defender, but Van Dijk still found the space to fire in the stoppage-time leveller.
That, admitted the Sunderland boss, was a "massive" and costly mistake.
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce: "The dejection amongst us all is clear. It was so important to see this game out. We know how important three points would have been.
"If we'd have got the win, we'd have had a gap for next weekend when we're not playing. We dropped a massive clanger in those last few seconds. With the amount of people we had in that box, it's baffling.
"We didn't have the composure to keep the ball, play out and see the game out properly. We paid a very heavy price."
Southampton manager Ronald Koeman: "For 85 minutes, we were not at the level I expect of Southampton. I think we lack confidence at the moment. They made it very difficult with their defensive organisation.
"We played better football with one player less on the pitch.
"The red card was a one-on-one situation. If it's a foul, then it's a red card. You have to accept that."
Southampton, with just one point from a possible nine, travel to in-form Stoke City on 12 March.
Sunderland do not play next weekend as scheduled opponents Everton are still involved in the FA Cup.
Next up for Allardyce's men is a crucial derby at fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 20 March.
