High School of Dundee pupils expelled after cannabis discovery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three pupils at the High School of Dundee have been expelled following the discovery of cannabis on school property.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A further thirteen pupils at the fee-paying school have been suspended for using E-cigarettes.
Another pupil has been suspended and given a final warning after the discovery of the class B drug.
In a letter to parents, rector Dr John Halliday said police were conducting an investigation into the incident.
Dr Halliday wrote: "Following the discovery of a small amount of cannabis on school property, three pupils in F3 have now left the school for their involvement in this incident.
"As I intimated last week, the school immediately notified the police, who are conducting their own investigation.
"We obviously cannot comment on their investigation but I can reassure you that no pupil still at school is under investigation by the police."
Dr Halliday said the 13 pupils suspended following E-cigarette use were given "clear warnings" and guidance.
He said that the school had strict anti-drugs and anti-smoking policies.
He wrote: "Breaches of the policy are treated with the utmost seriousness, with the resulting disciplinary decisions reached after full and thorough consideration of the facts and circumstances.
"I and my senior colleagues have been addressing these incidents directly and believe that we have taken appropriate action in support of the school's standpoint that such behaviour cannot be tolerated."
