Emergency services were called to Pure Wafer on Millbrook Drive, Llansamlet, at 09:00 GMT on Sunday.
A large oxygen and nitrogen store was protected and then the fire was tackled but crews are expected to be in attendance for a while.
Eighteen people were evacuated before the fire service arrived, and the cause is being investigated.
Police have advised residents in the Birchgrove and Glais to keep their windows and doors shut and roads in the immediate vicinity of the business park also remain closed.
Mid and West Fire Service incident commander Chis Margetts said there are 68 firefighters at the scene.
He added: "A very successful multiagency operation has now brought the significant fire under control and we have been working with our partners to ensure all environmental and chemical risks have been identified.
"Crews have now successfully surrounded the fire, however, we anticipate that we will have crews in attendance into this evening.
"Fire investigation officers are also in attendance and have commenced preliminary enquiries into the cause of the fire."
Chris Davies, 26, a Royal Mail worker of nearby Tregof village, said he heard an explosion at his home, half a mile from the site.
He said: "There was a large explosion and the sound of gas escaping, a hissing noise.
"They have cordoned off the road, but I could see there were four storage tanks and it looked like one of them had exploded.
"There was nothing left of it. The firemen were on a cherry picker tackling it."
