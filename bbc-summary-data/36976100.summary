[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition of photographs has gone on show to mark 50 years since the demise of "one of the most beautiful stations there has ever been".

Trains from Nottingham Victoria Station used to take passengers to destinations around England, including London, York, Bristol and Oxford.
It was demolished in 1967, a year after the final service to London left the station.
The site is now home to a shopping centre.
Following the station's closure, all rail traffic was sent to Nottingham Midland, now the city's central station.
Exhibition organiser Janine Tanner said: "It was one of the most beautiful stations there has ever been.
"People used to refer to it as a cathedral.
"I think the majority of people were horrified when it closed.
"Obviously there were people who thought it should stay but the general consensus was that it shouldn't have closed."
The station opened in 1900 and was named after Queen Victoria but its owners cited falling passenger numbers and increased car travel in the 1960s as the reason for its closure.
All that remains now as a reminder of the site's railway past is the clock tower, a tunnel entrance and a retaining wall.
Pictures highlighting its past are on show at the Nottingham Industrial Museum for the next three weekends.
The images then go on display at the Great Central Railway at Ruddington and the Victoria Shopping Centre.
