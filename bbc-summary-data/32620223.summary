Khan was freed on bail on Wednesday, hours after being convicted of culpable homicide.
A sessions court in Mumbai sentenced the actor to five years in prison for killing a homeless man.
The man was among five people who were run over in the incident.
The Asian Age welcomes the court's decision. "The justice system must consider nothing except the evidence and the severity of the crime, all of which weighed against Salman, however charitable his disposition," it says in an editorial.
The DNA newspaper has also given front-page coverage to the actor's conviction.
The New Indian Express praises the court for ensuring that the law of the land is equal for all citizens.
The Hindustan Times says the case has "proved that though the delivery of justice is slow in India, there is justice in the end".
The Tribune agrees, saying the drama has finally "hit an anti-climax".  The paper also highlights that the actor's fans are disappointed with the verdict.
The Indian Express gives the key details of the case on its front page.
