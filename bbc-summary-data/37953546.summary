[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macau's former chief prosecutor charged with nearly 2,000 crimes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former chief prosecutor in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau has been charged with nearly 2,000 crimes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ho Chio-meng is accused of setting up a criminal syndicate, abuse of power, and money laundering.
Relatives and colleagues of the prosecutor - who was once tipped to become Macau's leader - have also been charged.
Macau, a one-time Portuguese colony, is the world's largest gambling centre and has a reputation for crime.
Mr Ho, who was prosecutor general from 1999-2014, was arrested in February while trying to board a ferry to Hong Kong.
The 1,970 charges against him include accusations that he and his associates took kickbacks worth 44 million patacas (Â£4.3m; $5.5m) from construction projects.
The former official is currently in prison after Macau's top court ruled he might flee the city if granted bail. His trial is set to begin on 5 December.
