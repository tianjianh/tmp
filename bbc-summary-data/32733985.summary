The 18-year-old was attacked on Saturday while she walked along a path off Haslett Avenue East in Three Bridges, West Sussex.
Detectives are going through the CCTV to see if it shows the victim or her attacker prior to the assault.
Officers are also carrying out house-to-house inquiries in the area.
Det Insp Paddy Mayers said: "I'm grateful to those people who have contacted us but I'm sure there are many more who will have passed the victim in Haslett Avenue East or Worth Road and could have seen her.
"They may have also seen the attacker. If you were driving in the area at about 23:00 BST on Saturday and saw anything at all, please contact us.
"You might think what you can tell us is of little importance but it could prove vital to our investigation."
Sussex Police said the victim, who was wearing a white cardigan and grey tracksuit bottoms, was found "staggering" along the road by a passer-by shortly before 23:30.
She was treated by paramedics and taken to a specialist unit that supports victims of rape and sexual assault.
