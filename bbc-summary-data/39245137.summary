Marine Harvest Premiership: Kinlochshiel win again as Netwonmore drop points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kinlochshiel emerged as the only Marine Harvest Premiership team with full points from their first two games after a 4-2 defeat of Lovat at Kiltarlity.

Champions Newtonmore failed to win for only the third time since 2015 when they came from behind for a 1-1 draw away to resurgent Glenurquhart.
Oban Camanachd swept Lochaber aside 7-0 at Mossfield Park and it finished goalless between Kingussie and newly-promoted Kilmallie at The Dell, where Kilmallie's Michael Rodger was sent off.
Keith MacRae gave Shiel an early lead, which was extended by John MacRae, before Jordan Fraser made it 3-0 on the half-hour mark.
Graeme MacMillan pulled one back for Lovat after the interval, but MacRae struck again almost immediately.
A further goal from Greg Matheson was all Lovat, who remain pointless, could muster.
Daniel MacKintosh gave Glenurquhart the lead after just four minutes against the reigning champions, but Norman Campbell's second-half effort spared More a first league defeat for two seasons.
It was one-way traffic in Oban, where Andrew McCuish opened after 10 minutes before Daniel MacVicar and Aidan MacIntyre struck in the first half - and Malcolm Clark then Conor Howe netted in the second before McCuish and Howe completed doubles.
Lochaber, like Lovat, still seek their first point.
In the National Division, Fort William, like Kinlochshiel in the Premiership, are the only side on four points from two games following a hard-fought 3-2 home win over newly-promoted Strathglass.
Strath led twice and only succumbed to JD MacMaster's winner.
The attacking impotency that contributed to Skye's relegation last season re-emerged in their goalless draw with Caberfeidh at Strathpeffer, while Robbie Brindle got Beauly's winner as they came from behind to beat Inverness 2-1.
