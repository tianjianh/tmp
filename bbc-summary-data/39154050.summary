The 32-year-old Wallaby will join the Irish province once the Super Rugby season concludes.
Fardy has won 39 Australia caps and has also played 83 times for the Brumbies since his debut in 2012, scoring nine tries.
"Scott is a player of considerable talent and experience and we are looking forward to welcoming him to Leinster," said head coach Leo Cullen.
"In order to compete consistently on two fronts, in the Pro12 and the Champions Cup, we need to have competition across the team.
"While Scott has played a lot of rugby in the back row, we have signed Scott as a second row and believe he will complement the second-row options that we already have here in Leinster."
Fardy sees it as a chance to experience something different in the latter stages of his career. "I am delighted to be joining Leinster Rugby, a club with a rich heritage and a proud tradition," he says.
"I am very grateful to the Brumbies and the Australian fans for all the support over the years and I am committed to seeing out the Super Rugby season in a positive manner."
