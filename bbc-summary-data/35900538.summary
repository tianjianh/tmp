The roof and upper floor of the Tudor-era Wythenshawe Hall was badly damaged in a blaze on 15 March that was tackled by 50 firefighters.
Jeremy Taylor, 26, of Wythenshawe, has been charged with arson.
Manchester City Council has released photographs showing shattered stained glass windows and blackened beams.
The authority said "crucial archaeological work" is taking place at the timber-framed mansion, which was built in 1540.
It was home to the Tatton family for about 400 years.
