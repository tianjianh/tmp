The 31-year-old Asian man was attacked by two men as he used the cash point at the BP garage on Herringthorpe Valley Road in Rotherham, police said.
He was also punched several times in the face during the attack, which happened at 06:00 GMT on Saturday.
The victim is hospital in a stable condition.
South Yorkshire Police said the first man was white and of tall, slim build. The victim could not provide a description of the second man.
Det Insp Richard Partridge said detectives were treating the incident as a "racially aggravated" assault.
The first man is reported to have punched the victim several times in the face before the second man used what has been described as a meat cleaver to slice off the top of his left hand forefinger.
The two men then left the scene in a dark coloured vehicle.
Mr Partridge said the victim did not know his attackers and the incident appeared to be unprovoked.
"A full investigation is underway and as well as reviewing CCTV, we have a team of detectives in the area and officers are supporting the victim," he said.
