Fire in Keen's gun shop, Aberkenfig, closes Bridgend Road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road has been closed in Bridgend county after a fire broke out in a gun shop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fire crews were called to Keen's Tackle and Guns, Aberkenfig, at 19:40 GMT.
Due to the presence of shotgun cartridges and other materials, neighbouring properties were evacuated as a precaution and Bridgend Road was closed.
Crews from Bridgend, Ogmore Vale and Pencoed took about 30 minutes to extinguish the fire.
Three senior fire officers were sent to the incident and a full safety inspection has begun.
A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said the incident was "well under control and there is no danger".
The road remained closed late on Tuesday night while investigations were carried out.
