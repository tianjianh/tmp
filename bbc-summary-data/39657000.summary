Swansea City: 'We still have belief we will stay up' - Clement

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement says his side still have the belief to avoid Premier League relegation.

Clement believes Swansea, 18th in the table and two points adrift of Hull City, need 10 points from their remaining five games to survive.
The former Derby boss admits his team 'haven't responded well,' to the pressure of the last few matches.
"As soon as you lose that belief, the job is done. I don't get that sense from the players," said Clement.
The Swans will be without midfielder Jack Cork and Wayne Routledge for Saturday's "must win" home clash with Stoke City.
After initially lifting the fortunes of his team, the Swans have slid into the relegation zone after six games without a win and Clement admits their performances have been disappointing.
"They haven't responded particularly well over the last five or six games when the pressure has been there," he said.
"I continue to reinforce the point I said to them. We have to play under this pressure because, if we keep performing the way we are, the pressure will be gone (as Swansea will be relegated) and the last two or three games will be for nothing.
"The mental side is a key area at the moment. But it would be difficult to put it all on that.
"It's a slightly different situation to way this club has been over the last few years.
"In the first four years the club got off to such a good start in the first part of the season, they were never in a situation at the end of the season where so many points were required.
"Last season was slightly different, they had slightly more at the halfway point than this time and got out of it.
"This season has been the worst situation at the halfway point. It's new they are in this situation, but you have to get on with the task in hand. That's about preparing well, performing well, dealing with the pressure."
Clement said he was aware of the leadership former captain Ashley Williams used to bring before his summer move to Everton.
But the Swans' managers called on his players to show those same leadership qualities now.
"Not just one person, but as many as possible, helping each other and having that belief, still," he said.
"I know there has been some critics out recently about lack of effort, lack of passion and those kinds of things have been said.
"I don't believe the players are not trying and don't understand the situation we are in and how important this is for the club and for the fans and for the city.
"We understand all those responsibilities, but the belief is still within the players and with five games to go I still believe there is a lot of twists and turns. That's 15 points and I still believe it will go to the very end."
Meanwhile Clement has not ruled out a move for former Chelsea captain John Terry this summer - if the club stay up.
Clement coached Terry at Stamford Bridge and described him as a "fantastic leader" and a "dying breed."
Asked about possible interest, Clement said: "Why not?....I'd be more than happy to speak to him."
