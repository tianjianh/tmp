Lens, 28, joins up with manager Dick Advocaat for a fourth time after spells at AZ Alkmaar, PSV Eindhoven and Sunderland.
The Dutchman joined Sunderland from Dynamo Kiev for Â£8m just over 12 months ago, but made only 14 Premier League starts for the club.
Lens scored three league goals for the Black Cats.
He tweeted that he had "known ups and downs with Sunderland," but was "proud" to have played on Wearside.
The forward added: "Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have taken the decision to be loaned for the remainder of the current season.
