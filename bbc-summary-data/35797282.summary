In a statement issued through Police Scotland, they said: "We would like to thank everyone for their support at this unfortunate and difficult time.
"We have special thanks to all the medical staff, family, friends, neighbours and the police for their efforts, hard work and time spent helping and trying to revive our miracle babies.
"Both boys were long awaited little soldiers who were full of love, happiness, fun and cheek."
The statement added: "Individually and together they have touched the lives of everyone they met.
"We along with our family and friends are still in shock and devastated at such a tragic loss from such a 'freak' accident.
"They have been taken from us far too early and will be forever missed and loved.
"We wish to be left alone and be given the privacy needed to grieve."
It is understood that the family rented the home from a man who formerly ran a business from there, selling ornamental koi carp.
