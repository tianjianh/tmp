Man City fined £15,573 for incidents relating to Champions League tie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City have been fined £15,573 by Uefa for incidents in the home leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Monaco on 21 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Europe's governing body said the fine related to a pitch invasion, objects being thrown and a late kick-off.
City won the match 5-3 at Etihad Stadium but lost the return 3-1 and went out on the away goals rule.
Meanwhile, City have accepted a Football Association charge relating to Sunday's league game with Liverpool.
They were charged with failing to "ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion".
It followed an incident "in or around the 50th minute" of the 1-1 draw, when referee Michael Oliver gave the Reds a penalty, penalising Gael Clichy for a raised boot on Roberto Firmino.
The case will be heard by an independent regulatory commission.
James Milner scored from the spot, giving Liverpool the lead, but Sergio Aguero ensured City took a point from a thrilling draw at Etihad Stadium.
Both Clichy and David Silva were booked after Oliver pointed to the spot.
