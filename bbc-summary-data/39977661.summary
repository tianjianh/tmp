Second Oxford 'legal highs' shop owner sentenced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second director of a company that sold so-called legal highs has been given a suspended prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alastair Sanderson, 30, from Harwell, pleaded guilty to six offences of supplying dangerous products to consumers.
His company, RAD Trading Ltd, sold products with names such as King B, Cherry Bomb, Blow and Charly Sheen at the Red Eye shop in Oxford.
He was given a 12-week jail sentence, suspended for 24 months.
Sanderson was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work by Oxford magistrates and told to pay Â£20,000 costs.
He handed himself in to police after fellow director Darren Manley was given a six-month suspended sentence earlier this year.
The products were described as research chemicals and herbal incenses, but Oxfordshire County Council's trading standards team said their "foreseeable use" was as "legal highs".
Jody Kerman, Trading Standards operations manager, said the way the products were sold without health risk warnings was illegal.
The council started investigating the business in 2014 after doctors raised concerns about the products' effect on people using them as drugs.
