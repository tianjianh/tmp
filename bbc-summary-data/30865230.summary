[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review into child sexual exploitation in Telford has been opened by the local authority.

It follows a major investigation in the town that led to seven men being jailed in 2012 on various offences, including the trafficking of vulnerable girls.
Kevin Guy, chair of the Telford and Wrekin scrutiny committee, said its review had also been prompted by events in Rotherham.
He said the committee expected to publish its findings in a year's time.
Mr Guy described it as a "big piece of work on an extremely serious issue".
The review is expected to probe education, health, policing and social services in Telford.
"We need to make sure children are safe within the borough," Mr Guy said.
"It's important we're all fully aware of what bodies are responsible for what and that they're doing the job they should be.
"The key thing is, are they ensuring children are being protected from CSE [Child Sexual Exploitation]? Are the victims and families supported? And how are perpetrators being prosecuted?"
An earlier report into the various agencies' handling of child sexual exploitation in Telford was published in April 2014.
It identified a number of areas for improvement, including training, communication and work with families.
Tam Sheen, who set up the Calla support group in Telford, welcomed the latest review.
"Since then [the last report] we've had Rotherham and it doesn't hurt to understand the situation.
"The more it's in the news, the more families understand what's been going on and the more families are coming forward."
