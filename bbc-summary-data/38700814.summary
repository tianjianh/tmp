Norwich City 2-0 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City moved back to within two points of the Championship play-off zone as they claimed a second home win in successive Saturdays at Carrow Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Birmingham City striker Cameron Jerome fired Norwich ahead against his old club with a right-foot shot into the bottom right corner on 15 minutes.
That came 40 seconds after Blues' Lukas Jutkiewicz had headed against the bar.
Timm Klose then headed his first of the season from Robbie Brady's 43rd-minute cross to extend Blues' winless run.
Gianfranco Zola's men have now failed to win in nine games since he took over from Gary Rowett as manager on 14 December.
Blues had Emilio Nsue making his debut at right-back, while Kerim Frei made his first start on the wing, with fellow January signing Cheick Keita left on the bench. They dominated possession for long periods and had their chances, especially in the first half. But a fifth defeat under Zola leaves them still 12th in the table, six points behind eighth-placed Norwich,
Apart from Jutkiewicz's near miss, Norwich had another let-off midway through the opening period when Craig Gardner sent a free header over the top when perfectly placed. But the Canaries should have made it 2-0 when Steven Naismith latched on to Wes Hoolahan's cutback, only to miss from just outside the six-yard box.
And Blues keeper Tomasz  Kuszczak made a smart close-range stop to deny Jonny Howson before poor defending from an inswinging Brady free-kick allowed Klose a close-ranger free header at the near post to double the Canaries' lead.
That sealed Norwich's fifth home win in six league games, which might have been by more but for a smart save from Kuszczak to deny Jacob Murphy and an off-target header from Naismith.
Jerome also missed a good chance on the breakaway but the 30-year-old Yorkshireman's earlier effort leaves him now just two short of a century of goals in league football.
Norwich City manager Alex Neil:
"For some time now I have had the feeling that we are now moving forward again after a difficult spell.
"The players are performing better, I have been happier with what I have been seeing and this was a continuation of that.
"It was a good steady performance from the lads. We did the ugly side of the game well and when we do that we have the quality to cause problems at the other end.
"We knew the way Birmingham would play and we made the decision to get in their faces and try and get the ball back off them, not just sit back and let them have possession, which I don't like to see when we are at home."
Birmingham City boss Gianfranco Zola told BBC WM:
"The players are doing everything I have asked but, unfortunately, the results are not coming. I am disappointed by this but I am determined we will come back stronger.
"I am not happy about the situation. Not happy at all, but I am determined to make this club successful. I fully trust the players that they will step their game up.
"We created a lot, maybe more than in other games but we made mistakes and paid for it. There is a lot for me to think about over the next couple of days."
