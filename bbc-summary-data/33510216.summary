[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cancer surgeon investigated over the deaths of a number of his patients has been sacked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sudip Sarker worked as a consultant colorectal surgeon at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.
A police inquiry into Mr Sarker's actions began in 2013 after concerns were raised about the number of patients who died while under his care.
He was excluded from working at Worcestershire Royal Hospital and Redditch's Alexandra Hospital in 2012.
At the same hearing, conditions were placed on his registration by the General Medical Council.
Worcestershire Acute Hospital NHS Trust's acting chief executive Chris Tidman said: "I do hope that the dismissal provides assurance that the trust will take whatever action is necessary so as to protect patient safety.
"In the meantime, Mr Sarker continues to be investigated by both the police and the General Medical Council."
A telephone helpline and dedicated email address were established in 2013 for people to discuss any concerns.
