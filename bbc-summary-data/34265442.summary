[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester United 3-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anthony Martial's rich goalscoring form continued as Manchester United eased into the League Cup fourth round with victory at home to Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wayne Rooney got his first domestic goal of the season to put United ahead against their Championship opponents, who made 11 changes for the game.
Midfielder Andreas Pereira, 19, scored a spectacular free-kick to double the lead on his first start.
And substitute Martial, also 19, coolly slotted home a third in injury time.
How United's League Cup win unfolded
It was the striker's fourth goal in as many matches since his £36m move from Monaco.
Fellow substitute Memphis Depay controlled the ball into his path before the Frenchman stroked beyond Bartosz Bialkowski in the Ipswich goal.
But the goal of the night belonged to Pereira, whose dipping free-kick bent over the Ipswich wall and into the corner.
United face Middlesbrough, who beat fellow Championship side Wolves 3-0 on Tuesday, at home in the next round.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal:
"It is not so difficult for Martial to stay grounded because he is a player who is very modest and he knows he can score because of his fellow players.
"Twice we made it very easy for him because the gaps were existing and then with his speed and his composure he can score.
"He did it also against Liverpool and now again. We are happy but still we have to keep our feet on the ground."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"Manchester United deserved to win. But I am delighted with my players.
"I could have put any team out against that team and probably still would have been beaten."
