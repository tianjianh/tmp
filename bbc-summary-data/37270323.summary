Portmeirion festival-goers claim they have been waiting for up to four hours as tractors tow cars out of the water-logged field.
One visitor, Catriona Mcgee, said there was "no organisation and no priority" over drivers trying to leave.
A statement on the festival's website said: "We are doing everything in our power to minimise impact."
Ms Mcgee said: "There's nobody here from the festival organising it, there's no system whatsoever.
"It's a case of whoever flags the tractor down first gets to leave. It's terrible."
The festival's online statement said: "Due to the adverse weather conditions over the weekend we are expecting some delays at the park and ride site.
"We are doing everything in our power to minimise impact and would like to thank everyone for their patience, cooperation and for being part of yet another incredible Festival No.6."
