No phone signal on 750 miles of roads, RAC Foundation says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 750 miles of road in parts of north and mid Wales have no mobile phone signal, meaning drivers cannot call for help if they break down or have an accident.

An RAC Foundation report said Powys, Gwynedd and Ceredigion were in the top 10 areas in the UK with the worst coverage.
It highlighted the A494, which runs from Gwynedd into England.
Powys is the worst affected county, with 437 miles (703km) without signal.
Gwynedd has 172 miles (277km) of road without signal and Ceredigion has 156 miles (251km).
Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: "Most of us like to think we are always just a mobile phone call away from help but even in a crowded, high-tech country like Britain the reality is somewhat different."
