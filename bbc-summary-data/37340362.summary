The jobs will be filled over the next three years and bring BDO's employment levels in Northern Ireland to more than 200 people by 2018.
The project will be supported with a grant of £217,000 from Invest NI.
Peter Burnside, managing partner of BDO Northern Ireland, said the new positions will contribute more than £1m a year to the local economy.
"As an established local firm we are committed to investing in and developing the local marketplace, creating as many employment opportunities as we can," he said.
"At BDO Northern Ireland, we provide careers, not just jobs, and this contract enables us to create up to 43 new positions that will contribute over £1m per annum to the local economy.
"With 12 of the roles already filled, we are continuing to recruit and greatly appreciate all the support provided by Invest NI."
