[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kinlochshiel went second in the table courtesy of a 1-0 victory away to Glasgow Mid Argyll, while Glenurquhart's 2-1 home win over Lovat sent them third.
Shiel and Glenurquhart both leapfrogged Oban Camanachd, whose game at Kilmallie was postponed following the death of Oban's 1996 Camanachd Cup winning captain Neil "Nonny" MacInnes, who was 46 years old.
In the MacTavish Cup, second tier side Fort William lost 2-0 to holders Newtonmore. Artemis MacAulay Cup holders Kyles also progressed after a 7-1 win over Bute in Rothesay.
Kingussie scored their two goals in the first half, both coming from Martin Dallas. At Yoker, Oliver MacRae got the only goal of the game for Kinlochshiel after 42 minutes and Mid Argyll were unable to respond.
Greg Matheson put Lovat ahead after 43 minutes, but James MacPherson's goal and a late Fraser Heath winner swung the game Glenurquhart's way. At An Aird, Newtonmore had been expected to overwhelm Fort William but after Iain Robinson's opener a quarter of an hour in, Glen Mackintosh's clincher did not come until midway through the second half.
Newtonmore now progress to a home quarter final against another second tier side Caberfeidh.
Grant Irvine and Roddy MacDonald both got hat tricks for Kyles against Bute.
Sandy MacKenzie was Kyles' other scorer and Duncan Davidson got Bute's consolation early in the second half. Kyles will now welcome Aberdour or Glasgow Mid Argyll in the last eight.
Leading Scotland scorer Kevin Bartlett, who has just returned to Caberfeidh from Lovat, grabbed two including a penalty as Cabers beat Oban Celtic 4-2 in Strathpeffer in the National Division. In the same league, Strathlass and Inverness drew 1-1 in Cannich.
