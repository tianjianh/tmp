His private jet touched down at Prestwick Airport on Tuesday evening and he arrived at the hotel and golf course in Ayrshire a short time later.
He confirmed last month he had purchased the complex from Dubai-based Leisurecorp for an undisclosed sum.
Mr Trump said: "I think it is really beautiful and we are going to make it the finest in the world."
The course will continue to be managed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
Turnberry is the only course in the Open circuit to be owned privately. Mr Trump has ambitions to host the Open at his other course in Aberdeenshire.
In a statement in April, Mr Trump said: "I intend to invest many millions of dollars (pounds) in order to bring the hotel to the highest levels of luxury.
"When completed, I believe that the Turnberry Hotel will be the finest and most luxurious hotel in all of Europe."
