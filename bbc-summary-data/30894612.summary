The Channel Island, which sends players to the Commonwealth Games, will have a representative side at April's European Team Championships in Slovenia.
The island team will play in the third division of the tournament.
"This is pretty impressive that we've managed to get a team in there and become a member of European and World Squash," the island's director of squash, Nick Taylor, told BBC Sport.
Jersey decided to apply for international status after squash was not included as one of the sports for this summer's Island Games.
Jersey is the  having won 10 gold, six silver and three bronze medals in the three Island Games that have included squash.
"The Island Games is amazing and if we did have the opportunity to compete at the Island Games we would certainly snatch their hands off because it is a fantastic event," said Taylor, who is a former British Open winner, European champion and world number 14.
"It could be up to 10 years before we're competing at an Island Games again, so they need competition.
"We've got hundreds of kids playing the sport in Jersey so we need something to inspire those youngsters as well."
Taylor, along with his wife Sarah and Scott Gautier,  in Glasgow.
He is hopefully Jersey can replicate the success of their Channel Island neighbours Guernsey, who have produced world number ones such as Martine le Moignan and Lisa Opie, as well as current world number 23 Chris Simpson.
"Being a small island it's very difficult to go to a Commonwealth Games and compete for medals," added Taylor.
"It's so important that we are competing at those levels to inspire our younger players.
"Guernsey have produced lots of high-quality squash players in the past, and we've got a world-class facility over here, but we need the events to inspire our young players.
"I think we're doing that with our PSA event, now becoming part of the European and World Squash family, and hopefully Commonwealth Games going forward as well."
Jersey squad for the European Team Championships: Nick Taylor, Scott Gautier, Ian Furness, Mark Le Roux, Sarah Taylor, Kate Cadigan, Beth Garton.
