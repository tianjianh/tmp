Joss Labadie went close for the Daggers early on, while home goalkeeper Mark Cousins denied Shaun Batt.
Luke Gambin weaved his way into the box to put Barnet ahead from close range.
Michael Nelson then met a Chris Hackett cross to steer the ball home from two yards out, leaving Dagenham winless at home in League Two this season.

"Since I've been back here, I think that's the worst performance that we've put in.
"I thought that we had no tempo about our game today. I thought the first goal that we gave away was really, really poor defending.
"Sometimes you can be behind but you can actually be the dominant team. We were behind and we never really showed any dominance; I thought our attacking play was patchy."
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London:

"Some of those players haven't played in a while so it was good to get them back out there."
"All credit to the staff as well for keeping the players fit in this little period and keeping the sharpness."
"We didn't have that many chances today, I don't think it was fantastic probably for our supporters to watch, but it's better to have two players up front for a change which was good for us, and again good to get another one of our youth players from last season on the pitch towards the end."
