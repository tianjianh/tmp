Migrant crisis: Hungarian army stages border protection exercise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hungary's army has begun exercises to prepare for a possible future role in guarding the southern border to try to stem the influx of migrants.

Budapest plans to send soldiers to help police at the border where thousands of migrants arrive from Serbia every day.
A new razor-wire barrier is already being built along the frontier. MPs are expected to vote on stricter border controls later this month.
Authorities have been told to expect 40,000 more migrants by next week.
Many of them are fleeing conflicts in countries like Syria and Libya and are trying to travel through Hungary to Germany, Austria and Sweden - wealthier EU nations with more liberal asylum laws.
In other developments:
The Hungarian army launched the Decisive Action exercises on Wednesday to prepare for its possible new role, pending a vote in parliament.
"It is our job to make sure Hungary is defended," Gen Tibor Benko said.
Hungary has recently completed a 175-km (110 mile) razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia, and is building an additional barrier.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban this week pledged to speed up the construction of the new barrier.
"Everyone has to get ready to do intensive work in the coming weeks," he was quoted as saying.
However, the measures have so far failed to stop thousands of people getting into the country from Serbia.
Hungary has become a key point on the journey north for the migrants, with more than 150,000 people arriving this year.
A surge of migrants fleeing conflict and hardship in Africa and the Middle East has pushed north through Europe over the past few weeks.
On Wednesday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced plans for a "swift, determined and comprehensive" response through a quota system.
In a "state of the union" annual address, he said tackling the crisis was "a matter of humanity and human dignity".
Among Mr Juncker's proposals:
14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda
15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda. European Parliament then to decide on any new asylum measures with EU governments
Early 2016: EU proposals for better management of legal migration to EU due

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
