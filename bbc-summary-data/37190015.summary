Crew Manager Paul Wilkens, a 47-year-old father of four, had worked for Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service for 14 years.
He was found dead on Tuesday morning while on duty at Castle Donington Fire Station.
The fire service has not yet given any details of how he died.
Chief Fire and Rescue Officer Steve Lunn said: "The whole service is devastated and shocked at the sudden and tragic loss of our friend and colleague.
"At this hugely sad time our primary concerns are very much focused on Paul's partner, his children and his immediate and close family. As a service, we are doing everything we possibly can to support them."
Mr Wilkens had previously served in the armed forces, in the Corps of Royal Engineers.
A JustGiving page to support his partner, daughter, son and two stepchildren has already raised thousands of pounds.
A tribute on the page said he was affectionately known as TL - due to his "too loud" presence.
"TL was certainly larger than life itself; you certainly knew when TL entered a room, a party and even an incident," the tribute said.
"He was incredibly positive and tremendously kind."
