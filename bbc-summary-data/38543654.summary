Officers were called to an address in Bryn Heulog, Old Colwyn, Conwy county, at 20:30 GMT on Thursday and David Kingsbury, 35, was found dead nearby.
In a tribute, his family said they will miss his "easy going nature".
On Saturday, North Wales Police were granted a further 36 hours to question a 38-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of murder.
A post mortem examination revealed Mr Kingsbury died from a single stab wound.
In the tribute, his family said: "David was a very loving, affectionate son, brother and uncle with a good heart.
"We all loved him to bits and will miss his happy, easy going nature, his infectious smile and sense of humour."
Det Insp Arwyn Jones said officers want to speak to people who were in Aldi or the Co-op store on Abergele Road, Old Colwyn, between 20:30 and 21:00 on Thursday.
