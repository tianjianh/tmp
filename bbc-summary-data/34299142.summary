[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Morrison's header secured a win for Cardiff, who came from a goal behind to beat Charlton and move into the play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Karlan Ahearne-Grant put the visitors in front soon after the break.
But City were level just four minutes later when Joe Mason found the net with a close-range finish.
After both sides had further chances to score, Morrison rose to head home Peter Whittingham's cross and leave Cardiff fifth and the Addicks down in 17th.
The hosts, who were looking to end a two-game losing run, started brightly with Anthony Pilkington seeing a curling effort palmed away by Nick Pope.
Morrison then went close when his free header from a Whittingham corner was cleared off the line by Jordan Cousins.
But after Morrison was wasteful with another header and Joe Ralls miskicked when clear on goal, Cardiff let the Addicks back into the game.
Tony Watt went close with a header before half-time and Ahearne-Grant opened the scoring after the break when he rolled the ball past Simon Moore.
The goal provoked a reaction from the hosts as Mason finished from close range - the strike allowed to stand, despite appeals for handball.
Mason went close again and Moore denied Watt and Cousins at the other end before, having seen another header go over, Morrison finally hit the target to secure Cardiff the only home win of the day in the Championship.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade: "It was important we bounced back and got a reaction from the disappointment of the last two games where we felt we were unfortunate.
"Despite our domination in the first half we were unable to convert our chances which was frustrating.
"But the good thing is after going a goal down we showed a lot more intensity and deserved the equaliser and the goal that brought us the three points."

Charlton manager Guy Luzon: "When you lead 1-0 away from home you make sure you show the character and organisation to keep the result.
"If you do that you will have space to counter-attack as the game goes on. But we couldn't, though our problem started in the first half as from every set-piece Cardiff won the ball and they had quite a lot of chances to score.
"That continued in the second half and we were eventually punished for that."
Match ends, Cardiff City 2, Charlton Athletic 1.
