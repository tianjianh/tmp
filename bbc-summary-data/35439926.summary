Eli Walker finished a slick Ospreys move for the opening try, before Rory Hughes' score put Glasgow 13-10 up at half-time.
Sam Davies' boot kept Ospreys in touch but Ryan Grant's controversial try restored the visitors' lead.
Ospreys levelled again with Dan Evans' incisive score and Davies missed a late chance to win the game as his drop-goal attempt sailed wide.
The hosts stay seventh in the Pro12 table, while Glasgow reclaim eighth spot from Cardiff Blues.
Buoyed by a European Champions Cup win against Racing 92 in their last outing, Glasgow made a strong start and led 6-0 thanks to two Duncan Weir penalties.
Ospreys responded first with a Davies penalty and then a smartly worked try from a line-out move, which culminated in a pop pass from centre Josh Matavesi to wing Walker, who sped over unopposed.
There was also deft handling in Glasgow's opening score, with lock Leone Nakarawa offloading brilliantly for wing Hughes to touch down in the corner.
A second Davies penalty brought Ospreys level at 13-13 early in the second half, but Glasgow soon restored their lead with a contentious try.
Referee Peter Fitzgibbon consulted television match official Jon Mason and, although there appeared to be a double movement from back row Ryan Wilson, the score was awarded as prop Grant plunged over from close range.
Ospreys equalised for the second time with 10 minutes left to set up a tense finale, with Davies' break and offload setting up full-back Evans to cross for their second try.
Davies had an opportunity to put the hosts in front three minutes later but pulled his drop-goal wide.
