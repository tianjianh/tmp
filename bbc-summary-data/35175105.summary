[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fire crews were called to the farm, in the village of Quothquan, near Thankerton, at 22:45 on Wednesday.
They used four hose jets to contain the fire to one section of the building.
The farmer removed livestock and about 150 bales of hay to allow firefighters better access. An investigation into the cause of the blaze is under way.
Crews worked through the night to extinguish the blaze and a single crew remained at the scene on Thursday morning to continue dampening down operations.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was "liaising with police to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident".
