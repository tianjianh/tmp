Cardiff City 2-1 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City marked Russell Slade's first match in charge with a win which ended Nottingham Forest's unbeaten start to the season.

Goals from Federico Macheda and Peter Whittingham gave the Bluebirds a commanding 2-0 half-time lead.
Forest improved in the second half and halved the deficit with Britt Assombalonga's goal a minute from time.
But Cardiff stood firm to claim only their second victory in nine Championship matches.
After a protracted appointment following his departure from Leyton Orient, Slade had spoken about his intent to make Cardiff a fitter and harder-working unit.
The energetic nature of the hosts' performance will have pleased Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's successor, though Forest's lacklustre display will have been equally worrying for their manager Stuart Pearce.
Forest were unbeaten in their previous 11 Championship games, albeit with draws in their last four league outings.
Slade made four changes to the Cardiff team which lost 1-0 to Blackpool, with top-scorer Kenwyne Jones the most notable player dropping to the bench.
The new manager's decision was vindicated in style, however, when Jones' replacement Macheda gave Cardiff the lead after 22 minutes.
Aron Gunnarsson led a Cardiff counter-attack and passed to Macheda, who cut inside from the right wing and deftly evaded a challenge before stroking the ball beyond Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow with a low finish.

Forest were still reeling from the opening goal when Cardiff doubled their advantage.
The visitors failed to clear a Cardiff throw-in and the ball rolled to the edge of the area, where Whittingham was on hand to strike crisply into the bottom corner.
Eager to preserve their unbeaten record, Forest began the second half with much more intent than they had mustered in the first.
Assombalonga thought he had halved Forest's deficit, but the top scorer's effort on the rebound was ruled out for offside.
Cardiff were forced into a flurry of substitutions and positional switches when Tom Adeyemi had to go off just two minutes after replacing Gunnarsson.
With winger Craig Noone filling in at left-back and forward Adam Le Fondre switched to the left flank, Slade's makeshift side had to withstand heavy Forest pressure late on.
Assombalonga did eventually get his name on the scoresheet when he converted a cross from Michail Antonio with a minute left.
But much to Slade's visible relief, Cardiff held on to give the former Leyton Orient and Yeovil Town boss a winning start to his reign in South Wales.
New Cardiff boss Russell Slade: "The players worked exceptionally hard. I hope people saw a bit of a difference today and a bit of a structure and a game plan which we can develop going forward.
"We hung on in there well during the last few minutes, which were a bit scary, and it is a great result for the football club."
Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce: "I am disappointed with the manner of the defeat. We were not at the races today, man for man, and collectively we were outfought and gave away a couple of very poor goals.
"There were some half-hearted challenges to stop players and that has not been us this year, and that is probably the thing that disappoints me the most."
