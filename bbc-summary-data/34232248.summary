Police believe Sean Banks may have been involved in a fight with a group of youths near a tunnel that passes beneath the M74.
The teenager's body was found in North British Road just after midnight.
His family said they had suffered a "tragic loss". A post-mortem examination will be carried out and CCTV images are being reviewed.
Det Ch Insp Gary Boyd, from Police Scotland, appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.
He said: "Around 22:40 hours last night there were a number of youths who were near the entrance to St John the Baptist Primary School in North British Road and we believe that Sean may have been involved in an altercation with someone from this group.
"We are studying CCTV from the surrounding area and would appeal to anyone near the school or in North British Road at this time to contact us.
"A local man has been murdered and I'm sure that local residents will be shocked by that news.
"However, I am sure they hold the key and I am appealing to them to contact us with any information, no matter how trivial it may seem, please pass it on to police."
Sean's family said in a statement: "We have suffered a tragic loss. Sean will be sadly missed and we would ask that everyone respects our privacy at this time."
