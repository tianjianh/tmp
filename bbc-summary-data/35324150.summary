The Met Office has issued yellow "be aware" warnings for snow for southern, north east and northern Scotland on Saturday and Sunday.
BBC weather presenter Stav Danaos said -10 was seen in parts of the country with lying snow - with further snow falling on Saturday.
Snow and ice have also been affecting travel in many parts.
Scotland has seen freezing temperatures for several days.
While it has meant challenging travel conditions for some, the weather has also allowed all five of Scotland's snowsports centres to open their slopes for skiing and snowboarding.
Glenshee, Lecht, Glencoe Mountain, CairnGorm Mountain and Nevis Range are preparing to mark World Snow Day on Sunday.
Climbers and hillwalkers, however, have been warned that the risk of avalanches in Scotland's highest hills and mountains has been rated as "considerable".
The Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service has given the rating to the six areas it covers - Northern Cairngorms, Southern Cairngorms, Glen Coe, Torridon, Creag Meagaidh and Lochaber.
