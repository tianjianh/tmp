It's all down to the need to get lots of food - and fast.
Both animals use their tongues, or their trunk, to grab food in the wild - like humans would use their hands.
But they also need to eat fast to avoid dangerous predators, so it's thought their 'grabbers' have evolved over 1000 of years to become long and strong.
