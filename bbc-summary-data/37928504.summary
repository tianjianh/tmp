[SN]TITLE[SN]
What do you want to know about welfare changes in Scotland?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Do you want to know more about the way benefits in Scotland will be changing? We want your questions to put to the minister in charge, Angela Constance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She will be in the hot seat next week for a BBC online webchat.
So, if you have a question on a welfare-related topic such as Universal Credit, Tax Credits or Child Benefit send it to newsonlinescotland@bbc.co.uk.
And please put "webchat question" in the message field.
In the very near future, the Scottish government will be able to create new benefits in devolved areas, such as health and education.
They will also be able to top-up existing payments including for Universal Credit, Tax Credits and Child Benefit.
While the majority of welfare payments will remain with Westminster, Holyrood will have control over more than 15% (Â£2.7bn) of social security spending.
Ms Constance, who is Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, has wide-ranging responsibilities including social security measures against poverty, disabilities, older people, tackling inequalities and social justice.
