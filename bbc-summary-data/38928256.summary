Economy Secretary Ken Skates said innovation and entrepreneurship were "vital drivers for the economy".
"The importance of providing space, community and support for aspiring entrepreneurs is key to success," he said.
The two-year scheme aims to secure a similar amount of private investment.
Run by the Welsh Government's Business Wales, the minister said the hub would provide a community for entrepreneurs with support from groups including Glyndwr University and Coleg Cambria.
In addition, 90 jobs are to be created by a new financial services business, Chetwood Financial Ltd, which is being established with £750,000 from the Welsh Government.
