The 22-year-old sunk a 60ft-putt for an eagle on the 18th, as he became the youngest ever winner of the tournament at Torrey Pines in San Diego.
The world number 137 also had an eagle on the 13th to card a seven-under-par 65 and finish on 13 under, with American Charles Howell and Chinese Taipei's Pan Cheng-tsung on 10 under.
England's Justin Rose finished fourth.
The Olympic champion had led at the halfway stage of the tournament and carded a two-under 70 to finish on nine under and tie with Americans Keegan Bradley and Pat Perez.
Rahm turned professional just seven months ago and the victory guarantees him entry to this year's biggest tournaments. He moved to the United States in 2012 and learned English by listening to rap music.
He said: "It does a lot for me. I get to the play the Players Championship, I am likely going to the Fed Ex Cup, I am going to the majors, it is amazing.
"I really don't know how it is going to work, I will have to look at my schedule."
Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson said: "I think Rahm's more than just a good young player.
"I think he's one of the top players in the world. I think there's an intangible that some guys have where they want to have the pressure, they want to be in that tough position, they want to have everything fall on their shoulders. And he has that."
England's Paul Casey finished in 28th place on five under, while overnight leaders Brandt Snedeker and Patrick Rodgers tied for third on eight under.
