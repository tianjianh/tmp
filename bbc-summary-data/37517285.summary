WW2 bomb blown up after evacuation in Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A World War Two bomb found on the seabed off Hampshire has been blown up in a controlled explosion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 500kg (1,100lb) device was found in Portsmouth Harbour by a barge carrying out dredging works on Thursday.
The Gunwharf Quays retail complex had to be evacuated while the German bomb was safely dealt with.
The Royal Navy towed it into open waters about 1.5 miles (2.4km) east of the Isle of Wight, where it was blown up on Friday morning.
Dredging works are being carried out in the harbour ahead of the arrival of the Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth next spring.
