Sales of Irn Bru in the UK Parliament have increased 60% in the last year, according to new figures.

The spike comes after the SNP upped its number of seats from six to 56 in the 2015 general election.
Numbers obtained by the Press Association show 8,708 cans or bottles of the fizzy drink were sold in the financial year 2015-2016.
It marks an increase from the 5,452 units sold in Westminster bars, cafes and vending machines the previous year.
MPs and other parliamentary staff are expected to drink another 8,493 cans or bottles by the end of the financial year in April 2017.
The SNP's gains in the 2015 general election saw them become the third biggest party in Westminster.
Patrick Grady, SNP MP for Glasgow North, said the fizzy drink gave politicians "sustenance" through the long days in the Commons, which often sits into the evening.
He said: "Barrs, which produces Irn-Bru, is an independently owned company which plays an important role in the economy of central Scotland and the country as a whole.
"Famously Scotland is the only country where Coca-Cola is not the biggest selling soft drink.
"But it looks like we're making progress in the House of Commons and perhaps the taste will catch on among MPs and staff from south of the border."
