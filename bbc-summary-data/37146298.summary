Cardiff manager Paul Trollope says he is still hunting for new players ahead of the close of the transfer window.

Joe Ralls and Anthony Pilkington struck for Cardiff in their 2-2 draw at Fulham, the first goals scored by Cardiff players this season.
"We are still looking to do some business," Trollope told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"We are still on the look out and we are still trying to make things happen before the window shuts."
The addition of a striker is understood to be a priority for Cardiff, who won 2-1 in midweek against Blackburn but incredibly had to rely on two own goals.
The Bluebirds have added forwards Frederic Gounongbe, Kenneth Zohore and Lex Immers and Wales duo Emyr Huws and Jazz Richards to their squad since Trollope's appointment.
Former Wales coach Trollope believes the transfer market will be busy in the remaining days, especially with no emergency loan window in place this season.
"It will be a busy few weeks for most teams I would imagine, especially with the emergency loan window being out," he said.
"You hope to do it [sign players] and get it sorted next week, it would lead to an easier life, but the movement of other clubs can dictate who is coming in and out.
"So I would imagine there will be some late action."
Trollope would not elaborate on whether he has money to spend, but did admit players could still depart the Cardiff City Stadium, following the sale of defender Fabio Da Silva.
"If you are talking finances you need to talk to the chief executive or to the chairman, but from my point of view we are looking to add," he said.
"There are a few players we are still open to offers for and if the right offers come in that suit all parties then we will look at them on their merits and see if that happens."
