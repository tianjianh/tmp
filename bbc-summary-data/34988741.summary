Prince Harry has spoken of his frustration at the slaughter of elephants and rhinos, as images of his volunteer work in Africa were released.

The photos show Harry helping with the fight against poaching during his three months in Africa over the summer.
Their publication coincides with his visit to South Africa Wildlife College near Kruger National Park on the fifth day of his royal tour.
He said the slaughter of the animals was a "pointless waste of beauty".
During his summer visit, Harry worked with rangers - who respond to poaching attacks on elephants and rhinos - as well as veterinarians.
One of the pictures, all of which were taken on a smartphone, shows him with a sedated rhino that was about to be de-horned in order to protect it.
The prince was also photographed assisting in the facial reconstruction of a rhino that had been attacked for its horn and left for dead.
Another shows the prince in South Africa's Kruger National Park lying on the stomach of a sedated elephant, which was about to be freed.
In written commentary accompanying the elephant photograph, Harry said: "I know how lucky I am to have these experiences, but hearing stories from people on the ground about how bad the situation really is upset and frustrated me.
"How can it be that 30,000 elephants were slaughtered last year alone?"
