The 32-year-old played the last four County Championship matches for the county in 2015 as they avoided relegation from Division One.
McLaren, who has played two Tests for his country, will be available for the entire season across all three formats.
"I look forward to returning in April and helping the county challenge across the board for silverware," he said.
McLaren, who previously played three seasons for Kent as a Kolpak signing from 2007, has also played 54 one-day internationals and 12 T20 matches for South Africa.
He has also played T20 cricket for Middlesex and for Mumbai Indians in the IPL.
"It's nice to have him back as he had a tremendous impact on the team when he came in at the end of last season," Hampshire director of cricket Giles While told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's great to have him available for the whole season as it fits perfectly for us and I know he's also looking forward to coming back."
