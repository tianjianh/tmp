Scottish public relations and digital media firm The Big Partnership has expanded its operations again by opening an office in Dundee.

The move comes two months after the company launched a base in Manchester.
The Big Partnership already has a number of clients in Dundee and the surrounding area.
They include Dundee Rep Theatre and two technology spin-outs from the University of St Andrew's - SA Instrumentation and Photosynergy Ltd.
The company aims to win Â£150,000 of new business in its first year in the city.
The Dundee office is its fifth in Scotland and seventh in the UK.
Big director Zoe Ogilvie said: "We have strong ties to Dundee, with a history of working with clients in the city, as well as in Fife and Perthshire.
"Opening permanent premises here widens our offering to a city which has huge potential.
"Dundee is in the middle of a Â£1bn regeneration, which is expected to create more than 7,000 jobs, see the opening of an international centre of design and herald a major redevelopment of its train station.
"With further plans to open more hotels, bars and restaurants, it's the perfect time to be launching a base here."
