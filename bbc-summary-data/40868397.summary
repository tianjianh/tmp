Rachel Webb is among 100 relatives of knife crime victims backing a campaign to have a Knife Angel sculpture on the square's Fourth Plinth.
The Mayor of London's office said the Shropshire-made statue would not feature there and works had been selected up to 2022.
Mrs Webb, from Derbyshire, said she was "shaken" by the decision.

The 26ft (8m) sculpture made from 100,000 confiscated blades was intended as a tribute to knife crime victims and a campaign was started to install it in the central London square.
However, a City Hall spokesperson said the Fourth Plinth was "the site of a rolling programme of contemporary art" and works had been chosen "by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group on behalf of the Mayor of London".
The sculpture is currently at the British Ironwork Centre in Oswestry, Shropshire.
Clive Knowles, the centre's chairman who is behind the campaign, said the petition had been signed more than 35,000 times.
Mrs Webb, of Belper, whose son, Tom, 22, was killed over a comment about a woman being "fit", has said the statue could inspire young people to "de-tool".
She said: "This is an epidemic and we need help and support from the mayor.
"This amazing sculpture has been declined because it doesn't fit some criteria. It's bizarre."
City Hall said the only way for a piece of art to be displayed was through being selected by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group on behalf of the mayor.
It added the mayor recently launched his knife crime strategy, which "included an additional Â£625,000 for knife and gang crime projects".
