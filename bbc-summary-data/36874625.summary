Police said the 34-year-old had been dropped off by taxi in the Milton area when he became involved in an argument.
The man was then attacked and badly injured after making off into Ashgill Road at about 00:25 on Saturday.
He was taken by ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where his condition was "critical but stable." The stabbing is being treated as attempted murder.
The attackers are described as white, all aged in their 20s.
Det Sgt John Dowds, of Police Scotland, said: "The injured man had just been dropped off by a taxi in Balmore Road near to Ashgill Street where it is believed he became involved in an argument with some people in the area.
"However, he made off into Ashgill Road where he was attacked by four men.
"He was very seriously injured with what was originally thought to be life-threatening injuries, however, thankfully now he seems to be in a critical but stable condition."
Police are urging anyone with information about the attack to come forward.
