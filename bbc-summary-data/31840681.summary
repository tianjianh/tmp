The body of the man was discovered in a caravan near the Nottinghamshire/Lincolnshire border on 13 March 2014, but detectives are still no closer to knowing who he is.
Post-mortem examinations showed the man, believed to be in his 50s, could have been dead for up to six months.
Det Insp Andy Wilson said the man may not be from the area.
The body was found by a member of the public in the static caravan on derelict land off Gringley Road, Beckingham, near Gainsborough.
Detectives said they did not suspect any foul play as there were no obvious signs of injury.
Det Insp Wilson, from Nottinghamshire Police, said they believed the man may have taken shelter in the caravan and died there.
"He may not be from the area," said Det Insp Wilson.
"He may have travelled from eastern Europe to work but somewhere there is a mother missing a son, a wife missing a husband or a child missing a father.
"We are desperate to get him back to his family and believe the public hold the key."
