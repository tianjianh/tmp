The 26-year-old Swede joins the League One club on a two-year deal, with the option of a one-year extension.
Former Malmo and Hacken player Pekalski is Oxford United's fourth overseas signing since manager Pep Clotet was appointed in July.
"I'm happy to be here and it's been a pretty natural decision to make the move," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
"After 11 years of playing in Sweden, I was looking for something that would be a challenge and a bit of an adventure.
"I've worked with Pep before (at Malmo), he's a brilliant coach and I've heard a lot about Oxford's ambition, which I think is really interesting."
Pekalski has made 15 appearances for Halmstads in the Swedish top division this season after joining the club in March.
