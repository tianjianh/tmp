A hacking suspect facing extradition to the US said he "would want to work" with its intelligence agencies to highlight system "vulnerabilities".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lauri Love, 31, who has Asperger's syndrome, is appealing against an extradition order signed last year by the home secretary.
Mr Love, from Stradishall, Suffolk, faces trial accused of hacking into the FBI, the US central bank and Nasa.
An appeal against his extradition is expected to be heard at the High Court.
Speaking to BBC Inside Out, Mr Love said: "It is very hard for me to imagine not being able to access information using computers - that's the way I have interfaced with the world since I was able to.
"It would be like losing my sight if I was locked away from technology and only able to use a telephone to call my family once a week.
"If there are no other options and it is a choice between being subject to the US justice system and being turned into an example or deterrent or choosing to end my own life as an alternative then I do reserve the right to do so."
Mr Love said the Pentagon currently offered "bounties" to approved US citizens to find vulnerabilities.
He said if the US authorities were interested in "actionable intelligence on vulnerabilities" then "I would want to work with them".
"I am not accused to any sort of criminal gain or of attempting to make money or cause damage, I am accused of using the internet in only 'non-naughty ways'," he said.
