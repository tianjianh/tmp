Channel 4 have confirmed Andrew, Carolyne, Louis and Alex, from Brighton, will no longer appear on the show.
The family have been on the programme since it began in March 2013.
"Mr Michael has confirmed his proposed candidacy as a UKIP MP," Channel 4 told Newsbeat.
"Sadly any Gogglebox cast member who becomes a candidate for a political party will have to step down from their involvement in Gogglebox.
"It's with great regret that the Michaels are no longer in the show.
"They have been excellent contributors to Gogglebox, and we are very grateful for all they have given to the show."
Speaking to Newsbeat, Alex Michael said: "We sat down as a family and we discussed it at length, either we stay on Gogglebox and my Dad doesn't accept his position or he accepts the position and we can no longer be on the show."
Alex said she is gutted to be leaving the show and would have liked to have stayed on until the end of this series.
She said she fully supports her dad: "It was a hobby for him to begin with and it turns out that he was good at what he was doing and people really liked him.
"I'm proud of my dad to have got to where he is and we will be fully supporting him in his political endeavours from now on".
Mum Carolyne tweeted: "We've loved every min of our involvement. It's the best show on TV & I want to thank everyone for their wonderful support - we'll miss u."
Andrew will stand for the UKIP and contest the East Sussex seat of Hastings and Rye.
That seat is held by a Conservative MP.
