[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has flown to Cuba to resume chemotherapy treatment for cancer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The parliament in Caracas held a special session to authorise his trip.
Mr Chavez had a tumour removed in Cuba in June. He returned there for a first round of chemotherapy last month. The exact nature of his cancer has not been disclosed.
The illness has raised doubts about whether he will be able to stand for re-election next year as planned.
But President Chavez has said he is aiming for victory, and that he is responding well to the treatment.
Speaking to his supporters in Caracas before his departure for Cuba, Mr Chavez said he was ready for more treatment.
"I'm leaving in a better condition, and with this second phase of chemotherapy I will be even better," he said.
