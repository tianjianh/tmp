[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natasha Capell, 26, was found guilty of the murder of Kyle Byfield, 23 who was wounded at the flat in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 15 April.
He died later in hospital. Capell had admitted manslaughter, but had denied intending to kill Mr Byfield
Passing sentence at Oxford Crown Court, Judge Patrick Eccles QC ordered she spend at least 18 years in jail.
The jury at Oxford Crown Court took two hours to unanimously find her guilty on Wednesday.
The trial had heard Mr Byfield went to Capell's home in Jubilee Court, Banbury, with a friend after a party in the town. His friend knew Capell.
An argument broke out when Capell tried to get them to leave as they had all been drinking.
A post-mortem examination established Mr Byfield died from a stab wound to the chest.
While giving evidence, the mother-of-one apologised to Mr Byfield's family saying: "I wish I could swap places with him. I wish I could change it, but there's nothing I can do."
Speaking after the verdict, Det Supt Chris Ward of Thames Valley Police described it as a "tragic case" that showed "the dangers of excessive drinking and taking drugs".
Alan Byfield, Kyle's father, said: "Kyle had his whole life ahead of him. He had a good job and worked hard and was looking forward to his life together with his girlfriend.
"It devastates me to know I won't get a telephone call from him and won't hear his voice again."
His mother Roni Byfield added: "My life has fallen apart since I lost my son and nothing can bring him back."
