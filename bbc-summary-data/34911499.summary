Haskins was awarded the belt after Randy Caballero was stripped of his title after weighing in five and a half pounds over the limit for last Saturday's fight, which had been due to take place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
Bristol-based manager, Chris Sanigar, told BBC Points West about his future hopes for 32-year-old Haskins.
