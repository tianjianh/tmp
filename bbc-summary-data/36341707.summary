McSheffrey, 33, out of contract in the summer, scored once in seven games for Rovers after arriving on loan in March.
He made 91 appearances for Scunthorpe and scored 15 goals since signing for the League One side in January 2014.
"Nothing's signed yet, but it's probably 100% more or less going to be Doncaster," said McSheffrey.
"Doncaster are the ones that are going out there to get straight back up and have a promotion season."
Doncaster were relegated to League Two on the final day of the season, finishing 21st in the table with just 11 wins from 46 league games.
"It's a proper club with big potential so really, it was the one that was standing out to me," McSheffrey added.
