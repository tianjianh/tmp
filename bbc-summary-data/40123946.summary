Taylor joined Maidstone in July 2015 from Cambridge United, helping them earn promotion from National League South in his first season at the club.
The 22-year-old former Chelsea trainee scored eight goals in 41 league appearances for the Stones this season.
"I had a good two years at Maidstone United but for me it's time for a new chapter in my career," he said.
"Other clubs were offering me more financially and I had an offer from League Two, but it was a no-brainer for me to sign for Aldershot."
