[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ferry Hrossey took action to avoid vessel at Kirkwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ferry had to take action to ensure it avoided a possible collision before docking in Orkney.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hrossey was heading into Kirkwall in fog at about 22:00 on 3 July when passengers described the ship making what appeared to be an emergency manoeuvre to avoid another ship.
It was believed to have been the anchored Coastguard tug Herakles.
Serco Northlink Ferries has now said the ferry had "manoeuvred to ensure a safe passing distance".
This was said to have "caused the ferry to list more than normal".
