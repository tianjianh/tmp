Ismail Patel, who attends Sharples School in Bolton, was given only eight years to live by doctors when he was born with Pompe Disease, a condition which restricts his movement and speech and leaves him breathing via a tube and fed with another tube.
Ismail's results have been good enough for him to be able to take a business studies course at college next year.
