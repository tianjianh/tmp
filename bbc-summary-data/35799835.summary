[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African Charl Schwartzel won the Valspar Championship in Palm Harbour, Florida with victory over American Bill Haas at the first play-off hole.

The 31-year-old carded a four-under 67 to finish seven under with Haas, who was one ahead overnight.
He then claimed the play-off with a par for his 15th professional win, but only his second on the PGA Tour.
World number one Jordan Spieth, the defending champion, birdied the last for a 73 and was tied 18th, seven back.
Playing partner Lee McCoy, the 22-year-old amateur who grew up next to the Copperhead course, followed his third-round 66 with four birdies in a 69 and finished fourth to qualify for the Houston Open.
Haas was two shots ahead into the closing stages, but having made par from a greenside bunker at the par-three 15th, he was unable to do so from a similar scenario at the next and was tied with Schwartzel, who birdied three of his final six holes, including a putt from 64 feet at the 13th.
At the first play-off hole, the par-four 18th, Haas put his tee shot with a three wood into the trees on the right and his second into a greenside bunker.
Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters champion, took an iron off the tee and was pin-high in two, before calmly two-putting to secure the title after Haas could not hole for par from 18 feet.
