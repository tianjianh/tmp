[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Adams, 59, and Constance Adams, 55, were arrested by Dutch police on Friday on suspicion of carrying out an attempted murder in Islington in 2013.
They will now be extradited for police questioning in England.
In December 2013, a 51-year-old man was shot in the chest after being approached by a man and woman as he sat in a car on St John Street.
He was taken to an east London hospital where he required treatment for his injuries for more than a month.
