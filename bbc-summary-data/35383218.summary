Nigeria, who would have qualified for the next round with a win, went ahead through Elvis Chikatara on 51 minutes.
But Tunisia levelled on 69 minutes when Ahmed Akaichi headed in.
Akaichi came close to scoring a winner for Tunisia but was denied by a goal-line clearance by Kalu.
The result meant Nigeria stayed on top of the group, with four points, and Tunisia moved to second on two points.
Their positions in the table remained the same after Guinea and Niger drew 2-2 in the day's second Group C match.
After 38 minutes of deadlock there were two goals in two minutes in Kigali.
Issa Moussa's goal for Niger was cancelled out by Alseny Camara's third goal of the tournament just a minute later.
Niger's coach Francois Zahoui, who led Ivory Coast to the final of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, was forced to make three changes before half-time due to injuries.
But his side managed to regain the lead four minutes into the second half with Moussa on target again.
With 12 minutes left to play Guinea levelled for a second time -  the fourth time they have done so at the tournament - through Aboubacar Bangoura.
The final matches in Group C are on Tuesday when Nigeria play Guinea and Tunisia face Niger.
