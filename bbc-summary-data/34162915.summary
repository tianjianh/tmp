Police and paramedics were called to Park Avenue in Gosforth at 05:45 BST but the 42-year-old victim was pronounced dead in hospital.
A 20-year-old was also held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, Northumbria Police said.
A force spokesman described it as an isolated incident with no risk to the wider community.
Superintendent Richie Jackson said: "We understand the concerns of the local community and extra officers are in the area to answer any questions they may have.
"This was an isolated incident and we have now made two arrests. We do not believe there is any risk to members of the wider public.
"Despite this we would still ask anyone with any information about the stabbing to get in touch as it still could help our ongoing enquiries."
