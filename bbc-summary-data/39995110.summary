[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan pulled off their "Great Escape" to deny leaders Nottinghamshire thanks to a mammoth effort from Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke.

The pair batted through the final day in a stand of 226 as the home side reached 420-5, 159 runs ahead of the visitors.
Ingram's marathon near 10-hour knock saw him reach a county-best 155 not out, while Cooke was unbeaten on 113.
Nottinghamshire stay top of Division Two thanks to a 12-point haul.
England spinner Samit Patel came close to bowling Ingram three times either side of his century, but there was little assistance from the pitch for their willing seam attack.
Ingram's century was the slowest in the Championship this season off 294 balls, in sharp contrast to his huge hitting in the One-Day Cup.
The pair came together half an hour before the end of day three and Cooke also reached three figures shortly after tea on the final day, not giving a chance in his equally gritty innings.
The sixth-wicket partnership was Glamorgan's highest against Nottinghamshire, beating 131 from Peter Walker and Don Ward in Newport in 1961, and was approaching the all-time record of 240 when the teams shook hands on a draw at 16:50 BST.
Glamorgan's Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's quite strange, while you're out there you get on with it ball by ball and you're in the moment, but looking back it was a long couple of days and we can be proud of what we've done. It is my longest innings but once you're out there, you keep it simple.
"I really enjoyed the partnership with Chris and the longer we went on, that process became easier. But we still want to get on the winning side and maybe this is what we need to change momentum for us."
Chris Cooke added:
"It was good to get through the tricky spell last night with Colin, it gave us momentum going into the last day and it was just about (setting) small targets.
"Getting to lunch was important and from there the belief started to grow, they kept running in but we were up to the task."
Nottinghamshire acting captain Steven Mullaney told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"From my point of view the bowlers have everything and it was an outstanding effort, but hats off to Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke who did really well.
"We've had more luck (on other occasions), Samit Patel was outstanding without any luck.
"We welcome 12 points and we're still top of the league so we can't complain."
