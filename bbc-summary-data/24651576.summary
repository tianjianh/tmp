Giant George weighed more than 17.5 stone (111kg) and was able to reach a height of 7ft 3in (2.2m) standing on his hind legs.
The news of the Great Dane's death was announced on George's official Facebook page.
Owner David Nasser said: "It is with a heavy heart that we announce Giant George died last night."
The message, posted on 18 October, went on to read: "George passed away peacefully surrounded by loved ones; one month before his eighth birthday."
Giant George started life as the runt of a litter of 13 puppies, but went on to grow to 43in (109cm) from paw to shoulder.
In 2010, he was named by Guinness World Records as both the world's tallest living dog and tallest dog ever.
He made it into the record books by beating his nearest rival, Titan, a Great Dane from California, by three-quarters of an inch.
The titles landed him spots on the Oprah Winfrey Show and ABC's Good Morning America.
He also had his own website, Facebook page and Twitter handle.
On a plane trip in 2010 for a media appearance in Chicago, George was given a row of three seats to himself.
He ate around 110lb (50kg) of food each month.
George was so big he had to have his own queen-sized double bed inside the house, where he slept until he passed away last week.
