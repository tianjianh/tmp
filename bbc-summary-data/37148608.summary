A 56-year-old woman has been assaulted and robbed as she was getting out of a car parked on a driveway in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman was attacked in Mountcastle Drive North at 03:00 on Sunday as she was getting out of the front passenger side of the car.
She was dragged to the ground, receiving minor injuries, and her red canvas bag was stolen.
Detectives believe the crime could be linked to an attempted break-in at a nearby property.
The suspect was described as being white, in his 20s, about 5ft 8in tall and of medium build.
He was wearing a grey hooded top with grey bottoms, and was last seen heading towards Hamilton Drive.
Officers are also keen to trace another man seen in the area at about the same time.
He was described as being white, in his 20s, 5ft 8in tall and of medium build. He was wearing black clothes.
Det Con Stevie Herd said: "We believe that an attempt may have been made to break-in to a nearby home shortly beforehand and are currently treating this as linked to the robbery.
"Anyone who may have witnessed the robbery, or saw any suspicious behaviour in the area around this time, is urged to get in touch."
