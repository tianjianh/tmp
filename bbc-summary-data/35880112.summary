[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Eames, 40, attacked the women on the Trans Pennine trail in Bentley, near Doncaster, on 10 September 2015.
He threatened to harm five children who were with the women if they did not comply with his demands, police said.
Eames will serve a minimum of 10 years and six months after pleading guilty at Sheffield Crown Court.
As well as three counts of rape, Eames, of Redbourne Road, Bentley, admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted rape and two counts of robbery.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Sgt Pete Swift, said: "Eames is a vile and loathsome individual and his actions that day were sickening and absolutely inexcusable.
"He made the women endure what can only be described as an agonising, vicious and traumatising attack and I am pleased he will behind bars for a very lengthy period of time."
He added: "What intensifies the abhorrent nature of this attack even further is the fact Eames carried out his assault in the presence of children.
"The victims were given a horrendous choice on that day to either run and look after themselves or stay with the children in their care and ensure their wellbeing."
In 2009, Eames was  jailed for four-and-a-half years after taking a six-year-old girl hostage for over 40 hours during an armed siege at a house in Scarborough.
