Former WBA continental light-welterweight champion Tommy Martin has retired from boxing after suffering a bleed on the brain following January's loss against John Wayne Hibbert.

An MRI scan revealed the injury after the previously undefeated 22-year-old lost the Commonwealth title fight.
The British Boxing Board of Control stopped a boxing return and he thanked them for "probably saving my life".
"Unfortunately for me this is the end of the road as a boxer," Martin added.
Martin, a former Peterborough United youth-team player, will now work with young fighters.
"It is now time to turn this negative into a positive by putting all the passion and fire I have back into other fighters," he said.
