Thomas Rhodes, 19, was found dead about 16.15 BST on Sunday in Hallam Towers on Manchester Road in Fulwood.
A post-mortem examination showed he died of multiple injuries consistent with a fall, the West Yorkshire Police said.
The force is treating his death as unexplained and appealed for witnesses.
Det Insp John Fitzgibbons said Mr Rhodes' family were "devastated by his death".
"I want to trace Mr Rhodes' movements from Saturday, 25 March, and into the early hours of Sunday," he explained.
