Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has said they must bide their time as they try to sign West Brom's Saido Berahino.

The Potters had a Â£20m bid for the 23-year-old rejected last month but remain interested in the former England Under-21 striker.
Hughes said: "It is no secret that we have made bids and have an interest in Berahino, but it is not in our hands.
"We just have to be patient and if the situation changes then we will be ready to sit down and talk."
He added: "He is obviously a player of another club and if they don't want to sell - or have no intention of selling - then there is nothing we can do to affect that.
"He is an outstanding young talent but you need a lot of boxes ticked and all the ducks in a row before any deal happens.
"At the moment that is not where we are. If it happens we will be delighted, if it doesn't we will move on to [other] targets."
Stoke start the new Premier League season with a trip to newly promoted Middlesbrough on Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off).
