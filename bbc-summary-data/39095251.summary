Kane struck three times in 23 minutes as Spurs beat Stoke City 4-0 to climb to second in the Premier League table.
The 23-year-old also scored three against Fulham in the FA Cup on 19 February and against West Brom in the league on 14 January.
"He's playing at a very good level, a fantastic player," said Pochettino.

Kane scored in the 14th, 32nd and 37th minutes as Spurs made it eight straight league wins at White Hart Lane.
Dele Alli scored in first-half stoppage time to complete the rout against mid-table Stoke.
Pochettino added: "He's one of the top strikers in the world and I think he deserves it because he's a great professional and top man. I'm happy for him.
"It doesn't surprise me, because I've told you many times that for me he's one of the best strikers in the world.
"This season we are not only winning games [at White Hart Lane], we are playing very well here - maybe because we all know it's the last season here and it's a very special atmosphere on the pitch and in the stadium."
Analysis by former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Radio 5 live
That was a special performance by Harry Kane. There are only a select number of players who can score like he can on their weaker side.
More often than not, if he is in the box, he will hit it. It goes through bodies, goes through legs and ends up in the back of the net.
I just don't know how much more of a warning you need when he is on the edge of the box with the ball. He is lethal with both feet. You need to close him down. When you're hot, you're hot. It's as simple as that.
Former England striker Alan Shearer, who scored a record 260 Premier League goals: "Calm down Harry Kane! What is he after...a Premier League record or something?"
Former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker tweeted: "A third hat-trick for Kane in nine games. The last person to do that was....someone else."
