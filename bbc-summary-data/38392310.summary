Call for clearer leadership over breast screening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report has called for clearer leadership in part of the NHS after hundreds of women in Scotland missed out on routine breast screenings.

The review by Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) was carried out after it emerged that medics failed to issue screening invitations to 3,831 women.
It found that all of the women have now been offered appointments but 41% have yet to take up the offer.
Women aged between 50 and 70 should be screened every three years.
However, some of those who were missed had not been screened in more than nine years, according to the HIS report.
It found that 218,073 were invited to undergo mammograms in 2014-15 and almost three quarters (72.5%) took up the offer.
The procedure can identify breast cancer before any symptoms are noticeable.
The report recommends that an "adverse event" team should be set up to review whether "every practical step" has been taken to ensure the identified women have the opportunity to be screened.
It said clearer leadership was needed from the health service's National Services Division (NSD), which is responsible for managing the performance of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.
A new IT system will address a number of issues which led to the problems, but it should be subject to ongoing monitoring, the report said.
The chairman of the review group said the report proved that "more needs to be done" to ensure every eligible woman in Scotland is screened.
Stephen W. Duffy, who is also professor of cancer screening at the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine, said: "Effective and timely breast screening for women is crucial in the early diagnosis of breast cancer.
"Clearly the vast majority of women in Scotland receive their invitation to be screened in a timely manner, but it's important that all women are given the opportunity to be screened at the earliest opportunity.
"This report clearly demonstrates that more needs to be done to ensure that this happens for every woman eligible for screening in Scotland."
The discrepancy only came to light when a woman contacted her GP in Lanarkshire in August 2015 to enquire about the date of her last breast screening.
When it emerged that she had not been checked since 2010, an investigation was launched.
Claire Sweeny, of HIS, said: "In Scotland we are working hard to develop a culture where people receive the best possible care every time they encounter our health and social care system, and that when issues occur there is an open culture of learning.
"We are encouraged by the response of NSD to our report's findings and recommendations."
Cancer charity Breast Cancer Now said the report must be followed by "immediate action".
Policy and campaigns manager Lawrence Cowan said: "Breast screening saves lives.  The earlier breast cancer is found, the better your chances of survival.  That's why it's so important that the screening service works properly."
