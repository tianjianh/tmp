Roberts' exclusion comes despite a campaign that drew widespread praise for his displays, including a man-of-the-match performance against Scotland.
Davies, who spent most of the tournament as Wales' first-choice number nine, was replaced in the starting line-up by Rhys Webb for the final match against Italy and scored a try after coming on as a 62nd-minute replacement.
Northampton Saints' North, who previously suffered four head blows in a five-month spell and was sidelined for much of 2015, was the only player in the championship to score more than three tries.
England's Owen Farrell finished the tournament as the top points scorer, contributing 62 points over five games.
