The 19-year-old University of Stirling swimmer clocked 47.90 seconds, which is also good enough for an automatic place at July's World Championships.
"I'm delighted with that," said Scott. "I didn't have the same preparation as last year, so to do a PB (personal best) is incredible.
"I just came out here to race, so that's a bonus."
University of Edinburgh duo Jack Thorpe and Kieran McGuckin were second and third behind Scott.
Scott finished fifth in last summer's Olympic final in 48.01 seconds, bringing home silver medals from the 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley relays.
"I was trying to hit the qualification time and I have done that," he added.
"It's a time for the Commonwealth Games [2018] as well so it's been a phenomenal day and I am glad to be on the podium with two other Scots."
Mark Szaranek, of Edinburgh University, was second behind Max Litchfield, who set a new British 400m individual medley record in his home town.
