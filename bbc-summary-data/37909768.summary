[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hooker Logan Tomkins has signed a new one-year deal with Salford Red Devils for 2017, having helped save their Super League status this term.

Tomkins, 24, left Wigan, where brothers Joel and Sam play, to link up with the Red Devils in July, and was an ever-present for Ian Watson's side.
Salford have already lost captain and fellow hooker Tommy Lee to St Helens for the coming campaign
"Logan stepped up to be our starting nine last season," Watson said.
"He does things across the park that don't always get seen but make a massive difference to the team.
"He's shown big improvements during his time here and I'm sure he can continue to develop in 2017."
