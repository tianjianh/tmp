[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second-half goal from Charlie Wyke, his 17th of the season, spared Carlisle a third consecutive defeat as the Cumbrians were held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron Wildig gave the Shrimps an early lead and the visitors held out until Wyke's 74th-minute effort which followed the sending off of defender Dean Winnard.
Morecambe's bright start was rewarded in the seventh minute when Kevin Ellison whipped over an accurate cross from wide on the left to pick out Wildig, who coolly guided his shot past Mark Gillespie into the bottom-left-hand corner.
The Carlisle defence was all at sea early on and only an offside flag denied Peter Murphy a second goal with a first-time flick from Michael Rose's penetrating pass.
As Carlisle finally began to get into the game, the woodwork came to Morecambe's rescue in the 25th minute when Barry Roche produced an instinctive save from Jason Kennedy's far-post header and Wyke, from six yards, slammed the inviting rebound against the bar.
Carlisle pressed for an equaliser after the break, although Wildig kept Gillespie on his toes with a 25-yard skimmer which the goalkeeper went full length to turn away for a corner.
The Shrimps had Winnard sent off in the 73rd minute for a foul on Shaun Miller and from the free-kick on the left edge of the box Nicky Adams' curler was glanced past Roche by Wyke's header.
Wyke and substitute Derek Asamoah had late chances, but with just one point from three games Carlisle's automatic promotion hopes again faltered.
