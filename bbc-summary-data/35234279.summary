Kaya Langmead was left with "red raw" skin after getting stuck to the seat at McDonald's in Exeter's High Street, her mother, Nicole Langmead, said.
The incident last week is thought to have been a prank. Police are searching for two girls seen leaving the toilets before Kaya went in.
Devon and Cornwall Police said no one else was being "sought at this time".

Kaya's mother, Nicole Langmead, said her daughter managed to free herself from the toilet seat, thought to have been covered in super-strong glue, but was in tears after the incident last Thursday afternoon.
McDonald's said staff swiftly offered medical help and contacted police "as soon as our restaurant team was made aware of this incident".
Devon and Cornwall Police said "two girls have been identified" but had concerns about their names being mentioned on social media.
The force said: "We are aware there is social media attention relating to the incident and understand that the public are concerned.
"However, we have a duty to protect everyone involved and will take positive action against threats or abuse.
"We are in contact with the victim's mother and will keep her updated on our progress."
