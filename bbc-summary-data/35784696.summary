Matt Dixon: Western Australia seamer signs two-year deal with Essex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
County Championship Division Two club Essex have signed Western Australia seamer Matt Dixon on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Australia under-19 bowler Dixon holds a British passport and will not count as an overseas player.
The 23-year-old has taken only seven wickets in five first-class games, but averages 22.00 with the ball from four Twenty20 matches.
"Matt is a talented young man who bowls at a really good pace," Essex head coach Chris Silverwood said.
"He adds depth to our squad, as you need a number of seamers in a squad to be able to compete on all three fronts, as we plan to."
