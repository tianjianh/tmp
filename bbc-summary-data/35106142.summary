EU referendum: 'No taboos' when EU debates UK demands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
EU leaders have to hold a "serious debate with no taboos" on David Cameron's reform demands, European Council president Donald Tusk has said.

In a letter inviting leaders to this week's summit, Mr Tusk warned of "high stakes" and said while "significant progress" had been made in talks the EU was still "far from an agreement".
The PM's proposals are due to be discussed over dinner in Brussels.
His spokeswoman predicted a "full, substantive, frank discussion".
Mr Cameron wants to reform the UK's relations with the EU before a referendum on the UK's membership.
He set out his intentions in phone calls with Mr Tusk as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday, Downing Street said.
A final agreement is not expected to be reached at the summit, which starts on Thursday, but Mr Tusk says it should "pave the way" for an agreement by February's gathering.
In his letter, he said the discussions should focus on the "most controversial" elements of Mr Cameron's demands, which are likely to centre on his calls for a four-year wait before EU migrants can receive working-age benefits.
"The stakes are so high that we cannot escape a serious debate with no taboos," Mr Tusk said.
As well as the welfare curb, which is aimed at cutting EU migration, the PM is also calling for protection for countries not using the euro currency, measures to boost competitiveness and exempting Britain from the drive towards an "ever-closer union".
His spokeswoman said the summit was "an important milestone in the UK renegotiating its relationship with the EU" and would include a frank discussion on the "sensitive topics" of migration and welfare.
Mr Cameron, who discussed his reform plans with Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka on the phone on Tuesday, has been warned by a committee of MPs he cannot achieve fundamental reforms without changing the EU's treaties - and that there is not enough time for this to happen before the referendum, promised before the end of 2017.
No 10 agreed that the "legally binding, irreversible" changes being demanded by Mr Cameron will need treaty changes.
But a spokesman said this did not need to happen before a referendum, which must be held by 2018.
Also on the agenda for the EU Council meeting will be the migrant crisis, with the EU aiming to "regain control" of its external borders which have not been secure enough, Mr Tusk said.
"The protection of our external borders is not intended to scare off those who flee wars or persecution. Europe is a community of freedom and will always provide shelter for those in danger," he added.
The leaders are also due to discuss climate change and the fight against terrorism.
