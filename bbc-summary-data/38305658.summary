The Swede, also the Open champion and an Olympic silver medallist in Rio, takes the title for a second time having also won in 2013.
The 40-year-old said the past season had been "the best of my career" and he was "very proud" of his achievements.
"To win for a second time is a fantastic way to bring the curtain down on it," he said.
Stenson's 20-under-par 264 at Royal Troon, where he finished ahead of Phil Mickelson to win the Open, matched the record for the lowest score at a major.
He took silver in Rio after bogeying the final hole while Briton Justin Rose made his birdie putt to win by two strokes.
