Catalans Dragons ran in eight tries as they won in England for the first time this Super League season with a convincing victory at Wakefield.

The Dragons raced to 26-0 ahead early on as Jodie Broughton, Dave Taylor, Pat Richards, Jason Baitieri and Glenn Stewart crossed.
The hosts got to within four points as Anthony Tupou, Joe Arundel, Reece Lyne and Tom Johnstone touched down.
But Richie Myler and two Tony Gigot tries secured the win for Catalans.
Former Dragons forward Mickael Simon crossed over for the late consolation score, but the Wildcats have now lost four of their opening five matches of 2016.
The French side, who had Remi Casty back from an eight-month knee injury, won just twice away from home last season and have now beaten Wakefield four games straight.
They have won back-to-back games after losses to Wigan and Hull FC in their first two matches.
Wakefield coach Brian Smith: "I was very disappointed with our defensive performance in the first half and, when we got ourselves back in the game, we let ourselves down with defensive problems.
"If you concede 42 points you are not going to win. That part was very disappointing, generally we're better than that.
"The boys were still putting in at the end but you get no medals for trying. In professional sport you've got to be better than that."
Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous: "I think we were very good for the first 20 minutes and, although we let in some soft tries, we leave with two points.
"Defensively we need to improve but to come away and score 40 points is pleasing.
"Since the first day he arrived in Perpignan in November, Richie (Myler) has worked very hard. I know what he can bring to the team with the ball and defensively he's working very hard.
"His partnership with Todd (Carney) is improving, I'm very happy with Richie."
