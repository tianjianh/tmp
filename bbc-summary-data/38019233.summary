The cancer hospital in Withington has been rated as "outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission.
It is the largest single-site cancer centre in Europe and treats more than 44,000 patients per year.
Chief executive Roger Spencer paid tribute to the "dedicated, expert staff" and "outstanding research".
The health watchdog commended the "friendly and open culture" and investment in "the latest technology" following its inspection in May.
The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is "helping to shape the future of cancer care", chief inspector of hospitals Professor Sir Mike Richards said.
"Our inspectors were struck by the commitment to excellence that filters through every area of the trust."
The report said the surgical division "demonstrated a robust approach" offering "bespoke" treatments, which "improved survival rates" and "quality of life".
Mr Spencer said he was "delighted and very proud", adding "it is the culture of The Christie to relentlessly pursue innovations".
The Christie is the third specialist hospital trust in the country to receive the CQC's highest rating alongside The Walton Centre in Liverpool and Liverpool's Heart and Chest Hospital.
