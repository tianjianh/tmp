[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish technology companies are heading to Bavaria on a trade mission which aims to strengthen links between Scotland and Germany.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The delegation will visit a number of prominent businesses, universities and government organisations in Munich this week.
They will seek opportunities in the tech sector for increased collaboration and international investment.
The mission will be led by Scotland's Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse.
The visit comes two months after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon held talks in Berlin with a member of the German government about the UK's Brexit vote.
Ms Sturgeon later said she had set out Scotland's perspective on the EU referendum, adding that she was aiming to strengthen Scotland's relations.
During the Bavaria trip, the Scottish tech companies will meet senior executives from IBM, BMW, Munich Technical University, Munich Technology Centre, the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and the City of Munich.
Mr Wheelhouse will also meet executives from renewable energy firm BayWa r.e. and Fraunhofer, Europe's largest applied research institute. Both organisations have their UK headquarters in Scotland.
The mission will also highlight the work of support bodies such as Scottish Edge, We Are The Future, Informatics Ventures and Women's Enterprise Scotland.
Scottish companies heading to Munich:
Among those taking part will be David Scrimgeour, founder of the British-German Business Network.
He said: "Bavaria is an attractive market for Scottish tech companies and this will hopefully be the first of many visits.
"The idea behind this mission is to explore the potential for future co-operation between the two tech ecosystems and to start to build relationships in Bavaria. We expect a return visit early next year."
Andrew Dobbie, founding director of digital creative agency MadeBrave, who will be travelling as part of the delegation, said: "Companies like ours who are eyeing international growth see Germany and Bavaria as important territories so I'm really excited about the opportunity to build relationships that I'm sure will lead to business activity for MadeBrave."
Mr Wheelhouse said: "This visit presents a very important opportunity to take a group of some of Scotland's most exciting and innovative technology companies to Germany, and to visit Bavaria in particular; an area that is known globally as a leading international technology hub.
"Our aim is that, through achieving increased collaboration across the commercial, public and university sectors, we will be able to translate this into significantly increased economic benefit for both Scotland and Bavaria.
"Germany is Europe's largest market, as well as the third largest inward investor into Scotland and one of our most important export markets."
