[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The operator of a landfill site in Surrey that is producing a sewage-like smell should pay compensation to residents, local MP Crispin Blunt says.

There have been more than 120 complaints about the odour from the site in Cormongers Lane in Redhill.
Biffa, which runs it, has begun urgent improvement work after the Environment Agency found surface water was causing hydrogen sulphide gas emissions.
Mr Blunt, the Reigate MP, said Biffa should get the site working properly.
The Conservative MP said: "The local community that played host to the site should be getting some compensation from Biffa."
He added that the company should recognise the smell as "wholly unacceptable" and make some "collective restitution" to the people of Redhill.
In a statement, Biffa said: "To date a Biffa Award Scheme has donated Â£140m to community projects throughout the UK and, specifically within the locality, Biffa has endowed a nature reserve next to the site."
A report by the Environment Agency after officers inspected the site has led to an action plan being implemented by Biffa.
The improvements that Biffa are making include installing 100 gas extraction wells.
Initially it was thought the emissions were methane gas but further investigations found it was hydrogen sulphide.
Biffa said low levels of the gas can cause an unpleasant odour but it was not dangerous to health at such levels.
The agency said it would be carrying out regular odour assessments and further site inspections.
