Three-time champion Adams, 58, dropped just two legs in his 4-0 victory over Jim Widmayer of the United States.
Fourth seed Mitchell, 44, overcame Belgium's Geert de Vos 4-2, while Rotherham's Dawson came from 3-1 down to beat Latvia's Madars Razma 4-3.
Earlier, England's Robbie Green and Darryl Fitton reached the last eight.
Fitton defeated second seed and 2014 runner-up Alan Norris in a deciding set, while Green thrashed Swedish qualifier Peter Sajwani 4-0.
Lincolnshire-based Adams is making his 22nd consecutive World Championship appearance in 2015 and a routine win over Widmayer confirmed his 15th quarter final.
Adams, who is the third seed at Lakeside, told BT Sport: "I felt my darts were a bit loose but I'm happy with the result.
"There were lots of straight tons that could have been scores of 140, and too many loose darts scoring one or five."
Mitchell's match with De Vos was a much closer affair, with the man from Dorset eventually prevailing to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in six attempts.
