World number one Andy Murray started his new season with a surprise defeat by Belgian David Goffin in the semi-finals of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi.

Murray, who had not conceded a set in his previous five encounters against the Belgian, was beaten 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.
Goffin will face Rafael Nadal in the final of the exhibition event after the Spaniard beat Milos Raonic 6-1 3-6 6-3.
Murray plays Raonic in a third-place play-off from 09:00 GMT on Saturday.
After losing the opening set against Goffin, Murray recovered to go 3-2 up in the second set.
But the world number 11 broke back and piled the pressure on the Briton.
Murray, who lost just nine matches in his entire 2016 season, will play in the Qatar Open in Doha in the first week of 2017 as he builds towards his push for an elusive first Australian Open title next month.
