The 26-year-old has made one appearance for the German Bundesliga side this season, playing in a Europa League game against Red Bull Salzburg in December.
The former Bayer Leverkusen keeper joined Schalke from Fortuna Dusseldorf in the summer of 2014.
"Fabian has come in to compete for the number one jersey," said City head coach Lee Johnson.
"He's certainly got a good pedigree, having played in the Bundesliga, and we hope he has a successful spell with us."
Meanwhile, City have sold Richard O'Donnell to Rotherham for an undisclosed fee.
