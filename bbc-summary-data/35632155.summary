[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Grisedale, 58, admitted causing the death of 46-year-old Andrew Birch in Scarisbrick, Lancashire in January last year.
Grisedale, from Southport, dangerously overtook Mr Birch's car which collided with an oncoming vehicle, Liverpool Crown Court was told.
He was sentenced to two years in jail and banned from driving for two years.
On the evening of 6 January 2015, Mr Grisedale carried out a dangerous manoeuvre in his BMW, overtaking a Peugeot Horizon on Southport Road before speeding off towards Southport.
As a result, the driver of a Toyota Carina that was travelling in the opposite direction lost control before it collided head-on with the Peugeot.
Andrew Birch, who was a passenger in the Peugeot, suffered fatal injuries.
His 80-year-old mother who was driving the car and the driver of the Toyota, a 41-year-old woman, were also seriously injured.
Det Sgt Keith Rimmer from Lancashire Police said it was "the reckless actions of Kenneth Grisedale" that led to the death of Mr Birch "in tragic circumstances".
"I hope today's sentence sends out a clear message to anyone who carries out dangerous manoeuvres and takes risks on the roads.
"Such behaviour can cost lives and cause devastation to the families of those involved."
