Hallworth, 19, from Skellingthorpe, Lincolnshire, the 100th seed, lost 6-1 to world number 30 Ben Woollaston.
"I had a lot of confidence coming into the competition, so I'm a little bit disheartened," he told BBC Sport.
"But I am always improving so it is only a matter of time before I start winning games."
Hallworth, who is in the second season of his two-year tour card, has struggled this season.
"I am enjoying playing against all the best players in the world, but I don't think I am doing myself justice at the minute," he said.
"Ben is a good all-round player, who got to a ranking event final last season, so has established himself on the tour. I know I can beat him, but it's doing it on the day. That's a different story.
"Some players do take a bit longer to blossom, but I know I am good enough to be up there, so I have to keep working hard.
"Confidence is definitely number one in this sport and you only get confidence from winning games so it can be a bit of a vicious circle. I know I am progressing it's just doing it on the day."
Woollaston, 28, from Leicester, said he was just happy to progress in the tournament.
"I nicked a poor first frame on the black and played okay after that," he added. "I don't care if I play terribly as long as I get to six. Once I won the first frame I felt comfortable after that."
