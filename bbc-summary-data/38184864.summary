Irish Premiership: Hamilton gets six-game ban after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glenavon player-boss Gary Hamilton has been hit with an additional two-match ban, six in total, after appealing against an original suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hamilton had been handed a two-match ban, with a further two suspended, for comments he made to referee Mervyn Smyth after being sent-off.
But after his appeal hearing, this was changed to a four-match suspension.
Hamilton also unsuccessfully challenged a red card decision and two-match ban he got for violent conduct.
The Irish FA's Appeals Committee decided the Disciplinary Committee had been too lenient in suspending the two matches for a probationary period of six months.
Normally, Hamilton would have got a straight four-match suspension for the comments made to the referee, but at the appeal hearing it was stated that the Disciplinary Committee had some sympathy with the Glenavon player-manager's case.
Hamilton, and Glenavon chairman Adrian Teer, spoke at the appeal hearing.
In its published findings, the Appeals Committee said Hamilton had shown "a deplorable lack of respect for the referee" and that such behaviour would not be tolerated.
The Appeal Hearing was told that the two assistant referees and fourth official reported that Hamilton had behaved aggressively in the officials' changing room.
He called referee Smyth a 'liar', questioning his faith with comments such as 'how can you call yourself a Christian?'
Hamilton had been sent-off for aiming a blow at opponent Chris Hegarty during a 1-1 draw against Dungannon Swifts in which two other players were dismissed by referee Smyth.
His six-match ban starts on Monday, 5 December.
