[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hammering down a stadium and community

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Last year I ran work by lifelong West Ham fan Marcus Drinkwater who had been documenting the final year of the football club's time at the ground they called home for 112 years - Upton Park.

West Ham now play their football at the Olympic Stadium, in Stratford, east London, but Drinkwater has continued to record both the demolition of the old stadium and the businesses that remain in the surrounding area, this time in black and white.
"Now the stadium is halfway through demolition and the songs are no longer being sung in Upton Park, many businesses are feeling the strain," says Drinkwater.
"West Ham's decision to up sticks and move over three miles west has left a big hole in the community, a hole being filled with 842 'luxury dwellings'. The flats are estimated to be completed by 2022 so it could be a little too late for the local business owners in the area."
Drinkwater feels that the story of Upton Park, known as the Boleyn Ground in latter years, is the story of London today.
He says: "Profits overshadow people and property developers are shaping our city. Another one of London's iconic areas is being gentrified and local people, for now, will have to learn to adapt regardless of the loss of income and loss of community."
Here are a selection of Marcus Drinkwater's pictures from his ongoing project.
