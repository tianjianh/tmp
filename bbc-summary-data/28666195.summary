[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City Council asks for care home quality views

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City Council is to change the way it provides care home services after acknowledging many aspects of the current model "need to be improved".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 12-week consultation has begun into how all aspects of care home services are commissioned and delivered.
Residents, their families and carers are being asked their views on service quality, choice and independence.
A new commissioning model will then be made for more than 170 homes where the council commissions placements.
"While satisfaction with services is generally high there is room for improvement," said Netta Meadows, Bristol City Council service director.
"There is a general need for higher quality care provision and a wider understanding within homes that residents should be encouraged and supported to be as independent as possible."
