The firm was originally fined a record $5.2bn by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) but the two sides have settled on a lower amount.
"This is the best outcome for the company," MTN executive chairman Phuthuma Nhleko said.
The fine was imposed amid fears that militants were using the phone lines.
