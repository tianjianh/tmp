[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers have signed Oldham Athletic forward Rhys Murphy for a nominal fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Arsenal trainee, 25, joined League One Oldham in January 2015, scoring three goals in 25 appearances for the Latics, and had loan spells at Crawley and AFC Wimbledon last season.
He scored nine times in 15 league starts with League Two side Crawley.
"It's a really good signing as he's got bundles of ability," manager Mark Cooper told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I'm convinced that, if we get him a run of games. he will score a lot of goals.
"I didn't think we'd get him, to be honest, but with the help of the chairman and (club director) Asif Rehmanwala, we've managed to get this one done.
"It's a little bit of a statement for us, because there were a lot of clubs after him. The fans will enjoy watching him play."
On Wednesday, forward Jon Parkin left the National League club after terminating his contract by mutual consent, while League Two Colchester United signed forward Kurtis Guthrie from Mark Cooper's side for an undisclosed fee.
