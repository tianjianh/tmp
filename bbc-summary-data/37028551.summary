Boxer Michael O'Reilly will not fight in Rio after failing a doping test, the Olympic Council of Ireland has said.

The middleweight, 23, was told last Thursday he had failed a test due to an "adverse analytical" finding.
He was suspended, and will not now contest that decision.
In a statement handed to Irish broadcaster RTE, O'Reilly said he unintentionally took a supplement that may have contained a banned substance.
It added he was given it "by someone unrelated to his team or association".
Olympic chiefs announced on Thursday an Irish boxer had failed a test, but would not confirm which member of the team it was.
The middleweight was tested before Brazil, and said he disclosed at the time that he had taken the substance.
The statement also said O'Reilly apologised to his fellow boxers, team-mates, the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, Sport Ireland, the Olympic Council of Ireland and "all those who have supported" him.
It comes in the same week Irish boxer Paddy Barnes, who won bronze medals in London and Beijing, suffered a shock defeat by Spain's Samuel Carmona.
