Katie was found by police after they were called to Alness Drive on Monday afternoon.
Witnesses described how Katie's mother, named locally as Alison Rough, fell to her knees in the street, crying and pleading for help after her daughter was injured.
Katie was taken to hospital after officers arrived at the scene but died a short time later.
Flowers and cards were left near the field, including one that read: "Night night my darling princess Katie. Love nana and grandad."
A number of people paid tribute to Katie, a pupil at the city's Westfield Primary School.
Tracey Ralph, Katie's headteacher, said her death was a "terrible loss".
"Katie was a kind and thoughtful child who was well liked by both pupils and staff," she added.
Neighbours of the dead girl said she was a "really sweet" girl who could often been seen playing outside with friends.
North Yorkshire Police said: "Katie's family are devastated by this tragic event and have asked for their privacy to be respected at this extremely distressing time."
