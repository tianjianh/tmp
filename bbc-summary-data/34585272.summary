Council leader's barn saved from possible demolition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A renovated barn belonging to Carmarthenshire council's leader has been saved from possible demolition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillor Emlyn Dole's wife, Gwenda Owen, received permission to partially convert barns in Pontyberem last year.
But an investigation by planning officers found "substantial demolition of the original building".
Planning committee members voted nine to eight in favour of granting retrospective permission after visiting the site on Tuesday.
