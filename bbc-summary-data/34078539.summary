She was running from her mother to her grandfather in Hanworth Park, Feltham, at 18:00 BST on 20 August, when she was struck by the pellet, police said.
She was taken to hospital where she underwent surgery to remove the pellet. Officers warned the incident could have been fatal.
The Met Police are appealing for help in finding who is responsible.
Det Helen Larson said: "This was a horrific incident and we are appealing for anyone with information to contact police.
"This shooting could have been far worse, possibly fatal and we need to find the person or persons responsible."
A group of boys were seen running out of nearby bushes following the incident, she added.
The three-year-old spent two days in hospital and is now making a good recovery, but will need further hospital appointments, police said.
