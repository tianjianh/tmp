The girl group made X Factor history by becoming the first group to win the show since it started in 2004.
Back then, Jesy, Perrie, Leigh-Anne and Jade went by the name of Rhythmix.
They were tipped to be the next big UK girl band, and are still going strong.
Newsround interviewed the girls back in their first year of winning the competition.
