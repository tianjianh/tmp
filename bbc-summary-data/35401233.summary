Deaf people in Bristol who are upset because they had to sell their social club building have started a campaign for a new one.

The Centre for Deaf People, a charity, sold its premises to pay off a pension deficit.
Trustee Sandra Smith said deaf people in Bristol "needed a new base".
Plans for the new centre include recruiting a fundraiser, a book keeper and setting up a website.
The original centre was established in 1962 and became a focal meeting point for Bristol's deaf community - complete with its own skittle alley.
Ms Smith said: "We do need a new base, where people know that they can come and meet - especially for young people".
She added it was not just about "alleviating the loneliness" but about somewhere people could go who "were all the same".
Six years ago the charity ran into difficulties when they had their core funding cut by the council.
Former trustees and management, who are no longer involved in the charity, said they were "devastated to hear about the closure of the centre".
