Police said the men forced their way into the house in Ashley Road, Poole, at about 21:15 GMT on Friday.
Officers said the family's children were also threatened in what they said was a "very frightening ordeal". No-one was hurt.
The robbers are thought to be white, in their early-20s and were said to speak with a "local accent".
Dorset Police urged anyone who is offered "Asian jewellery" in "unusual circumstances" to contact the police.
