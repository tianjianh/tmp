Historic Wales merger rushed and ill-thought, Plaid AM warns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to merge some parts of Wales' main heritage bodies are "rushed and ill-thought", Plaid Cymru has claimed.

The Welsh Government is looking to merge the commercial functions of National Museum Wales and Cadw under the banner Historic Wales.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates has said the aim was financial resilience.
Plaid's culture spokesman Dr Dai Lloyd accused ministers of an "unacceptable" lack of consultation, and threatened to block the merger.
"Such institutions represent the custodians of Welsh heritage," he said.
"They play a key role in our national identity and for that reason the Labour government must approach their independence as a red line in any reforms carried out.
"Failure to do so will undermine the integrity and purpose of these treasured institutions."
Mr Lloyd added that he would be asking for a Senedd debate on the plan for Historic Wales and urged Mr Skates to "pay heed to the heritage sector's concerns".
Referring to the deal under which Plaid supports Labour's right to govern Wales, Mr Lloyd said:  "There are various things we are unhappy about in the loose compact arrangement with Labour. This is right up there."
"I wouldn't have thought it would come to a vote [in the Senedd].  But we remain against it.
"And if it comes to a vote we would be voting against it. It is one of those red lines."
Earlier in October, National Museum Wales director general David Anderson warned AMs that a partial merger would see the museum "tied by the legs", saying its commercial and other activities were "deeply integrated with each other".
Former Arts Council of Wales chairman Dai Smith has also said he was alarmed by the plan.
