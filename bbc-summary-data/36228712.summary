The Port of Grangemouth is celebrating 50 years since the first container vessel called at the terminal.

The Sea-land freight service pulled into the port on 7 May 1966, as it transported goods such as Scotch whisky to the US.
Grangemouth was the first UK port to handle a transatlantic ship carrying only containers as part of the Europe and American shipping route.
Since then, it has become Scotland's largest container port.
Its terminal has handled more than three million containers over the past 50 years.
Today the facility, which is owned by Forth Ports, handles more than Â£6bn worth of goods each year including spirits, food, steel plate, timber, paper and equipment for the oil and gas industry.
According to its owners, as much as 30% of Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP) now goes through the port.
Commenting on the golden anniversary, Forth Ports group chief executive Charles Hammond said: "We are excited about reaching this significant milestone in the history of the port.
"Over the past 50 years the port has changed and adapted to the changing needs of our customers. We are now Scotland's largest container port and it makes a major contribution to the economy of Scotland.
"We look forward to continuing to play our part for Scotland in the next 50 years."
