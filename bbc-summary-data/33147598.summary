[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Chisholm, 31, abused Humza Yousaf as the politician took part in a Big Issue awareness initiative outside Queen Street station on 7 February.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard he said "you're not from my country" and also made reference to "a benefits locust".
Chisholm was also ordered to be supervised for 12 months as part of a community payback order.
The court heard that 30-year-old Mr Yousaf, who is minister for external affairs and international development, was taking part in a charity event to highlight poverty.
He was with a Big Issue vendor trying to sell the magazine to commuters when the incident took place.
Chisholm, from Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire, passed by and told those filming the event: "Take a photo of that mate, that's a benefit locust".
The father-of-one then declined to buy a Big Issue from the politician, saying: "You're not from my country".
Chisholm previously admitted acting in a racially aggravated manner.
Imposing the community payback order, Sheriff Andrew Mackie told him: "Your behaviour was deplorable on this occasion, there is no place for the type of conduct you displayed in Scottish society."
The court heard the incident was reported to the police on 13 February and there was a media campaign to try and identify Chisholm after the footage was posted online.
He was eventually traced and invited to the police station but he declined and said he would speak to a lawyer.
When officers arrived at his door he was recognised from CCTV and arrested for a racist breach of the peace.
It also emerged that Chisholm has previous breach of the peace convictions with religious and sexual orientation aggravations.
He was previously fined ??600 at the same court after he ran on to the pitch at Hampden as Rangers beat Celtic in the 2003 League Cup final.
