The Welshman, who has had surgery after fracturing his tibia and fibula, says he has a "long period of recovery ahead".
Rowe, Team Sky's road captain, broke a rib in a crash on the opening stage of this year's Tour de France but rode on to help Chris Froome win the title.
"I'll be back, when I don't know, but I'll be back," tweeted. Rowe, 27.
Speaking about the incident, he said: "I jumped down into the water but landed in a shallow section on my right leg. I knew straight away that it was a bad one."
Rod Ellingworth, Rowe's coach, added: "Obviously it's a serious injury and so Luke's going to be off the bike for a while."
