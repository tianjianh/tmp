[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The River Severn has burst its banks in Bridgnorth and flooding has forced roads to be closed across Shropshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flood waters covered the play area and rugby pitch at the town's Severn Park.
The Environment Agency said five flood warnings for the Severn were in place through Shrewsbury and at Ironbridge, Bridgnorth, Hampton Loade and Quatford.
Shropshire Council said the A488 in Bishop's Castle was blocked as were Gravel Hill Lane and Sydney Avenue in Shrewsbury because of flooding.
The Met Office is forecasting more rain on Monday and Tuesday.
The Environment Agency, which extended flood defences in Ironbridge on Saturday, said river levels in Bridgnorth were about 4.5m (14ft) and were expected to peak later.
It said levels in Shrewsbury had receded but would peak again on Monday.
Chris Bainger, from the agency, said: "We seem to be having little bits of respite in the rain and that's giving us gaps to let levels drop a bit before they rise again but we must remain vigilant.
"We do have some pretty atrocious weather fronts coming in bringing a lot of rain so there is no respite for the rest of the week."
Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had to rescue a woman from her car after it got stuck in flood water at Strefford Ford near Craven Arms.
It said it also had to use a winch to pull a car out of 2ft of flood water in Onibury, near Craven Arms, at about 20:45 on Saturday.
It said heavy winds also brought down a tree in Pool Dam in Shrewsbury which landed on a car parked in a house driveway. No-one was injured, it said.
