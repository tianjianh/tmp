Australian Marc Leishman produced a superb finish to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the Nedbank Challenge at Sun City, South Africa.

The 32 year old had already eagled the 10th to add to three birdies before birdieing the final two holes for a round of 66 to reach 14 under.
Overnight leader Henrik Stenson dropped to second after a 70 with two dropped shots in his final three holes.
Defending champion Danny Willett is 10 strokes adrift in a share of 11th.
Leishman, whose 2012 Travelers Championship victory on the PGA Tour remains his sole professional title, was in a three-way play-off for The Open at St Andrews in July, won by Zach Johnson.
He defied temperatures which at times exceeded 40 degrees celsius at the picturesque Gary Player Country Club in the North West province, sending his approach to seven feet to set up an eagle at the 547-yard par five 10th.
At both of the closing par fours he pitched to within five feet for further birdies and said: "It was fun, I was driving the ball really well there on the back nine and managed to roll in some putts. It was a good day.
"I've been in this position a few times in big events so it's great to draw on that experience. I've come up short a couple of times but I've won tournaments before and I'm looking forward to having a chance."
Stenson, who gave himself just a 5% chance of playing this week after spending three days in bed with the flu, said: "I was feeling better when I started but playing in 38 degrees certainly takes it out of you."
