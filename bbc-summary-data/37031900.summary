Rio 2016: Relay swimmers serve up success for Scotland

Scotland's first podium success in Rio came in the pool, with Stephen Milne, Duncan Scott, Dan Wallace collecting silver in the 4x200m freestyle relay.

The Scottish trio handed over to England's James Guy, who swam a strong final leg to finish behind the USA.
Aberdeen's Robbie Renwick also takes home an Olympic medal having lined up in the semi-final.
"The guys were absolutely amazing and it was a real honour to be swimming with them," Milne told BBC Sport.
"They really smashed it up. We can all be really proud of ourselves."
Milne, from Inverness, was well down the field but Scott and Wallace pulled the team back into contention and Guy overtook the Japanese to finish second in a new British record time of seven minutes, 03.13 seconds.
It was a busy day for Glasgow-born teenager Scott, who also qualified for the final of the 100m freestyle in seventh place after setting a new British record in the heats.
"I was a bit disappointed with how I swam at the Worlds last year, so I felt I had to step it up," said the 19-year-old.
"To come away with an Olympic medal is unreal.
"We were world champions last year, so we thought we had a medal in us, we just didn't know what colour. We're delighted with silver."
Wallace was part of that World Championships success in Kazan, along with Renwick and Guy, but needed a wildcard pick to make it to Brazil following a disappointing first half of the year.
"I was lucky to be on the team," said the 23-year-old from Edinburgh. "I knew I had to step it up and get back to my best. I think I did that and I'm very proud."
Guy, who replaced Renwick for the final, suffered disappointment earlier in the week, going into the individual 200m as world champion but finishing fourth.
Delighted with his contribution as he followed the legendary Michael Phelps home, he was already looking ahead to the Tokyo Games in 2020.
"We're building a great team," he said. "Our oldest guy is 23 so, come Tokyo, we'll be fully grown men going for that title."
