A plan to stop the rise in liver disease is being rolled out across Wales.

Deaths from liver disease have more than doubled in 20 years, largely due to the rise in obesity, alcohol misuse and blood borne viral hepatitis.
The Welsh government said these three causes are almost entirely preventable and published its plan in 2015.
Alcohol care teams will be set up in each health board to tackle alcohol-related cases and reduce re-admissions.
Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP Committee for Wales, called for more to be done to identify high-risk patients earlier on.
"The problem... is that actually symptoms follow far later than the potential damage, so we actually have to pick up the people who are at risk in advance," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"We are not picking up as many as we should."
Dr Bailey, a GP in Caerphilly, said he would welcome "increasing the ability of patients with alcohol problems to get early advice" as well as a public awareness campaign.
"I don't think many people realise that liver disease has this association with obesity," he added.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: "Last year, I published our liver disease delivery plan, which sets out how the Welsh NHS aims to stop the rise in liver disease and deaths, give patients more support, improve the quality of services, improve specialist knowledge in liver disease throughout the health service, and encourage patients to take responsibility for their health and care.
"The new measures I'm announcing today focus on education, early intervention and prevention, and ensuring we provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time.
"Our NHS will continue to play its part in treating those who need it but all of us have to take responsibility for the health consequences of our lifestyle choices."
