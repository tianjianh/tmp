"Considering the position the car ended up in, the potential for much more serious injuries is clear," an ambulance spokesman said.

All three women were taken to hospital for head and back injuries.
A spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said they were investigating the incident.

"When crews arrived they found a car lying on its side against a tree, off the side of a bridge," the spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said.
"The three women inside had managed to get out of the vehicle themselves and were back up on the roadside."
The 35-year-old driver of the silver Peugeot was treated for glass to the eyes, abrasions to both legs and possible back injuries.
The 39-year-old front seat passenger had a head injury and pain in both legs while the 29-year-old in the back seat had back pain and a head injury.
