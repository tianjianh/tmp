Josh Little & Greg Thompson get Ireland call-ups for T20 games against Hong Kong

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Little and Lorcan Tucker have been handed a first Ireland call-up for two T20 games against Hong Kong next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Left-arm pace bowler Little, 16, and wicketkeeper-batsman Tucker, 19, impressed at the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh this year and are among six new faces for the Bready matches.
Greg Thompson, James Shannon, Sean Terry and David Rankin are recalled.
The matches are part of two double-headers with Ireland women facing Bangladesh in morning matches.
The men's games take place at Bready on 5 and 6 September, starting at 15:30 BST.
Ireland women will also take on Bangladesh in ODIs at the same venue on 8 and 10 September - all matches start at 10:30.
"We wanted to bring some freshness to the squad - in particular we are delighted to see the youth of Josh Little and Lorcan Tucker added to the squad," said chair of selectors Alan Lewis.
"Left-arm quicks have been hugely successful in T20 and Josh's introduction will drive his career forward, we hope. He bowls with pace and is an excellent athlete.
"Lorcan's ability to score all around the ground with his 360 degree game - as witnessed at the U19 World Cup - coupled with his wicketkeeping gives us excellent balance."
