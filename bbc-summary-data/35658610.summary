A police officer was caught driving home from a disciplinary meeting at 100mph while more than seven times over the legal alcohol limit, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Con Simon Reader swerved and lost control of his car on the M90 as he drove back to England following the meeting in Aberdeen.
A court heard that the 45-year-old had spent the previous evening drinking "very, very heavily".
Reader was given a six-month curfew and banned from driving for three years.
Perth Sheriff Court was told drivers had to swerve out of Reader's way as he weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph on the dual carriageway.
The court heard that the officer, who is from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, had been called to a meeting with his superiors on 21 January and was warned that he could face losing his job because of "health issues".
Depute fiscal Robbie Brown told the court that during a 30-mile stretch, from Dundee to the M90 near Perth, Reader forced several motorists to swerve to avoid colliding with him.
Mr Brown said: "On the M90 he was seen travelling at 100mph in the inside lane.
"He was overtaking and had to brake sharply because he hadn't reacted to approaching another car.
"He swerved and lost control, mounting the central reservation, striking the barrier and crossing both lanes before coming to rest partly on the hard shoulder and partly on the lane facing north."
Mr Brown said Reader initially gave a breath sample at the roadside which measured 157 micrograms - more than seven times the 22 micrograms limit.
He subsequently refused to give a breath test.
Solicitor George Donnelly, defending, said Reader had a previously "exemplary record", but was told at the meeting that, given his health issues, Police Scotland were giving "serious consideration" to dismissing him.
Mr Donnelly said: "That impacted deeply upon him. He would seem to have resorted to alcohol.
"He drank very, very heavily for the rest of the day and that evening in the hotel room and the decision to drive from Aberdeen followed."
Reader admitted driving dangerously on various roads in Tayside on 22 January.
He also admitted failing to provide breath specimens.
Sheriff William Wood said: "These are very serious matters.
"One of the few things that can be said to be to your advantage was that no-one was hurt. It was at the upper end of recklessness."
