Chris Woakes: Deaths of Matthew Hobden and Tom Allin are 'awful'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Chris Woakes says the task of trying to secure a Test series win in South Africa has been put into perspective by the deaths of two young cricketers in the space of a week.

The body of Woakes' former Warwickshire team-mate Tom Allin, 28, was found by a bridge near Bideford on 4 January.
Two days earlier Sussex bowler Matthew Hobden, 22, died, with police looking into whether he fell off a roof.
"To lose two such young guys in the space of a week is awful," said Woakes.
Police are not treating Allin's death as suspicious.
"Tom's chances at Warwickshire were limited but he was always upbeat and a great guy to have around," added Woakes.
"It is such sad news and puts cricket into perspective."
Woakes and the rest of the England team are set to travel to Johannesburg for the third Test, which starts on 14 January.
England lead the four-match series 1-0 after surviving a last-day scare to draw the second Test in Cape Town.
Woakes played in the first Test win in Durban, only to make way for the return of England's leading wicket-taker James Anderson, who returned to fitness after a calf injury.
"I can't be disappointed with the way I performed in Durban and it is frustrating whenever you are left out," he said.
"But Jimmy has 420 Test wickets and is England's best-ever bowler. You don't mind stepping aside for that and, unless there are any niggles, I would be surprised if there were any changes for the next Test."
