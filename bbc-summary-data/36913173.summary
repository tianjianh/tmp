Brothers Dominic and Jason Usher, along with Greg King, kidnapped the victim in Heanor, Derbyshire, in April 2014.
They put him in a van, bound his legs and hands and threatened to stab him and chop off his toes if he did not give them the keys to his safe.
The trio, along with two others, were jailed for a series of crimes.
Nottinghamshire Police said the men took their victim to a remote farm in Watnall, Nottinghamshire, and left him "shoeless, battered and bruised" with his legs and hands still bound together. He eventually flagged down a passing motorist.
Dominic Usher was involved in a violent robbery in Arnold a few weeks prior to the kidnap, the force added.
Three days later, the brothers set fire to a stolen convertible Mazda used in the robbery.
But enquiries led detectives to the Usher brothers and King over the kidnap.  They also uncovered evidence linking Dominic to the robbery.
Dominic Usher, his girlfriend Grainne Cafferkey and friend Scott Finch then attempted to pay off a key witness in the kidnap case.
Dominic Usher, 29, of Colmon Walk, Nottingham, admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice and was convicted of kidnap, blackmail, robbery and arson after a trial at Stafford Crown Court. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 11-and-a-half years on Wednesday.
Jason Usher, 27, of Willow Hill Close, Nottingham, pleaded guilty to kidnap, blackmail and arson - and was acquitted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
King, 30, of Portland Road, Selston, was jailed for eight years and four months after admitting kidnap and blackmail.
Cafferkey, 24, of Cromwell Street, Nottingham, was sentenced to 44 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Finch, 32, of Durnford Street, Nottingham, was jailed for 16 months after admitting conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Det Ch Insp Paul Myers, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, revealed Dominic Usher's accomplice in the robbery was jailed in July 2014.
He said: "The psychological effects of their ordeals remains with them still."
