Challenge Cup: Salford Red Devils 29-22 Toronto Wolfpack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils beat League 1 side Toronto Wolfpack to reach the last 16 of the Challenge Cup, despite playing most of the match with 12 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Salford winger Justin Carney was sent off for dissent before half-time.
But Greg Johnson crossed twice to help the Super League club to victory against their third-tier opponents.
Debutant Ryan Brierley scored one of Toronto's four tries having joined from Huddersfield in midweek, but their first Challenge Cup campaign is over.
It was the first competitive defeat that the Wolfpack, who have won all five of their League 1 matches in 2017, had suffered.
Kris Welham's try put the hosts in front but Liam Kay and Quentin Laulu-Togagae replied, and Brierley touched down for a debut score in between Johnson's double for Salford.
Michael Dobson and Gareth O'Brien, who also landed a second-half drop-goal, were the home side's other scorers, while Fuifui Moimoi crossed late on for Toronto.
Salford coach Ian Watson: "We knew it was going to be a massive game on the back of a very tough Easter period for us. They came here and had a real dig.
"In the first half they caused us a few problems but we fixed it up in the second half, defensively we were a lot better. Losing Justin didn't help, the boys had to dig a bit harder."
Toronto coach Paul Rowley: "The sending-off probably wasn't a good thing for us. It obviously altered our mind set and we stopped playing in the second half.
"I thought we were really good in the first half, we scored some good tries and had two disallowed but it was a game of two halves and probably the old head of Dobson managed the game better in the second half.
"We are bold and brave in our play and to go away from that is disappointing."
