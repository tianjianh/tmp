[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth theatres in the spotlight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They're national treasures. Not just the actress Sheila Hancock, but the theatre where she began her work in the 1950s - the Kings Theatre in Southsea and the New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth.

Both got a mention from MP Will Quince as he brought the curtain up on a new season of Westminster Hall debates in Parliament.
He argued: "The West End is often the showcase of our best theatre, but it does not exist in a vacuum; it exists because it is fed and sustained by the talent of regional theatres across the country."
Not only did the regional theatre develop new talent like Ms Hancock, he said, but every pound spent made Â£3 for the local economy.
Portsmouth MP Flick Drummond then took her cue to enter the debate, pointing out the financial collaboration needed to restore the Theatre Royal.
"The major extension and refurbishment last year was supported by the Parity Trust, Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Its key partner is the University of Portsmouth, which is now sharing part of the site."
Oxfordshire MP Ed Vaizey, now the minister for culture for a record 10 years, replied for the government, arguing that changes in funding were moving in the right direction.
"There is a lively debate about the amount of funding that goes into London and to other areas outside London," he said.
"It is important to say that when we came into office around 60% of lottery funding went outside London. That has now risen to 70%, and the Arts Council has an ambition to go further to reach 75% by the end of 2018."
The minister welcomed the debate and agreed in principle that regional theatres deserve every penny they get but made no promises that any more money would be forthcoming.
Portsmouth's Flick Drummond also drew attention to the work done behind the scenes. She pointed to a course in pyrotechnics that is part of training for local theatre apprentices.
The debate ended without fireworks, but some bravura performance none the less.
Though Will Quince, the MP who brought the debate, may have offended some of his colleagues with his closing line.
"They do say that politics is showbusiness for ugly people," he concluded. Luckily they didn't have to vote on that.
