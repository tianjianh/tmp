The wife of former prime minister David Cameron has designed a 40-piece collection which will be sold from early next year.
Mrs Cameron said she was inspired to start the label as there were not many British brands that fit the "designer contemporary" bracket.
The brand name is derived from her children's names - Elwen, Florence, Ivan and Nancy.
Items from the fashion range will be priced between Â£100 and Â£300.
The first pictures of the collection will feature in the January issue of British Vogue ahead of its launch for spring/summer 2017. Her sister Emily Sheffield is deputy editor of the magazine.
In an interview with the publication, Mrs Cameron said: "I felt that there was a lot of American and French brands out there that fit that bracket of designer contemporary with the right price point and the right styling, but there aren't that many British brands which fill that space."
She said she resisted the urge to completely design the collection with herself in mind as "that would be pointless", adding: "I've spent a lot of time trying stuff on my friends."
Mrs Cameron became known for her fashion style during her time at Number 10 and previously worked as creative director of luxury brand Smythson, where she still holds a consultancy role.
She also currently serves as an ambassador for the British Fashion Council and is often seen wearing UK brands including Roksanda, Christopher Kane and Erdem.
She said she was launching her own fashion range to "create an urban uniform for busy women" saying she felt there was a gap in the market for a British brand that offered a wardrobe that could take women from day to evening.
Fashion expert Oonagh O'Hagan said Mrs Cameron's style influenced a generation of successful women who were interested in wearing fashionable designs.
"She promoted the idea that you could be taken seriously and still be fashionable," she said.
"You could look cool and sophisticated and you didn't always have to wear black. She had a big impact on the brands she wore. She wasn't a leader but she was a savvy adopter and her doing this label shows that.
"She has seen there is a bit of a gap for women. If you're a successful businesswoman you want to feel like you have an identity, you're individual with a knowledge of fashion but not obsessed.
"I think it's a savvy and clever move."
Mrs Cameron joins a long list of famous names who have launched their own fashion lines which also includes former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham and rapper Kanye West.
Ms O'Hagan, fashion and textile curriculum leader at Central Saint Martins, said a celebrity name does not always guarantee success and launching a fashion label can be an uphill struggle.
She added: "There are so many celebrities that have bombed out. It can be a dangerous ground. That is why Samantha Cameron is interesting because not many people who are famous through politics have done this. It's usually singers and actresses.
"It's really difficult to set up a fashion line. Initially you can start very small but once it becomes popular you have a horrible jump where you have to take on factories across the world to get your production up. That responsibility is stressful.
"That's why many designers have backers and need people to put money into them. You'll probably lose money in the first few years and that's famous people as well. It's not particularly easy."
