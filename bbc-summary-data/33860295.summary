Man 'tries to force girls into car' in Coventry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two attempts by a man to force teenage girls into his car in Coventry have been linked by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers want to trace a "Good Samaritan" who intervened in the second incident in two days, in Longford.
The victims, aged 14 and 16, escaped unharmed after separate attacks on Friday and Saturday evening.
The girls described different cars but police said they were linking the cases because a "very similar method" had been used in approaching them.
The 16-year-old was walking along Lady Lane at about 21:30 BST on Saturday when a silver car pulled up beside her.
A man described as Asian asked her to get into his car - and when she refused he got out and tried to grab her, West Midlands Police said.
A man walking past told the driver to leave the girl alone and police are urging him to come forward as a witness.
It follows a similar attempt on Friday when the 14-year-old was approached by a man who tried to push her towards his blue Vauxhall Corsa on Windmill Road.
Sgt Helen Waite said: "I would like to stress that incidents of this kind are very rare and on both occasions the girls were not hurt."
Anyone with information has been urged to contact officers.
