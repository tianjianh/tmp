Thames Valley Police attended the incident at around 17:50 GMT on 9 February in Copyground Lane.
The man was taken to hospital with knee injuries, but has since been discharged from hospital.
PC Tom Smith urged the driver to come forward.
He said: "The CCTV shows the driver clearly brake sharply and then speed away with no regard for the injured man they leave lying in the road.
