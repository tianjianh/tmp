Bellshill designer's Royal Mint Remembrance Day coin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Royal Mint designer from North Lanarkshire has been selected to design this year's special Remembrance Day coin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Docherty, who is originally from Bellshill, took his inspiration from the wreath that lies at the foot of The Royal Mint's own on-site war memorial.
His Â£5 coin features a full-colour wreath surrounded by the inscription: Their name liveth for evermore.
He is the fourth designer to be chosen to produce a Remembrance Day coin.
What is Remembrance Day?
The coin will be struck at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
Thomas, who has worked at the Royal Mint for 11 years, said: "This wreath is not only personal to us at The Royal Mint but also reflects the 'everyman' we all commemorate on Remembrance Day; from the wreath-layers to the poppy wearers all over the country.
"I wanted to paint the colours of the poppies boldly and vibrantly, hopefully emphasising that the poppy is a symbol of remembrance, but also one of hope for the future."
