Send us your pictures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We're looking for your photographs from around Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
You send them to us and we'll include a selection on the weekly picture gallery published every Friday on the BBC Scotland news website.
They don't have to be related to a news story - they could be a local landmark, a gathering of friends - anything really that depicts life in Scotland.
BBC Scotland weather presenters are also looking for your pictures of weather scenes from around Scotland to use on television.
However, if you send in photographs of children, we must have written permission from a parent or guardian of every child featured (a grandparent, auntie or friend will not suffice).
Email your pictures to scotlandpictures@bbc.co.uk
Please give us your name, where you live and brief details about the pictures.
If you want to send your picture from your mobile phone, email them to the same address as above. You can send them from any network or phone.
If you would like your image to be included in the weekly picture gallery, please make sure it has a landscape photo with a minimum size of 976x549 pixels.
You can also tell us what you think of the week's pictures on the BBC Scotland News facebook page.
If you submit an image, you do so in accordance with the BBC's terms and conditions.
