Brighton Pride: Exhibitions mark 25th event

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two exhibitions have opened in Brighton's Jubilee Library to mark the city's 25th Pride event in its current form.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 1991 Brighton Pride began with four days of protest, film, live music and a picnic in Preston Park.
Dani Ahrens, one of the organisers of the event in 1991, said: "We had been organising an annual march (since 1988) to protest at the passage of Section 28 into law.
"By 1991, we felt that our resistance to this law, and its effects, had built a community that was strong, angry, and full of creativity."
The BrightonPride25 exhibition tells the story of the event's history with photographs and film footage.
Alf Le Flohic said: "BrightonPride25 will highlight the dedicated politicos, performers and party-goers who have made Brighton Pride the unique celebration of love and liberation that it is today."
Kate Wildblood said, "From those early days of Queer On The Pier and days out on The Level, to the park life of Preston Park and campaigning for the Freedom To Live, Brighton Pride has a history worth knowing and a history we should all be proud of."
Also on display at the Jubilee Library is an exhibition entitled "#Outcome".
Portraits by Tom Dingley include people well known in the LGBT community - each holding a photograph taken in their childhood.
Mr Dingley said: "[It gives] a sense of journey into adulthood, leading successful happy lives as out adults."
BrightonPride25 is open at the Jubilee Library until 2 August. #Outcome is at the library until 9 August.
Brighton Pride takes place on 1 and 2 August with a parade through the city ending at Preston Park.
The city's second Trans Pride festival takes place from 25 to 27 July and includes a solidarity march and dance party on Saturday and picnic on the beach on Sunday.
