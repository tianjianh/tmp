Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, of Mildenhall, Suffolk, was brutally assaulted after his team played at Southend United on 21 March.
He suffered a head injury and is critically ill in hospital.
His sister Victoria Forsythe said she and her family were "not in any way upset or angry" at Southend fans.
She said that in fact, they felt "much the opposite" as Southend supporters had "supported us through this tough time and continue to do so".
"As a family, we are hopeful and are holding on to the miracle that Simon will wake up."
The grandfather remains in a medically-induced coma at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
He also sustained a broken hip and broken nose during the attack in the Essex town's East Street.
Police said Mr Dobbin and his friends had left the Blue Boar pub when they were assaulted by a group of men who had come out of another pub.
The fight was broken up by police using CS spray.
Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore said: "He is a decent family man who was simply enjoying a day out.
"It is my intention to identify everyone involved in this sickening attack and bring them to justice."
A fundraising appeal has made nearly Â£10,500 to help Mr Dobbin's family.
Four men, aged 19 to 33 and all from Essex, have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and released on bail.
