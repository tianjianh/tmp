The French midfielder, who spent last season on loan at Saint-Etienne, produced a fine finish from the edge of the penalty area.
His goal took Nice three points clear of Monaco, who won 3-0 at Lorient on Friday, and Paris St-Germain, who beat Nantes 2-0 at home on Saturday.
And it condemned Saint-Etienne to a first home defeat in 10 games.
