Hosein has scored 713 runs in 18 first-class games at an average of 32.4.
The 20-year-old set a club record for most dismissals in a match by a keeper when he took 11 catches in his first-class debut against Surrey in 2014.
"He made some impressive contributions last year when given the opportunity," director of cricket Kim Barnett said.
