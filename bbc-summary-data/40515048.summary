Funding of £4.3m is to be shared between projects aimed at regenerating Scottish coastal communities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money from the Coastal Communities Fund will go towards 18 schemes designed to boost tourism, create jobs and grow the economy.
Among the grants is £300,000 towards 64 miles of coastal paths at the Rhins of Galloway in south west Scotland.
Plans for a visitor information centre and hub at Fort Augustus will benefit from £237,500.
And £258,190 will go to a project to transform the facilities at Discovery Point in Dundee.
Harris Development Ltd has been awarded £300,000 to develop two pontoons for small boats, while the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust will use nearly £200,000 for a network of 25 whale-watching and heritage sites across the west coast.
Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "With more than 10,000 miles of stunning coastline in Scotland, we need to do all we can to protect the marine environment that lives there and to help people living and working in these areas make the most of the economic opportunities on offer.
"This latest investment delivers on our commitment to supporting fishing and coastal communities, and includes a range of exciting projects that will improve paths and facilities and create new opportunities to attract tourists."
