Mark Ronson calls rush release of Uptown Funk ‘a good thing’

Despite rumours to the contrary, Mark Ronson says "it was a good thing" that Uptown Funk was released early following the success of a cover version on The X Factor.

Eventual runner-up on the show, Fleur East, sang the track a month before its scheduled released date.
"I was in America and just saw one of my friends had put on Twitter 'Fleur East doing the Uptown Funk'," he says.
"I was just like, 'Cool she must be covering it, that's interesting'."
"And then everyone was telling me she did this awesome version, and so her version came out and we rushed ours and everything came out for the good."
Mark does question though "why they don't put out records here as soon as they are out, you can hear them".
Uptown Funk went on to win Mark Ronson his first ever UK number one.
His chart reign was short-lived though after X Factor winner Ben Haenow bumped him from getting the Christmas number one with his winner's single, a cover of One Republic's Something I Need.
Showing excellent manners, Ronson says he's not sad to miss out on the festive chart milestone, and instead is "excited to be Christmas number two".
He can console himself with landing a new streaming record instead, as Uptown Funk has the most streams ever of a single in one week, with 2.4 million.
"I know - I kept hitting play," he grins.
Ronson puts the streaming success down to the Christmas party effect, "I went to a Christmas party and I heard it about nine times on Saturday night, by the end I was so embarrassed I left because I assumed people would think that I was putting it on!"
Mark also says it's all "cool" between him and Lily Allen after his friend called X Factor's use of the then-unreleased Uptown Funk, "music industry corruption".
That was because Mark shares a record label with Simon Cowell.
"You know it's cool," he says. "I spoke to Lily and told her it wasn't anything like that.
"It's like you're friends, you want to set the record straight.
"I mean I could see why it maybe looked that way to somebody but that's definitely so far from what happened - they did a cover, we were like, 'Oh cool', and then we put our record out."
