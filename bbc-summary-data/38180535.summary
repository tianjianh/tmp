A spoof news site has released a charity song for Christmas, mocking an infamous river crossing.

Southend News Network's song "Dartford Tolls" has been viewed more than one million times on Facebook and YouTube.
Written by the site's creator, the ditty slams the Essex to Kent crossing's regular traffic jams and "extortionate" toll charges.
Southend News Network's "chief reporter" said the aim was to raise "as much money as possible" for charity.

The anonymous figure said he came up with the idea for a Christmas song after writing another tune earlier in the year called "Sometimes Our Pier's On Fire".
"I always try to base my fake stories around things people are passionate about," the "chief reporter" said.
"On Facebook and Twitter, people go nuts about the crossing - being held up, being charged so much.
"The whole song is based on the premise that the crossing should have been free after a few years. But here we are in 2016 and it costs more to use it than ever before."
The site teamed up with singer Annie Humphrey, who recorded the track, and a swear-word riddled version has so far clocked up 1.2 million hits.
Profits from the "clean" version, which has been released as a download, will be split between the British Heart Foundation and Shelter.
The "chief reporter" said he was "aware it would be a monumental task" to reach the number one spot in the charts.
"We're up against Sir Cliff [Richard] and Sir Terry [Wogan]!" he said.
"Southend News Network was started as a joke blog and I had no idea that it would reach this level.
"At least I have a pop career to fall back on now - hopefully."
