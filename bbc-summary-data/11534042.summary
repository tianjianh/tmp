Statistics reveal Britain's 'Mr and Mrs Average'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A picture of the average man and woman in Britain today has been painted with the release of figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The average British man is 38, will live another 41 years and is educated at least to A-levels.
The figures - released to mark next week's UN World Statistics Day - show the average British woman is two years older and will live to 82.
The ONS's Jil Matheson said stats "form the backbone of democratic debate".
Many of the figures are for the UK as a whole but some, such as weight and height, only relate to England and Wales.
Ms Matheson added: "It is impossible to open a daily newspaper or watch a news broadcast without seeing references to statistics on the economy, health, education or crime.
"Every day in the UK, decisions are made and money invested based on official statistics."
The average man works 39 hours a week and earns Â£28,270 a year. On average, women work less - 34 hours a week - and earn less - Â£22,151.
The ONS said the average man in England was 5ft 9in (175.3cm) tall and weighed 13.16 stone (83.6kg).
The average woman in England weighed 11 stone (70.2kg) and was 5ft 3in tall (161.6cm).
Women living in England or Wales will have an average of 1.96 children during their lifetime, said the ONS.
The ONS also revealed the five grocery items most likely to be in the average shopping basket - a two-pint carton of semi-skimmed milk, a pack of sliced ham, a box of breakfast cereal, some bacon and a bar of milk chocolate.
The average age to get married in England and Wales was 30.8 for men and 28.8 for women but the average age for divorce was 36.9 for men and 40.8 for women.
Consequently the typical man remarried at 45.9, compared with 43.1 for women.
The ONS analysis also suggests it is women who need to do more exercise.
Only 29% of women do the recommended amount of exercise, compared with 39% of men.
