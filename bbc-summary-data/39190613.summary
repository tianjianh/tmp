[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who stalked his ex-girlfriend just weeks after police handed him a restraining order has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Munro, 45, from Aberkenfig, Bridgend, denied stalking his former partner but was found guilty after a trial at Swansea Crown Court.
The court heard he was "besotted" with her, approaching her outside her home and at a park while she walked her dog between January and May of last year.
Munro was jailed for 18 months on Tuesday.
The court was told he was a successful businessman who owned a taxi firm and a minibus company which operates a Â£20,000-a-month school transport contract around Bridgend.
The jury heard he had been jailed for eight days over Christmas 2015 after she ended their four-year relationship the previous June.
He was later given a suspended sentence and a restraining order with instructions not to contact his ex after pleading guilty to harassing her.
But within the same month he continued his stalking.
Judge Daniel Hale said: "You're a man in your 40s. Not some lovelorn teenager.
"She clearly wanted to lead an independent life. But you were besotted with her.
"There was no violence but it must have been unpleasant."
Munro also had his restraining order extended to include streets near her home and was ordered to pay a Â£150 victim surcharge.
