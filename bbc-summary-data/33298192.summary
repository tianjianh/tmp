Nuplace, owned by Telford and Wrekin Council, is being officially launched later.
It plans to build and manage more than 400 homes for the private rental market, using brownfield sites owned by the council.
Work will begin on Monday, with 130 homes being built in Madeley and Randlay.
Of these, 101 properties will be on the site of Madeley's former Woodlands Primary School.
Other schemes, many on a smaller scale, are planned for Malinslee, Madeley Court, Wildwood, Woodside and Newport.
The authority said the 400 homes would be rented out to private tenants, with any profits used to offset council cuts.
It said the plans would also help to meet the area's housing targets, encourage inward investment and create jobs.
Councillor Shaun Davies said the properties would provide an important income stream that would "contribute to funding frontline services".
The local authority also owns a solar farm, which it said earlier this month was on course to make a Â£150,000 profit by the end of the year.
The 15,000-panel site at Wheat Leasows, expected to generate enough electricity for 800 homes, was switched on six months ago.
