Through teenagers' eyes - unique snapshots of Syrian refugee life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Their homes are dusty refugee tents - and life is hard. Using cameras on smartphones - and with the support of Save the Children and professional photographer Michael Christopher Brown - Syrian teenagers have created unique portraits of conditions inside the Zaatari camp in neighbouring Jordan.

Over the course of a week, the girls and boys aged 14 to 18 were taught photographic techniques, and then asked to capture images of their daily reality. The iPhone files were then converted into distinctive square Instagram images.
Take a look at some of their results here - and hear from three of the teenagers - Khaled, Samar and Omar - plus photographer Michael Christopher Brown:
