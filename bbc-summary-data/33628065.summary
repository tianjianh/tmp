Nama deal: 'No response' from Irish government to NI inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stormont's finance committee has said it is "disappointed" that the Irish finance minister has not replied to its request for Nama officials to appear before its inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee is intending to investigate the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.
Its chairman Daithí McKay said they had written to Michael Noonan asking him to ensure Nama appeared at the inquiry.
However, they said Mr Noonan has so far not responded.
Mr McKay said: "Nama have a responsibility to come before the committee to answer questions and it is disappointing that Michael Noonan has so far not responded.
"Officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) will attend the committee inquiry tomorrow [Thursday] and I look forward to their contribution.
"The finance committee and the wider public are entitled to access the truth about the sale of the Nama assets."
The committee postponed its first hearing of the inquiry last week, but is due to meet again on Thursday.
Mr McKay had said they wanted to ensure they did not prejudice a police investigation or any potential criminal trial.
The National Crime Agency is leading the criminal inquiry into the Nama loan sale controversy and is concerned its investigation could be undermined.
The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) is the Republic of Ireland's "bad bank", set up to deal with toxic loans during the Irish banking crisis.
Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than £1bn last year.
An Irish politician, Mick Wallace, has alleged that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a Northern Ireland politician in the wake of the deal.
Mr Wallace told the Irish parliament the money had been moved for that purpose to an Isle of Man bank account controlled by the Belfast solicitor Ian Coulter.
Mr Coulter is the former managing partner of Tughans solicitors in Belfast and worked on behalf of the buyers in the Nama deal.
He said he had directed that money be transferred to the Isle of Man account for "a complex, commercially and legally-sensitive" reason.
He said that no politician, nor any relative of any politician, was ever to receive any money.
The money moved to the Isle of Man was later retrieved, though Mr Coulter and and his former partners at Tughans remain at odds on the circumstances of that transaction.
BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme has established the Isle of Man account was intended to facilitate payments to non-lawyers or deal fixers.
All those involved in the deal deny any wrongdoing.
