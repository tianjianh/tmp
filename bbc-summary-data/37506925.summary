Jonathan Teplitzky, director of that film and 2013's The Railway Man, is attached to direct the $13m (Â£10m) project, according to Screen Daily.
Weston, a former Welsh Guard, suffered horrific burn injuries when the Sir Galahad ship came under fire in 1982.
The 55-year-old was made a CBE for his charity work last year.
Salon Pictures, the company behind the project, previously produced a 2015 documentary about footballer Paul Gascoigne.
Churchill, to be released next year, stars Brian Cox as the famous leader and Miranda Richardson as his wife Clemmie.
Shooting on the as-yet-untitled film is reportedly due to begin in Wales in spring 2017.
A spokesman for Weston confirmed to the BBC that a film about his life was in the works.
