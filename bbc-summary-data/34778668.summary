A police and crime commissioner has said the Welsh government's attitude to the role has "made life difficult".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Johnston said the government had not accepted PCCs and often dealt with the chief constable on matters which should have been referred to him.
But PCC Alun Michael said the Welsh government had been "very supportive".
A spokesman for the public services minister said the government had worked well with PCCs but believed there were "better models of police governance".
It is three years this weekend since PCCs were first elected, with a turnout of almost 15% across Wales.
Independents Ian Johnston and Winston Roddick were elected in the Gwent and North Wales police areas respectively, Labour's Alun Michael in South Wales, and Conservative Christopher Salmon in Dyfed-Powys.
Mr Johnston said Labour's attitude to PCCs was "not helpful".
"It's a really difficult job if the ministers aren't engaging with you and are still engaging with chief constables," he added.
Mr Michael said: "Some organisations are muddled over the responsibilities of chief constables and PCCs but the Welsh government has been very supportive.
"I'm very satisfied with the co-operation we've had from the Welsh government.
The Welsh government said it worked closely with police and had developed a productive working relationships with commissioners.
The role of PCCs is to set police budgets and appoint chief constables. It was created to make policing more accountable to the public.
The second round of elections for the posts will happen on the same day as the assembly election next May.
Labour opposed their creation but in September the shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the party now accepts they are "part of the policing landscape".
