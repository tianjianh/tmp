Scotland's Intercontinental Cup match against Hong Kong has been abandoned due to heavy rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Play in Hong Kong was washed out for all four days of match without a ball being bowled.
Hong Kong are currently fourth in the table, seven points above Scotland, who are searching for their first win in the tournament after a draw and a loss.
Scotland drew at home with Afghanistan in rain-hit Stirling last June before losing in the Netherlands in September.
Scotland are scheduled to play one-day internationals on 26 and 28 January, followed by two Twenty20 internationals on 30 and 31 January in the build-up to the ICC World Twenty20 in India, which begins on 8 March.
Meanwhile, spinner Con de Lange has returned home from the tour following the birth of his second child.
Scotland squad: Preston Mommsen (capt), Alasdair Evans, Bradley Wheal, Calum MacLeod, Con de Lange, George Munsey, Josh Davey, Kyle Coetzer, Mark Watt, Matt Machan, Matthew Cross, Michael Leask, Richie Berrington, Rob Taylor, Safyaan Sharif.
