Patrick Quigg and Fergal Higgins hit Derry's goals in the first half as the sides went in level at 2-6 to 0-12 at the interval.
However, skipper Sean O'Shea's goal early in the second half put the Kingdom in control.
Kerry outscored Derry 1-12 to 0-4 in the second half as they dominated.
It was all very different at the start at Croke Park as points from Patrick Coney, Caolan Devlin and Seamus Higgins helped Derry take a 0-3 to 0-1 lead.
Quigg's goal enabled Derry to maintain the advantage but Kerry then took control to move five ahead before Higgins' goal helped the Oak Leafers draw level by the break.
But the second half was one-way traffic as Kerry set up a semi-final meeting with either Mayo or Kildare who meet on Monday afternoon in Tullamore.
