Bolton Wanderers: Ownership decision could be made before QPR game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers could make a decision on new ownership before Saturday's home game against Queens Park Rangers, BBC Radio Manchester understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood that three parties are interested in buying Wanderers from current owner Eddie Davies.
Banker Roger Tamraz, Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust and a consortium led by Dean Holdsworth are in the running.
The Championship club are scheduled to appear in the High Court on Monday over an unpaid tax bill of around £3m.
Bolton could face the threat of a winding-up order from Revenue & Customs if they fail to pay their tax bill, but avoided an immediate order in January before their case was adjourned until 22 February.
The Trotters are £172.9m in debt and currently under a transfer embargo for breaching Financial Fair Play rules.
