A five-year project to improve Scotland's mountains has received £3.28m from The Heritage Lottery Fund.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It takes the total to £6.1m when combined with contributions from several national park authorities.
The scheme, entitled Scotland's National Parks - The Mountains and The People, also provides training opportunities for young people.
The project brings together Scotland's two national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs.
Cairngorms Outdoor Access Trust (Coat), Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland have also contributed in funding.
Environment minister Dr Aileen McLeod said: "This is a great example of Scotland's environment agencies coming together to make a real difference to the people and landscape of Scotland."
In total, 23 mountains in Loch Lomond and The Trossachs will benefit from the funding, including Ben Lomond and The Cobbler, while in the Cairngorms, paths which have been eroded by climbers on Beinn A Ghlo will be repaired.
Vocational training courses, aimed at equipping young people with skills to help them into employment, will also be offered and conservation and education programmes will be available for schools, colleges and universities.
Dougie Baird, chief executive of Coat, said: "Mountains in Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are so important for nature and as places people can escape the hustle and bustle of modern life.
"The HLF funding means we can now get started and with all partners help protect the Scottish landscape for millions of people to enjoy."
Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund, said: "Scotland's national parks encompass some of the country's most iconic landscapes and are vital for their contribution to tourism as well as for the health and social benefits of the millions of people that enjoy them."
