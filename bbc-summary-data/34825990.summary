Men sprayed with 'noxious substance' in Stamford Hill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been sprayed in the face with what police describe as a "noxious substance" in north London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 57-year-old was taken to hospital with minor injuries following the attack in Rostrevor Avenue Stamford Hill, on Saturday night.
Another man was also attacked but he has not come forward to police.
Stamford Hill has a large Jewish community but a Metropolitan Police spokesman said the assault was not being treated as anti-Semitic.
