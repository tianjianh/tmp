Large parts of Scotland have had dry and sunny weather over the past few days.
Some of the best spells of sunshine on Thursday were experienced in Aberdeenshire, Moray and also the Highlands.
However, the dry conditions have resulted in firefighters having to deal with a wildfire near Mousavord Loch at Sandness in Shetland.
