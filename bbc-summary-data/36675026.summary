The 27-year-old former South Africa Under-20 international is the 11th new signing the Falcons have made ahead of the upcoming Premiership season.
Cooper is expected to join up with the squad in August for pre-season.
"We are delighted to have tied up a deal for Kyle, who has vast experience at a high level," said director of rugby Dean Richards.
"He is a quality player and his arrival gives us significant competition for places at hooker along with the likes of Scott Lawson, Ben Sowrey, Santiago Socino and David Nelson."
Cooper added: "I love the physical game that Newcastle play. Since I was a boy I have admired the physical style of the Premiership and I will enjoy being a part of a competition I have always loved watching."
