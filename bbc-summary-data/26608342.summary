Volunteer plea to keep Prestatyn's Scala arts centre open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Volunteers are being asked to play a big part in keeping a community cinema and arts centre open in Denbighshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three out of the four full-time members of staff at the Scala in Prestatyn have been made redundant to cut costs.
Denbighshire County Council which part-funds the complex had warned that the operation had to be more cost-effective if its subsidy was to continue.
Chairman Rhiannon Hughes said the job losses were regrettable but they had been left with little option.
A meeting is being held at the Scala on Tuesday at 15:00 GMT in an appeal for volunteers, but Ms Hughes stressed that volunteers would not be expected to directly replace redundant staff.
"There are various roles to be filled, and volunteers can play a big part in making visiting the Scala an enjoyable experience," she said.
The front-of-house service will not operate in the mornings due to the cuts.
