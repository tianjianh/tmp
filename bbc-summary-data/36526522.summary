[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A photograph of Daniel Warlow, 24, throwing a chair ahead of England's game against Russia on Saturday was shown at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.
Warlow, of Spring Meadow, Tipton, will not be able to travel to any Birmingham City or England games in the UK.
District Judge Shamim Qureshi said what happened was "quite disgraceful".
He said Warlow, who must also surrender his passport ahead of international tournaments, can expect to be "vilified" for his actions.
The court also heard he had been present on nine previous occasions when there had been disorder involving Birmingham City fans, although he had never been charged with any offence.
Mr Qureshi commended PC Colin Barlow from the West Midlands football unit, who identified Warlow from a picture published on a British news website.
He was arrested at his home in Tipton and admitted to officers the picture was of him.
Mr Qureshi added that if he been arrested in France, Warlow would have been jailed for up to three months, and still have been given a banning order in Britain.
He also urged the public to help the police identify anyone else involved in the violence at the football championships in France.
After the hearing Warlow's solicitors, Football Law Associates, said arguing against the police's bid for a banning order "would be highly prejudicial" to him.
It said: "[Not contesting the application] does not amount to an agreement that the contents are true and many allegations within the application are disputed."
