Stephen Fry is to host the Baftas again, despite quitting Twitter after his quip at this year's event about costume design winner Jenny Beavan.

The comic came under fire after joking she was dressed like a "bag lady" at February's ceremony.
Following the criticism, he tweeted that she was a "dear friend" who had got the joke.
The Baftas take place on 12 February 2017 at a new venue for the event, the Royal Albert Hall.
It will be the twelfth time Fry has hosted the UK's biggest film ceremony, which has previously been held at London's Royal Opera House.
Fry said he has not "slammed the door" on Twitter after last year's incident, but said the site had become a "stalking ground for the sanctimoniously self-righteous".
Beavan, who won the Bafta for best costume design for Mad Max: Fury Road, came on to the stage in February wearing a black leather jacket, white t-shirt and dark trousers.
Following her acceptance speech and once she had left the stage, Fry said: "Only one of the great cinematic costume designers would come to the awards dressed like a bag lady."
But he posted a picture of the pair at a party later that night to show his comment had not been taken badly.
Next year's ceremony will feature Cirque de Soleil, which will be in residence at the Royal Albert Hall at the time of the awards.
Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said: "I am thrilled we have the opportunity to work with Cirque du Soleil during its season at the Royal Albert Hall, and have no doubt that next year's ceremony will be all the more magical for this creative collaboration."
Nominations for the Baftas will be announced on 10 January.
