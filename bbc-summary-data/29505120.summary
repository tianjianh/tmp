It's claimed a fourth batch of naked celebrity photos has been released.

According to the Daily Beast, the pictures include the first male victim, Hulk Hogan's son Nick.
Others targeted apparently include actress Winona Ryder, 90210's AnnaLynne McCord, a fully-clothed Nina Dobrev from The Vampire Diaries and Victoria's Secret model Erin Heatherton.
Google removed "tens of thousands" of nude pictures last week which had been stolen from celebrities.
Hollywood entertainment lawyer Marty Singer, who is representing over a dozen celebrities whose iCloud accounts were affected in August, has threatened to sue Google for "violating privacy".
A statement said the tech giant had deleted photos "within hours" of requests being made and had "closed hundreds of accounts".
Other stars targeted previously include Cara Delevingne, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Jennifer Lawrence.
The latest photos have been uploaded to photo-sharing blog 4chan.
The first celebrity photos were released by hackers at the beginning of September.
Two more waves of nude pictures, called the Fappening, were then uploaded weeks later.
It's claimed hackers managed to break into celebrities' iCloud accounts, but Apple has denied any form of security breach, suggesting "brute force" attacks on accounts with "weak" passwords were to blame.
The company says accounts were "compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions".
The term is a mixture of two words, "the happening", as in what's going on, and "fapping", a slang for a sexual act.
Fappening has become the term for when a hacker accesses nude photos of celebrities and leaks them in exchange for Bitcoins.
