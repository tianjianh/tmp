Clayton Williams, 19, has been found guilty of the manslaughter of the 34-year-old officer, but cleared of his murder.
PC Phillips had been laying a tyre-punching "stinger" device in Wallasey, Wirral, as he attempted to end the chase.
Williams ran him over in the stolen pick-up truck he was driving.
Footage released by Merseyside Police shows Williams reaching speeds of more than 70mph before the collision.
Moments before the impact, PC Phillips can be seen laying the stinger.
