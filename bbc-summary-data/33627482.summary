Waistcoat tribute to Wickerman founder Jamie Gilroy

For more than a decade thousands of music fans have flocked to a rural corner of Scotland for one weekend every July.

They travel to The Wickerman Festival, famous for an eclectic line up of musicians and its annual Saturday night climax - the torching of a wicker effigy.
To regulars at the festival in Dundrennan in Dumfries and Galloway, its co-founder Jamie Gilroy was also a very visible presence.
Dressed in a trademark waistcoat, the farmer-turned-festival organiser was a jovial and ever-amiable host to his 15,000 guests.
When he died tragically following a firearm incident at his farm last year, there were fears that the festival could not continue.
This year's Wickerman, headlined by The Waterboys, Lulu, Example and Tom Odell, will be the first since his death.
When the time came to make a decision about the future of the event, his daughter Jennie Camm said the family were very "level-headed" about it.
"When everything was in front of us, the decision was really very clear," she said.
"We had to go forward with it for lots and lots of reasons, particularly because of Dad and it was such an important part of his life, but also because the Wickerman is such an important part of lots of other people's lives."
She added: "At no stage have I questioned the decision to go forward. It's been absolutely the right decision. I'm glad we made it."
The decision was further complicated by Jennie's health - in August last year she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
By her own admission, the last 12 months have been "challenging".
"Certainly the diagnosis of cancer was a huge shock and when you think that's as bad as it's going to get, it gets worse," she said.
"So it teaches you to appreciate how lucky you are.
"I miss Dad every day. Mostly at the moment because he knows where everything is and he's done it for so long it's just second nature."
In a nod to her late father, Jennie has ensured that this year's wicker "gate man" will wear a waistcoat and she has invited festival goers to wear something similar in his memory.
Waistcoats were a "massive" part of his character, she said.
"We hope that by doing that a little bit of Dad will be present all over the site at all times.
"And I know it would make him smile because it's not down-hearted, it's done very much with a smile on our faces and that's absolutely appropriate and I am absolutely certain he would approve of that."
Following her cancer diagnosis, Jennie is also hoping to use the festival to raise funds for and awareness of Maggie's Centres. She received support from staff at the Edinburgh centre while she underwent radiotherapy at the Western General.
She has introduced a new section to the festival - the Pianoman Tent - which will house a dedicated Maggie's team offering practical, emotional and social support to anyone affected by cancer.
It will also host a special acoustic performance by Lulu and, after dusk, it will transform into a lively piano bar.
Jennie said Maggie's offered her a "huge amount of support".
"I think if I can offer just a little bit to one person at the festival then I will feel a huge amount of satisfaction. If I can do more than that, then that would be fantastic."
It is shaping up to be another successful Wickerman for the family at East Kirkcarswell Farm. Is Jamie watching over them?
"Well he better sort the weather," Jennie said.
"But I think he might be. I hope he is and if he is, I think he'll be very proud."
