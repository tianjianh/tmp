[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland celebrated reaching Women's the Euro 2017 finals by ending their qualifying campaign with an impressive win away to group winners Iceland.

The hosts had trounced the Scots 4-0 in the reverse fixture, but a repeat never looked likely as Jane Ross headed home Emma Mitchell's cross for the opener.
Fanndis Fridriksdottir's miscued effort crept past Gemma Fay for the equaliser.
But Caroline Weir hit the post before Ross converted a penalty for her second after Lisa Evans was felled in the box.
It was Ross' 10th of the campaign and her 46th for Scotland in her 95th international.
The win drew Scotland level on 21 points with Iceland, who finished top of Group 1 courtesy of their better head-to-head record.
It was a victory the Scots merited against their higher-ranked opponents and one that should give them even greater confidence going into the tournament in the Netherlands next summer.
Coach Anna Signeul had spoken of the need for her players to show they could compete with more physical teams like Iceland - and they more than matched their opponents in Reykjavik in terms of physicality and technical ability.
Iceland had not conceded a goal in their previous seven qualifiers but any thoughts of finishing the campaign with an unblemished record ended when Mitchell's pin-point cross from the left saw Ross head past Gudbjorg Gunnarsdottir.
The Scots were playing with a poise and authority that may have been the result of already being assured of qualification.
But they were caught out just before the break when Fridriksdottir stole into the box and though she sliced her attempted cut-back, the ball spun past Fay and, despite Mitchell's attempts to clear, crossed the line.
Scotland were unfazed by that setback or the noisy home support and almost took the lead again a minute into the second half when Weir cracked a 25-yard shot against the base of the post.
But the second goal arrived in the 56th minute when Evans exchanged passes with Ross and was then tripped by Sara Bjork Gunnarsdottir.
Ross showed why she is Scotland's leading scorer in qualifying with a confident spot-kick, sending Gunnarsdottir the wrong way.
The win might have been even more emphatic if Evans had not clipped the bar after rounding the keeper.
Scotland came under considerable pressure in the closing quarter of the match but Fay was never seriously troubled as the visitors rounded off their successful campaign in style.
