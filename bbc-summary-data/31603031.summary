The 22-year-old former Wales Under-20 international made his Dragons debut at 17, making him the youngest player to ever represent the region.
He will fill the gap left by Micky Young and Peter Stringer, who will leave the club in the summer.
Evans will compete for a place in Bath's side with Chris Cook, Will Homer and new arrival Niko Matawalu.
"Having known Jonny since he was a youngster and seen his development for myself, I know he'll fit right in here," said Bath coach Darren Edwards, who worked with Evans at Dragons and with Wales U20s.
"He brings a spark to the game and he's very much at an exciting stage of his career. He's joining a club that has a fantastic forward pack and he'll thrive on playing off such a strong platform."
