Pauline Cafferkey, 40, was taken to the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital under police escort on Thursday morning after becoming unwell.
She is in a stable condition and medics say there is no danger to the public.
This is the fourth time Ms Cafferkey has been in hospital since returning to the UK from Sierra Leone two years ago.
On Thursday, NHS Greater Glasgow said: "Pauline Cafferkey was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital this morning under the care of the Infectious Diseases Unit.
"Due to Ms Cafferkey's past medical history, appropriate precautionary measures were taken whilst further investigations were carried out.
"We are pleased to report that tests for the Ebola virus are negative. She remains in a stable condition in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. We want to repeat our previous reassurance that there is no risk to the public."
On Friday, the health board said it did not plan to issue any further updates on Ms Cafferkey's condition as she did not have Ebola, there was no public risk and they must respect her confidentiality as a patient.
Ms Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working as part of a UK team at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.
She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free hospital in London at the beginning of 2015 after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.
Ms Cafferkey was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, and in March 2015 returned to work as a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.
But it was later discovered that the virus was still present in her body, and she was readmitted to the same London hospital in October 2015.
She again recovered, before being treated at the Royal Free for a third time in February of this year due to a further complication related to her initial Ebola infection.
More recently, the nurse faced a number of misconduct charges by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).
These were for allegedly allowing a wrong temperature to be recorded during the screening process at Heathrow on her arrival back in the UK from Sierra Leone in 2014.
The NMC's conduct and competence panel dismissed all charges at a hearing in Edinburgh last month after being told that Ms Cafferkey's judgement had been impaired by illness.
