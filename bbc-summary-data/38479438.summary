Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran says he is "letting the supporters down" as his side languish at the bottom of the Premiership.

Caley Thistle fell to a 3-2 defeat away to Highland rivals Ross County, leaving them without a win in 10 matches.
"I'm letting supporters down, I'm letting the board down, I'm letting the chairman down at the moment," Foran told BBC Scotland.
"But, believe me, I feel it. That will change."
He added: "We'll get better, I'll get better, my team will get better in 2017 with a little bit of help, some players coming in."
Liam Boyce scored twice for Ross County either side of Carl Tremarco's diving header.
Martin Woods put County 3-1 up on the hour mark before Alex Fisher's close-range finish set-up a frenetic finale.
"Today's probably the first time we looked a bit nervy, a bit low on confidence from our goalkeeper to our striker," said Foran. "All over the park, I thought we looked a bit low on confidence.
"When you're like that, you're also low on energy. I thought County had a wee bit more energy around the park than us, a bit more fight, a bit more grit, which is disappointing from our point of view.
"This break is coming at the right time now. These lads need to get away, get their minds refreshed.
"For me starting in management in 2016, it's been a poor half of the season from my point of view, from me and also from the players. We need to get ourselves refreshed, come back ready to go again.
"We're only six points out of the top six, which is our aim. We believe we'll still get there. We need to come back better in 2017 than we were in 2016."
County end the year in sixth place, leapfrogging Partick Thistle, and manager Jim McIntyre was happy to get his first home win over Inverness.
"It's really pleasing to get the monkey off our back that we've not beaten Inverness at home since we arrived here," said McIntyre. "I'm delighted for the players - I thought they put in a fabulous effort.
"I thought it was a keenly contested derby. Inverness had a lot of the game as well, but I think our chances were better than theirs and we deserved to win.
"Our home record has not been good enough. We've had several good performances and not picked up enough points. I can't dress that up.
"It was so important we nailed that result today. Going into the break, it just makes it a happier three weeks."
