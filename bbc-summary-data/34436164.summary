One machine was pulled from the wall on Mill Street in Gamlingay near St Neots, Cambridgeshire, at about 01:45 BST on Saturday morning.
About two hours later, a machine six miles away at Morrisons in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, was hit.
Police said the thieves left empty-handed and abandoned vehicles at both crime scenes.
John Mercer, who lives on Mill Street, said: "We were woken by the noise and looked out to see an agricultural vehicle pulling the machine out of the wall, which took about two minutes.
"We called the police, but while we were doing so a Bedfordshire Police car arrived and the thieves sped off in a car empty-handed and they left behind the agricultural vehicle and a loader."
Officers have also recovered a stolen vehicle which was used at the Morrisons raid in Market Square.
Meanwhile, Hertfordshire Police said a cash machine was removed from the outside wall of the Co-op on High Street in Stanstead Abbots near Hertford at about 03:00 BST on Sunday morning.
A number of people who lived above the shop were evacuated from the building amid concerns about its structural safety.
The cash machine was left behind, but it was unclear if any money had been removed.
A Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman said: "We are aware of incidents elsewhere in the region and are linking in with colleagues from other forces as part of our inquiries."
