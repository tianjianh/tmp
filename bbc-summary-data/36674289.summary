[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Attou, 21, was charged for driving fellow suspect Salah Abdeslam back to Brussels from Paris on the night of the attacks, when 130 people were killed.
Hamza Attou had opposed extradition to France but Belgium handed him over on Wednesday, prosecutors said.
Belgium transferred Salah Abdeslam to French police in April.
Prosecutors say another suspect, Mohamed Amri, was with Hamza Attou in the car that picked up Salah Abdeslam on 13 November. Mr Amri is still in Belgian custody. The three were caught by CCTV cameras at a French petrol station on 14 November.
So-called Islamic State said it carried out the Paris bombings and shootings on 13 November, which were at least partly planned in Brussels. Hundreds were also wounded in the attacks.
Belgium is preparing to hand over Mohamed Bakkali to France - another suspect held for his alleged role in the November Paris attacks. But Belgium has set the condition that he must serve any prison sentence in Belgium.
France also wants to question Mohamed Amri and a third suspect in Belgian custody - Ali Oulkadi.
