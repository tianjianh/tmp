Sir Cliff Richard is due to sing at the Mass at St Mary's RC Church in Woolton.
TV stars Paul O'Grady, Jimmy Tarbuck and Christopher Biggins will join her sons Robert and Ben in giving readings.
Her family have asked fans to line a two-mile stretch of the funeral cortege route along Woolton Road but not gather outside the church itself.
The funeral begins at 13:00 BST.
The funeral cortege will start at the junction of Woolton Road and Church Road North, and will travel to the junction with Blackwood Avenue before continuing to the church.
The family said the public would not be able to access the church grounds and asked people not to travel to Woolton village as "as this may compromise the funeral party and invited guests from attending".
The church is where Black and husband Bobby Willis had their marriage blessed in 1969, following a register office wedding earlier that year.
The singer and TV star died after suffering a stroke earlier this month at the age of 72.
After a hymn and greeting by the Right Reverend Thomas Williams, Auxiliary Bishop of Liverpool, Sir Cliff will deliver opening words and perform the song Faithful One.
Her son Robert Willis will read Henry Scott-Holland's poem Death Is Nothing At All, while Ben Willis will read a passage by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.
Black's hit Anyone Who Had A Heart will play during Holy Communion, while The Long And Winding Road by her friends The Beatles has been chosen as the recessional music.
Biggins will deliver a Bible reading from the Book of Wisdom, Tarbuck will read the Prayers of the Faithful and O'Grady will give a closing tribute.
Black grew up in Liverpool and found fame on stage after singing in clubs including the famous Cavern in the early 1960s.
She went on to become a TV favourite, hosting the hit Saturday night shows Blind Date and Surprise Surprise from the mid-1980s to early 2000s.
Fans have been asked to make donations in her name to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity. An online donation page has been set up.
After the service, Black's body will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in Allerton Cemetery, where her parents are buried.
Black died of a stroke after falling over at her Spanish home on 1 August.
An album of the star's greatest hits re-entered the UK top 40 after her death, and is continuing to climb the chart.
It is likely to be in the top three when the next chart is announced on Friday, according to the Official Chart Company, and could be number one.
