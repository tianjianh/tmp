The Welsh county's One-Day Cup match against Hampshire on Sunday was abandoned following concerns about the "dangerous pitch" at Cardiff's Swalec Stadium.
The decision was taken after Hampshire batsman Jimmy Adams was hit by a rising delivery, after Michael Carberry had also been struck.
Morris confirms that the ECB has interviewed the umpires, both captains and coaches, as well as Glamorgan head groundsman Keith Exton.
Glamorgan are also conducting their own investigation and will be refunding admission costs to any spectator wishing to be reimbursed.
