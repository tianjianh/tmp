Phillips, 27, led home a British one-two in the elite men's event ahead of team-mate Kyle Evans.
"I can't stress how hard that was," said Phillips, who skipped the opening World Cup event of the season in Argentina last month.
"It was by far most challenging day of racing I've had in a very long time."
The 2013 world champion burst from the start-gate to lead from the front and pip 22-year-old Evans, who earned his best ever World Cup result.
Phillips recently made headlines after speaking out about the Rio 2016 Olympic BMX course because of the safety risk to riders.
He became the figurehead for a movement among the world's elite riders, who refused to compete in a test event at the course in October 2015.
In the women's competition in Manchester, Bethany Shriever, 16, reached the semi-finals on her debut at this level.
Shriever finished in fifth place in her semi, just missing out on the final.

The British team has only secured two BMX places - one male and one female - at an Olympics since the sport made its debut at Beijing 2008.
They should again seal one female qualification place, but will attain the maximum three male spots if they rank inside the top four at the end of the Olympic qualification period in May.
