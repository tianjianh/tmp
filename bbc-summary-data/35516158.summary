[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Supermarket chain Tesco has said it will brush up on its spelling and grammar after making two mistakes in a single pack of baby clothes.

The parents of three-month-old Alexander Kendall, from Norwich, spotted the errors after being given a set of five bodysuits from the store.
One bore the slogan "I was born awsome", while the other read: "Daddys little man" - missing an apostrophe.
Tesco apologised after Alexander's father shared the errors on Twitter.
It offered a refund or exchange and said: "Sorry about this, we've made our suppliers aware of this so it can be corrected for future stock."
Mother Sophie Kendall, 28, said: "We both work as journalists so are perhaps a bit more pedantic about these things than most.
"Fortunately Alex is a long way off being able to read so we'll just use the suits and hope nobody notices."
