The water pipes in the town are old and prone to leaks and bursts, Severn Trent Water said.
Part of Milford Road is expected to be closed until the summer as a metal water pipe is replaced. Diversions will be in place.
The road is "just too narrow" in parts to be kept open as large machinery will be used, a spokesman said.
More than 12 miles (20km) of new water pipes are being laid from the Shugborough area into Stafford town centre.
In the first phase, which began in September, pipes were installed on Tixall Road for a new housing development nearby.
