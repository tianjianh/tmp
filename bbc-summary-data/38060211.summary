[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 2-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone ended a four-game losing streak by beating Eastleigh in the National League at the Gallagher Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dan Sweeney got the hosts off to the perfect start after curling a shot past Scott Brown to put the Stones in front inside the first five minutes.
Jamie Cureton almost equalised moments later for Eastleigh when he burst through on goal but could only blast his effort into the side-netting, in a first half with few chances.
But the Spitfires did level four minutes after the restart through Mikael Mandron's spot-kick although, 10 minutes later, Maidstone earned a penalty of their own, which Bobby-Joe Taylor converted to seal all three points.
