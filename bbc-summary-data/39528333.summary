Catalans Dragons full-back Tony Gigot has had a two-year suspension by the French Rugby League Federation doping department reduced to three months, meaning he can return to match action.

Gigot, 26, tested negative but was banned in February after an "inappropriate exchange" with an anti-doping officer in October.
Les Dracs have registered the France international in their 25-man squad and he could feature at Leigh on Friday.
He scored 12 tries in 30 games in 2016.
"We are stunned by this sanction," Dragons chief executive Christophe Jouffret said at the time of the ban.
The club's statement said that the procedure was carried out "in the presence of several witnesses who were able to confirm the good behaviour of our player".
