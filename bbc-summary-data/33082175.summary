More than 100 officers were involved in the search and arrest operations which took place in Dublin, Cork and Wexford.
A Garda (police) spokesman said the arrests were the result of a six-month investigation targeting crime gangs.
Within the last 48 hours, the suspects have been charged with a total of more than 200 drug offences.
Several Garda units, along with police dogs, searched more than 50 homes.
The Dublin arrests took place in the south inner city, where 26 men were detained by police targeting "an organised drug distribution network operating in this area".
All 26 suspects are due to appear at Dublin District Court on Thursday.
In Cork, 16 men and 9 women were arrested in a operation focused on the supply of heroin to the city.
They are due before Cork District Court on Wednesday.
In Wexford town, seven men and two women were also arrested in connection with heroin supply.
They are all aged between 22 to 61 and are due to appear at Wexford District Cork next week.
Ch Supt Michael O Sullivan, from the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, said: "These operations reflect the commitment of An Garda Síochána to tackling the sale and supply of drugs at all levels in our society.
"We thank those people who raised concerns regarding the sale of drugs in their local community and for their patience in allowing us the time to go about our investigation, which was methodical and thorough.
"The scourge of drugs in local communities can only be combated with local community support. An Garda Síochána will continue to play our part as is shown by this operation," he added.
