Police were called to a fight involving about 20 rival supporters in McLeod Street, near the Tynecastle stadium, on Saturday 16 January.
A 53-year-old man and two 16-year-old boys have been arrested.
They were released on bail to appear in court at a later date and were ordered not to attend any football matches.
Insp Emma Croft, of Police Scotland, said: "As part of our ongoing commitment to tackle fan disorder Police Scotland has been working closely with Hearts FC to identify and address a group of individuals who bring disorder and criminality to the doors of what is a family-friendly club.
"These arrests clearly send out the message that such behaviour will not be tolerated and we will work tirelessly to trace those involved in such criminality.
"All three males are now unable to attend a football match for the foreseeable future, which is particularly relevant given next weekend's Edinburgh derby."
A Hearts spokesman said:  "We have a very good and close working relationship with Police Scotland and will continue to do our best with them to eradicate the type of behaviour which is unacceptable to the majority of Hearts supporters."
