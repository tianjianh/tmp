[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hearing was told Brady's solicitor, Robin Makin, had given assurances "there is no likelihood" it would happen.
On Tuesday, Coroner Christopher Sumner said Brady's body would not be released until such a guarantee was made.
Brady, who tortured and killed five children with his lover Myra Hindley, buried four of his victims on the moor.
The body of the serial killer, who died at Ashworth Hospital secure psychiatric unit in Merseyside on Monday, is under police guard at a mortuary.
Mr Sumner said the remains of the 79 year old will be released at 14:00 BST on Thursday.
The inquest at Southport Town Hall heard Merseyside Police asked for the release of the body to be delayed in order for funeral arrangements to be made by Mr Makin, the executor of Brady's will.
Michael Armstrong, counsel for the force, said: "The deceased's body is currently under police guard.
"Upon release to the executor the police will no longer be in a position to provide any assurances in respect of the safety of the body."
Mr Armstrong said officers understood there were no suggestions Mr Makin had made arrangements to have Brady's body dealt with.
The coroner said he would delay the release of the body for almost 24 hours to allow the police time to "negotiate" with Mr Makin about funeral arrangements.
Brady, who along with Hindley became known as the Moors Murderers, was jailed in 1966 for the killing of John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17.
In 1985 he also admitted to the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, who was 12, although he was never tried for those crimes.
Born in Glasgow in 1938, Brady later moved to Manchester where he met Hindley and died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit in Merseyside, where he had been detained since 1985.
The inquest was told on Tuesday that Brady's cause of death was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cor pulmonale, a condition that causes the right side of the heart to fail.
