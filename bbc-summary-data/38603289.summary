The suspects face charges ranging from armed robbery in an organised gang to kidnapping, criminal association and handling stolen goods.
Six other people remain in police custody.
Kardashian West was held at gunpoint and tied up by robbers while staying in the French capital in October.
The TV reality star was targeted at an exclusive flat near Place de la Madeleine while her bodyguard looked after her sister at a nightclub.
The gang stole €9m (£8m; $9.5m) of jewellery, including a diamond ring valued at around €4m.
Those placed under formal investigation are Yunice A, 63; Florus H, 44; Marceau B, 64; and Gary M, 27.
Yunice A was charged with robbing Kardashian at gunpoint and leaving her bound and gagged.
The others face charges of aiding and abetting the theft.
Three people were released without charge on Wednesday, including Kardashian's chauffeur in Paris, Michael Madar.
Throughout the inquiry, police have been investigating whether the gang was tipped off that Kardashian West's bodyguard was not at the hotel residence at the time of the robbery.
Although there has been no trace yet of Kardashian West's missing jewellery, police did recover an estimated €300,000 during raids on Monday.
