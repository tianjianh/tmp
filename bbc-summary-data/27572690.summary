Lewis Powter was reported missing by authorities at HMP Hollesley Bay after failing to appear for roll call at 20:00 BST on Sunday.
The 30-year-old, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, was last seen at 18:50 BST.
Another inmate, Paul Oddysses, 49, absconded on Saturday afternoon.
Suffolk Police said Powter - who has a Dennis the Menace tattoo on his right arm - had connections with the Cambridgeshire area.
He is described as white, about 5ft 10ins tall, of medium build, with brown hair, blue eyes and is clean shaven.
He was last seen wearing a blue jumper with a white t-shirt, blue jeans and white Ralph Lauren trainers.
On Saturday, Hollesley Bay contacted Suffolk Police just after 13:00 BST reporting Oddysses had left the premises. He was serving a life sentence for attempted robbery and robbery with a firearm.
He has connections in the Hertfordshire and Essex areas and is known to frequent Enfield in North London.
