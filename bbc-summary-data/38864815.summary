[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 3-0 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Godden was on target again for Stevenage as they recorded a third win in a row with an impressive victory over promotion-chasing Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Godden has now scored eight times in his last eight games, and has 15 in total this season, with his penalty being sandwiched by strikes from Steven Schumacher and the excellent Tom Pett.
Sam Saunders went close early on, sending a free-kick from 25 yards narrowly wide with Jamie Jones left standing before Chairboys stopper Jamal Blackman had to push away Jobi McAnuff's curler.
However, the hosts went ahead on 25 minutes as McAnuff's cross was helped on by Godden and Schumacher was on hand to nod in from close range.
The lead was doubled just before half-time when Pett was tripped in the area by Dominic Gape, leaving Godden to send Blackman the wrong way from the spot.
The visitors were the architects of their own downfall for Stevenage's third, as Aaron Pierre was dispossessed on the edge of his own area by Pett, who rounded Blackman to score.
