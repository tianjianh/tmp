David Walliams supports Peter Pan house project in Dumfries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children's author and comedian David Walliams is to be part of a special event with Joanna Lumley to help raise funds for Moat Brae house in Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building - which helped inspire author JM Barrie to write Peter Pan - is being turned into a children's literature centre.
Walliams and Lumley will hold a conversation at the Cadogan Hall in London on 19 March.
Proceeds from the event will go to the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust.
The fundraiser promises "a marvellous morning of stinky stories and quirky questions".
Work recently started on converting the historic building after more than Â£5m in capital funding was raised.
It is hoped it can open to the public in two years' time.
