Dumfries and Galloway could become a pilot region for a project to teach English as a second language to Syrian refugee families.

The potential move is contained in a report to the council's policy and resources committee.
The region is expected to welcome about 20 families over the next five years who could be helped with their language needs.
If successful, the scheme could be rolled out across Scotland.
A report to the local authority said the Scottish government and academic institutions could provide some funding for the scheme.
Council leader Ronnie Nicholson said one of its priorities was to protect vulnerable people.
"Helping vulnerable families who are innocent victims of war and persecution is simply the humanitarian thing to do," he said.
"Our council, through the Dumfries and Galloway Refugee Crisis Project Board, is working with a range of appropriate professional and volunteer groups to prepare our region to host refugee families.
"The local response to the refugee crisis from our volunteer partners has been quite outstanding and I am proud of the work done by them and local agencies."
