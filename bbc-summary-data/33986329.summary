The level of the cryptosporidium bug that has affected water supplies to 300,000 homes in Lancashire has fallen significantly, it has been claimed.

United Utilities said it is installing ultraviolet light rigs at five sites on the Fylde coast to eradicate the bug.
The microbial parasite is killed when irradiated with short wave UVC light.
The water company said levels are now "very low" but urged people to continue boiling water.
The warning was originally issued on 6 August after traces of the bug were found at the Franklaw treatment works near Preston.
The affected areas include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
Gary Dixon, customer services director for United Utilities said: "We have identified a number of locations where we will position the rigs as we observed water flowing through the system."
He said when traces of the bug come out of the service area and come into contact with the light, it is eradicated immediately.
"The levels of cryptosporidium were extremely low in the first place and are now very low," he said.
"Until we get clear samples our advice to customers is to continue to boil water."
