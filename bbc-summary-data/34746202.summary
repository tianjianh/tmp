Farah, who will defend his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m titles in Rio next summer, will run the 8km race at Holyrood Park.
It will be the 32-year-old's first cross country event in five years.
"For many years, cross country was a key building block for the year ahead," said Farah.
"I'm pleased to add it to my schedule for the first time since I ran in Edinburgh back in 2011."
The race on Saturday, 9 January will be broadcast live on BBC television and the BBC Sport website.
