Glamorgan v Nottinghamshire: Stuart Broad and Luke Fletcher lead way for visitors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire put themselves in a strong position for a fourth straight win as they bowled Glamorgan out for 187 in reply to an impressive 448 all out.

England paceman Stuart Broad took 2-40 and Luke Fletcher 3-60.
Aneurin Donald's 53 was the home side's top score in a disappointing display.
Earlier, Notts batted through the showers until mid-afternoon thanks to Chris Read (88) and Brett Hutton (61), who put on 97 for the seventh wicket.
Read, who batted with a runner and did not keep wicket because of a bruised hip, was caught on the square leg boundary when in sight of becoming the visitors' third centurion.
The last four wickets went for 21, Timm van der Gugten claiming a five-wicket haul on his Championship comeback when he bowled last man Harry Gurney.
But the visitors reduced Glamorgan to 51-4 as their seamers struck either side of tea, aided by Chetashwar Pujara's run-out of Will Bragg.
Donald and David Lloyd (34) added 72 before Broad grabbed two quick wickets in his second spell, and Donald's dismissal to a brilliant leaping boundary catch by sub Luke Wood off Fletcher signalled the end of the specialist batting.
Nottinghamshire lead by 261 on first innings and are likely to enforce the follow-on on day three.
Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"Chris Read bottom-edged one onto his hip, it's swollen up, it's sore and it's making him immobile so he'll ice it up overnight, but it's doubtful he'll keep (on day three).
"It was a really good score on the pitch, a lot of the damage was done by Chris and Riki Wessels in the last session (on Friday), then Brett Hutton played well - it was nice to get a very competitive score.
"Everybody chipped in with the ball, we bowled some really good balls and took some great catches. The fielding was one of the stars today and it's been significant for us."
Glamorgan batsman Aneurin Donald told BBC Wales Sport:
"I felt pretty good out there, I applied myself getting in but it is pretty criminal to get out the way I did and when I did.
"If you did graft your way through the first 20 to 30 balls it did open up a bit, they did that very well and to be fair they took all their chances again today.
"It is a tough day for the team, we really stuffed it up with the bat. It is difficult to take and we are going to come back and really show a bit of fight."
