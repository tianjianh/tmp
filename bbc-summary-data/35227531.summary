Crossrail 2 'threatens' historic London buildings, say campaigners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Historic buildings which have been part of central London since the 19th Century could be demolished to make way for Crossrail 2, according to heritage campaigners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport for London (TfL) has proposed a new rail route running from north to south across much of the capital.
The Victorian Society has raised concerns the plans "would see numerous historic buildings demolished".
A TfL spokeswoman said demolition was "always our last resort".
The sites identified as at risk by the group include several Grade II-listed buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, and part of Angel station in Islington, which was built in 1902.
The society's director, Christopher Costelloe, said: "Every effort must be made to use those sites which would minimise Crossrail 2's impact on London's unique and historic environment."
The group also criticised Crossrail 2's statement on how construction would affect London's heritage, claiming it "almost entirely deals with the impact of ground settlement caused by tunnelling rather than minimising the demolition of historic buildings of quality".
MichÃ¨le Dix, TfL's managing director for Crossrail 2, insisted that in planning the route they had "looked to minimise the impact on local residents and communities as much as possible".
She pointed out that while some Victorian buildings are within the proposed Crossrail 2 construction area they may not necessarily be affected when works are carried out.
She added: "Demolition is always our last resort and where buildings are needed we will try to ensure the faÃ§ade is retained to maintain the character of the local area."
Permission has not yet been granted to build the railway, and members of the public can contribute to the consultation on the route until 8 January.
