It began in the housekeeping quarters of the Chewton Glen Hotel in New Milton just after midnight.
The hotel said all guests and staff were accounted for.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, which sent five fire engines, said the blaze incinerated all the items in the hotel's laundry.
Spokeswoman for the hotel, Angela Day, said the fire was contained and guests returned to their rooms at about 04:00 GMT.
A fire service spokesman said the operation to put out the fire required 24 sets of breathing apparatus.
He added: "Our attendance was two pumps from New Milton, two from Lymington and one from Redbridge.
"Also to support we had our response support vehicle from Redbridge, environment protection support from Romsey, a co-responder from Ringwood, command support from Beaulieu and Eastleigh, and our incident command support unit from headquarters."
An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
