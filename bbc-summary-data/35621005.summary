Davis, 22, defeated Korea's Paris Grand Slam winner Jan-Di Kim, scoring a yuko and waza-ari with two attacks for the win.
It was revenge for Davis after she had been beaten by her rival in last year's Jeju Grand Prix final.
"Nekoda has had a brilliant day and has proved that she belongs at this level," said head performance coach Kate Howey.
