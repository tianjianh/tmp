O'Brien has recovered from a hamstring injury which saw him miss three of the five ODIs against Afghanistan in March.
Stirling is named in a 14-man squad following a finger injury sustained during the Intercontinental Cup game with the Afghans on the same tour.
Boyd Rankin and Jacob Mulder will miss the matches because of back injuries.
Warwickshire bowler Rankin, 32, returned to his national side last year after a brief and unfulfilling switch to England, which culminated in a single Test appearance against Australia.
O'Brien famously scored the fastest century in World Cup history as Ireland secured a three-wicket win over England in 2011.
Ireland will face England at Bristol in the first of the two games and the teams will meet again at Lord's two days later.
Ireland have previously played five home ODIs against England and two in global tournaments,
"The opportunity to play England in England and in particular at Lord's is not only historic, but a great tribute to Irish cricket and its journey," said Ireland head coach John Bracewell.
"The 14 selected give us the best balance available to take on England in early May. The conditions will be as different as they could be from those we experienced against Afghanistan in India - as will the composition of the two bowling attacks, with pace being key.
"It'll be another great challenge for our players, but one everyone associated with Irish cricket can't wait for," he added.
"I've no doubt we will have a massive support at both venues given both the number of Irish around Bristol and in London, never mind the amount of people travelling over," said captain William Porterfield.
"There's no doubt that the games against England will be tough but we've got some hard cricket under our belts this past few months and that will stand us in good stead for the challenges that await.
"We're all determined to do well, and while we'll certainly respect England, there's absolutely no fear factor there."
Ireland squad for England ODI series: William Porterfield (Warwickshire, capt), Andrew Balbirnie (Leinster Lightning), Peter Chase (Leinster Lightning), George Dockrell (Leinster Lightning), Ed Joyce (Sussex/Leinster Lightning), Tim Murtagh (Middlesex), Andrew McBrine (NW Warriors), Barry McCarthy (Leinster Lightning), Kevin O'Brien (Leinster Lightning), Niall O'Brien (NW Warriors, wk), Paul Stirling (Middlesex), Stuart Thompson (NW Warriors), Gary Wilson (Derbyshire/Northern Knights, wk), Craig Young (NW Warriors).
