Rebecca Evans, 27, from Bridgend, was eight months pregnant when she died in the three-car pile up near Port Talbot, on Tuesday.
Her son Cian, two, was seriously hurt and is recovering in hospital, and her husband Alex was also in the car.
The couple were on their way to work at homeless charity Shelter Cymru when the crash happened.
Shelter Cymru's head of campaigns, Michelle Wales: "This is such a tragedy and obviously something we didn't expect.
"She was such a lovely, lovely person and we are all so upset. Staff and trustees are in a state of shock.
"Rebecca had been working for Shelter Cymru for five years building the education and youth information service which has helped thousands of young people to understand the practical steps young people need to take to live independently.
"Without her passion and commitment to young people many would have faced homelessness and uncertain futures."
She added: "Under Rebecca's leadership the education and youth work of Shelter Cymru had become highly regarded by schools, government and other organisations in the field and had made real impacts on the understanding of homelessness and housing need among young people.
"Her colleagues are utterly devastated and all our thoughts are with her partner Alex Evans, our Communications Officer and their son Cian, both of whom survived the accident."
South Wales Police is still investigating the crash, which involved a BMW, a Peugeot and an Audi, and happened on the westbound carriage between junctions 38 and 39 at 08:20 GMT.
A 50-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has been bailed.
