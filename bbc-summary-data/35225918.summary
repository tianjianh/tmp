Junior doctor strikes back on as talks fail

Strikes by junior doctors in England are back on after talks with the government have broken down.

A 24-hour walk-out next Tuesday will be followed by a 48-hour strike on 26 January in the contract dispute.
A third day of action will take place in February, the British Medical Association said.
The action is likely to lead to thousands of non-emergency operations and hospital appointments being cancelled in the coming days.
But despite the failure to reach a deal, both sides have already indicated they want to keep negotiating ahead of next week's walk-out.
It comes after the union agreed to cancel three strikes last month to re-enter talks with the government.
The BMA had until midnight to decide whether it still wanted to take industrial action - or face having to re-ballot its members.
This is because of trade union rules which only allow industrial action in set timescales and require unions to give a week's notice of any walk-out.
The strike details announced are:
The development came after both sides sat down on Monday for the first time since the Christmas break.
Weeks of negotiations had taken place right up until Christmas Eve following the intervention of conciliation service Acas.
Those talks marked the first time both sides had met formally since the break down of the original talks in autumn 2014.

But BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said the union had been left with no choice but to move towards industrial action as despite the weeks of negotiations the government still was not taking their concerns "seriously".
"We sincerely regret the disruption that industrial action will cause, but junior doctors have been left with no option.  It is because the government's proposals would be bad for patient care as well as junior doctors in the long-term that we are taking this stand," he added.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract had to change to help improve weekend care.
He said the sticking point in the latest round of discussions had been over weekend pay and he had asked Acas to help them reconvene talks.
"It is extremely disappointing that the BMA have chosen to take industrial action which helps no-one. We had made good progress."
Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, added the news was "extremely disappointing".
"Once again patients are being caught in the middle of this bitter dispute."
