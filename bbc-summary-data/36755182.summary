The Bahamas has issued a rare travel advisory for its citizens visiting the US, recommending particular care for young men in cities affected by tensions over recent police shootings.

The advisory warns citizens to not get involved in protests and avoid crowds.
It comes after two black men were shot dead by police in Minnesota and Louisiana, and five officers were killed at a protest in Dallas.
Some 90% of the Bahamas population is black, according to the CIA.
The advisory comes as the country, a former British colony, celebrates its Independence Day holiday, on 10 July, a time when many locals travel abroad, including to the US.
The statement, issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, tells citizens to "exercise appropriate caution", especially in cities affected by "tensions... over shootings of young black males by police officers".
"In particular young males are asked to exercise extreme caution in affected cities in their interactions with the police. Do not be confrontational, and co-operate," it says.
"Do not get involved in political or other demonstrations under any circumstances and avoid crowds."
The US regularly issues travel advisories for Americans visiting other countries, but it is rare for nations to issue warnings for their citizens travelling to the US.
