Restoration for Italian-style landmarks in Leeds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three imposing Italian-style towers in Leeds are to be restored and repaired, the city council has announced.

Steeplejacks are to scale the Giotto, Verona and Little Tower at Tower Works to re-point the brickwork.
Debris is also to be removed from the Giotto Tower and its glass tiles repaired and replaced on the "recognisable and unique landmarks".
The structures were dust extractors for a factory that made steel pins for the textile industry.
The works was founded by T.R Harding in 1864-66 and the towers' design was influenced by his love of Italian architecture.
The plan to transfer four listed buildings - the three towers and the Engine House in Holbeck - to Leeds City Council from the Homes and Community Agency was agreed in 2013.
The Giotto Tower, the largest of the three, is based on Giotto's Campanile in Florence, while the Verona Tower takes its design from the Torre dei Lamberti in Verona.
The Little Tower, the smallest of the three mimics a traditional Tuscan tower house.
Councillor Richard Lewis said the towers were "among the city's most recognisable and unique landmarks and the site as a whole is a hugely important part of the city's heritage".
The repair work to the towers is to be funded with money from the Homes and Communities Agency and is to start in June.
The rest of the site is to be developed by Carillion for mixed use as a "key element" of the plans for Holbeck.
