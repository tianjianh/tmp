Chris and Fiona Jones, of Y Felinheli on the Menai Strait, near Bangor, have spent the last 14 years sailing their 43ft (13m) boat Threeships.
Their 90,000 nautical mile journey has taken them to more than 40 countries since setting off in 2002.
A cannon salute from the Royal Welsh Yacht Club, Caernarfon, on Saturday marked their return to home waters.
The couple, who are ambassadors for the Ocean Cruising Club and taught sailing for two years prior to their trip, have kept a blog of their travels over the years.
Mrs Jones told BBC Radio Wales they did not expect to go away for so long.
"When we first set off we didn't really have any plans to circumnavigate. We thought we would just go sailing and see what we could see," she said.
"It's pretty difficult to choose a favourite spot. We loved a lot of places and loved meeting all different people.
"I suppose New Zealand was a highlight and so were some of the Pacific islands."
