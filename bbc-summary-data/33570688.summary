The Football Association of Wales (FAW) apologised, citing "unprecedented demand", with strips unavailable online and in short supply in shops.
Wales are currently at an all-time high of 10th in the Fifa world rankings and are on course to qualify for Euro 2016.
In a joint statement with supplier JD Sports, the FAW said new supplies would be available within the next few weeks.
JD Sports has an exclusive deal with the FAW, which means Wales' kit is only available in its shops and on its website.
Research by BBC Radio Wales' Good Evening Wales programme found shirts are sold out in the Cardiff city centre branch and only one XXL size shirt was available in Swansea.
In a statement, the FAW said: "Due to unprecedented demand for the official Wales replica kit, as a result of the team's on pitch success, stock is currently in short supply.
"We would like to apologise to any fans who may have been unable to purchase the kit at the moment. An additional order was placed after the successful launch period and is expected in our stores within the next few weeks."
The statement added planned stock numbers would be reviewed to meet demand in future.
