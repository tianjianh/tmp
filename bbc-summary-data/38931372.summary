Whiteheads Steelworks was closed down in 2005 and later demolished as part of the city's regeneration works.
Developers say the development, off Mendalgief road, could regenerate a section of Pill "traditionally associated with industry".
Plans also include a pub-restaurant, retail and assisted living units.
Whiteheads Developments first submitted plans for the development in 2015 with a smaller number of residential properties -  498 - and a care home.
Developers changed the plans following noise concerns over the Coilcolor factory and after increased costs of "unforeseen contamination" at the site.
