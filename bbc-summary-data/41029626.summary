The 38-year-old arrived at Sixways in 2015 when he joined from Munster.
"There is no doubt that other players in the squad look up to him. I am sure he will do a superb job," said Worcester director of rugby Gary Gold.
Warriors' former captain South African GJ van Velze, and centre Ryan Mills have been named vice-captains.
Worcester begin the new season away to Newcastle on Friday, 1 September.
