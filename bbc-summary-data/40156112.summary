Four suspected militants who attempted to attack a paramilitary camp in Indian-administered Kashmir have been killed in a gun battle.

A spokesman for the Central Reserve Paramilitary Force (CRPF) said four armed suicide attackers had tried to enter the camp in the Bandipora region.
All of them were killed before they could enter the camp, he added.
Police said the militants did not "appear to be locals", hinting that they were from Pakistan.
India and Pakistan both claim disputed Kashmir in its entirety, but only control parts of it.
Delhi accuses Islamabad of fuelling militancy in the disputed region, a claim the latter denies.
The attack comes amid fresh tension in the region which has seen a new outbreak of violence after a prominent militant was killed by Indian armed forces.
