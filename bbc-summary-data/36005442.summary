[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shomsu Miah housed the woman who had been trafficked to the UK and was being kept against her will.
She and another woman were brought into the country by co-defendants Istvan Vinter and Maria Gaspar, who were jailed last month.
Miah, 44, pleaded guilty during his trial at Nottingham Crown Court and was given a two-and-a-half year sentence.
Hungarians Vinter, 57 and Gaspar, 23, were sentenced to eight and six years respectively last month.
Police said Vinter and Gaspar trafficked two women having promised them work in a hotel.
A jury was told Miah, from Nottingham, had travelled to Hungary to meet the pair before the trafficking took place.
One victim, who was kept against her will in August and September, was forced to have sex with men and had her identity documents taken so she could not flee.
She was offered for marriage to one man and taken to a nightclub where she was offered for sex.
The other victim was sold for marriage in London but managed to escape and return home to Hungary.
All three men were charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to their exploitation, and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration to a member state.
