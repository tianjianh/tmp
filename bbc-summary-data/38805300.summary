More than 100 fans were involved in city centre violence ahead of Manchester United's game against Sheffield United on 9 January 2016.
Bottles were thrown at officers amid the scuffles, but no-one was injured, Greater Manchester Police said.
Those taken to court were banned from games for three to five years.

When the visiting fans reached Bengal Street in Ancoats the rival groups attacked each other.
Police footage showed one man launching a glass bottle.
