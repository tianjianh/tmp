Trust's plan to avoid 'media traps' scrapped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A failing mental health trust has scrapped plans insisting governors do not talk to journalists without consulting it first, in case they say "things they don't mean".

The Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust proposals said there was a danger some of them could be "trapped" by leading questions from the media.
The report said the new rules would ensure a "fair" coverage of the trust.
But it later withdrew the report after "concerns" were raised by governors.
The report, which had been due to be discussed on Thursday, said: "Governors may be contacted out of the blue by media and need clarity on how to field such approaches to avoid traps."
It added: "If a governor is approached by a media representative they should initially refer the journalist to the communications team [of the trust].
"Giving interviews or making statements without communications team support carries significant risks."
The report said some journalists may "lead interviewees into saying things that they don't mean or take quotations out of context in order to distort a story".
Gary Page, chair of the trust, said: "The governor media policy (report) was drawn up by the governors' membership and communications sub-group.
"We have taken on board concerns expressed by a number of governors and it was agreed to withdraw the policy for further discussion.
"The intention of the policy is to provide guidelines for governors to support them in their dealings with the media."
A spokesman for the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk and Suffolk said: "We are obviously disappointed that the trust attempted to control the interaction with the media of the unpaid and elected representatives of patients, carers, staff and other stakeholders.
"That said, we are heartened by the vigorous opposition to this ill-judged proposal by a group of new and independently-minded governors."
The foundation trust was the first in mental health trust in England to be put in special measures in February 2015 by NHS Monitor after the Care Quality Commission reported the trust was "not a safe... service".
