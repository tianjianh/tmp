Police had investigated the message and met with both parties.
However the Robinson family have decided not to take any further action.
"We would like to remind all supporters that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated under any circumstances and action will be taken," the club said.
The Latics are bottom of League One, three points adrift of safety.
