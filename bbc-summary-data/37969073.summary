Rochelle Clark scored the opening try as she became England's most-capped player in a 12-10 win over Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old overtook fellow prop Jason Leonard by making her 115th international appearance.
She is now level with Scotland's Donna Kennedy as the record caps holder in the women's game.
Izzy Noel-Smith scored the crucial try for England eight minutes from time at University College Dublin, after Nora Stapleton had crossed for Ireland.
Sunday's match was not part of the autumn international series.
England, who beat France 10-5 at Twickenham Stoop on Wednesday, have moved up to second in the world rankings.
They meet New Zealand, the top-ranked team, at Twickenham on 19 November before facing Canada a week later.
