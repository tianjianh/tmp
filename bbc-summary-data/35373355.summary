[SN]TITLE[SN]
Julian Assange's questioning by Sweden delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swedish prosecutors seeking to question Wikileaks founder Julian Assange say they are considering whether to submit a renewed request to Ecuador.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Assange has been living in Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012.
He sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual assault against two women in 2010.
He denies the accusations and says he fears Sweden would extradite him to the US for possible trial there.
Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement that her office had received a letter from Ecuador.
In it, Ecuador rejected "for formal reasons" Sweden's request to question Mr Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said Sweden had acted disrespectfully when it sent its request, which he said was full of crossed out lines and was a simple re-issue of a previous document.
Ecuador also suggested that its officials conduct the interview with Mr Assange and asked Swedish prosecutors for a list of questions.
Ms Ny said that Sweden was currently considering its response.
