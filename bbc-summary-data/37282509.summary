[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kieran Lee scored a stoppage-time winner as Sheffield Wednesday came from two goals down to beat Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham scored two first-half headers to put the Robins firmly in control.
Steven Fletcher nodded in to pull one back but Sam Hutchinson was soon sent off for fouling Marlon Pack in the box.
Lee Tomlin's penalty hit the post and Gary O'Neil was red-carded for City before Barry Bannan levelled from range and Lee slotted in to steal the points.
After kick-off at Hillsborough had been delayed by 15 minutes because of torrential rain and a thunderstorm, it was the visitors who started the better.
Abraham, 18, first leapt highest to power in O'Neil's looping cross, before nodding home his eighth goal in nine games after Josh Brownhill's drive was parried into his path by Keiren Westwood.
The Owls, who had only scored five in six league matches prior to the game, improved after the break and halved the deficit when Fletcher headed Fernando Forestieri's corner into the net.
Drama soon unfolded when Hutchinson was dismissed after slipping and bringing down Pack, only for Tomlin's subsequent spot-kick to cannon off the post, leading to O'Neil receiving a second booking for a foul in the immediate aftermath.
Bannan then equalised with a 30-yard drive that burst through the hands of goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell, and Lee showed composure to sidestep a defender and fire inside the far post to earn Wednesday only their second win over their opponents in 12 attempts, moving them above the Robins into ninth.
Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"It was an exciting evening, but it was a very strange game for us.
"Two-nil down at half-time was very heavy to us. I spoke very calmly to the players at half-time. It was important to speak calmly to them to explain how we could revert things.
"I spoke more to the heart of the players because it wasn't down to their attitude.
"My players received the message and we did fantastic in the second half. We tried to create problems for them in the second half with different players.
"We were lucky they didn't score the penalty. At 2-1, the penalty miss was crucial.
"We needed to compose our defence and play with balance. I don't want to be in this situation in the future. We want to score first."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson:
"It was a bad dream, wasn't it? It wasn't bad luck because we should have scored a third goal from the penalty spot.
"The sending off of O'Neil altered the course of the game. He won the ball cleanly and it was disappointing that he [the referee] got that wrong.
"I thought we were excellent in the first half, slick and quick on the counter. We completely bossed them in the first half and they kept hitting a brick wall. They ran out of ideas.
"The most disappointing thing for me was a couple crumbled out of my lot. I see it in the mindset and it does happen. What you can't do is freeze. You have to be brave and bold in everything you do.
"I've got no fears that the group will bounce back. Physically, technically and mentally they've got to handle it."
