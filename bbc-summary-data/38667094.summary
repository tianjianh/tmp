The magician died last year aged 77 at his Berkshire home, a month after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.
McGee is working with the charity Brain Tumour Research to raise awareness of the disease.
The new pin badge - featuring a white rabbit in a pink top hat - will help generate funds, McGee said.
"Paul died four weeks and five days after the diagnosis.
"I still miss him every day. I still love spending time with our rabbits, he loved them so much and they make me think of him.
"I hope people will buy these badges - by wearing one they'll be remembering Paul and supporting vital research."
The pin badge, which McGee helped to design, is available on eBay with a suggested donation of Â£5.
Sue Farrington Smith, chief executive of Brain Tumour Research, said: "We are enormously grateful to Debbie who, like so many of our supporters, is bravely sharing her story with the aim of ensuring other families do not have to bear the pain they have experienced."
