Dersalloch wind farm, located on Dersalloch Hill, between Straiton and Dalmellington, has 23 turbines with a capacity of 69MW of electricity.
It is first of eight onshore wind farm projects, worth more than Â£650m, being delivered by ScottishPower Renewables.
They will have a combined total of 221 turbines, capable of generating almost 500MW - enough to power 130,000 homes.
Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, said he was delighted to see Dersalloch wind farm starting its operational life.
"It has always had the potential to be a significant renewable energy project and, combined with the other wind farms we are currently constructing, will play a significant part in the future of Scotland's energy production," he said.
