PDC World Darts Championship: Van Gerwen eases past Stein

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champion Michael van Gerwen is through to the third round of the PDC World Championship after a 4-1 win over German qualifier Sascha Stein.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dutchman Van Gerwen lost the first set but recovered to set up an encounter against England's Terry Jenkins.
Jenkins did not lose a leg in trouncing Australian qualifier Laurence Ryder 4-0 and missed a double 12 that would have given him a nine-dart finish.
Fourth seed Gary Anderson beat Jelle Klaasen 4-3 in a classic encounter.
Scotland's Anderson was 3-1 down but finished with a three-dart average of 103.02 to see off the Dutchman, winner of the rival BDO World Championship in 2006.
In other matches, English eighth seed Dave Chisnall lost 4-2 to Benito van de Pas of the Netherlands.
Ninth seed Robert Thornton beat England's Ronnie Baxter, with the Scotsman also coming close to a perfect leg.
Scot Peter Wright, runner-up to Van Gerwen last year, rounded off the afternoon session with a 4-1 win over Belgium's Ronny Huybrechts.
