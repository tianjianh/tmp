Since 2011, American photographer Mustafah Abdulaziz has travelled to eight countries around the world highlighting the global water crisis in his documentary project, Water Stories.
Seventy large-scale photographs from the series are on display in London in his first UK solo exhibition.
Abdulaziz's project aims to highlight the effects of urbanisation, poor sanitation, pollution and water scarcity.
"Our most critical resource for life on this planet hangs in a delicate balance - between growing populations and energy demands, between rising seas and melting ice and between those who have access to clean water and those who do not," says the photographer.
"Photographs have the capacity to bring into focus our place in the world, where this imbalance between water and civilisation may be explored in the hope we may look upon ourselves and our world not as separate entities but as one whose future is intrinsically linked," says Abdulaziz.
The open-air exhibition, to mark UN World Water Day, is in collaboration with the HSBC Water Programme, a partnership between HSBC, Earthwatch, WaterAid and WWF.
