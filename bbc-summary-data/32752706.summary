Kings College London's Strand demolition plan paused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
University plans to demolish a row of Victorian buildings in central London are put on hold while government ministers consider the application.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of people have signed a petition to stop King's College London replacing the buildings on the Strand with a new, bigger academic building.
Save Britain's Heritage campaigners said the new building would be "bland".
Westminster Council approved the college plan on 21 April but a holding direction has since been applied.
The application for 154-158 Strand, which includes a new courtyard and link to Somerset House, was submitted in December 2014.
The college said it had the support of English Heritage and the council.
A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: "The Department has received representations asking for this application to be called-in.  We have issued an Article 31 holding direction on this planning application while we assess whether or not to do so, so we can give the matter proper consideration."
