Scarlets and Wales flanker Aaron Shingler feared a concussion he suffered last season could have ended his career.

The 29-year-old suffered a blow to the head at Ulster in February 2016.
He said: "It has been a frustrating time. When I had the bang I was just sitting around and wasn't able to do a lot really.
"I still don't remember the concussion tests. I think that was half the problem."

Shingler made his first appearance of the season last weekend against Connacht as Scarlets registered their first win of the season.
He said: "I was suffering from headaches and dizziness for a long time and I was a little bit concerned if it was ever going to get better.
"I thought 'this could be the end'. Luckily it has cleared up itself and here we are."
Shingler says he will not let the threat of another concussion affect his approach.
"It could occur again if I have a bad bang. I'm not too concerned. I'm not holding anything back because of it."
He is now looking forward to Scarlets' trip to Treviso on Saturday as they look to climb from eighth in the table.
"If we lost at home against Connacht we would have been in a tricky situation - it's great to have got that win," Shingler added.
"Again we are under pressure this weekend as we are chasing from quite far behind now."
