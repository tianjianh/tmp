Redmayne faces competition from Bryan Cranston, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Fassbender.
Dame Maggie Smith is up for best actress for The Lady in the Van - pitting her against Cate Blanchett.
Blanchett's romance Carol and Steven Spielberg's drama Bridge of Spies lead the nominations with nine each.
Alongside Blanchett and Dame Maggie on the best actress list are Alicia Vikander for The Danish Girl, Saoirse Ronan for Brooklyn and Brie Larson for Room.
Carol and Bridge of Spies are both nominated for best film, alongside financial crash drama The Big Short, DiCaprio's survival epic The Revenant and Spotlight, about a newspaper investigation into child abuse in the Catholic Church.
The Danish Girl, in which Redmayne plays transgender pioneer Lili Elbe, is named on the shortlist for outstanding British film, along with Brooklyn, in which Ronan plays a young Irish woman who emigrates to New York.
Amy Winehouse documentary Amy is also up for best British film, as are marital drama 45 Years, Ex Machina - in which Vikander plays a synthetic human - and surreal comedy drama The Lobster.
Most nominated films:
Other British talents up for awards include Julie Walters, whose role as a boarding house owner in Brooklyn pits her against Kate Winslet, who plays an Apple marketing executive in the biopic of Steve Jobs, for best supporting actress.
Three Brits are in the best supporting actor category - Christian Bale for The Big Short, Idris Elba for Beasts of No Nation and Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies.
Ridley Scott will fly the flag in the best director category thanks to his work on space survival saga The Martian.
However there were no nominations for James Bond film Spectre, Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-tipped Joy or Suffragette.
Carey Mulligan's hopes of a best actress nomination for Suffragette were dashed, while other Brits to miss out included Charlotte Rampling, who was tipped for 45 Years, and Steve Jobs director Danny Boyle.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens could be rewarded for its huge success after being nominated for best production design, sound, original music and special visual effects.
One of the film's young stars, Londoner John Boyega, has already received his nomination for the Bafta Rising Star Award alongside Brie Larson, Dakota Johnson, Taron Egerton and Bel Powley.
The annual Bafta ceremony takes place at London's Royal Opera House on 14 February - two weeks before the Oscars.
