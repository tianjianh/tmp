[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accused preacher Anjem Choudary granted bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radical preacher Anjem Choudary has been granted conditional bail as he awaits trial for allegedly encouraging support for so-called Islamic State.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Choudary, 48, had spent the last two weeks in custody after breaching his bail by meeting a person he was "precluded from contacting".
At the Old Bailey on Friday, he was granted bail on the same conditions.
Mr Choudary, from Ilford, east London, pleaded not guilty to charges of encouraging support for IS.
He will remain in custody until a Â£15,000 surety is provided to the court.
His co-accused, Mohammed Rahman, of Whitechapel, in east London, also pleaded not guilty to inviting support for IS between 29 June 2014 and 6 March 2015.
The case was adjourned until 11 January for a further hearing, ahead of the scheduled start of the trial the following day.
The trial is expected to take three to four weeks.
