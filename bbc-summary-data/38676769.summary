[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elderly people could be left "isolated" as a health board considers shutting a village GP surgery in Powys.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board (ABMU) is asking patients for opinions on closing Coelbren Health Centre.
Patients would have to travel to Seven Sisters in Neath Port Talbot - three miles (4.8km) away - but a bus service between the villages has stopped.
ABMU said Powys and Neath Port Talbot councils were working to try and find a solution.
John Brunt, Powys council member for highways, said the route was commercial and the council had no control over it being withdrawn.
Vikki Jones, who lives in the village, said: "It's quite shocking and quite upsetting. People just feel increasingly isolated and forgotten about.
"There's a running joke that we're going to put a 'closed' sign up at the entrance to the village."
An ABMU spokeswoman said Dulais Valley Primary Care Centre, which runs both surgeries, has had issues with GP recruitment and has been unable to provide the full range of services at Coelbren for a year.
She said it was not possible to safely run a main surgery in Seven Sisters and a branch surgery in Coelbren with only two doctors, and efforts to recruit more proving unsuccessful due to a national shortage.
Part of the proposal is to base support services, such as counselling and physiotherapy, at Coelbren.
The spokeswoman added there was low-cost community transport available between the villages.
Ms Jones said she had offered lifts and help to elderly and disabled people in the village.
"We're a community and, if we don't fight together as a community and make our voices heard, we are going to lose these things," she said.
"People are becoming prisoners in their own homes, having to pay Â£5 each way for a taxi to go to the doctor, if they can get one at all."
The community engagement process began on Thursday and continues until 16 February.
A public meeting is being held at Coelbren Welfare Hall at 11:00 GMT on Saturday, which will be attended by Brecon and Radnorshire AM Kirsty Williams.
Ms Williams said: "It is clearly an extremely difficult time for the community. To lose GP services and a key bus route in such a short space of time will be hugely challenging for many people in Coelbren, and is a prime example of the challenges isolated communities face.
"If people can't see their GP in Coelbren it's absolutely essential transport links are maintained to stop them being cut off and to allow them to see someone nearby".
