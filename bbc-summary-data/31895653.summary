Tom Daley failed to qualify for the 10m platform final at the season-opening Diving World Series event in Beijing.

The 20-year-old Briton debuted a new dive he described as "like a firework" at last month's national championships in Plymouth.
The Olympic bronze medallist used the routine again but scored just 54.00.
China's Jian Yang, who set a new world record last year, won the event, with American Olympic champion David Boudia second and German Sascha Klein third.
Daley introduced the new dive - a 3.5 somersault with one twist - to replace the 'demon' dive that had troubled him at the 2012 Olympics, and which he later admitted "terrified" him.
But although he won a fifth individual 10m platform title at the British Championships, the new dive scored just 61.2 and he conceded afterwards there was still "work to be done" on it.
Daley's team-mate Tonia Couch came an encouraging fourth in the women's 10m final.
There was 3m success for Great Britain on Friday as Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg finished third in the synchronised event.
