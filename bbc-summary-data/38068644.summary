Warning of industrial unrest in Dounreay pay row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trade unions have warned of the potential of industrial unrest at the Dounreay nuclear site in a row over pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The GMB, Unite and Prospect have called on Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) to increase its 1% pay offer.
The unions said DSRL's parent company Cavendish Dounreay Partnership had "significantly increased its profits year on year".
The Dounreay site near Thurso in Caithness is being decommissioned.
Prospect negotiator Richard Hardy said: "Our members are working hard to decommission the site, yet much of the money this generates is flowing out of Caithness and Sutherland, reducing the economic benefit for the local community.
"Everybody should get a share of the profits, not just the shareholders."
Sandra Owsnett, the DSRL trade union co-ordinating committee chairwoman, said: "It is our firm belief that the offer of 1% falls far short of members' expectations.
"We do not believe DSRL have made any serious attempts to address members' concerns and this has been made clear during the negotiations."
DSRL has yet to comment.
