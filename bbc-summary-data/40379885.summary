The Canadian will also be studying for a Master's degree at Cardiff Met University.
This will be Faryna's third season in the Elite League after two productive years with the Dundee Stars.
Devils coach Andrew Lord said: "Drew is a big strong guy that is going to win battles in the corners and in front of the net.
"We love the way Justin plays.
"He plays with an edge and has the ability to back his game up if need be."
