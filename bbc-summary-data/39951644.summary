Rolf Harris was nicknamed 'Groper Rolf' after allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old girl at a TV recording in the 1970s, a court heard.

The former TV presenter is accused of grabbing the woman's breasts, and putting his hand between her legs during the filming of sporting show Star Games in 1978.
The accusations were made in a trial at Southwark Crown Court.
The 87-year-old entertainer denies four charges of assault against three girls.
The alleged victim said that Mr Harris told her she was "a little bit irresistible" before running his hands up her legs in a taxi in Cambridge.
On Wednesday the woman told Southwark Crown Court: "This was Rolf Harris, my sister and I adored him.
"I was shocked and confused. I did feel a bit dirty but I didn't feel it was my fault.
"Until very recently I had not talked about it in any detail. But he was called Groper Rolf in our house."
The woman then said that after telling her father about the alleged incident, he told her she should not have worn such a tight-fitting top at the recording.
She said: "If my father's reaction had been a bit dismissive, what would someone who didn't love me say?"
Earlier the jury heard that in 1983 Mr Harris allegedly molested a 13-year-old girl during a recording of the BBC's Saturday Superstar.
The court heard the entertainer approached her after the recording of the show - which featured pop group Wham! - had ended.
Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told the court that Mr Harris touched the alleged victim's breasts and then said: "Do you often get molested on a Saturday morning?"
On Tuesday defence lawyer Stephen Vullo accused a third person of being on a "compensation bandwagon", after claiming Mr Harris put his hand up her skirt in 1971.
The woman, who was 14 years old at the time, claims Mr Harris abused her at a music event in the Lyceum Theatre in London.
The case continues.
