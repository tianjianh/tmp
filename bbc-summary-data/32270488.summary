[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Offensive words and symbols were painted on the buildings between Friday evening and Saturday morning.
The Conservative office in West Mount Street was vandalised with the word "scum", a swastika and the letter "Q" in white spray paint.
The letter "Q" was also painted on the door of the Labour party office in nearby Rosemount Place.
Ross Thomson, Scottish Conservative candidate for Aberdeen South, said he believed the "Q" was intended to stand for quisling, or traitor.
"Once again we see the ugly side of nationalism on display," he said.
"People should engage in healthy democratic debate but attempts like this to try and intimidate and bully political opponents are utterly disgusting."
A Police Scotland spokesman said inquiries were ongoing and asked anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area to contact them.
