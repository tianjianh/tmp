Jeremy Corbyn: Europe facing 'humanitarian crisis'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a packed hall as delegates in Brighton gathered to hear from their new leader.  Jeremy Corbyn promised a new kind of politics - a gentler politics.

He criticised the Conservatives over their treatment of refugees.
He said he's been inspired by people of this country and the donations they'd made to refugees in Calais. He said it was the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two and criticised the response from the wealthiest, which he said simply isn't enough.
Mr Corbyn made clear he would not support the expansion of grammar schools ahead of the government's announcement on whether to give the green light to a new annex in Sevenoaks.
He reiterated the words of the shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, saying Labour would not bring back selective schools because they want aspiration for all, not the few.
And he pledged to tackle soaring house prices - which affect many in the South East.
Mr Corbyn asked: "Where's the security for young people in careers knowing they are locked out of buying their own home by soaring house prices?"
But though he spoke for just under an hour (59 minutes) the speech was short on policy.
Despite that, party activists loved it and the South East's only Labour MP, Hove's Peter Kyle, told me he thought it was "authentic, passionate and heartfelt".
He said Mr Corbyn had started setting out some of his policies but more importantly than that he said he would listen to the public.
Mr Kyle said he was encouraged by that, and would get out in his constituency to ask what people thought before feeding it back to the leadership of the party.
Back in the hall, Mr Corbyn received a standing ovation after his first speech to conference.  He now has to turn support from party activists into votes in areas like the South East - which turned its back on Labour at the last two general elections.
