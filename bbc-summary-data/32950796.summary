The Russian club, managed by former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas, won their domestic league with two games to spare last weekend.
And just how did the Villas-Boas and his players celebrate? By dressing in traditional Russian clothing, as you do.
A picture was posted by former Manchester City player Javi Garcia on his Instagram account featuring a sharp-looking Garcia and his equally snappily-dressed team-mates, which includes former Arsenal forward Andrey Arshavin, surrounding Villas-Boas.
Zenit's title win, the fourth in their history, came in Villas-Boas's first full season in charge.
