Police and paramilitary forces have been deployed in Handwara, where the shooting happened.
Two men and a woman were killed and five others injured while protesting against the alleged molestation of a teenage girl by a soldier.
The army and police have ordered investigations into the deaths.
Curfews were imposed in Handwara and Srinagar following the violence, and shops and businesses were closed.
The BBC Urdu's Riyaz Masroor in Srinagar says hundreds of protesters had thronged the town square in Handwara following allegations that a soldier had attempted to molest a schoolgirl.
"When the protesters marched toward the central market and tried to storm a bunker, the soldiers indiscriminately fired at the procession," NA Sofi, an eyewitness, said.
However, our correspondent says that there is a lack of clarity on where the bullets came from with another eyewitness saying that the first round of firing came from the police.
Police said the firing injured seven men who were taken to a local hospital where two of them later died of  bullet injuries.
A 70-year-old woman who was also injured died in Srinagar on Tuesday night, reports said.
Authorities say the situation in Handwara is tense and a large number of security forces have been deployed to maintain order in the town.
Jammu and Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state and has been the scene of a violent insurgency against Indian rule since 1989.
