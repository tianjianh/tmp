Glasgow's skyline has been changed with the demolition of the last of the Red Road flats.

In an apparent misfiring, two of the blocks remained partially upright but the remaining high-rise blocks were brought down by controlled explosion.
Some residents in neighbouring properties had to be forced to leave the exclusion zone prior to the demolition.
Unconfirmed reports indicated they will not be allowed to return home.
They had told BBC Scotland they were concerned about damage to their properties.
A controversial plan to demolish five of the blocks as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony last summer was dropped.
When built they were considered the answer to the city's housing problem but became rundown and vandalised.
Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) said a single blowdown would be less disruptive to local residents.
Members of the public were kept about 1,000ft (300m) away from the blocks.
About 1,000 households were due to be temporarily moved while the demolition took place.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Tina Suffredini, who lives in the exclusion zone and was refusing to leave, said she wanted the block to be levelled gradually to lessen the impact on the surrounding area.
"I am concerned about everything," she said.
"Gas mains, there's a petrol station a couple of hundred yards away from the triple block, there's a nursery right under it, the dust, the flying debris - anything could happen.
"It could be two years down the line and our foundations could start to crack. I want to see them taken down safely, bit by bit."
Built in the mid-1960s to tackle the city's housing crisis, the flats were once the tallest residential structures in Europe, providing accommodation for almost 5,000 people.
The demolition programme, which changes the city's skyline, is part of GHA's renewal plan.
Two previous demolitions have taken place, in 2012 and 2013.
GHA said the decision to take all six blocks down in a single demolition was taken following feedback from local residents.
It said it would hold consultations on development options for the site.
