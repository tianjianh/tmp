Staffordshire Police said Mr Marren sustained fatal injuries when his Ford Fiesta hit a tree on the B5030 Ashbourne Road.
A family tribute said: "William was a young man with his whole life ahead of him.
"He worked really hard to support his family and adored his two little girls, Jessica and Freya.
"He was the partner of Lucie and also the loving son of Carl and Julie and brother of Kieran and Alex.
"William had a kind-hearted, positive and fun personality.
"He was an experienced driver, having passed his driving test seven years ago and a keen sportsman.
"If he had been able to, he would have worked seven days a week.
"His loss leaves a huge gap in all our lives and he will be greatly missed by his family and friends.
"We want to thank everyone for their kind messages, flowers and support at this very difficult time.
"We would particularly like to extend a special thank you to the two cyclists who discovered the car on Sunday morning and hope that we will be able to meet them to thank them personally."
