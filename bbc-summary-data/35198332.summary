[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish SPCA said the kittens had been abandoned "in a heartless way" in the South Ayrshire town on 23 December.
They were found by a member of the public in Ferguson Street and handed to police who contacted the charity.
The Scottish SPCA said they were underweight and dirty but were now safe at its Ayrshire rescue centre. It has appealed for information over the case.
Scottish SPCA assistant manager, Lynda Hourtson, said: "The member of the public told the police they found the kittens in a bin on Ferguson Street.
"All five were underweight and quite dirty but they are doing well.
"They are around six-to-eight weeks old, so, it may be someone's cat has had an unwanted litter and they have decided to abandon them in a heartless way."
Ms Hourston added: "Abandoning any animal is not only cruel but also an offence.
"Thankfully the kittens are now safe and we'll be looking for new homes for them shortly."
