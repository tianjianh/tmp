[SN]TITLE[SN]
British Land sells its three Northern Ireland retail assets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the UK's largest property firms is selling the three retail assets it owns in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British Land is disposing of the Riverside Retail Park in Coleraine, Lisnagelvin shopping centre in Londonderry and a retail unit in Craigavon which is leased to Tesco.
It is understood that the sales are part of a broader strategy rather than due to a negative view of the Northern Ireland market.
British Land is selling some of its smaller retail parks to free up capital to invest in larger assets.
Riverside Retail Park is one of the main retail developments in the north of Northern Ireland and is anchored by Sainsbury's and B&Q.
The Lisnagelvin shopping centre is anchored by Tesco and Primark.
