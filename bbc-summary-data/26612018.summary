[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Mail issues World War One stamps

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Royal Mail is to publish a series of stamps to commemorate World War One over the next five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first stamps will be issued in July and include a portrait of 15-year-old solider Pte William Tickle, who was killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
Stamps featuring a painting of a poppy and lines from the poem For The Fallen will also be issued in July.
Royal Mail said 30 stamps would be made over five years to recognise a war that "changed the course of world history".
The stamps will honour the contribution of Commonwealth countries, the armed forces, non-combatants and women.
Helen Grant, the minister for the WW1 centenary, praised Royal Mail's "long and distinguished history of recording special events and anniversaries with commemorative stamps".
The World War One Centenary
"Postal workers played a really important role in the war with many displaying gallantry and heroism of the highest order," she said.
"I hope that these stamps will help to bring home the meaning of the centenary to everyone that sees them."
About 75,000 postal workers fought in the war.
Royal Mail's own regiment, the Post Office Rifles, was formed in the 1860s to protect its buildings from attack.
About 1,800 of its solders were killed - and 4,500 injured - during the war.
Royal Mail consulted with the Imperial War Museums, senior figures in the armed forces and organisations including the Royal British Legion before producing the stamps.
It has also published a database of memorials that commemorate those who died in WW1.
