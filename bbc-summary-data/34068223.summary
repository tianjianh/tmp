[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheshire devolution bid outlined by three councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government will be asked to transfer powers to Cheshire as part of a devolution bid which it is claimed could create 112,000 new jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal by Cheshire East, Cheshire West & Chester and Warrington councils aims to improve transport links, build homes and boost business.
An official report said there was a strong ambition to "drive forward the Northern Powerhouse".
But there is disagreement over whether there should be an elected mayor.
Focuses of the plan include Crewe's HS2 hub, Warrington's nuclear sector, and plans to improve transport and infrastructure in Chester, Ellesmere Port and parts of North East Wales.
It is hoped the county will be able to retain business rates generated by new companies, so they could be used to fund the development of new housing.
A Cheshire West and Chester Council report said the plans would help "enhance productivity and deliver real and lasting public service transformation which will support the economic growth ambitions."
Cllr Brian Clarke, member for economic development and infrastucture at Cheshire West, said: "The Cheshire and Warrington sub-region has a long heritage of successfully working together, delivering real economic collaboration and growth.
"A devolution deal will build on these unique economic attributes, distinctive local geography and the drive and determination of both private and public sector partners."
A further proposal will be put forward to establish an Enterprise Zone in Ellesmere Port, to incentivise businesses to relocate to the area.
There is no agreement on whether the bid should include an elected mayor for Cheshire.
The Leader of Cheshire East Council, Michael Jones, is in favour, whilst the leader of Warrington Borough Council, Terry O'Neill, described it as "premature".
