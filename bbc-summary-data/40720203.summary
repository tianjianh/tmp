Callum Green's try put Hull 18-12 ahead at the break after they twice levelled, with Carlos Tuimavave and Albert Kelly responding to Ryan Hall's brace.
Tuimavave's second sparked a try blitz, with further scores coming from Liam Watts, Jamie Shaul and Scott Taylor.
Hull meet the winner of Sunday's semi-final between Wigan and Salford.
A drop goal by man of the match Marc Sneyd, taking the score to 25-12 after 55 minutes, left Leeds with a huge challenge to reach their sixth final in eight years.
Kallum Watkins' pace and power got him on the end of a deft kick from Danny McGuire five minutes later to give the Rhinos hope.

But three tries in 10 minutes from Hull put the result beyond doubt, booking their return to Wembley on Saturday, 26 August.
Ashton Golding's try two minutes from time was mere consolation for Leeds.
At times both sides defended stubbornly, with the poise and class of Hall to finish two first-half tries the highlight of Leeds' attacking exploits.
Hull were spoiled for inspired contributors, with stand-off Kelly creating his try from nothing and then showing supreme patience to put Watts over in the second half.
Tuimavave's two tries were expertly taken, his first in particular as he rose highest to pluck a Sneyd high ball from the air under pressure, while Shaul showed explosive pace to dash 75 yards to help make it 37-18 after 71 minutes.
For Taylor, his try to cap a sensational team performance ensured he marked his 250th career appearance in style.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford told BBC Sport: "It's special. What we've spoken about all season [is defending] that trophy.
"Special mention goes to conditioning and physio staff - I had a full pack of cards. To have that is a credit at this stage of the season.
"We stifled them of field position, fixed up in second period and credit to Marc Sneyd's kicking game."
Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott told BBC Sport: "They were very good. It was a good contest in the first half but, as Lee Radford said, they stifled us in the second half and their kicking game was outstanding.
"A couple of kick tries gave them a numerical advantage, which wasn't insurmountable, but with the lack of field position we didn't have in that second half, I thought they were really good.
"We weren't awful, but they were really good."
