Andy Bishop: Southport part company with player-manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport have parted company with player-manager Andy Bishop after only one win in their first eight National League matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old, who has played three times this season, was appointed in April after a spell as interim boss.
His departure means the club, who say they are "actively seeking applications for the post", will look to appoint their ninth manager since April 2013.
The announcement was made shortly after Saturday's 1-0 loss to Dover.
