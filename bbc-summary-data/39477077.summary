Two unexploded shells which were awaiting disposal by bomb experts were thrown in the sea by a member of the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The explosives were initially found at Hurst Spit near Milford-on-Sea on Thursday night by a passerby.
The shells, which had been placed within a police cordon, then vanished overnight before disposal teams arrived.
Police said the person who had removed the shells had since come forward.
The shells were thrown in an area of the sea not regularly used by bathers.
The Hampshire force said: "We have carried out an assessment of this location and any risk posed by these objects to the public is low."
