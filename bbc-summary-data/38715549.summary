Papy Djilobodji: Sunderland defender denies violent conduct charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland defender Papy Djilobodji has denied a Football Association charge of violent conduct following an incident involving West Brom midfielder Darren Fletcher on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Senegalese's arm appeared to make contact with Fletcher's face in the 86th minute of his side's 2-0 defeat.
The incident was not seen by the match officials but was caught on video.
Djilobodji, 28, will now plead his case before an independent regulatory commission hearing.
The date for the hearing has yet to be announced by the FA.
As the former Chelsea player has been sent off once already this season - against Hull on 19 November - he would face a four-match ban if found guilty.
He would miss the home game against Tottenham on 31 January followed by Crystal Palace (away), Southampton (home) and Everton (away).
