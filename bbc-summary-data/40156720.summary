The 19-year-old is recovering in an Italian hospital after tangling with another rider and hitting a bollard.
Yee, who is due to sit A-Levels this week, is undergoing concussion checks.
Also a gifted track athlete, last week he set the fastest 5,000m time by a British junior since 1981.
Yee, from Brockley, London, was last year tipped by Mo Farah as a future Olympian.
In a statement, British Triathlon said Yee had briefly lost consciousness after the crash.
"Alex is receiving a very high level of care and it is hoped that he will be able to return home in the next few days," the statement added.
