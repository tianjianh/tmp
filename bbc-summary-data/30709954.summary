Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said they struggled to recruit in the UK and held internet interviews for those unable to meet face-to-face.
Some nurses have already started work at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor; Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan and Wrexham Maelor.
A health board spokesman said: "We need to attract qualified nurses."
She added: "During 2014 we recruited over 70 nurses from Spain; 45 of these have now moved to Wales and taken up their posts, with the rest due to join us this year."
