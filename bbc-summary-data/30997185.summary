Llandaff homes plan concern for BBC HQ site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns have been raised by plans to develop hundreds of homes on the site of BBC Wales' Cardiff headquarters.

Llandaff Society said the character of the area "will be very difficult to sustain" as the sale has been agreed on the condition Taylor Wimpey gets permission to build up to 500 homes.
The broadcaster plans to move to a new centre by Cardiff Central rail station.
The sale of the current sites will help fund the new development and staff are expected to move in 2018.
