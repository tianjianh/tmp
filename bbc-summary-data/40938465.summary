Qualifiers: Warrington Wolves 22-8 Halifax

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An acrobatically taken try from Matty Russell helped Warrington overcome Championship side Halifax and maintain their perfect record in The Qualifiers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peta Hiku put the Super League hosts ahead and, after both sides were denied a try by the video referee, Chester Butler made it 4-4 at the break.
Chris Hill restored Wolves' lead, only for Butler to respond again.
Russell brilliantly rose to claim the hosts' third from a cross-field kick, before Andre Savelio completed the win.
Warrington Wolves boss Tony Smith:
"We were a little flat in the first half and we had to respond in the second half and we did. We probably didn't nail a few chances in first half when we were held up two or three times over the line and had some dubious obstruction calls and if you nail those it gives the whole game a different perspective.
"It was a tough game because the ruck was slow and Halifax did what they had to. Credit to how the defended because they knew they needed to slow us down to keep in the game and they were allowed to.
"Playing against a Championship team you learn some stuff, but I thought we had a Championship standard referee today and that's going to happen to us from time to time.
"We have to be able to cope with that and come out on top regardless of that. Halifax haven't given up all year and that's why they are in the position they are in terms of making it to the Qualifiers and Richard Marshall has done a great job with them there."
Halifax boss Richard Marshall:
"We are a proud bunch and I'm a proud coach today and I thought we had the opportunity to win the game.
"In the first half with some smarter decisions with ball we could have scored a couple more tries. We did force the pass, but we had to when you are playing one of the best teams in this competition and in Super League.
"Warrington have some world class players, but I thought our enthusiasm was world class and our attitude to defend for your team-mates was outstanding and that goes a long way with me.
"We didn't win the game, but we certainly got a few wins internally in that performance."
