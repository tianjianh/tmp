The train operator, which runs services between Scotland and London, ran a recruitment fair at Addiewell Prison, West Lothian, this week.
More will be held in prisons across the UK every three months.
Virgin Trains said it wanted to help end the "revolving door syndrome" of reoffending. It is also encouraging other companies to take part.
The company has been actively recruiting ex-offenders since 2013.
Twelve people with convictions were employed by Virgin Trains in 2014 as part of the contract for the West Coast route.
There are currently 27 people working in the business who were recruited through the programme, the firm said.
Kathryn Wildman, who leads recruitment on the West Coast line, said going into prisons had proved a successful way of finding "talented candidates" for jobs in the company.
She said: "This isn't just about helping society and giving people a chance to turn their lives around. It's hiring the best people no matter what their background is.
"We'd urge other employers who might be thinking about this to give it a go."
Virgin Trains has established partnerships with HM Prison Service, the Scottish Prison Service and private prison operators to work with inmates who are nearing the end of their sentences.
Scotland's Justice Secretary, Michael Matheson, said: "Supporting people into work when they come out of custody is an essential part of their reintegration, and helps to reduce the chances of them offending again.
"We are working with the public sector, including the Scottish Prison Service, and private businesses to make it easier for people with convictions to find employment.
"Virgin Trains are very supportive of this work and I am delighted to hear of this latest partnership with HMP Addiewell to tackle the barriers which prevent people from turning their lives around."
