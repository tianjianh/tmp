[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne - who was jailed for perverting the course of justice in 2013 - has been granted a Commons pass, a Freedom of Information Act request has revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Lib Dem MP and ex-wife Vicky Pryce were both jailed after she took his speeding points in 2003.
Some 360 former MPs were granted passes for the Parliamentary estate, according to the Press Association's FOI request.
Labour MP John Mann said Huhne should not have been given the pass.
Mr Mann said: "I do not think someone who has committed a criminal offence that has meant they went to prison should get privileged access to the Houses of Parliament.
"Let them queue with the general public if they want to get in."
Huhne and Pryce both served two months of an eight-month sentence.
Huhne had quit the Cabinet and stood down as Eastleigh MP after pleading guilty.
Speaking after his release, he said prison had been "a humbling and sobering experience".
Also on the passholders list was ex-Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, and Derek Conway, who had the Conservative whip withdrawn and then stepped down as an MP after his employment of his son was heavily criticised.
