Welsh Lib Dems' nurses and smaller class sizes pitch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh Liberal Democrats have promised to create a "Wales that works for you", as they published their assembly election manifesto.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leader Kirsty Williams launched the document, which highlights the party's key priorities in the next assembly term, at a GP's surgery in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.
She said: "People want good schools, good hospitals and a vibrant economy."
The party is pledging more nurses and smaller class sizes, among other plans.
Details: What's in the Welsh Lib Dem manifesto?
Ms Williams said: "Our message is that after 17 years of devolution we need to create a Wales that works for everyone and a government that really gets the basics right.
"We've been listening very carefully to the people of Wales, about how they feel about how the Welsh Government is performing, and there's a lot of frustration out there that devolution hasn't delivered all that it was promised to."
Key pledges in the 104-page manifesto include:
- more nurses on hospital wards
- smaller infant school class sizes
- building 20,000 affordable homes over five years
- a 'small business administration' offering independent advice and finance
- business rate flexibility for councils to boost economic development
The party said it would spend £42m, over five years, ensuring infant school class sizes were "normally" no more than 25 pupils "to give teachers the time to focus on a child's individual needs, which we believe is central to raising standards".
Current rules say there should not be more than 30 in classes for four to seven-year-olds, apart from a few exceptions.
But the latest figures indicated just over 7% of pupils were in classes of more than 30.
The Lib Dems promised to "build" on a bill, introduced by Ms Williams and passed by AMs in February, to ensure hospitals in Wales have sufficient nurses on duty.
The law would be extended to cover maternity and mental heath wards and community care teams.
The party would scrap tuition fees subsidies, with students from Wales instead receiving a living support grant of £2,500 a year.
Students currently pay the first £3,810 a year of tuition fees, with the Welsh Government paying the next £5,190.
This is a tough assembly poll for the Liberal Democrats, whose support collapsed at the 2015 general election leaving them with just one MP in Wales.
They are defending five seats in the Senedd.
This is a huge manifesto, coming in at more than a hundred pages, covering everything from scrapping enterprise zones to setting up a national cyber college to promote online courses.
So what do we look out for? Some of these policies could become reality if there's a repeat of the past five years, and Labour are reliant on the support of another party to get their budgets through every year.
And top of their shopping list in no particular order for the Lib Dems will be more nurses, smaller infant class sizes and a big rise in the number of affordable homes.
If that is the case then much will depend on how much cash they can extract for their home-grown policies as a quid pro quo for supporting another party.
Senior figures say they've done the costings and their main commitments on the NHS will be covered by extra cash going to health anyway, and on the construction of more social housing by not going ahead with a £1bn M4 relief road.
