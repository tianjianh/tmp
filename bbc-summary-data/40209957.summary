[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Williamson lost to Conservative Amanda Solloway in 2010 but won with a majority of over 2,000 votes this time around.
Elsewhere in the county, the Tories took North East Derbyshire after more than 80 years of Labour.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin retained Derbyshire Dales and Labour's Margaret Beckett held Derby South.
Mr Williamson's speech attacked the "gutter press" which, he said, has "smeared Jeremy Corbyn" during his election campaign.
He said he will "continue to work to deliver the sunshine of socialism".
He called for The Sun's political editor to resign for what he said were "smears" against the Labour leader.
Labour also gained High Peak.
Ruth George has become the new MP for the constituency taking the seat from Conservative Andrew Bingham by more than 2,300 votes.
