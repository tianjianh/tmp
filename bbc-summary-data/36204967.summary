The 45-year-old will take up the job in June when he replaces Craig Hogan who is returning home to Australia.
Adams played five Tests between 1999 and 2000, and captained Sussex to three County Championship titles.
After his retirement in 2008, Derbyshire-born Adams coached Sussex and Surrey, and he has also worked with Sri Lanka and the Netherlands.
A Cricket Ireland statement said that Adams' appointment was "another important step for Irish cricket towards its long-stated objective of joining the Test match playing nations".
Adams described the role as a "fantastic opportunity to work with Ireland's emerging talent".
"I hope my experience and knowledge will help all the players and academy coaching staff achieve their potential," added Adams, who also appeared in five one-day internationals for his country.
"The goal will most definitely be to ensure that Ireland head coach John Bracewell has the very best talent supply over the next few years."
Cricket Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth said that Adams' experience would prove invaluable to Irish cricket.
"With Chris' experience of coaching internationally, not to mention as a player in the Test arena with England, he will bring great understanding of what it takes to perform at the highest level," he said.
Holdsworth also paid tribute to Hogan for his "terrific work" in helping turning the Irish academy into a "world-class programme" since it was set up three years ago.
