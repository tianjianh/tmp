Sheen will star in the biopic In High Places, which will tell the story of the mountaineer's ill-fated expedition to Mount Everest in 1924.
Mallory was last seen near the summit with fellow climber Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine. His body was found in 1999.
Kelly Macdonald will play Mallory's wife Ruth, and Andrew Scott, best known as Sherlock's Moriarty, will also star.
He will appear as Mallory's friend and fellow climber Noel Odell, reported Screen Daily.
Writer and director James McEachen described the biopic as "an epic story about the uncompromising nature of character and the sometimes overwhelming power of dreams."
He said: "I have been fascinated by George Mallory for as long as I can remember. That led directly to my own Himalayan climbs in the 90s, including leading an expedition to 27,766 foot Makalu in 1992.
"It was this direct experience that gave me a deep-seated respect for the bold imagination and war-hardened bravery that Mallory and his companions displayed in their quest for the summit of Everest - long before the age of Gore-Tex and titanium."
Shooting is due start in South Tyrol, India, London and Cologne later this year.
