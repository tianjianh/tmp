The discovery was made at about 15:30 local time on Saturday in Ardclough, a village south of Celbridge.
People walking along the Grand Canal spotted a suitcase in the water. When they looked closer at it they discovered there was a body in it.
The man is believed to have suffered a violent death and a murder investigation is under way.
Police believe the body was not there for more than a few days, and are appealing for witnesses who saw anything in the area between last Thursday and Saturday to come forward with information.
The area was cordoned off overnight ahead of the arrival of the state pathologist and the Garda (Irish police) Forensic Bureau.
The Garda underwater unit was also due at the scene on Sunday.
