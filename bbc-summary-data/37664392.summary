[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 0-1 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon climbed into the League One play-off places courtesy of victory at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The only goal arrived during a first half of Dons dominance as Neal Ardley's men extended their unbeaten run to eight league matches.
It was provided by Tom Elliott when he nodded in after Jon Meades had headed a 10th-minute George Francomb corner back across goal.
Francomb's next corner almost led to the Dons doubling their lead as Chris Whelpdale's header was saved before Jake Reeves' follow-up was blocked.
Only the combination of Posh goalkeeper Luke McGee and the woodwork came to the hosts' rescue just before the half-hour. McGee saved Elliott's initial effort before the frontman guided the follow-up against a post.
It took Posh 43 minutes to test Dons keeper James Shea. Callum Chettle's low shot drew ironic cheers from home fans and the hosts also offered little in the second period until Andrew Hughes saw a stoppage-time header tipped over.
Elliott came closest to doubling the lead after the break when his lob bounced off the far post but his earlier goal proved enough.
