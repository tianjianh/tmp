The DR Congo side were eliminated from Africa's premier club competition on Wednesday, losing 3-1 on aggregate to Wydad Casablanca.
Now they must try to salvage some pride by coming through a play-off to reach the group stage of the second tier competition.
Tunisians Stade Gabesien stand in their way over two legs, to be played on 6-8 May and 17-18 May.
Also dropping down to the Confederation Cup play-offs are the competition's reigning champions Etoile du Sahel. The Tunisians lost on penalties to Enyimba in their Champions League tie, also on Wednesday.
Etoile, the only to win all five Confederation of African Football club competitions, had fought back to win the second leg 3-0 only to fail in the shootout.
TP Mazemebe and Etoile and six other other Champions League round-of-16 losers make up half of the play-off field.
The other eight teams in the draw survived a three-round Confederation Cup elimination process.
Tunisian teams have dominated the 13-year-old competition with CS Sfaxien lifting the trophy three times and Etoile twice. Moroccan clubs have been the second most successful in the Confederation Cup.

MO Bejaia (Algeria) vs Esperance (Tunisia)
