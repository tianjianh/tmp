Shane Glynn, editor of BBC Sport NI, said: "Uruguay will be a tough test for Northern Ireland.
"They will be one of the sides who fancy their chances of winning the World Cup - and with players of the calibre of Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani, why not?
"I'm delighted BBC Northern Ireland has secured the rights to show the Uruguay game live on the Red Button and via our BBC Sport NI website.
"We will also broadcast on the website an extended highlights package of the friendly match against Chile the following week."
Patrick Nelson, chief executive of the Irish Football Association, said: "We are delighted that BBC Northern Ireland have obtained the rights to show this game live on their Red Button and internet services. Northern Ireland fans all over the UK will be able to see live how well our team does against one of the World Cup favourites."
