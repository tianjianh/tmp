Rangers eased past Dunfermline Athletic to reach the Scottish League Cup quarter-finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenny Miller fired the hosts ahead early on and Bruno Alves' free-kick soon doubled their advantage.
Alfredo Morelos followed Alves in getting his first Rangers goal and James Tavernier knocked home the hosts' fourth before the half-hour.
Daniel Candeias also netted a maiden goal for the Ibrox side with a free-kick before Morelos got his second.
Rangers will visit Glasgow neighbours Partick Thistle in the last eight.
Morelos, Miller and Graham Dorrans combined for Rangers' opener with Miller firing high into the net after Dorrans' effort had been saved by goalkeeper Sean Murdoch.
Miller, who took over the captaincy from Lee Wallace after the left-back was a late withdrawal from the side, netted again from an offside position.
The second goal soon arrived, however, as Portugal defender Alves curled a 25-yard free-kick past the flailing Murdoch.
Dunfermline almost pulled a goal back with Declan McManus' free-kick beating Rangers keeper Jak Alnwick but coming back off the crossbar.
Miller set up two goals in quick succession with passes that allowed Morelos and Tavernier to find the net.
Pars boss Allan Johnston introduced defender Jean Yves Mvoto for attacker David Hopkirk as the visitors made it until the break without losing any more goals.
But Rangers found their rhythm again in the second period with midfielder Candeias taking over free-kick duties from Alves, who had been replaced by Danny Wilson, and beating Murdoch from a similar distance to his countryman's earlier strike.
And Morelos pounced to knock home after Murdoch parried a drive by Tavernier.
