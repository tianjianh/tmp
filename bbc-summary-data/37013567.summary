A pair of Queen Victoria's silk stockings - which contain just one small ladder despite being 170 years old - have gone under the hammer.

The monarch, who cut a severe figure in black in later life, wore the delicate cream garments in the 1840s, when she was in her 20s.
The stockings, which have Queen Victoria's initials embroidered in red, were sold for £220.
Newcastle auctioneer Anderson & Garland had estimated they would go for £150.
A spokesman said there had been global interest in the undergarments, currently owned by a private collector.
Fred Wyrley-Birch, a specialist at the auction house, said: "When I was shown the stockings by the current owner, I was immediately reminded of a scene in the film The Young Victoria where Prince Albert knelt at Queen Victoria's feet and rolled her silk stockings up her legs.
"It contradicts the image we usually have of Queen Victoria as a rather large elderly lady dressed in black."
Items of the monarch's clothing were distributed to members of the royal household following her death in 1901.
In 2015 a pair of Queen Victoria's bloomers sold for £12,000, while in 2010 a pair of her stockings went for £700.
