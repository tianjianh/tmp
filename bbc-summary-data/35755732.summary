[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has defended Labour's campaigning on the EU referendum, saying his party is pushing for "a social Europe".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour is backing the Remain campaign, and Mr Corbyn - who has often been critical of the EU - has been urged to make a more high-profile case.
At a meeting of MPs, he was told the referendum could be "lost" unless the party made a more "passionate" case.
His spokesman said he would be making a "big" speech on the EU "in due course".
Speaking on a visit to Dagenham, Mr Corbyn said there were issues on which the EU should be challenged, but "at the moment we're campaigning because we want this sense of unity across Europe".
Labour is campaigning "on issues of social justice across Europe" including the social chapter, which sets out EU policies on workers' rights, and the Working Time Directive governing the hours employees can work, he said.
Mr Corbyn said he had held meetings with socialist parties across Europe on how they can support his campaign.
During Labour's leadership race, Mr Corbyn refused to rule out campaigning to leave the EU, but after winning the contest he confirmed his party would back Remain after calls from MPs to clarify his position.
At Monday evening's Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, backbench MP Barry Sheerman criticised Labour's campaign so far and warned of the need to mobilise the party's machine.
Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, shadow chancellor and Corbyn-ally John McDonnell said Labour had been "crowded out" with Conservative splits dominating the headlines and said it was time "for us to come out a bit more in terms of explaining our views".
