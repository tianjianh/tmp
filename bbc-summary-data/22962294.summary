[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people have been rescued from quicksand in Morecambe Bay in the last two weeks, prompting a warning from coastguards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 14-year-old girl stuck up to her waist on sands near Silverdale was rescued on 1 June.
On 16 June teams from the coastguard, police, ambulance, fire and RNLI were called out after a man and woman became stuck at Sandside.
Coastguard Chris Turner said: "It does go to show the dangers."
He added: "Luckily, those that have become stuck in recent weeks haven't been seriously hurt.
"With the summer holidays fast approaching, we're urging people to take extra care."
He said anyone who gets stuck should try to spread their weight, avoid moving and stay calm.
Rather than putting themselves at risk by attempting to rescue others, Mr Turner said people who spot others in trouble should call 999 and ask for the coastguard.
