Hannah and Andy Bailey, from Witney, asked friends on Facebook to donate clothes, tents and sleeping bags for the Crying Out for Calais project.
They were "overwhelmed" by the support and have filled up Mrs Bailey's car with supplies.
They will stay near the camp, housing up to 5,000 migrants and asylum seekers, until Friday.
Mrs Bailey told BBC Radio Oxford: "We hope we can meet a range of people and spend some time showing we respect them and get to know them.
"We weren't planning on people giving us support but we have been overwhelmed. The Renault Clio is full to the brim.
"We have seen a lot of negativity in the media and we wanted to bring some positivity."
Mr Bailey works for a charity and Mrs Bailey works at a school.
