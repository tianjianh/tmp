NI anorexia sufferer launches High Court bid to block treatment in England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An anorexic woman from Northern Ireland has launched a legal bid to block attempts by health authorities to send her to England for further treatment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawyers issued emergency proceedings at the High Court in Belfast after she was about to be moved against her wishes.
But the bid was put on hold after the health trust involved agreed to postpone the move until a separate tribunal decides her status.
The patient is currently being detained under mental health legislation.
A mental health review panel is expected to determine on Friday whether the woman, who cannot be identified, should remain in the unit.
If the tribunal decides her detention is still necessary the legal battle over the transfer to England will resume in court next week.
The judge was told that the woman is in a "fairly chronic state of health".
However, she is opposing a decision that she should be moved out of Northern Ireland to undergo continued treatment.
The case was adjourned following the pledge given on behalf of the trust.
Counsel for the woman successfully sought anonymity for her, based on her right to privacy, medical condition and current status.
The judge imposed a ban on reporting the names of either the woman or the trust.
