Janet Commins was killed in Flint, with a man previously imprisoned after admitting her manslaughter.
North Wales Police said Stephen Anthony Hough, from Flint, was arrested in Essex on Sunday and had not previously been held in connection with the case.
He is due to appear before Llandudno magistrates on Wednesday.
Janet's family is being supported by officers, while the force has also made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Det Supt Iestyn Davies said: "There have been significant developments to assist police investigations of this nature in the past 40 years and significant changes in the way we approach murder investigations.
"This man has not previously been arrested in connection with the 1976 investigation.
"A dedicated team of officers have been working on this investigation and, as a result, further evidence has come to light which has caused us to review all the circumstances surrounding the initial investigation."
