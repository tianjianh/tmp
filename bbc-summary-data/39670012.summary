A centre which celebrates Pembrokeshire's wartime history has unveiled a full size replica cockpit of a Sunderland flying boat.

Made by local volunteers, it gives a simulated experience of flying over the Milford Haven waterway.
It has taken two years to build and has been funded by a grant from the Ministry of Defence.
A large-scale model of an entire flying boat was also unveiled at Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre.
The RAF's Air Officer for Wales, Air Commodore Adrian Williams, said: "Pembroke Dock is really important to the history of the Sunderland, and although there's a full-scale Sunderland aircraft in the RAF Museum at Hendon, what we've done here in Pembroke Dock is really unique."
