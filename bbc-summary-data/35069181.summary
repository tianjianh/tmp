A senior police officer has been suspended following an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood Supt Gerry Murray, who is head of road policing in Northern Ireland, was suspended from his post last month.
The 60-year-old, who recently featured in a BBC documentary, is one of the PSNI's longest serving police officers.
Last year, he led a group of officers as they marched for the first time at the St Patrick's Parade in New York.
The officers walked alongside members of An Garda Siochana.
