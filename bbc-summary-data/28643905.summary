The detached cottage in Ceinws, Powys, was bought by the Welsh government for Â£149,000 and will be knocked down.
April's parents said on their Facebook page it was "a huge weight off our minds", and added the house had been "a constant reminder".
Bridger, 48, abducted April as she played with friends near her home in Machynlleth on 1 October 2012.
He was jailed for life in May 2013 for murdering the girl in a sexually motivated attack.
April's body has never been found, but blood and fragments of bone consistent with a young human skull were found at the house he rented.
Police believe Bridger dismembered the girl and dumped her body parts at locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding the house.
During the trial, the court heard how child sex abuse images were found on his laptop, along with images of children from the area.
Bridger had claimed he had run over April in his car and could not remember where he disposed of her body. But a jury found him guilty of her murder and he was jailed for life.
On Monday, it emerged that the Welsh government had bought the house Bridger had rented for the price its owners paid for it in 2008.
April's parents Coral and Paul Jones said on their Facebook page: "The Welsh government has bought the house in Machynlleth connected to the death of our daughter, April.
"This is a huge weight off our minds, as it can now be demolished. The loss of our beautiful daughter was bad enough, but the house has been a constant reminder of the tragic events.
"Our family want to thank the Welsh government for listening to us and for understanding our need to see the house demolished."
A spokesman for the Welsh government said: "After discussions with the family, the Welsh government has purchased the property in Machynlleth connected to the death of April Jones.
"The Welsh government will now work with the local authority, the Jones family and the local community on the most appropriate future for the site, following demolition of the property."
Montgomeryshire MP Glyn Davies said: "This house witnessed a truly horrific act which shocked a small community and appalled the world. It is good news that it is to be demolished."
