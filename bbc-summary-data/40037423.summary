Chelsea captain John Terry "could not care less" about the furore over his substitution against Sunderland.

Terry received a guard of honour from team-mates as he left in the minute matching his shirt number, 26.
Thousands of pounds were won on the unusually timed substitution and the Football Associated has asked the betting companies involved for information on bets they received.
"All I care about is celebrating with my Chelsea fans," Terry said.
One bookmaker said it had paid out on three bets, with one customer claiming he had been paid at 100-1 on a Â£25 stake.
The 36-year-old, who is leaving the club at the end of the season, revealed the idea to come off at that time in his final Premier League game with the club was his.
He said: "I wanted to play 26 minutes because the shirt number means a lot to me and the supporters, so as long as they are happy - and I was over the moon with the reception - I promise you I could not care less.
"Me and the fans have a wonderful rapport and have done for 22 years. Nothing that people write or say can ever get in the way of that."
The former England defender, who joined Chelsea's youth academy in 1995, hopes to make his 718th and last appearance for the Blues in Saturday's FA Cup final against Arsenal.
