[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Hutchison, 50, from Inverness, was jailed for six months and banned from driving for five years on Wednesday.
He appeared at Inverness Sherriff Court after being caught six times over the legal limit whilst disqualified and without insurance on 23 February.
Hutchison was previously banned from driving on 10 February.
He had been disqualified after being found seven times over the limit in a car park outside his home revving the engine.
But 13 days later, he was caught back behind the wheel over the legal alcohol limit again. He also admitted two previous convictions for similar offences between 2007 and 2008.
Defence solicitor, Marc Dickson, said his client had made the short journey to a supermarket and was on his way back when caught by police.
He said: "He suffered depression and became alcohol-dependant when he lost his employment."
