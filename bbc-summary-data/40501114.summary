Jessica Urbano has not been heard from since the 14 June blaze that claimed the lives of at least 80 people.
She had been sleeping in the family's flat on the 20th floor while her mother and and sister were at work and her father visited a neighbour.
A vigil was held in Avondale Park, west London, at about 16.30 BST on Tuesday.
Balloons bearing messages, such as "God bless you" were released by dozens of children, many wearing "Happy Birthday Jessie" T-shirts.
Jessica's parents thanked the crowd for coming.
