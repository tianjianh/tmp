Around 600 out of 5,100 homes have been built on Priors Hall Park in Corby since 2010, but its developers and landowner are in administration.
One home owner said the site - once promoted in an advert voiced by broadcaster Sandi Toksvig - was an "expensive disappointment".
Administrators Deloitte confirmed a new investor was being sought.
The Priors Hall Park website promises an "attractive setting" and "superb rural walks through the rolling Northamptonshire countryside", which it re-branded as North Londonshire.
A radio advert, voiced by Ms Toksvig, described it as "a friendly place to bring up the kids".
"If you think you've grown out of London, see how you could grow into North Londonshire," it said.
Hughie Coull has lived at Priors Hall for five years. He said: "It looked nice and I thought there'd be country walks, a pub, shops and play areas for the kids but we've got nothing."
Another home owner, Julie McCallum, said: "When I look at the advert now it actually makes me laugh.
"It cost us a lot of money to move. What we thought we were buying and what we actually got were two very different things.
"It's been an expensive disappointment for us".
Corby Developments Limited and BeLa Partnership Limited called in Deloitte last October.
A spokesman for Deloitte, said: "We appreciate that some residents are frustrated by the progress of some of the amenities promised by the developers.
"We can confirm that material progress is being made, particularly in respect of the community centre and the district centre.
"House builders are continuing to build, house sales remain strong and the estates team is busy maintaining the site.
"We are now working to find a new investor to complete the development and have already had significant interest."
