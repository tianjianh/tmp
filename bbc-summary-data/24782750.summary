Anthony Grant's superb fourth-minute strike from the edge of the box put the Alex in front.
But the Chairboys levelled against the run of play when Cowan-Hall flicked Dean Morgan's cross into the bottom corner in the 37th minute.
Max Kretzschmar's free-kick went close for the home side and Brad Inman missed a late chance to put Crewe through.
The two sides will meet again to decide who goes through to the next round on Tuesday, 19 November.
