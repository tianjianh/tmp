Aslef suspends Southern rail strike ballot among drivers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's biggest rail union has suspended a strike ballot among its members who work for Southern railway, because of "technical difficulties".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aslef had begun asking its members if they wanted to take industrial action in the dispute over driver-only trains.
The result of the ballot was due to be announced within two weeks, but the union confirmed it would now reissue ballot papers to almost 1,000 drivers.
Southern said it hoped to sit down with union officials to resolve the dispute.
The RMT union is also balloting its driver members for strikes, with voting closing on 18 November.
It has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with Southern over changes to the role of conductors.
The latest 48-hour walkout involving conductors ended at midnight on Saturday, with further stoppages planned in the coming weeks, in the run-up to Christmas and over the new year.
Southern wants drivers, rather than conductors, to operate carriage doors at certain times.
