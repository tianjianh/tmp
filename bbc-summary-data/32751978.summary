A familiar feature in Cardiff Bay for more than 20 years is relocating after being sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 2000 Lightship, a Christian centre funded by Associated British Ports and Cardiff council, will move up the Severn estuary next week.
It was put on the market last year after a "harsh economic market", its chaplain Rev John Stacy Marks said.
"The board of trustees are relieved that the boat remains afloat and will continue to serve a purpose," he added.
