Vince, 25, earned his first England cap with the start of the first Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley.
Smith, 33, who captained Durham to the County Championship Division One title in 2009, will stand in as skipper for Nottinghamshire's visit on Sunday.
"It makes sense that he picks up the reins," director cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent.
White continued: "He has a lot of experience and he's the sort of character who can deal with captaincy really well.
"He's been a consistent performer with us during his time here - I'm sure he'll be in the runs again soon."
