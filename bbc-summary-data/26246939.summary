The deal will earn the 28-year-old Manchester United striker more than £70m over the next five-and-a-half years.
His weekly wage is more than president of the United States Barack Obama earns in a year, but boxer Floyd Mayweather's earnings knockout Rooney's.
BBC Sport breaks down what all the numbers mean...
£15.6m- Wayne Rooney's annual wage eclipses the reported salary of Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo (£14.25m) and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, whose reported wage is £12.08m a year, according to the 2013 Forbes rich list.

£160,000 - The figure he will have to spend once tax and national insurance contributions have been taken off his £300,000-a-week wage.
£30,000 - The average weekly wage of a Premier League footballer in 2011-12, according to statistics compiled by Deloitte's sports business group.
£517 - The national average weekly wage of a person working in the United Kingdom. The amount the prime minister earns pales in comparison to what Rooney will pocket, with David Cameron collecting around £2,740 each week.
65 - The amount of weeks it would take Barack Obama, the president of the United States, to make what Rooney earns in just seven days, based on his £240,000-a-year wage.
1885 - The first year that it became possible to be paid to play football.
£4 - The maximum wage introduced by the Football League in 1901. Although it may look small by today's standards, at the time it was twice the average wage of a skilled tradesman.
£20 - The amount that was in Sir Tom Finney's final pay packet before the former Preston winger hung up his boots in 1960.
60 - The number of years it took until the maximum wage was abolished in 1961. Shortly after it was removed, former Fulham and England inside forward Johnny Haynes became the first £100-a-week player.
£1,200 - The amount goalkeeper Peter Shilton made each week in 1979 when he became the best-paid footballer in Britain by signing a new contract at Nottingham Forest.

£10,000 -  The first player believed to earn a five-figure sum each week was Chris Sutton, when the striker joined Blackburn Rovers from Norwich City in 1994.
£100,000 - Sol Campbell left Tottenham for London rivals Arsenal in 2001, signing a contract that would see the former England defender become Britain's first footballer to earn a six-figure sum each week.
£200,000 - The estimated weekly wage Carlos Tevez earned at Manchester City when he joined the Blues in 2009.
Lamborghini Veneno - reputedly the world's most expensive supercar. Rooney would have to save up for a few months to amass the £2.7m required.
A year's salary would buy 208 terraced houses in Croxteth, Liverpool where he grew up.
A week's pay would buy 563 season tickets for family and friends at Old Trafford or 33,333 copies of Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography.
£74.85m - Pop superstar Madonna tops the latest list of richest celebrities according to Forbes, having made an estimated £74.85m between June 2012 and June 2013, just over £1.4m a week.
£34.73m - During the same period, Canadian singer Justin Bieber earned an estimated £34.73m, while actor Leonardo Di Caprio earned £23.35m.
£25.75m - American footballer Aaron Rodgers is the world's highest paid athlete, based on wage/winnings, say Forbes. The Green Bay Packers quarterback collected £25.75m between June 2012 and June 2013.
£20.36m - Boxer Floyd Mayweather made the most in wages/winnings outside of the NFL, while British Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton took home £15.57m during the same period.
