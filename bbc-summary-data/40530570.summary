Normandy landings veteran awarded France's highest honour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A veteran of the Normandy landings has been awarded France's highest honour for his role in helping to liberate the country from German occupation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Irvine Rae, 93, was due to be presented with the National Order of the Legion of Honour at Edinburgh Castle in January with nine other men who took part in the D-Day landings in France.
However, the Fife veteran was unable to attend due to a broken hip.
So, the French Consulate rearranged a special presentation ceremony for him.
He received the honour at Leuchars military base in Fife on Thursday.
Emmanuel Cocher, the French consul general in Scotland, presented Mr Rae with the award.
Mr Rae, who lives in Tayport, said: "Despite what I did in France in the Royal Engineers, I still can't quite understand why I'm getting this - to me it was just normal work in the course of military service for my country.
"Of course, I'm very pleased about it - it's a wonderful gift and a great honour."
Mr Rae was called up in 1942 at the age of 18, when he was an apprentice lithographer with John Avery Printers in Aberdeen, and was assigned to the Royal Engineers.
He joined 514 Field Survey Company, 15 Map Reproduction Section.
In the lead-up to Operation Overlord, he was involved in survey planning, production of every map likely to be required in northern France, organisation and preparation of equipment and the planning and training for their landing.
On June 7 1944, D Day +1, aged 20, Sgt Rae sailed from Portsmouth with three men as his section's advance party on board HMS Glenroy, carrying all their maps and equipment.
They then transferred onto craft for their landing on the Normandy beach known as Sword and over several days advanced inland, safely reaching the farm where they were to set up and wait for the rest of their section to join them.
Collecting information from Army Field Survey, RAF, resistance groups and the local French people, Sgt Rae redrew the frontline positions on the maps and printed off copies, which he was involved in delivering to the front line.
As the war progressed, with 15 Map Reproduction Section, Sgt Rae advanced through northern France, Belgium and into Germany, continuing to support the front line with updated maps.
Mr Rae, who has recovered well from his broken hip, said: "The French people were very, very nice - very helpful.
"My spoken French wasn't very good but they helped me out - it maybe took half an hour sometimes but we got there in the end.
"They were very amenable to what we were doing there to help them."
Later, Sgt Rae was redeployed to Italy, Palestine, Egypt and Greece.
The Legion d'Honneur was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte in recognition of both military and civilian merit.
Membership of the Legion is technically restricted to French nationals but foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds may also receive the award.
