After a level-par 72, six off the lead, in the foursomes on day one, the pair shot a six-under 66 in the fourballs but it was one too many for the cut.
World number three Jason Day and world number nine Rickie Fowler carded a 68 but missed the cut by two shots.
Sweden's Jonas Blixt and Cameron Smith of Australia lead by one at 15 under.
The tournament returns to foursomes for the third round, with the halfway cut reducing the 80-team field to 42 for the weekend.
It is the first official team event on the PGA Tour since 1981.
Englishman Rose, the 2013 US Open champion, and Open champion Stenson of Sweden needed to birdie the final hole at TPC Louisiana but the Ryder Cup partners both found the water at the par five.
The partnership set a Ryder Cup record of 12 birdies in 16 holes at Gleneagles in 2014, but Stenson said of their showing in Louisiana: "You want to be in the hole with two chances as much as possible. At times we didn't live up to that. We left each other hanging on a few occasions."
England's Ian Poulter and Australia's former US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy had eight birdies in their 66 and are six shots off the pace.
Andrew "Beef" Johnston made the cut on the number at seven under in partnership with American Kyle Reiffers, but Luke Donald, Greg Owen, Jamie Donaldson, Tyrrell Hatton and Russell Knox were other British players who failed to qualify.
