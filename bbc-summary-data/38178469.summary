[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton moved top of the Championship and extended their unbeaten league run to 14 games with a win against 10-man Leeds United at the Amex Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glenn Murray put the Seagulls in front from the penalty spot after Kalvin Phillips was sent off for handling on the line midway through the first half.
Despite dominating, the hosts only sealed victory with Tomer Hemed's late penalty after Lewis Dunk was fouled.
Leeds defended resolutely but rarely troubled the division's best defence.
Brighton, who go two points ahead of second-placed Newcastle, were top of the table at the same stage last season following a 21-game unbeaten run at the start of the campaign.
The Seagulls eventually missed out on automatic promotion to the Premier League, finishing third on goal difference behind Middlesbrough and champions Burnley.
However, Chris Hughton's men are now eight points clear of Reading in third, and three of their remaining four league games this month are against teams in the lower half of the division.
Their task against Leeds became easier when midfielder Phillips blocked Dunk's goalbound effort with his arm and Murray stepped up to smash home his 12th league goal of the season - all of which have come at home.
The striker, on loan from Bournemouth, had more opportunities in a one-sided first half, heading just wide and seeing his looping effort tipped over by visiting goalkeeper Rob Green.
Brighton were made to wait until the 83rd minute to add to their tally when Kyle Bartley tangled with fellow defender Dunk in the area - Israel striker Hemed sending Green the wrong way from the spot.
Fourth-placed Leeds had won five of their previous six Championship games before their visit to the south coast, but could drop out of the play-offs if results go against them on Saturday.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"I am delighted with the result and the performance.
"The only negative was that there was too big a gap between the first goal and the second. Anything can happen and in that period we didn't create more opportunities.
"In the last four or five games we have not been at our best but we have kept picking up results."
Leeds boss Garry Monk:
"I'm frustrated. Brighton are a very good side but had we kept 11 men on the pitch it could have been different.
"Brighton deserved to win, but we didn't do ourselves justice.
"It was a tough night and we didn't make it easy for ourselves."
