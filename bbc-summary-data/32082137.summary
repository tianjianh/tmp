China has announced a new initiative to help bring to justice corrupt officials who have fled overseas.

The plan, called Sky Net, starts next month as part of efforts spearheaded by President Xi Jinping to crack down on rampant corruption.
It will co-ordinate investigations of offshore companies and underground banks that transfer money overseas.
China is increasingly seeking international co-operation to tackle corruption and track down suspects.
The Xinhua state news agency said 680 people suspected of economic crimes were repatriated to China in the second half of last year.
Some 150 economic fugitives are believed to be living in the US alone to escape prosecution.
Officials said Sky Net will mean there is nowhere to hide from the law.
A number of senior officials have been prosecuted and jailed in the anti-corruption campaign launched after Mr Xi became the head of the ruling party in 2012.
He has pledged to pursue both "tiger and flies" - high-ranking and minor officials - in his anti-corruption drive.
