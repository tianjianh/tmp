Britain's top tennis executive has resigned to take up a similar position in his homeland at Tennis Canada.

Lawn Tennis Association chief executive Michael Downey will serve a six-month notice period that will see him remain in place until after Wimbledon.
"I've been honoured to have led the LTA over the last three years," he said.
"I am hugely proud of the foundations the team at the LTA have laid in order to turn participation in Britain's beloved sport around. "
He added: "It's an exciting time for tennis in this country and I look forward to the next six months, maintaining the momentum we've built in our continued mission to get more people playing tennis, more often."

Three and a half years in a role such as this is often not long enough to leave much of a mark, but after an uncertain start, Michael Downey has left his imprint on British tennis.
The performance department was allowed to remain in a state of flux for far too long, but with Simon Timson now at the helm, the LTA has a man who in the same role at UK Sport oversaw Britain's stunningly successful Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games.
There has been a rise in the number of people playing tennis under Downey's watch and he certainly brought a phenomenal work ethic with him. Given the salary on offer and a potentially bright future for the sport, there is sure to be a lot of interest in succeeding him.
