Mayor of Weymouth and Portland's car and chauffeur scrapped

A Dorset mayor's car and chauffeur have been scrapped in a bid to save the council money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mayor of Weymouth and Portland, Councillor Richard Kosior, will now have to use a his own car, or hire a taxi or limousine and driver, depending on the type of engagement he attends.
It comes after former mayor Christine James chose not to use the service and instead opted for her own transport.
The annual cost of running a car and providing a chauffeur was Â£21,000.
However, providing alternative transport for the last financial year was about Â£3,100, the borough council's scrutiny and performance committee said.
"Therefore there is the potential to make a significant budget saving in this area," a committee report said.
Mr Kosior, who was elected mayor on 19 May, said: "In these days of austerity and council cuts we can't be seen to be squandering money on chauffeuring me to various functions."
Hired taxis or cars would bear the coat of arms of the borough "for that sense of occasion", he added.
He said he had asked for a review in six months to ensure the new format was still saving cash.
