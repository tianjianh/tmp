Alessandra, 27, made just 11 appearances in his one season with Rochdale and spent time on loan at York last term, scoring twice in 11 games.
The Manchester-born attacker's most prolific spell was at Plymouth, where he scored 25 goals in 101 games.
"He's a good footballer, he scores goals, he's intelligent and he's ambitious," boss Craig Hignett said.
"I wanted to add goals to the squad and I've gone out and tried to find players who will fit in to how we play and what we want to do."
