Mourinho had claimed officials were "afraid" to award his team penalties after Robert Madley denied the Blues a spot-kick in a 3-1 loss to Southampton.
It was announced on Wednesday that the 52-year-old had also been given a suspended one-match stadium ban.
However, the Portuguese will not face further punishment from the FA.
The governing body is less concerned about criticism of itself than that aimed at individuals and match officials, given this could call into question their integrity.
On Thursday, Mourinho said: "I'm happy I don't have an electronic tag.
"£50,000 is a disgrace. The possibility of getting a stadium ban is astonishing."
Mourinho also had another dig at Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger - without naming him.
He felt aggrieved Wenger went unpunished for calling referee Mike Dean "weak" and "naive" following Arsenal's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea last month.
Mourinho claimed the FA had set a dangerous precedent by rescinding a red card given to Arsenal's Gabriel, who had been sent off for kicking out at Chelsea striker Diego Costa.
Wenger also faced no action after pushing Mourinho in the Stamford Bridge technical area in October 2014.
"Afraid costs £50,000. Weak and naive - you can do it," added Mourinho, who signed a new four-year deal at Chelsea in August.
"We can push people in the technical area. We can, no problem."
Later, in an interview with the BBC's Dan Walker, to be shown on Saturday's Football Focus, Mourinho reiterated his unhappiness with the FA.
When asked if his relationship with English football's governing body could be fixed, he said: "It's not my relationship with the FA, it's their relationship towards me.
"You should analyse what's happening with me, compare it with other managers. Do you think a word is comparable with a push in the eyes of everyone?
"I can't say anything because the next time I speak, seriously a stadium ban, then after that, an electronic tag."
Last month, Mourinho was cleared by the FA of making discriminatory comments to former club doctor Eva Carneiro.
He was also charged last season for claiming there was a "campaign" to influence referees' decisions against his Chelsea side.
Mourinho was also given a formal warning for comments before the Blues' 2-0 win at Stoke on 22 December 2014.
Chelsea entertain Aston Villa on Saturday (15:00 BST) seeking a third Premier League win in nine games after a poor start to the season.
The reigning champions are 16th in the table after losing four out of eight top-flight games.
Mourinho has said he will only resign if he loses the backing of the players, with club captain John Terry stating the squad remain firmly behind the manager.
Chelsea subsequently took the unusual step of reiterating their "full support" in a statement on the club website.
Asked by Walker for the reasons for the bad start to the campaign, Mourinho said: "There's an accumulation of factors which I'm not ready to discuss."
Jose Mourinho's £50,000 sanction was the seventh time he has been fined by the FA in 10 years, with those punishments totalling £181,000. Figures published in March showed that Mourinho earns approximately £13.2m (18m euro) a year.
On that basis, the latest fine is
15 October, 2015 - £50,000: Mourinho had claimed officials were "afraid" to award his team penalties.
28 January, 2015 - £25,000: He made comments claiming there was a "campaign" to influence referees' decisions against his Chelsea side.
8 May, 2014 - £10,000: Mourinho was fined for comments after his side's Premier League game against Sunderland on 19 April. He "congratulated" referee Mike Dean after Chelsea lost.
10 April, 2014 - £8,000: Mourinho was sent off in the 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa. He was dismissed after walking on to the pitch to speak to referee Chris Foy after Ramires was red-carded.
24 October, 2013 - £8,000: Mourinho was fined for "improper conduct" in his side's Premier League match against Cardiff. He was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting.
10 August, 2005 - £75,000 (reduced from £200,000): Mourinho was fined over his role in the 'tapping-up' of Arsenal defender Ashley Cole.
9 June, 2005 - £5,000: He was charged for comments made after the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester United. Mourinho was unhappy that Sir Alex Ferguson spoke to referee Neale Barry as the teams left the pitch at half-time.
During his time at Chelsea, Mourinho has also been fined £8,900 by European football's governing body Uefa.
31 March, 2005 - £8,900 (plus two-match touchline ban): The charges relate to Chelsea's Champions League tie against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on 23 February. Mourinho claimed he saw Frank Rijkaard speaking to referee Anders Frisk.
Thursday's London Evening Standard claimed Mourinho is fighting to stay in control of the dressing room with several players increasingly unhappy with his handling of the club.
The report alleges a "significant section" of the first-team squad have become unsettled by the manager's public criticism of players and backroom staff.
"What they write is an absolute disgrace," Mourinho told Football Focus.
"I don't need to repeat what the players are saying over the international break, they don't have the obligation to say this.
"I'd say every player had the chance to go to the press with their national team, but they think about Chelsea, their manager - and I think it's a disgrace the lengths people go to disturb people working."
Dan Walker's interview with Jose Mourinho will be shown on Football Focus on Saturday starting at 12:10 BST.
