Welsh Olympic boxer Joe Cordina has confirmed he plans to turn professional in the "near future."

Cordina lost a split decision to Hurshid Tojibaev in the last-16 of the lightweight division at Rio 2016.
The 24-year-old, who won bronze the 2014 Commonwealth Games, said there were a number of factors to consider before turning professional.
"As it stands I'm still a GB boxer, still in camp but in the near future I will be turning professional," he said.
"I couldn't put a date on it. There's a lot of things that can affect things when you turn pro.
"You don't get the support from the lottery and UK Sport, you're on your own and it's a tough call."
Having achieved his goals of competing at the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, Cordina said his ultimate ambition would be winning a world title.
Cordina knows two-weight world champion Joe Calzaghe and trains in the same gym, St Joseph's in Newport, as IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby.
"I spar with him [Selby] quite a lot leading up to fights," Cordina told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"He's someone you look to and if I want any advice I'm sure he'd give it.
"Same with Joe Calzaghe, if I look for any advice of him I'm sure he would pass it on.
"There's some big fighters in Wales that are coming through. You've got Liam Williams, Andrew Selby, Craig Evans and Nathan Cleverly's won a world title.
"Eventually when I do turn over I can follow in their footsteps."
Promoter Eddie Hearn said this week that he has talks planned with several members of the Team GB squad for the 2016 Olympics. He previously stated to BBC Wales Sport that Cordina was the top prospect in the squad.
