Eight appliances were sent to fight the fire at Wardley industrial estate near Swinton, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said.
The fire is believed to involve a large number of recycled computer parts in an industrial-sized container.
A number of people were evacuated from their homes but there are no reported injuries.
A downed power line also caused problems at the scene and was being made safe by the National Grid, the fire service added.
Firefighters managed to bring the flames "well under control" just after 02:00 BST, with people in the surrounding area advised to keep their windows and doors shut to prevent smoke from seeping into their homes.
Darren Moore, force duty officer for Greater Manchester Police, said: "At 11.23pm police attended a large fire at a recycling plant to assist the fire brigade.
"The fire is believed to be contained although it will continue to be fought overnight."
Eleven people were transferred from their homes into emergency accommodation, he said, with others leaving to stay with family and friends.
The cause of the fire is unknown and an investigation will take place.
