Donna Creighton returns to sliding - swapping skeleton for bobsleigh

Former Great Britain skeleton slider Donna Creighton is hoping a switch to bobsleigh will boost her bid to reach the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Creighton began her skeleton career in 2004 and competed at six World Championships before retiring in April.
She has spent the subsequent months learning how to pilot a bobsleigh and will look to compete in both second-tier and World Cup events this season.
"I know is a big, big challenge," said 31-year-old Creighton.
"I still have that urge to continue representing the country until at least Pyeongchang to try to fulfil that Olympic dream, as that's what's missing from my skeleton CV.
"If I hadn't given this a go, I think I would have been questioning myself a few years down the line."
The arrival of Creighton as a credible top-level pilot is a welcome addition to the GB Bobsleigh setup with world junior champion Mica McNeill currently the only recognised pilot on the women's programme - following the retirement of Paula Walker after the Sochi Winter Olympics.
"That team element really excites me," said former heptathlete Creighton, who spent 13 years as a skeleton slider.
"That's really important as I'm not just competing on my own any more - I have someone else I have to worry about in the back of the sled and if I crash, it's not just me that's affected, it's someone else as well."
The new season begins in November, with Olympic qualification ending on 14 January 2018.
