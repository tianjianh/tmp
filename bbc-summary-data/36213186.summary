[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stephen Carson murder: Man accused of shooting refused bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man facing trial for the murder of Stephen Carson in south Belfast has failed in a bid to be released on bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Smith, 37, from Ardmonagh Gardens, Belfast, is one of two men accused of the killing.
Mr Carson was shot dead in front of his family in a house at Walmer Street on 25 February.
The judge told the court he refused bail because he was concerned about possible intimidation of witnesses.
He also said bail was refused because of the defendant's previous record, which includes violence.
Police said they opposed bail because the victim's partner had identified the accused as the man who came into her home with a shotgun.
A defence lawyer challenged how the identification procedure was conducted.
The court also heard that forensic tests had linked a shotgun found when Mr Smith was arrested to the killing.
Mr Smith is due in court again on 2 June.
His co-accused, David Smith, 32, from Monagh Drive, Belfast, is still in prison awaiting trial for murder.
