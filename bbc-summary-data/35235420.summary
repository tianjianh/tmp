Threats were posted on Facebook to "kill as many people as possible" at Montgomery High School in Blackpool on Monday.
Lancashire Police dismissed the threat as "not credible".
A person claiming to have written the post has since apologised on the Blackpool Gazette website, saying it was "a gigantic mistake".
In the original post, made during the school holidays, the Facebook user praised people who killed students in the US, and wrote on the school's page: "Nobody talks to me or notices me except when they're calling me a nerd and pushing me around."
Responding to one student, they commented: "You think it's a joke? You'll see bullets, bodies, and blood."
Later, a long apology appeared on the Gazette's website, saying: "I am a bullied student at Montgomery, I did start the threats but they are NOT genuine; I simply wanted to shock the school into handling the bullies."
Describing their actions as "the stupidest decision I've ever made", the author, who claimed to be 15 years old, continued: "I just wanted to do something about the bullies because all other channels of communication were ignored.
"I thought scaring the bullies and the teachers would simply sort out the bullying problem and then everyone would just move on; I was incredibly wrong."
Lancashire Police has confirmed the apparent confession is one of the lines of inquiry in their investigation.
The school, which said more than 1,000 of its 1,375 pupils did not attend on Monday, added it was "unable to comment" on the apparent confession as it did not want to "compromise what is an extensive ongoing police investigation".
On its website, principal Tony Nicholson wrote there had been a "much higher attendance" on Tuesday.
