Davy Graham, who died in 2008 aged 68, was described as a "guitar genius".
One of his pieces, Anji, was covered on the Simon and Garfunkel album Sounds of Silence and he is credited with inspiring a generation of singers.
The plaque will be unveiled at his birthplace, the former Bosworth Park Infirmary, in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire.
Davy travelled extensively and brought Middle Eastern and Indian influences into his repertoire and is often credited with pioneering World Music before the term was coined.
Ray Davies of the Kinks once described him as "an awesome influence".
David Suff, from folk label Topic Records, said: "Davy was a restless musician, ever searching for new ways to play the guitar.
"It is no exaggeration to refer to him as a guitar genius who inspired Bert Jansch, Martin Carthy, Jimmy Page, Paul Simon, John Renbourn and countless others."
For many, a major part of his legacy was a new way of tuning a guitar - known as the DADGAD style.
The plaque is set to be unveiled at 15:30 GMT by his partner Carol Ballard and musician Tom Baxter, along with a recent graduate from Market Bosworth and Hinckley based JAM Music School.
