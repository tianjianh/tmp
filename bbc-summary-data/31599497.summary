***SPOILER ALERT: If you're not up-to-date with Broadchurch series two, don't read on.***
The news was unveiled by an ITV continuity announcer as the closing credits started rolling.
The second series of Broadchurch ended with viewers finally finding out the killers in DI Hardy's Sandbrook case.
Ricky Gillespie confessed to killing Lisa Newberry while Lee Ashworth was revealed as Pippa Gillespie's murderer.
At the beginning of the final episode Danny Latimer's alleged killer, Joe Miller, was found not guilty.
Creator and writer Chris Chibnall said: "We've been overwhelmed that nine million people every week have continued to join us on the twists and turns of Broadchurch.
"This third chapter has been a glint in my eye for a long time and I'm thrilled to be writing these characters once again."
No details about the other cast members who will be joining Tennant's DI Alec Hardy and Colman's DS Ellie Miller have been revealed and filming dates will be confirmed at a later date.
So where does the show go from here? Here are the loose ends that need tidying up in series three.
So it was a case of community justice after Joe Miller was found not guilty of Danny Latimer's murder.
After being released from custody, Miller made his way to Reverend Coates' church.
But rather than allowing him sanctuary, Rev Coates rings up Danny Latimer's father Mark who brings his building partner Nige Carter round to the church.
They take him in their van to the chalet on the cliff where it's thought Danny Latimer was killed.
There he's told to leave Broadchurch forever by the whole family and his wife PC Ellie Miller.
The Rev Coates says he's got him a space at a halfway house in Sheffield. But will he go there?
At the end of the second series, DI Alec Hardy tells PC Ellie Miller he's not going to stay in the Dorset seaside town and wants to move closer to his daughter.
But at the end of the episode, Hardy is seen just about to get into a taxi presumably going to the local train station.
But does he get in or does he decide to stay?
If series two is anything to go by, it's not a done deal that Ricky Gillespie, Lee Ashworth and Claire Ashworth will be found guilty.
Despite confessing one after the other to being involved in Lisa Newberry and Pippa Gillespie's murders, in the world of Broadchurch that doesn't mean anything.
In a gripping finale, Lee Ashworth confesses to killing Pippa after her father admits killing 19-year-old babysitter Lisa.
He'd come home early from a wedding and walked in on her and Lee Ashworth having sex.
Claire Ashworth admits to helping cover up the whole thing.
Rev Coates consistently refuses to believe Joe Miller after he denies killing Danny Latimer in court.
He finally gives him up to Mark Latimer and his mate Nige after he's found not guilty of Danny's murder.
But will he go through a crisis of confidence after getting Joe Miller a place in a halfway house?
They're accused of having an affair in court by Joe Miller's defence barrister Sharon Bishop.
But PC Ellie Miller and DI Alec Hardy never actually get close to getting together.
At the end of series two, Miller refuses to hug Hardy despite being emotional after the conclusion of her husband's trial and helping to crack the Sandbrook murder case.
After losing the Joe Miller murder trial to Sharon Bishop, her former boss Jocelyn Knight offers to work with her again and help with her son's case.
But will she accept?
It doesn't look like it at the end of season two but that could change.
