Newcastle Diamonds rider Lewis Kerr, from Snettisham in Norfolk, collided with another rider before hitting a fence at an event on 3 August.
The 25-year-old, also known as Lewi, was airlifted from the stadium in Peterborough to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr Kerr's wife Jessie posted on Twitter she was "so happy" to have him home.
Mrs Kerr, who is pregnant with the couple's first child, said: "It's official... Lewi is Addenbrooke's hero! So happy!
"Lewi is recovering from home with the help of specialists.
"We realise it's a long, frustrating and difficult recovery for his brain to get back to normal after such a terrible trauma, but he's in the best place to start and we have the best help available.
"He is absolutely amazing and doing so well, but the brain will take nothing but time to heal now."
A spokesman for the rider's team said: "It's been a traumatic and hugely worrying week since our man crashed.
"But thanks to his will and determination and the truly amazing care he received he is continuing to make fantastic progress.
"All the medical staff treating Lewi are delighted with how far he has come in such a short space of time, given what he has been through."
Mr Kerr joined the Newcastle Diamonds on loan from King's Lynn at the start of 2013.
