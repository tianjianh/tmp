A plot at Sheffield Botanical Gardens has been planted with species sensitive to ozone pollution, including lettuce and wheat.
The project is a collaboration between the universities of Sheffield, Leeds and York.
"Air pollution is invisible, but the plants and pigments will show up its effects," said Dr Maria Val Martin.

Dr Val Martin said the 6x8m (20 x 26ft) garden will visually demonstrate the effects of pollution on plants with discolouring of the leaves.
Snap beans and clover have been planted alongside lettuce and wheat, and coneflower and milkweed will be added in a few months.
She said people will also be able to read information about plants' ability to absorb chemicals, and about air pollution's effects on humans.
