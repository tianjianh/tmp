BBC Wales Sport has learned the Championship club are keen to sign the 29-year-old on a permanent deal this summer.
Immers was a deadline-day loan signing from Eredevisie club Feyenoord.
He has made a big impact at Cardiff, scoring five goals in 12 appearances to help keep Russell Slade's team in contention for a play-off spot.
Immers scored 31 goals in 100 League appearances for Feyenoord, having joined them from Den Haag in 2012.
Cardiff are under a Football League transfer embargo, but were able to sign players on loan during the January window.
The club hope the embargo will be lifted in the summer in time for them to sign Immers when his loan deal will expires.
