Germany U21 1-0 England U21

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England were outclassed in a friendly defeat by Germany in Wiesbaden as preparation for this summer's European Under-21 Championship continued.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nadiem Amiri's strike from the edge of the box wrong-footed goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to open the scoring on Friday.
England's best chance fell to Alfie Mawson, but the Swansea defender's weak shot was easily saved after Nathaniel Chalobah sliced an acrobatic volley.
Jack Stephens could also have levelled, but Julian Pollersbeck saved well.
The Southampton defender then latched on to a deep free-kick inside the area late on, only to miscue his attempt from close range.
However, it was the hosts who dominated possession, with Wolfsburg midfielder Max Arnold - capped at senior level by Germany - impressing before he was substituted.
The 22-year-old went close to doubling the lead before the break with a long-range effort that Sunderland keeper Pickford watched wide.
Pickford gave an assured performance after conceding the goal, saving well on several occasions to keep the deficit at one.
Aidy Boothroyd's side are in friendly action again on Monday, when they visit Denmark.
They kick-off their finals campaign against holders Sweden on 16 June, with Slovakia and hosts Poland also in their group.
