The incident happened near junction nine on the southbound carriageway at Walton Summit, Lancashire, at about 22:30 GMT on Monday, police said.
The girl was a passenger in a VW Sharan heading southbound that was involved in a collision with a Renault Clio before a lorry struck both vehicles.
She suffered serious injuries and died at the scene.
The driver of the Sharan, a man in his 40s from Greater Manchester, also suffered serious injuries and is in a critical condition in hospital.
Three other passengers in the same car suffered less serious injuries.
The occupants of the other vehicles were unhurt.
Sgt Dave Hurst of Lancashire Constabulary's road policing unit said: "This was a horrendous collision in which a young girl has very sadly lost her life."
