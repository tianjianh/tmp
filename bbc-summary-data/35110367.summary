About 400m of safety line which had been installed in November to help the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade (TVLB) carry out rescues has been ripped out and fixings destroyed.
Harbour masters said it was a "pointless act".
The TVLB said the line is vital for safety.
Peter Lilley, captain of the TVLB, said: "Mounting rescue operations from Tynemouth Pier in stormy weather is one of the most dangerous situations our team can face and we have been very grateful for the support from the Port of Tyne in working to install this brand new safety line.
"We are very disappointed to hear that it has been vandalised within days of its installation, which increases the dangers our volunteers face if called to an emergency situation at this location."
