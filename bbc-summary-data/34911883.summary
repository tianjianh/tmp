Netflix is to reboot classic TV show Lost in Space, according to reports.

Deadline said the streaming service was successful following a round of multiple bids for the project, about a family of astronauts lost in an alien universe.
The original series - loosely based on The Swiss Family Robinson - aired in 1965 and was made into a 1998 film starring Friends' Matt LeBlanc.
Netflix has not commented on the reports.
The new series will be written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who wrote last year's Dracula Untold, starring Luke Evans.
Newcastle-born director Neil Marshall is also expected to be involved. His previous TV projects include episodes of Hannibal and the critically acclaimed Blackwater episode of Game of Thrones.
The original show saw the family of Dr John Robinson, accompanied by a pilot and a robot, set out from an overpopulated Earth in hope of colonising a new planet.
The mission, however, is sabotaged by the villainous Dr Zachary Smith who finds himself trapped, along with Robinsons, on the spaceship Jupiter 2.
The role was played by Jonathan Harris and recreated by Brit Gary Oldman in the poorly-received 1998 movie.
The TV show's theme music was written by John Williams, who would go on to score Hollywood franchises like Star Wars, Superman and Jaws.
Lost in Space aired on CBS for three seasons and ended its run after 83 episodes due to falling ratings and rising costs.
No stars have yet been attached to the new project.
