Troubled Betsi health board 'turning a corner'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The boss of Wales' biggest health board says it is turning a corner, 100 days after it came under government control over concerns about its management.

Betsi Cadwaladr's interim chief executive admits there is still more to do with no sign special measures are to be lifted.
Simon Dean said his 100-day challenge to turn the troubled organisation around was only the start.
But the Conservatives say there is a perception that little has changed.
The board, which is responsible for delivering health services to almost 700,000 people in north Wales, had been rocked by a series of scandals.
Mr Dean, the deputy chief executive of the Welsh NHS who was put in the Betsi post by ministers, said progress was being made but there was still "a lot of work to do".
He said the 100-day plans were intended to give a focus and to make immediate improvements but "this is a job that won't end".
"I'm really keen that we're embedding this work in the way we normally do business," he told BBC Wales.
He admitted the health board had been tarnished by failings in the past but said it was too early to come to the view that little had changed.
"I can understand people need to see change before they believe it's happened but I believe it's a little early to form that judgement yet."
Mr Dean said the health board's reputation was "critical" and staff morale was still an issue which had to be dealt with if Betsi was to recruit effectively.
"We have to deal with the areas of concern and we have to promote the opportunities and excellence that already exists here is in north Wales to attract people who want to work here, live here and build their careers here."
FIVE PRIORITY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Welsh Conservative Shadow Minister for Health Darren Millar said: "The people of north Wales are fed up with apologies and excuses for failure. Hard working staff, patients and their loved ones want to see progress and improvement."
The Welsh government will formally review the health board's status in October.
Mr Dean would not be drawn on when special measures might come to an end but said progress had to be continuous.
He called on the public to rally around and "get behind the health service" in north Wales.
"I want them to be honest, tell us as it is, celebrate the good things and tell us the things that frustrate and annoy them because if we don't know we can't deal with them.
"But overwhelmingly we need to make sure we continue to develop a service that meets the needs of the people we serve."
