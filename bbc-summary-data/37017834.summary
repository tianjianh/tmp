Brentford 1-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Hogan's goal for Brentford was the difference in their match against Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest goalkeeper Stephen Henderson saved Hogan's initial effort and Lewis Macleod's follow-up before Hogan tapped home his first goal of the season.
Dean Smith's Bees have now won back-to-back games at home with clean sheets.
Damien Perquis was sent off late on for Forest for a second yellow card and striker Britt Assombalonga wasted a one-on-one in injury time.
Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley produced a number of second-half saves to secure three points, including his parry from former Southend team-mate Assombalonga.
Earlier, Macleod had hit the crossbar for the Bees while Hildeberto Pereira and Eric Lichaj went close for the visitors.
Head coach Philippe Montanier, who joined Forest in the summer, has seen his team suffer back-to-back Championship losses after their opening day win over Burton.
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"It was nice to get two clean sheets and two home wins on the spin. We worked very hard for that - you have to in this league because no one will roll over and give you the points.
"We were masters of our own downfall at times because of our decision making and I felt we created most of their chances. People were giving the ball away in the last five or six minutes, but Daniel Bentley was very composed which was just as well.
"We didn't look after the ball well enough in the second half but we defended very well and looked organised, which made it difficult for Forest to create too much themselves. We had to re-organise and I'm glad the players did it themselves rather than me having to do it with substitutions."
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier:
"We were in control of the game and had many opportunities to score, but the story is always the same. It was a frustrating evening but I was pleased with the character of my side.
"We lacked efficiency to score goals and unfortunately that reflects the whole game. I thought Britt would score late on but we had too many opportunities to score and if you don't there's a danger you can always concede one goal.
"We made mistakes and that is frustrating but the mentality is good and we are trying too hard to achieve victories in what is a difficult moment for us."
