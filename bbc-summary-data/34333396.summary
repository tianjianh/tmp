A woman was attacked in a property in Cathays Terrace early on Tuesday.
This followed the sexual assault of another woman in the early hours of Sunday close to the Civic Centre.
Supt Andy Valentine of South Wales Police said officers were "keeping an open mind" as to whether the two are linked.
Earlier on Wednesday, police warned people to walk in pairs at night and stick to well-lit areas following the second sexual assault.
Supt Valentine added: "We understand this is likely to cause concern within the local community and enhanced patrols by our local Neighbourhood Policing Teams are continuing."
