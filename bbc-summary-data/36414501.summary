County Championship: Day three at Canterbury abandoned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent and Leicestershire were left frustrated as bad weather forced day three of their Championship match to be abandoned without a ball being bowled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After the rain that had prevented play in the morning stopped, bad light then thwarted efforts to get the game going.
Even use of the Canterbury floodlights could not help, leading to umpires Paul Pollard and Alex Wharf calling things off at 15:15 BST.
Kent will resume the final day on 117-2, still 224 runs behind.
