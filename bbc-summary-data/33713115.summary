Theresa Villiers' worry over Sinn Féin demands on welfare reform

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has said she is worried that Sinn Féin would ask for more money if the government agreed to its current demands over welfare reform.

Ms Villiers wants US administration support for the government's Stormont House Agreement stance.
She said it would not "fund a more expensive system of welfare in Northern Ireland than elsewhere".
"That is an important principle for us," she said.
"There is also an affordability question," she told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster.
"As a nation in 2010 we had the worst deficit in Europe and we still have got half of it to clear.
"There is a genuine concern, even if we were to offer more money to Sinn Féin now, which we are not going to do. The worry is that they would come back for more in the future."
Earlier this week, Martin McGuinness denied that his three-day visit to the United States for talks about the Stormont budget crisis had been a waste of time.
He said if the crisis was not resolved by September, Stormont's government would be "hanging by a thread".
His trip has coincided with a diplomatic visit to the US by Ms Villiers.
