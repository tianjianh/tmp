The 28-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was found lying on a pavement late on Sunday with serious injuries.

Police say she had been dragged by the neck through several streets.
The man now in custody is described as 38 and from nearby Bad Muender.
Both the victim and the suspect are German citizens of Kurdish origin, a police spokesman said.
A spokesman for Hannover prosecutors, Thomas Klinge, said the motive for the attack was not yet clear.
