Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic says he is focused on his job rather than worrying about renewing his own contract with the Championship club.

The Serb, 48, took charge of the Whites in December 2015 and his deal at Craven Cottage expires this summer.
"At this moment I am committed for my team, as important things are in front of us," he told BBC Radio London.
"I am very happy here and it is a fantastic place. I pay people around me to care about my future."
When Jokanovic joined Fulham, they were 18th in the Championship table, and the west London club eventually finished the 2015-16 campaign in 20th place, but 11 points above the relegation zone.
Despite losing strikers Moussa Dembele and Ross McCormack, who scored 36 league goals between them last season, Fulham are challenging for the play-offs this term.
They are eighth after 25 games, six points off the top six but with a game in hand.
Former Chelsea and Yugoslavia midfielder Jokanovic, who guided Watford to promotion to the Premier League in 2014-15, is relaxed about his future.
"A characteristic of Fulham is not to be especially quick to take decisions," he said.
"My profession always pushed me to be quick, and sometimes I made some wrong decisions, sometimes good. I am fully concentrated on my job.
"I am a young man and in the summer I will be in this business 100 per cent. I am not ready for resting."
