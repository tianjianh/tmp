The British Lionhearts beat the Morocco Atlas Lions 5-0 for back-to-back wins in the World Series of Boxing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rio Olympian Galal Yafai got them on their way when his opponent, Yassine Zaher, was disqualified in the first round after twice losing his gumshield.
Hungarian middleweight Zolta Harcsa and Liverpool bantamweight Peter McGrail extended the Lionhearts' advantage.
WSB debutant Connor Loftus and Croatian heavyweight Bepo Fillipi completed the whitewash at London's York Hall.
The team will return to York Hall in two weeks to take on Italia Thunder when they will be looking to avenge the 3-2 defeat they suffered in the season opener in Rome.
