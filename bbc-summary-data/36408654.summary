Rodgers, 43, has taken over as Celtic manager while midfielder Barton, 33, has joined newly-promoted Rangers.
"It's a great move for Brendan," said former Tottenham boss Redknapp, 69. "Joey Barton is a leader on the pitch and in the dressing room.
"It's a big pull next year with the Old Firm games again."
"Two of the biggest clubs in the world in my opinion, still," Redknapp added. "Even though they're not in the biggest league, they've still got incredible pull around the world.
"I'm looking forward to those games. They're going to be fantastic. I certainly would love to come up there at some stage and watch a game. It'd be a great atmosphere."
Former Liverpool boss Rodgers faces the task of extending Celtic's current run of five successive Scottish top-flight titles and returning the side to the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in three years.
"He'll be as good as the players he's got at his disposal," said Redknapp.
"He'll try to play the way he had his teams playing at Swansea. They'll pass the ball and get lots of movement.
"If he's got people who can play I'm sure he'll encourage them to try to play from the back. It'll be risky football but with the right people, if they're comfortable on the ball, I'm sure it'll be a success."
Former Manchester City and Newcastle player Barton, meanwhile, has joined Championship winners Rangers on a two-year deal after helping Burnley seal promotion to the Premier League.
"I recommended him," said Redknapp, who had Barton at Queens Park Rangers. "Burnley rang me about him. [Manager] Sean Dyche called and asked me about Joey and I said I would take him.
"He'll have his mood swings and if things don't go his way, there can be aggro. But, he wants to win.
"He's a real student of the game. He'll watch a million games. He'll be all over the place watching other teams play. He's interested in football. He'll watch every game on TV.
"He doesn't hold back. He's got strong opinions on the game. He gets people going. He'll be a big voice in that dressing room.
"He's got a real good understanding of football and his role in the game. You give him a job to do and he'll do the job.
"He was as good as anybody defending corners. The amount of balls he headed out the box when I had him, he did his job in the right position that you put him in.
"He'll be a good player for Rangers, I'm sure he will. I'm sure [manager] Mark Warburton will get the best out of him."
