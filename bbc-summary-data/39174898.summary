Overnight leader Scott Jamieson produced a nightmare final round of 78 to blow his chances at the Tshwane Open in South Africa.

Home favourite Dean Burmester carded a 65 to win his first European Tour Title on 18-under.
Scotland's Jamieson shared the lead with Sweden's Alexander Bjork after rounds two and three at Pretoria Country Club.
But his hopes evaporated early when he bogeyed three of his first four holes.
The 33-year-old ran up a double bogey on the eighth on his way to a front nine of 39 and he double-bogeyed the 12th and 13th, eventually finishing in a tie for 22nd.
Bjork carded a 71 to end the tournament in fifth spot.
Burmester began the day one shot behind Jamieson and Bjork but his second successive 65 ensured he finished three clear of both Finland's Mikko Korhonen and Spain's Jorge Campillo.
"I can't believe it," Burmester, 27, said. "I sharpened my teeth as a youngster on the Big Easy Tour here at home and I think I had five seconds in one year and then two years later I had four wins on the Sunshine Tour.
"It's gone from strength to strength and now I'm a European Tour winner and that sounds great."
Ireland's Paul Dunne carded a final round 66 to finish in a share of sixth on 12 under, with England's James Morrison also finishing in sixth after a 69.
