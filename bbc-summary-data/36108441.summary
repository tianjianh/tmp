Northern Ireland school leaders warn of 'budget crisis' impact

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Schools will see larger class sizes, fewer teachers and be able to offer fewer subjects due to rising costs, according to leaders of 80 of Northern Ireland's largest schools.

The warning comes in a joint statement from groups representing principals, governors and school finance managers.
Many schools are in a "critical situation", they say, facing budget deficits of as much as £500,000.
Education Minister John O'Dowd said his department's budget was challenging.
But he added that his priority had been to ensure minimum impact on the classroom.
The statement was issued by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the Governing Bodies Association, the Catholic Heads Association, the Association of Controlled Grammar Schools and the Voluntary Bursars Association.
They say school budgets are "already stretched to breaking point by successive cuts in recent years".
"Schools now face unprecedented financial pressures and will be running deficits of between £150,000 and £500,000," their statement continues.
"This will have a direct and significant detrimental effect on the quality of education currently offered to pupils."
They claim the reason for what they call a "crisis" is that schools now have to meet a number of additional staff costs from their own budgets.
These include:
The organisations say schools are not being given extra money from the department to meet the rising costs.
"Together we call on our politicians to reconsider these plans and find the cost savings in administrative and other areas which will have less potential impact on the futures of Northern Ireland's pupils," their statement adds.
"Surely Northern Ireland's priority must be to invest in the future of our children."
Pat McGuckian, the principal of Saint Patrick's High School in Keady, County Armagh, said the funding they had received had been reducing year-on-year.
"We have had to enforce financial redundancies as a direct result of the diminishing allocations," she said.
"We have reduced our teaching staff from 70 in 2010 to 62 in 2016."
"The news that the school has to pay for the increase in teachers' superannuation, paid by DE last year, and the 1% pay award is a devastating blow."
She said the most disadvantaged pupils would be hit directly by the cuts.
"We have now an additional budget to find of £140,000 which came out of a clear blue sky. I am in despair, our school is in despair."
Ms McGuckian said children with special educational needs might not get the assistive technology they need and others might not be able to study a specific A Level or Btec choice.
"John O'Dowd has always said the institutions do not come first, it's the pupils who come first.
"I'm not hearing that at the minute, I'm not hearing that pupils come first," she said.
In response, Mr O'Dowd said he had consistently protected the schools budget as far as possible.
"As a result of reductions imposed by the Westminster government, the overall executive resource budget for 2016-17 has been reduced in real terms," he said.
"However, although the budget for education is challenging, the position is significantly better than previously anticipated.
"However, it has been impossible to fully protect the schools budget.
"As a result, there will be 0.8% reduction in the next financial year."
"I have also allocated three quarters of the additional £20m, announced by the finance minister and which will be made available to my department as part of the June 2016-17 monitoring round, to the aggregated schools budget."
