A Stoke-on-Trent homelessness charity has been given almost £200,000 in a bid to "end" rough sleeping in the city.

Brighter Futures was one of 21 projects across the country to get a share of £3.5m grants from the government's Homelessness Transition Fund.
The charity said the money would be used to find accommodation for the 66 rough sleepers believed to be in Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme.
It said two key workers would also be employed to provide support.
Brighter Futures said the money would allow it to focus better on the long-term homeless in the area, many of whom had complex issues including alcohol and drug addictions and mental health problems.
"The goal is to accommodate them all and ensure they do not return to the streets," it said.
The key workers are also expected to help rough sleepers access treatments and therapies, as well as advice on issues such as debt and benefits.
