British Army officer rape trial: Alleged victim 'too drunk to consent'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US court martial has heard a woman who alleges she was raped by a married British Army officer was "too drunk" to consent to sex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lt Col Benedict Tomkins, 49, of Defence, Equipment and Support, based at Abbey Wood, near Bristol, denies rape.
The alleged attack happened after a UN event in Uganda in January 2015.
She told the court Col Tomkins came into her room under the pretence of working on a joint presentation.
The attack is said to have taken place at the Sheraton Hotel in Kampala after a drink-fuelled function.
The woman told the court that although her memory was hazy, she remembered he approached her and "instantly" unzipped her dress and forced her on to the bed after she spurned his advances.
Col Tomkins maintains the sex was consensual and that it followed kissing and intimate touching.
"I know I was too drunk to consent to any of that, if any of that happened," she added.
Defending, Peter Glesner accused her of "exaggerating" her drunkenness.
He said: "You were sober enough to collaborate with a senior British officer on a presentation but too drunk to consent to sex?"
The trial, being held at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, is the first-ever court martial which will be held in the US and UK to allow more witnesses to testify.
It will head back to the UK in Bulford, Wiltshire, on Monday after the prosecution's witnesses.
