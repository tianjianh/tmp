Welsh mountain rescue teams have been given special white water training using money paid in fines by banks.

Three volunteers from Gwynedd have undergone four days training in swift-water rescue from grants funded by the Libor scandal penalties.
More than Â£150m collected by the UK government has been spent on armed services charities since 2011.
In 2014, a further Â£4m was set aside to include mountain rescue teams across Britain.
"I think many of us sat at home last winter watching the flood events unfold on TV and, as mountain rescue water teams were deployed from across Britain to help out, we wondered if there was more that we as a team could be doing," said Graham O'Hanlon from the Aberdyfi Search and Rescue team.
The result was the latest training event on the River Dee in Llangollen, alongside members from the South Snowdonia and Aberglaslyn mountain rescue teams.
"I like the idea that something motivated essentially from greed and selfishness is being invested back into volunteering and community," added Mr O'Hanlon.
