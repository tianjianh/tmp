Gaby Stone, 34, from Edgware Road, north-west London, managed the long jumper's appearances, merchandise and sponsorship contracts for a 20% cut.
He claimed to have lost the athlete's money in a bad investment but in reality kept it for himself, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.
The 34-year-old was jailed for 18 months at Blackfriars Crown Court.
Stone used the funds to fuel his gambling addiction and admitted fraud by abuse of position during the time he was Mr Rutherford's manager from October 2014 to March 2015.
The court heard Rutherford, who won gold at London 2012 and bronze in Rio 2016 and also competed in Strictly Come Dancing in 2016, had been placed under "severe financial pressure" while training as a result of Stone's fraud.
Mr Rutherford said he felt "sick" upon learning of his former manager's deceit.
He and his family had also been concerned they would face income tax on money they had not received, thanks to Stone.
Judge John Hillen QC said: "The thought that someone who had responsibility for a large part of his [Greg Rutherford's] life and work, someone who he had placed trust in, had in fact been dishonest, left him feeling sick".
Julia Flanagan, defending, said Stone was "remorseful" and reflected on the impact of his actions daily.
It was initially thought Stone had deprived Mr Rutherford, a 2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year contender, of Â£62,800 but accountants have since revised this down to Â£48,488, which Stone has repaid in full.
Handing down the custodial sentence earlier, Judge Hillen told Stone: "No-one can buy their way out of prison."
