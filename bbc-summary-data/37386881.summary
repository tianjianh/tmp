[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronnie Barogiannis, 43, worked under the name of a former colleague, treating hundreds of people at a dental practice in East Yorkshire.
Police said eight patients suffered serious damage due to his actions.
Barogiannis admitted fraud and five counts of causing actual bodily harm. He was previously fined for operating illegally in Scotland in 2013.
Hull Crown Court heard how his latest deception, in 2013 and 2014, was reported to police after he inadvertently sent through personal data under his real name when the Smiles Dental Practice in Cottingham changed ownership.
The new owners contacted the General Dental Council and found he had previously been prevented from operating a dental practice in Scotland, police said.
He was arrested in October 2014 and released on bail with his Greek passport seized, but fled four days later using a Swedish passport.
Barogiannis, who completed a dentistry degree in 2003 but never registered as a dentist, was apprehended while working in Sweden in March 2016 and extradited back to the UK.
The police investigation found he was paid almost Â£50,000 for his illegal work. Officers spoke to about 700 patients during the investigation.
Timeline of events
2003 - Barogiannis completes a dentistry degree in Sweden
2013 - Sets up own dental practice in Scotland
August 2013 - Fined and convicted for failing to register his practice
Sept 2013 - Starts to work in Cottingham under a false identity
October 2014 - Arrested and released on bail, but flees the country
March 2016 - Arrested in Sweden and extradited back to the UK
Det Con Lucy Khan, who led the investigation, called Barogiannis a "very believable conman who weaved a complex series of lies".
"I hope that the jail sentence will prevent others from operating as bogus medical professionals," she said.
