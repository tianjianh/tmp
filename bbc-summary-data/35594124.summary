Wales lock Luke Charteris could be a doubt for the Six Nations match against France in Cardiff on 26 February.

Charteris is expected to be ruled out of Racing 92's match with Grenoble in France's Top 14 on Saturday.
Wales team medical staff will assess his knee injury when he returns for international duty next week.
The 32-year-old Bath-bound second row played in Wales' Six Nations draw against Ireland and last Saturday's 27-23 win over Scotland.
Charteris is one of 10 current Wales squad members based in either England or France who have been released for domestic matches this weekend.
He was expected to be picked to face Grenoble, while centre Jonathan Davies could play for Clermont Auvergne on their trip to Castres.
There are seven members of Warren Gatland's squad at Aviva Premiership clubs - including George North and Jamie Roberts who both scored tries in the win against Scotland.
Bradley Davies, who would probably take over Charteris' place in the team if he is unavailable, is at Wasps who play Bath on Saturday.
