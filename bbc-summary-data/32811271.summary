A barrister jailed for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old could face being expelled from the bar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Desmond Rosario, 46, from Bradford, attacked the girl in Sheffield in 2013.
A warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear before magistrates. He was found in Birmingham after a BBC Crimewatch appeal.
The Bar Standards Board, which regulates barristers, said Rosario faces disbarring, which means he would be unable to practise as a barrister.
Rosario, of Abbotts Wood, Heaton, was jailed for four years at Leicester Crown Court on Friday.
A Bar Standards Board (BSB) spokesman said: "While the BSB does not normally comment on individual cases, we were aware of the proceedings involving Mr Rosario, who, our records show, has not practised as a barrister since late 2013.
"Following his conviction, we can confirm that we are investigating him in accordance with our usual enforcement processes."
After his sentencing, Det Con Judith Proffitt said Rosario had been a "respected" criminal law barrister, but said he was not "above the law" and his behaviour was "despicable".
