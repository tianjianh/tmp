The Lady Glovers are top of WSL 2 ahead of hosting third-placed Everton on Sunday, after rivals Bristol City are at home to Durham on Saturday.
Yeovil are level on points with second-placed City, with two teams to go up.
"This club was built on hard work and determination - we give everything that we've got," Sherwood told BBC Sport.
"We have got three games to go - three big cup finals. We have to be mentally prepared and focused."
Everton and Durham both hand a game in hand on their promotion rivals.
