Crosby, 25, was a Grand Final winner with the Warriors against Warrington at Old Trafford on 8 October, and has signed a two-year deal.
Savelio, 21, spent part of last season on loan at Castleford having played three first-grade seasons at Saints.
The ex-Latchford Albion lock has signed a one-year deal.
"I'm looking forward to working with Dom," said head coach Tony Smith. "He's come from a successful programme and is looking for a change.
"Andre has been on our radar for a while. He has some X-factor about him. He can break the line and offload the ball."
