Luis Enrique: Barcelona boss wants coaches to be given six-month contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona boss Luis Enrique wants to see an end to long-term contracts for managers, believing they should be hired on six-month deals.

Enrique, who has also managed Roma and Celta Vigo, has won five trophies since taking over at the Nou Camp in 2014.
"I would make it so there is never a contract of more than six months," said the Spaniard, 45.
"If I'm not happy and I'm not helping, it makes no sense for me to be a coach. The shorter the better."
Enrique was appointed on a two-year contract and extended that agreement for a further season last June, keeping him at the club until at least 2017.
But he believes it would make financial sense for clubs to offer short-term deals, as they would not have to spend large sums to pay off sacked managers.
"If you don't like the manager, you just change it and you don't spend much money to fire him," he added.
He also said that the days of managers staying at one club for 20 years - as Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has done - are gone.
"In the modern era, it is impossible," he insisted.
Enrique's Barcelona take a 2-0 lead into the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Arsenal on Wednesday.
