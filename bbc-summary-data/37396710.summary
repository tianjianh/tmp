The 25-year-old left Huddersfield, where he made more than 70 league appearances, for QPR last summer.
While at Loftus Road, Gobern had a loan spell at Doncaster, which was cut short when he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury.
The former Southampton trainee made just two appearances for Rangers and five for Rovers.
"Oscar was waiting for an opportunity at a club which matches his ambition and after speaking to a few [clubs] in League One, he felt that we were the right fit," said Stags boss Adam Murray.
