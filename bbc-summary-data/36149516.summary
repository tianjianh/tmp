Portsmouth midfielder Danny Hollands says the depth of their squad will see them through the current injury crisis.

Pompey secured a place in the League Two play-offs with a 1-0 win at AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday, but were without eight first-team players.
Automatic promotion is still mathematically possible for Paul Cook's side with two games remaining.
"Our whole squad is quality," Hollands told BBC Radio Solent. "Whoever takes the field, we're all together."
"The 11 that took the field (at Wimbledon) were fantastic and whoever lines up this Saturday will do the same job."
Mathematically, sixth-placed Pompey could still overhaul third-placed Oxford with wins in their remaining games at Hartlepool and at home to champions Northampton.
"If we do well at the end of the season, that will take us into the play-offs," Hollands added.
"There's six points still to play for and we want to get as many as we can to ensure we hit the ground running come the play-offs."
