A decision was made after an inspection on Friday to prevent Tranmere fans making the journey to Surrey.
A new date for the fixture at Kingfield Stadium has yet to be announced.
Tranmere are currently third in the table, just two points behind leaders Lincoln City, with Woking just one place, and a single point, above the relegation places.
