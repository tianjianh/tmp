England became the first host nation to be eliminated in the group stages when they lost matches to Wales and Australia in Pool A.
"I ultimately accept and take responsibility for the team's performance," said Lancaster.
Lancaster, 46, was made permanent coach in 2012 and won 28 of his 46 games, but failed to win the Six Nations.
"I took on the role in difficult circumstances and it has been a huge challenge to transition the team with many hurdles along the way," he added.
"However, I am immensely proud of the development of this team and I know that there is an incredibly strong foundation for them to progress to great things in the future.
"We have played some excellent rugby and it was always going to be tough to get the right level of experience into them in time for 2015. It is a young group of players with the huge majority available for the World Cup in Japan in 2019, where I believe their recent experience will make them genuine contenders."
A review into England performance at the World Cup took place after the tournament, with Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie stating that Lancaster agreed he should step down from his role.
''The Rugby World Cup was hugely disappointing for everyone associated with the England team and the subsequent review into the team's performance was always intended to be extremely comprehensive, which it has been," said Ritchie.
"Following the review, Stuart and I met, where we agreed that he should step down as head coach. This was subsequently ratified by the RFU board."
He added: "Despite the results during this World Cup he has much to be proud of, and has embedded a new group of players that will be representing England for a long time to come. Looking forward, we will leave no stone unturned to ensure England achieves sustained success in the future."
Former England international Andy Goode: "We were all excited pre-World Cup. But it was obviously a failure and, as he said, it was his responsibility. I am not surprised by the decision. It is probably the right one. There are some great coaches in the setup, who need to be looked at."
Former England and Bath hooker Lee Mears: "I wonder if they could have kept him in the RFU somewhere. You can't waste all that experience. It's very reactive and causes a load of havoc."
There is no word yet from the RFU on the future of Lancaster's coaching team of Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt. The full World Cup review will be presented to an RFU board meeting on 17 November.
The search will then begin for a replacement for Lancaster in time for next year's Six Nations, with England opening their campaign away to Scotland on 6 February.
Those linked with the vacant position include Australia's Michael Cheika, former Wallabies and Japan coach Eddie Jones, Wales boss Warren Gatland and Ireland's Joe Schmidt.
