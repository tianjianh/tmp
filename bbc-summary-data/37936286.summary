[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The design of a new sports complex to replace the existing Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh has been unveiled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will form part of a planning application the City of Edinburgh Council will submit next year.
It wants the public to give their views on the artist's impression showing a striking, gold-coloured building.
There is an online survey and two public information events at Meadowbank Sports Centre on 17 November and 22 November both between 15:00 and 20:00.
Current proposals for the new sports centre include:
•An outdoor athletics track with a 500 seat stand
•Two multi-sport games halls
•Three fitness studios
•A gym
•A gymnastics hall
•Two squash courts
•A combat studio for martial arts
•A  boxing gym with ring
•A 60m six lane indoor athletics track and jumps space
•An outdoor athletics track with jumps space
•An outdoor throwing area
•Two FIFA 1 3G (all weather) pitches - one which will be in the centre of the athletics track
•Cafe and meeting rooms
The new centre will be partly funded by a residential and commercial development on parts of the existing site.
This will include development of affordable and low cost housing.
In addition to the planning application for the new sports complex, a masterplan for the wider site development will be submitted with the aim of gaining outline planning permission.
Richard Lewis, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and sport convener, said: "We want the new Meadowbank Stadium and Sports Centre to be a venue fit for the 21st Century and the public's views on our proposals are key to this.
"Transforming Meadowbank into a brand new sports complex would provide a modern, fully accessible high quality sports centre for sports clubs and the local community.
"I would urge everyone to tell us what they think about the range of facilities being proposed and the masterplan."
The existing Meadowbank was originally built for Edinburgh's 1970 Commonwealth Games.
