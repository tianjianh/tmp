Daventry dog death: Molly-Mae Wotherspoon's grandmother appears in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The grandmother of a baby girl who was killed by a banned breed of dog has had her case committed to crown court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, aged six months, was attacked by a pit bull in October at the Daventry home of her mother Claire Riley.
Ms Riley and the baby's grandmother, Susan Aucott, have been charged with owning a dangerously out of control dog resulting in a death.
Ms Riley did not appear before Northampton magistrates due to illness.
The baby died as a result of blood loss from head wounds inflicted by an American pit bull following an attack at an address on Morning Star Road on 3 October.
The breed is prohibited for ownership under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.
Ms Aucott, 55, of Alfred Street in Northampton, appeared before magistrates but did not not enter a plea.
She was remanded on bail and is due to appear at Northampton Crown Court on 7 October.
The magistrates hearing for Ms Riley, 22, whose address was given as West Cotton Close in Northampton, has yet to be arranged.
She was remanded on bail in her absence.
