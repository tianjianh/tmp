A new multi-million pound river crossing for Ipswich has been given the green light by chancellor George Osborne.

Campaigners say the proposed wet dock crossing could ease traffic problems, help create jobs and regenerate the waterfront.
Bridges crossing the River Orwell would also link the town with an island site.
Funding of £151m was confirmed in the Budget for both the Ipswich crossing and a third crossing in Lowestoft.
Ipswich MP Conservative Ben Gummer, who has campaigned for the scheme, said it was a "fantastic day".
"It is the single most important piece of new infrastructure that the town needs at the moment," he said.
"It will link the town better, release development land for jobs and prosperity in the centre of the town and help us to re-stitch the waterfront to the town centre."
A campaign for the £81m project was launched in October 2014 and a business case submitted to the Department for Transport in December by Suffolk County Council and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership.
The council said the scheme could trigger local economic growth worth more than £8bn.
Council leader Colin Noble said he was "pleased" by the chancellor's announcement and the council would now proceed with developing the proposals.
"This is a massive piece of work and... will deliver jobs and much improved infrastructure," he added.
An initial study into the crossing was given £100,000 in the 2014 autumn statement, before £2m was released in last year's budget for a feasibility study.
It is hoped it could be built in 2020.
