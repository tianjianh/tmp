Dozens of people wearing military-style uniform, berets and dark glasses attended the funeral of Peggy O'Hara in the city on Saturday morning.
Mrs O'Hara was the mother of an INLA man who died in the 1981 hungerstrike.
Police are already investigating reports that shots were fired over Mrs O'Hara's coffin earlier this week.
When footage of Wednesday's shooting appeared on the internet, it was condemned by DUP members.
Ahead of the funeral, the party sought assurances from the police that they would taken action against a repeat of paramilitary-style displays.
On Friday, DUP MLA Nelson McCausland submitted 20 questions to the PSNI Chief Constable about how republican funerals are policed.
On Saturday afternoon, DUP MLA Gary Middleton condemned images showing dozens of masked men marching through the streets during Mrs O'Hara's funeral.
Mr Middleton tweeted: "Despite assurances from @PSNIFoyle, I am disgusted that once again there was no police presence/interference today."
