[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the 28th consecutive month there has been a fall in the claimant count, with the total figure now at 44,300.
Over the last 12 months, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has fallen by almost 12,000.
The figures have been published by the Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency.
The other measure of unemployment, the Labour Force Survey, showed an unemployment rate of 6.2% in the first quarter of this year.
That is one percentage point less than the figures for last year and half a percentage point less than the previous quarter.
The Northern Ireland jobs market has recovered in parallel with the UK as a whole.
However, the Northern Ireland performance has been weaker than the UK average.
The annual drop in jobseekers claimants in Northern Ireland was 20.9%, which was the lowest decrease of the 12 UK regions.
The annual decrease for the UK as whole was  31.4%.
Northern Ireland also continues to have a distinct problem with economic inactivity; working-age people who are classed as neither in work nor seeking unemployment.
The Northern Ireland economic inactivity rate for those aged 16-64 stood at 26.9% which is the highest of the 12 UK regions.
In the first quarter of the year, the numbers classed as inactive fell by 20,000 to 557,000.
