The 20-year-old will end his 18-month stint at Celtic on loan from Manchester City at the Scottish Cup final on 27 May, when his team play Aberdeen.
"We've had a brilliant season so far," said Roberts of the treble-chasers.
"In such a special year for the club I want to be part of everything here."

Roberts called the chance to help add the Scottish Cup to the Premiership and League Cup trophies "a once in a lifetime opportunity".
"I spoke to the gaffer and this is just something I really wanted to do," he told the Celtic website.
"I have a great relationship with everyone around the England squad and I wish all the other lads and the management and backroom team the very best for the World Cup in South Korea."
