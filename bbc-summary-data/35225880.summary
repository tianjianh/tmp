What to expect in 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transport is dominating the headlines in Wales as many people return to work after the Christmas break.

Or travel disruption more like, with the strike by Arriva Trains Wales.
It also follows the temporary closure of the A55 between Bangor and Llanfairfechan during the holiday because of flooding.
It's a sign of things to come: transport will be a major political issue in the year ahead.
The most controversial topic will be plans for a Â£1bn new motorway around Newport, but problems on the A55, as witnessed over Christmas, will be used by opponents as the exact reason why they believe the lion's share of road-building funds should not be used on one scheme in Newport.
The Arriva Trains Wales franchise comes to an end in two years. Plans are being made for it to be run by a not-for-profit organisation owned by the Welsh government.
It's impossible to say whether that means strikes will be more or less likely, but unpredictable pay negotiations with unions that are still powerful in the rail industry is a risk that will fall on government in future, rather than the private sector.
Despite the profile of transport, I wouldn't expect it to rise above being a solid middle-tier issue in the assembly campaign, sitting below the holy trinity of health, education and the economy.
Labour in Wales begins 2016 facing a doubly-whammy of concerns over the NHS and potential in-fighting over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.
It is responding with a defence of its record on health funding in particular, while at the same time throwing in claims about the alternative being a coalition of chaos at Cardiff bay.
Labour doesn't have an overall majority with exactly half of the 60 seats at the assembly. If the numbers drop below then the big question will be whether it will go it alone, or possibly form a coalition with Plaid.
The fear of minority government is no longer as strong for Labour.
Four and a half years ago, journalists like me were posing the question about how it would manage without an overall majority.
In fact it's been relatively easy to get budgets through every year thanks to deals with Plaid and the Lib Dems.
But a problem has been the inability to drive through major change like council re-organisations without the numbers on its side.
And this will be among the considerations for Labour if its numbers drop further in May.
The Conservatives, buoyed by their performance in the general election in Wales, are focusing their attacks on Labour on health.
The Welsh Conservative group at the assembly is currently advertising for a new head of media.
Whoever gets the job won't have much time to get their feet under the desk before things hot up, and trying to get these messages across effectively will be top of the in-tray.
The media was criticised for talking about possible coalitions at Westminster which in the end never materialised last year.
I suspect this time round in the assembly campaign, the Tories will be happy to talk about a possible coalition between Labour and Plaid, as they try to maintain their status as the only party which has refused to do a deal with Labour.
2016 is a huge year for Leanne Wood. So far under her leadership, the party's fortunes in the ballot box have failed to match the rise in the party's profile.
This is the biggest test yet, not only for her, but also of the policies of her top team.
Plaid's policy on health is pinned to enormous structural change. The risk is whether internal re-organisation deals with the public's real concerns.
The potential upside is that it can genuinely say it's attempting to deal with what many consider to be the holy grail for the NHS: the integration of health and social care.
Recent polls, and of course the general election result, have failed to give the Liberal Democrats much comfort.
As campaigners knock on doors over the coming months, they'll be trying to take advantage of the concessions they have won in budget deals with Labour in areas like the pupil deprivation grant, as well as pointing to proposed legislation to protect nursing numbers.
And last but not least. The impact of UKIP on the assembly election is one of the most intriguing elements to the new political year because it would be the arrival of a new party in Cardiff bay.
The numbers vary, but most are expecting UKIP to send a handful of AMs to the Senedd after May.
The party is promising a rounded a series of policies but inevitably the party will be helped if David Cameron holds an EU referendum in the summer.
The Tories are hoping the vote will shoot UKIP's fox but the counter argument is that the extra profile it will receive on the issue will help it generate votes for the assembly at the same time.
And that gets underway on Monday when Nigel Farage takes on Carwyn Jones in a head to head debate on the merits of EU membership.
