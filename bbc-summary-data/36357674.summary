[SN]TITLE[SN]
Condition check shuts historic bridge near Melrose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Borders bridge which is more than 250 years old is to shut for two days in order for a detailed inspection of its condition to be carried out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The B-listed Lowood Bridge near Melrose will be closed on 2 and 3 June between 09:30 and 16:00.
Scottish Borders Council said it would allow a large mobile platform to access all areas of the bridge.
It said it recognised it was a "well-used route" and had kept the bridge open during busier commuter times.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "It is important the council can fully inspect the bridge to discover its current condition.
"From that, the council can make an informed decision on whether remedial work is needed."
