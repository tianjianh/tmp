The Premier League club say the 22-year-old left-back is expected to be sidelined for "up to eight weeks" after the knock in a 6-1 loss to Bournemouth.
"The Scottish international damaged his calf during the second half of the defeat," said a club statement.
Scotland will face England in World Cup qualifying Group F on 11 November.
Gordon Strachan's side sit three points behind leaders England after three games.
The Scotland head coach had remarked before this month's 1-1 draw with Lithuania that his squad had "incredible" strength in depth at left-back.
Robertson started at Hampden but picked up a knock and Celtic's Kieran Tierney took over for the 3-0 defeat in Slovakia.
Hull were 3-1 down at the Vitality Stadium when they lost Robertson to injury after 63 minutes, defeat knocking them down to 16th, two places and one point above the relegation spots. The game was Mike Phelan's first since his appointment as head coach until the end of the season following a spell as caretaker.
The left-back said on Twitter: "Looks like I'll be a supporter for the next few weeks! Hopefully the lads can kick on."
Robertson's Scotland team-mate, goalkeeper David Marshall, has endured a miserable spell since his transfer from Cardiff City, conceding 15 goals in his first four outings for the Tigers.
