[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander McBride drove into a tree in Hordle, Hampshire, causing the death of passenger Rebecca Marchant, of Leatherhead, Surrey.
The 34-year-old's daughter, 10, and niece, 8, were in the car at the time, on 16 February.
There were also traces of cannabis in the blood of McBride, of Sky End Lane, Hordle, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.
He was sentenced to four years and four months in prison and also banned from driving for five years and two months.
'Never forgive'
McBride ran home after the crash and was found by police hiding on a neighbour's driveway, the court was told.
He was more than twice over the drink-drive limit, with 160mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, the jury heard.
Rebecca was declared dead at the scene and McBride's daughter and niece were taken to Southampton General Hospital.
In a statement, Rebecca's family said: "The sentencing... will never be enough to compensate for the decision he took that night to drink and drive, we can never forgive him for leaving her after the accident."
PC Dave Mitchell said: "This is a tragic case where a young life has been taken following the selfish actions of McBride.
"He has ignored the drink-drive message which is repeated by police so often.
"This has cost Rebecca Marchant her life."
