The programme is aimed at creating the largest transformation of the airport since the current terminal first opened its doors in 1977.
It will include new passenger and baggage areas aimed at coping with increasing passenger numbers.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the investment by the airport's operators.
Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon was also announcing that the Scottish government is setting up a new £12m fund to help people who face losing their jobs in oil and gas to gain new skills and find new work.
The airport plans will see a 50% increase in the size of the terminal building.
She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What will be announced today is a £20m package of investment to expand the terminal at Aberdeen Airport, to improve passenger facilities, to improve baggage handling facilities.
"Obviously this is investment that is very important and very welcome for the fabric of Aberdeen airport.
"I think it is investment that is well-timed because, not withstanding the difficulties the oil industry is facing now, the difficulties therefore the north east economy is facing, this is a huge vote of confidence in the future of this part of Scotland so it's very welcome indeed."
Carol Benzie, managing director of Aberdeen International Airport, said: "Not only does this investment represent the most significant upgrade to the airport since the current terminal first opened in 1977, it demonstrates our commitment to providing passengers with high quality facilities.
"We have long recognised the need to expand the terminal and we are doing so with the long term future of the airport in mind."
James Bream, research and policy director at Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: "The investment is fantastic news for Aberdeen International Airport and its customers.
"The airport is our gateway to regional and international markets and the ambitious development plans are fitting for a globally significant city."
