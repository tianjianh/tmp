Kavanagh won Australia's biggest race in 2009 with Shocking, while Moody won 25 straight races with Black Caviar.
Racing Victoria is investigating and says horses trained by the trio exceeded the permitted cobalt levels.
"Our investigations will determine whether any or all of the trainers will be charged with a breach of the rules of racing," said Racing Victoria chairman of stewards Terry Bailey.
"They have the presumption of innocence and are free to continue racing at this time."
Three of O'Brien's horses, and one each trained by Moody and Kavanagh, failed tests after urine samples were taken last year.
