Nigel Richards defeated a rival from French-speaking Gabon in the final in Louvain, Belgium, on Monday.
Mr Richards is said to have memorised an entire French Scrabble dictionary in nine weeks earlier this year.
A previous English Scrabble champion, he originates from Christchurch, New Zealand, and is now based in Malaysia.
He beat Gabon's Schelick Ilagou Rekawe two games to nil in Monday's final.
