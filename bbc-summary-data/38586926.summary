At Leamington Magistrates' Court, Steve Brookes, 55, admitted seven counts of observing a person doing a private act.
Brookes, of Loxley Road, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was arrested in September after the motion-sensitive camera was found in an air freshener.
Brookes, who worked for Channel 4, ITV and the BBC, was granted bail to appear before Warwick Crown Court next month.
Magistrates heard Brookes, who contributed gardening tips to a BBC Radio Coventry and Warwickshire programme, was "full of remorse."
Prosecutor Baldev Atwal told the court: "Mr Brookes's iPhone had an application whereby he would be aware of the activation of that camera and could watch the recordings as they were reviewed and unfolded.
"What will clearly trouble this court is that Mr Brookes has gone to some extent and some length planning and setting up the camera."
Michael Jervis, defending, said Brookes appreciated that he was facing a custodial sentence and regarded his own behaviour as disgraceful and disgusting.
"He is in many ways a ruined man - his income certainly is going to suffer.
"He has become a very well-known character in the local community. He has a very close-knit family and despite his behaviour his family are supporting him."
Police said the action followed reports of incidents between November 2015 and September 2016.
Magistrates opted to commit Brookes for sentence at Warwick Crown Court on 8 February, ruling that their powers of punishment - a one-year jail term - were insufficient.
