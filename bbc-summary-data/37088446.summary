Rio 2016: A record-breaking Olympics for GB's Welsh athletes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Team GB's Welsh athletes have ended their time at Rio 2016 with a record four gold medals and the largest overall Olympic medal haul ever won by Welsh competitors.

The class of 2016 won 10 medals, surpassing the seven collected by Welsh athletes at London 2012.
Gold medals came from two-time taekwondo champion Jade Jones, sailor Hannah Mills and cyclists Elinor Barker and Owain Doull.
Their efforts improve upon the three gold medals won by Welsh competitors in 2012.
BBC Wales Sport has compiled all the key interviews and highlights as we celebrate the success of Welsh medal winners in Rio.
The 23-year-old retained her Olympic -57kg taekwondo title by beating Spain's Eva Calvo Gomez 16-7 in a thrilling final.
Two head kicks in the third round sealed victory for Jones - who has now won both GB's taekwondo gold medals since its introduction as a medal sport in 2000.
"I'm still young so to be double Olympic champion already is crazy to be honest," said Jones.
"I started crying before the semi-final because I was just so nervous and felt so much pressure. But I pulled it off when it mattered so I'm just so happy."

Hannah Mills and Great Britain team-mate Saskia Clark won gold in the women's 470 sailing event.
The pair, silver medallists at the 2012 Olympics in London, held a 20-point lead going into the medal race after winning three times and never finishing below eighth in the 10 preliminary races.
"I can't believe it. It has actually been the best feeling ever," said Mills.
"We have forgotten all about London. We are so proud to come back after it and we've worked so hard to get the upgrade to gold. Thank you to everyone back home for the support."

The 21-year-old from Cardiff claimed a gold medal after Team GB stormed to success in the women's team pursuit.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Barker and Katie Archibald clocked a time of four minutes 10.236 seconds to beat the USA in world record time.
"What do people say at a time like this? It is incredible," said Barker, competing in her first Olympic games.
She also said she "will probably" quit Great Britain's track pursuit team to concentrate on individual races in 2017.

Becky James won her second silver of Rio 2016 by finishing second in the women's sprint.
The 24-year-old, who claimed silver in the keirin on Sunday, lost the first two races in the best-of-three final as Germany's Kristina Vogel won gold.
"I really wanted gold but Vogel is an incredible rider," said James.
It has been an impressive Games for the Abergavenny-born star, who missed London 2012, won two world titles in 2013 but then overcame a cancer scare and career-threatening injuries to secure her place in Rio.

The Cardiff rider, 23, was the first Welsh athlete to win gold at the 2016 Olympics as he helped Great Britain men's pursuit team defend their cycling title.
Doull emulated fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas, who won at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, by helping Great Britain win in a world record time.
"I've dreamt of this moment for so long," said Doull, who rode alongside Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy.
"It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work."

The 25-year-old won silver in the women's 800m freestyle on 13 August, to add to the silver in the 400m freestyle she had won earlier in the week.
Carlin was beaten in both races by record-breaking American Katie Ledecky.

She puts her success down to finally starting to believe in herself following advice from a sports psychologist.
Carlin, who missed the London 2012 Games because of illness, was delighted to win two silver medals after years of upheaval.
"It has been tough. I relocated to the Bath programme two years ago and changed coaches and change where I live.
"To come away with two silver medals is an incredible feeling."

The Welsh pair won silver medals as part of the Team GB squad which was beaten 43-7 by Fiji in the inaugural men's rugby sevens final.
Great Britain were unbeaten in the competition going into the final, which they reached with a narrow 7-5 win over second seeds South Africa.
Scarlets flanker Davies said after the match that he was grateful that Wales coach Warren Gatland did not pick him for Wales' summer tour of New Zealand, which meant he could take part in the Rio Games.
"It does feel quite special, this is a moment I'm never going to forget. I'm just so glad to be a part of it," added Davies.

The 28-year-old from Wrexham won silver in the double sculls alongside rowing legend Katherine Grainger.
Her silver was the first Welsh women's rowing Olympics medal in history and all the more remarkable as her partnership with Grainger was dissolved earlier this year.
The pair were dropped from the double sculls but reunited for Rio just six weeks prior to winning their medal.
"It's been a hard few months," admitted Thornley. "We've had to dig deep.
"It's all a whirlwind. Still, the silver medal is really nice."
