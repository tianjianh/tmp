Drop in bus lane fines for motorists in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of drivers being fined for using Cardiff bus lanes has dropped significantly in the past six months, according to council figures.

Fines were introduced in December 2014, initially during rush-hour but expanded to cover office hours in autumn 2015.
In November 2015, 11,427 fines were issued and 10,853 upheld, falling to 6,832 and 5,835 respectively in February.
A council spokesman said the decline was "very encouraging".
Cameras have been installed on Crwys Road, Custom House Street, Duke Street, Kingsway, Newport Road, Park Place and Westgate Street.
February's figures were higher than the preceding month, but the council said that included two Six Nations matches.
Anyone caught driving in a bus lane faces a £35 fine, which can double to £70 if it is not paid within 21 days.
The spokesman added: "There will always be spikes and troughs in the data due to how busy the city centre is and whether the city is hosting high-profile events."
Motorists can also be fined for stopping in yellow cross-hatch boxes.
In June, it was revealed more than £1m had been raised in fines during the first six months of the scheme.
