The 31-year-old former Hull and Sunderland player has made 24 appearances for the Canaries this season but has not featured since 7 February.
"As soon as I learned of Fulham's interest I wanted to come here," Turner told the west London club's website.
"I just want to try and make a big influence on the team."
Fulham are 21st in the Championship table, eight points above the relegation zone.
