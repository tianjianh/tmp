Championship club Bristol City have re-signed Sunderland defender Adam Matthews on a season-long loan deal.

The 24-year-old Wales full-back played nine times in a loan spell with City at the end of last season and returns for the entire 2016-17 campaign without a recall option.
"I'm pleased to have Adam back with us," head coach Lee Johnson told the club's official website.
"He certainly fits the bill in terms of quality and experience at this level."
Matthews, who has won 13 caps for Wales but missed out on selection for Euro 2016, moved to Sunderland from Celtic in June 2015.
He made his Premier League debut for the Black Cats in the opening game of last season but suffered an ankle injury in August and was out for six weeks.
Matthews failed to regain his first-team place and moved to Ashton Gate at the start of March, before missing the last two Championship matches with a hamstring strain.
Matthews is the Robins' seventh summer signing after goalkeeper Ivan Lucic, defender Hordur Magnusson, midfielders Gary O'Neil and Josh Brownhill, winger Callum O'Dowda and forward Lee Tomlin.
