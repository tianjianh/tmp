Train delays to major airports expected because of engineering work

Passengers going by train to the UK's two biggest airports are set to face long delays over the festive period as engineering work begins.

Gatwick Express train services will stop for the next 10 days, while the Heathrow rail links will stop for four.
Network Rail said 20,000 of its workers would be carrying out almost 500 improvement projects across the whole of the UK during the festive season.
Its chief executive Mark Carne has thanked passengers for their patience.
He also said that passengers had in the past "shown themselves to be incredibly understanding of planned improvement work".
Gatwick Express trains will be suspended from 24 December to 4 January, while work is undertaken to replace a major railway junction at Purley, south London.
Southern Railway services to Sussex will also be affected.
Neither Heathrow Express nor Heathrow Connect services will run for four days after Christmas Eve, due to a line closure between Paddington and Slough.
Services to the South West and south Wales will also take longer as some trains are diverted to London Waterloo or Marylebone stations.
The West Coast Main Line will be closed between Crewe and Stafford between Friday and Tuesday, while there is also a closure on the lines from London Liverpool Street to Colchester, Ipswich and Norwich.
Network Rail always plans its biggest engineering jobs over the holidays because the trains are much quieter.
This year, it's the fast services to the two biggest airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, that will be hit the hardest.
The last Gatwick Express of the year leaves London at 21.15 on Christmas Eve, although slower services do start again on 27 December.
If you're planning a rail journey over Christmas and the New Year, the best advice is to check online first.
Network Rail got it badly wrong last year, as over-running work and a terrible back up plan caused chaos for thousands of travellers. Network Rail insists that won't happen again.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said Britain's "over-stretched" railways had suffered from signal failures, staff shortages and overcrowding in recent weeks.
Last year there was severe train disruption when engineering work on the lines from King's Cross and Paddington overran, delaying travellers on the first Saturday after Christmas.
Despite the rail delays airports are expected to be busy with an estimated four million people in the UK travelling abroad during the Christmas and new year period.
Meanwhile, the RAC predicted that Christmas Eve would be the busiest day for traffic on the roads with 4.1 million journeys being made.
Nearly 400 miles of roadworks have been removed to cope with the rush.
