Malan Wilkinson, from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said she was determined to end her life in November 2016.
But stranger Gwyn Jones talked to her, hugged her and stopped her.
Reunited with him, Ms Wilkinson thanked Mr Jones, saying: "I owe everything to him, he was my hero. He was so kind and he changed my life."
She told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: "I think if the world had more people like Gwyn then it would be a better place."
Ms Wilkinson has gone public with her story in an attempt to end the stigma and get people talking about mental health issues, which she says are often regarded as a "taboo".
Mr Jones said he did not think she was happy when he stopped to talk to her.
"She told me to go away," he said.
"We decided in the end that we would have a little hug, and I think from that moment you were safe."
After the meeting Mr Jones emphasised the importance of talking and seeking help for mental health problems.
He said: 'It's a taboo isn't it - we aren't supposed to say the words mental health. But I think that we need to face these things, if you don't talk about it, you won't get any help."
