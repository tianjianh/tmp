The charges relate to a range of fireworks-related offences in the run-up to Bonfire Night. All of the incidents took place in the north of Edinburgh.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said their behaviour was "reckless" and presented a "serious risk" to safety.
He said officer will work to identify all those responsible.
On Sunday 22 November, the police were called after youths threw fireworks at a Lothian Bus and onto the road in the Restalrig Road and Restalrig Road South area.
Ten males - one aged 12, four aged 13, three aged 14, one aged 15 and one aged 17 - were charged in connection with the incident.
The following Tuesday, 24 October, reports were made to police that young men were aiming fireworks at pedestrians and passing traffic at Scotmid, Restalrig Road South.
Two 13-year-olds and a 15-year-old were arrested and charged following the incident.
The 15-year-old has also been charged in connection with an incident at the Gulf petrol station in Restalrig the same day, where a firework was set off in another youth's face.
Several young people were seen throwing fireworks around on the evening of Thursday 26 October, according to reports by residents in Cables Wynd House.
Those responsible also targeted a police car, which arrived at the scene to investigate.
Three males, a 13-year-old and a 17-year-old, have since been charged.
