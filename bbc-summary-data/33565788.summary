St Andrews student Alexander Hilton jailed for poisoning classmate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An American student who poisoned a fellow St Andrews University classmate by lacing a bottle of wine with solvent has been jailed for three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Hilton, 24, encouraged Robert Forbes to drink the wine containing methanol before a ball in Fife.
Mr Forbes needed kidney dialysis after the incident in March 2011 and was left temporarily blind.
Hilton admitted assaulting him to his severe injury, permanent impairment and to the danger of his life.
Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Burns told Hilton: "This was a wicked and deceitful act and it could have had fatal consequences."
The judge said Mr Forbes "has been left with the agonising prospect of going blind in the future".
