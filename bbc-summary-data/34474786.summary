Pink Floyd's original singer and guitarist Syd Barrett is to be honoured with a "creative art installation" in his home city of Cambridge.

The artwork is planned for the Corn Exchange entertainment venue where Barrett, who died in 2006 aged 60, played his last live show in 1972.
Cambridge City Council is expected to approve the Â£10,000 funding.
Cambridge Live, which runs the venue, said the design - to be decided - would reflect Barrett's "genius".
Neil Jones, operations director for Cambridge Live, said: "Our starting point would be not to have a plaque or a bust, but something that would befit the creative genius of Syd Barrett and we are still working on the full form it would take."
Roger Keith Barrett, known as Syd, was Pink Floyd's main songwriter during their first flush of success in 1967, but he parted company with the band in 1968 at the time of their second album A Saucerful of Secrets.
He issued two solo albums and formed a short-lived band called Stars, which appeared at the Corn Exchange in 1972, before withdrawing from public life and living in Cambridge until his death.
Barrett had been an student at Camberwell School of Art in London prior to forming Pink Floyd.
His sister, Rosemary Breen, said: "We welcome this opportunity to commemorate Roger.
"He was bright, funny, quirky and witty and was an artist - not just in terms of music or paintings - but in a much wider sense.
"We look forward to working with Cambridge Live to create a lasting memory of an inspiring man."
The city council is due to fund the project using Section 106 money provided by developers for community facilities.
It is hoped the installation will be unveiled in sometime next year.
