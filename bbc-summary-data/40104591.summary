Scotland's Anna Signeul says the loss of star midfielder Kim Little to serious injury is upsetting to her squad ahead of the Euro 2017 finals.

The team manager was speaking as she added midfielders Chloe Arthur and Joelle Murray, plus defender Vaila Barsley, to her warm-up party.
Arsenal 26-year-old Little misses out with a cruciate ligament injury.
"Losing a player like Kim is obviously upsetting for the team," said Signeul. "We are devastated for Kim."
Signeul had hoped to add the midfielder to her squad as the Scots host Romania at Falkirk Stadium on 9 June before travelling to take on Sweden on 13 June as they prepare for this summer's finals in Netherlands.
But Little, who has 117 caps and had been suffering from a niggling injury, picked up a cruciate ligament problem during training with her club.
Signeul said it was a blow for the midfielder to suffer such an injury "at such a bad time" but urged her to now target helping Scotland to the 2019 World Cup finals in France.
"We wish her well in her recovery and hope to see her back in a Scotland jersey soon," said the Scotland boss.
"The important thing for Kim now is to concentrate on returning to full fitness.
"She is young and will have the chance to represent Scotland at other major championships in the future.
"But we will continue to focus on our preparations for the Euros as planned to ensure that we make the nation proud."
Hibernian 30-year-old Murray has returned to fitness after missing the recent friendly defeat by Belgium, while Bristol City 22-year-old Arthur also missed that game.
Barsley, the English-born 29-year-old who plays for Eskilstuna United in the Swedish top flight, made her debut in that 5-0 loss in Belgium.
"Vaila did very well in her debut against Belgium last month and we want to give her another opportunity to stake her claim for a place in the squad for the Euros," added Signeul.
"We are very happy to have Joelle return to fitness after missing the last match, while Chloe has done very well for Bristol during the spring and we are excited to have her in the squad."
