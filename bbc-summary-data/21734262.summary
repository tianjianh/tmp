Six Nations: Ireland's Eoin Reddan faces long absence with broken leg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland scrum-half Eoin Reddan has been ruled out for three months after suffering a broken leg in Saturday's Six Nations match against France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Replacement Reddan fell awkwardly beneath a tackle in the final minute of a compelling 13-13 draw and was given oxygen before being carried off.
Lock Donnacha Ryan damaged a shoulder during the game and centre Luke Marshall sustained concussion.
Both are doubts for the closing match away to Italy next Saturday.
Flanker Peter O'Mahony, scrum-half Conor Murray, centre Brian O'Driscoll and wing Fergus McFadden also picked up a variety of knocks.
Already missing were lock Paul O'Connell, wings Tommy Bowe and Craig Gilroy, centre Gordon D'Arcy, flanker Stephen Ferris and fly-half Jonathan Sexton.
Head coach Declan Kidney, however, refused to complain about Ireland's misfortune.
"We took a conscious decision that we would not complain about things," he said.
"Other people are worse off than we are, plus it is such an insult to the lads coming on and having a huge go.
"We are frustrated, but there are lads coming in who have no experience at this level under their belts and are doing such a good job for us.
"On any given day Paul O'Connell, Tommy Bowe, Stephen Ferris and Jonathan Sexton would be in the running for a Lions spot.
"I have never experienced an injury run like this, but you work your way through and I spoke to Jamie Heaslip about it and we agreed not complain."
