[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs are to visit an asylum seekers' centre in Cardiff at the centre of rows about overcrowding and the wearing of wristbands to receive food.

Members of the Welsh Affairs Committee will meet managers from the company running Lynx House on Monday.
Committee chair David Davies said MPs wanted to "get behind the headlines".
"It is important that we scrutinise this area now as the refugee crisis shows little sign of abating in the near future," he added.
Earlier in February, Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens said Lynx House staff told that her asylum seekers, some injured and some suffering from scabies, were being sent there in "crazy" numbers.
A rule making Lynx House residents wear coloured wristbands to get food was scrapped after claims that the practice was dehumanising and made people targets for abuse.
