With the game reduced to 32 overs per side, Quinton de Kock led the way for the tourists, smashing seven sixes in his 104 from 78 balls before retiring.
Wayne Parnell (61) and JP Duminy (68) also feasted on the county attack as the tourists made 289-4.
Sussex were never in the hunt after slumping to 30-3, finishing on 223-9.
Harry Finch (62) and Delray Rawlins (41) were the top scorers for the home side against a South Africa XI missing one-day captain AB de Villiers and Test skipper Faf du Plessis because of illness and injury.
South Africa next face Northamptonshire on Sunday before three one-day internationals against England precede their involvement in the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
Following that, De Villiers' men remain in the UK to face England in three Twenty20 internationals and four Tests.
