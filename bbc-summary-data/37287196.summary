[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Peacock made his Hull KR debut as they scored 10 tries past London Broncos to seal victory in the capital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers hit the ground running early on and were rewarded with two tries from Thomas Minns and one from Ben Cockayne.
Kieran Dixon extended Hull KR's lead but Alex Walker and James Cunningham pulled the Broncos back into the game.
However, tries from James Greenwood, Matty Marsh, James Donaldson, debutant Will Jubb and a hat-trick from Minns gave Rovers a comfortable win.
Former England captain Peacock, 38, came out of retirement after agreeing a deal with Hull KR until the end of the season, and came on just before the break to make his debut.
The result moved Rovers up to third place in the Qualifiers table and they are now level on six points with Huddersfield Giants with two games left to play.
London Broncos slipped to their fourth defeat since the split, but can still qualify for the Million Pound Game depending on results elsewhere.
