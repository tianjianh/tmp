Scott Sinclair credits his great start at Celtic to manager Brendan Rodgers' faith in him.

The 27-year-old has scored in each of his six league games since joining the Scottish champions.
"On a personal level, it's about me getting back to enjoying football and that's exactly what I'm doing," Sinclair told BBC Scotland after Saturday's 6-1 win over Kilmarnock.
"I've got a manager who believes in me and gets the best out of me."
Sinclair and Rodgers worked together at Chelsea and Swansea and were reunited when Celtic paid Aston Villa an undisclosed fee to bring the player in on a four-year deal in August.
The manager hailed Sinclair's "incredible" goal-run, revealing the winger had been hampered by recent illness.
"Scott was not well all week," Rodgers explained. "He didn't train after the game last weekend and we gave him a 45 minute rest on Wednesday [the 2-0 League Cup win against Alloa].
"But he always has a hunger to work hard and to score.
"He showed great composure for the goal."
Sinclair's strike against Kilmarnock came from the penalty spot, with Leigh Griffiths giving up the opportunity to score after he was fouled.
The gesture from the striker, who had already netted as a substitute on his return from injury, was appreciated, with Sinclair saying: "It was great from Griff and it just goes to show the togetherness in the team.
"I came here to score goals and create and as long as I'm doing my job I'm happy."
Next up for Celtic is a Champions League meeting with one of Sinclair's former clubs, Manchester City.
Pep Guardiola's side top the Premier League and have won all 10 of their games since the Spaniard took over, including a 4-0 demolition of Borussia Monchengladbach in their Group C opener, while Celtic were routed 7-0 in Barcelona.
"It's going to be massive," said Sinclair, who moved to City from Swansea in 2012.
"All the players are telling me when the Champions League nights are here it's unbelievable. Celtic Park will be rocking and I'm really looking forward it.
"With the fans behind us, it definitely spurs us on and gives us that little bit of edge."
Sinclair made just two league starts for City, spending time on loan at West Brom and Aston Villa before switching permanently to Villa in 2015.
"I wouldn't say I had a point to prove," said Sinclair. "I'm just enjoying football again. I've got a smile on my face and I'm scoring goals and we're winning games."
