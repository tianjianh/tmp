Tony Conway from Newtownstewart suffered injuries to his back and legs after the bull, which weighed around a tonne, attacked him while he was working in the field.
Mr Conway told BBC Radio Foyle only he only survived by pulling on the bulls nose ring.
"He came running towards me and I was on the ground within seconds", he said.
"I was unconscious for a while and he was goring me with his head.
"He was on my hips and back and legs. I was wondering what I was going to do.
"I tired to get up but he kept pulling me back. I tried to grab the wire fence but kept sliding.
"I thought it was the end of me. I asked him in that moment if he was going to kill me.
"I'm really lucky to be alive. I could be getting buried today.
"I grabbed the bulls nose ring and I pulled at it leading him up the field. I was knackered.
"He knocked the phone out of my pocket so I couldn't call anyone."
A man was killed after an attack by a bull on a farm in County Donegal in September.
Police were called to investigate the sudden death of Patrick Dowds, a man in his 60s, on the farm in Toulett, near Burt.
He was attacked by the bull as he was inspecting fields.
