Mohammad Amir back in Pakistan squad after spot fixing ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fast bowler Mohammad Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad for the first time since his conviction for spot fixing in the Lord's Test in 2010.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old received a five-year ban from all cricket and served three months in prison.
He has been selected to tour New Zealand this month for three Twenty20 and three one-day internationals.
However, the Pakistan Cricket Board said it is dependent on him receiving a visa from the New Zealand government.
Amir was one of three Pakistan players jailed in November 2011 for his part in a conspiracy to bowl deliberate no-balls against England the previous year, when he was only 18.
He was released from Portland Prison in Dorset in February 2012 after serving half of a six-month sentence.
His suspension originally covered all forms of the game but in January last year he was cleared to play domestic cricket in Pakistan.
Amir was selected for a Pakistan training session last month, which Pakistan one-day captain Azhar Ali and former skipper Mohammad Hafeez refused to join in protest at his inclusion.
Ali and Hafeez later reversed their decision and the PCB said Ali would remain as one-day captain after they rejected his offer to resign over Amir's presence.
