[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Greens have "an unprecedented opportunity" at next year's Holyrood election, the party's co-convener will tell their annual conference later.

Patrick Harvie will say a surging membership could see at least eight Green MSPs voted in next May.
That would be a record high and represent one MSP per regional list.
Mr Harvie will tell the conference at Glasgow's SECC the party offers a clear choice on environmental issues.
In his keynote speech, he is expected to say: "Holyrood needs a bold voice to ensure we close the wealth gap, build strong local economies, restore truly progressive taxation and start meeting our world-leading climate change targets. Scottish Greens are trusted, credible and our time is now."
The Scottish Greens have accused the Scottish government of sitting on the fence with the moratorium on fracking and underground coal gasification.
Mr Harvie said his party was unique in offering a clear "no" on these key environmental concerns.
He will tell the conference, which is expected to attract about 700 members over the weekend, that parties do not have to be in government to be relevant.
Mr Harvie will say: "We will campaign on our track record and our vision of a fairer, greener Scotland. We've been at Holyrood since the start and we've got transformational ideas onto the agenda.
"We've helped cut fuel bills by pushing for energy efficiency programmes, we've empowered local communities with the Climate Challenge Fund, we're giving football fans the prospect of ownership of their club, and we're a step closer to gaining rent controls to protect tenants from spiralling costs.
"And on unconventional gas extraction, we have relentlessly pursued ministers to protect our communities. Scottish Greens should be proud of the role we have played and we can offer voters in May a clear choice of opposing extreme energy industries."
