[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Murder detectives have said the answer to the killing of a 68-year-old man in Bradford lies in the local community.

Clement "Butch" Desmier, 68, was found dead at his house in Rowlestone Rise, Ravenscliffe, in August 2012.
The father of six and grandfather of 10 had suffered 70 separate injuries, including 40 stab wounds.
Three years on from the killing police have appealed for help saying "those responsible have links to the local community".
Det Supt Mark Ridley, who is leading the investigation, said: "It is now three years since the murder of Clement Desmier but this is still an ongoing investigation.
"We want to identify and bring to justice those responsible for his brutal murder.
"I believe that those responsible will have confided in others at some time and, because of the location of the offence, that those responsible have links to the local community.
"I would appeal to anybody who has information about the people who are responsible for the murder of Butch Desmier, or why he was killed, to contact West Yorkshire Police."
Two men arrested earlier this year - a 19-year-old and a 32-year-old - remain on bail pending further enquiries.
