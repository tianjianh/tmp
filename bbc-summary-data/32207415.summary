The made-to-order mouthguards are also said to contain gold and diamonds.
"My career's gone on 19 years and I've been able to preserve my smile," he told TMZ website.
The 38-year-old, nicknamed 'Money', is renowned for his ostentatious behaviour and stands to earn £122m from the eagerly-awaited bout on 2 May.
However the amount Mayweather has paid for his mouthguards is less than the sum Britain's Amir Khan spent on his shorts for last December's fight against Devon Alexander.
The 28-year-old from Bolton spent between £20,000 and £30,000 on the garment, which had 24-carat gold thread woven through the waistband.
Khan, who won the fight, donated the shorts to help rebuild the Peshawar army school where 141 children and staff were killed by the Taliban.
