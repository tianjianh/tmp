[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Dagnall scored a brace to help ease Crewe Alexandra's relegation worries with victory over play-off chasing Colchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dagnall, who has now scored three goals in two appearances since returning after a three-match ban, showed his clinical edge in a game of few chances, scoring the opener with a superb header before following that up with a simpler finish six minutes from time.
A third win in four games moves David Artell's side 13 points clear of the League Two relegation zone, while the visitors fell four points adrift seventh-placed Exeter.
After the match had survived two pitch inspections at Gresty Road, the game kicked off 15 minutes late and Crewe started strongest.
Callum Cooke's fierce drive was turned around a post by Sam Walker before Jordan Bowery volleyed over.
Dagnall opened the scoring in the 26th minute as he flung himself to connect with George Cooper's free-kick and headed past Walker.
Colchester went close to levelling when substitute Tarique Fosu volleyed inches past the far post before Crewe goalkeeper Ben Garratt did well to keep out Rekeil Pyke's close-range header with his legs.
And Dagnall made it 2-0 with six minutes left when he turned in Cooke's cut-back pass from the byeline.
Garratt preserved his clean sheet - a third in four games - with two late saves from Brennan Dickenson and substitute Macauley Bonne.
