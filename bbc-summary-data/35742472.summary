[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jim Wells to run for DUP in South Down in assembly election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former health minister Jim Wells is set to be the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) candidate in South Down in May's Northern Ireland Assembly election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Wells was at the centre of a controversy after remarks about same-sex marriage, unstable relationships and child abuse ahead of last year's Westminster election.
As a result, some DUP figures felt he should not stand for election again.
But he has been supported his party colleagues in the constituency.
His name was confirmed on Monday among a list of DUP candidates for this year's assembly election.
Mr Wells resigned as health minister shortly after the row over his remarks at an election hustings in Downpatrick, County Down, last April.
An internal email later emerged in which he accused others in the DUP of not being supportive.
He threatened to resign from the party if he was not offered his job back as health minister.
