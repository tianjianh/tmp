The facility in Coatbridge is capable of washing and drying 600,000 items of bed linen and towels a week for hotels and restaurants around Glasgow.
Cupar-based Fishers also unveiled new livery for its 80-strong fleet of green and white trucks.
The livery features iconic tourism landmarks to tie in with the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design.
The first truck will feature imagery of Glasgow's Finnieston Crane, the Clyde Auditorium and the statue of the Duke of Wellington - complete with its famous traffic cone.
Managing director Michael Jones said: "This will be the largest single laundry investment ever to be made in Scotland and is testament to Fishers' confidence in the strength of the country's growing hospitality industry and our continuing commitment to the sector.
"We're immensely proud of our new super laundry which underlines our commitment to investing in the business in order to service the needs of our customers in the tourism and hospitality sector here in Scotland.
"Being close to our customers is really important to us and this new facility brings us 60 miles closer to the growing Glasgow hotels market."
