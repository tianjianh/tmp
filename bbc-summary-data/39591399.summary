It was part of a larger pod and was spotted breaching clear of the water, not far from a group of surfers.
Malcolm Barradell from the World Cetacean Alliance was on Sennen beach eating a pasty when he saw the display.
Mr Barradell, who has photographed dolphins all over the world, said: "It's always great to see them in home waters."
