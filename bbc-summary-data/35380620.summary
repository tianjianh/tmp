[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior judge has again criticised delays in providing documentation in relation to inquests into contentious Troubles deaths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the end of the first week of a review of the 56 stalled proceedings, Lord Justice Weir said matters "needed to be taken out of neutral and put into a forward-moving gear".
He suggested that better training for those engaged in redaction work might be of benefit.
The review will continue next week.
The two-week review into 56 legacy cases began on Monday.
The cases involve 95 deaths where inquests have still to be heard.
These include some of the most controversial killings during the Troubles.
