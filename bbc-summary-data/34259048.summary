As Britain struggles to solve its housing shortage crisis, experts have been looking at the best solutions to building new homes.
Professor Philip Oldfield and the Sustainable Tall Buildings Design Lab at the University of Nottingham have been trying to predict what new houses will look like in 2050.
A specially-commissioned animated film for BBC Inside Out shows a variety of approaches to how our homes might look in 40 years' time.
The homes of tomorrow could range from sky-high apartments in vertical villages to flat-pack, pre-fabricated housing and eco homes.
Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One on Monday, 21 September at 19:30 BST and nationwide for 30 days thereafter on the iPlayer.
