It tells the story of a schoolteacher's thirst for revenge and her feelings of forgiveness after 30 years in jail for a crime she did not commit.
Diaz said the film was a testimony to the struggles of the Philippines after centuries of colonial rule.
Twenty movies competed in the 73rd edition of the film festival.
"This is for my country, for the Filipino people, for our struggle, for the struggle of humanity. Thank you, thank you so much," the 57-year-old director said as he accepted the award.
The film, Ang Babaeng Humayo in Tagalog, has a running time of almost four hours.
Other awards included:
This year's jury was led by British director Sam Mendes, who said the films in competition proved to be of "a wonderful, astonishing variety".
