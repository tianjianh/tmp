Osbourne told US TV show The Talk, which she co-hosts, that her family "put me into a facility".
"It's very weird when you suffer from a bad depression... I had a complete and utter breakdown," the star said.
"I woke up in Cedars-Sinai hospital and for probably three days I knew nothing. I couldn't think."
She added: "I couldn't talk. I could do nothing. My brain just shut down on me.
"It's hard enough surviving in this world anyway... I was doing too much of everything, thinking I'm a superwoman, 'I'm so strong. I can handle this, I can handle that'. My brain just totally fused.
"I found, for me, that group therapy was the best thing that I could do. People out there, I want you to realise there is so much help out there.
"It's nothing to be ashamed about."
Osbourne and Black Sabbath star Ozzy got back together earlier this year after splitting due to an alleged affair.
Ozzy Osbourne revealed last month he was undergoing "intense therapy" for a "sex addiction" that was putting his marriage at risk.
The Black Sabbath singer said he was "mortified" at the effect his behaviour had had on his family.
Osbourne made the statement following an interview given by his hair stylist Michelle Pugh.
Ms Pugh told People magazine she had had a "very real relationship" with the rock star which had lasted four years.
The singer and TV star Sharon have been married since 1982.
Their family life with two of their three children, Jack and Kelly, was the focus of a hit fly-on-the-wall MTV series from 2002 to 2005.
