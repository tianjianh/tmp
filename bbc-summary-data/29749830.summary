Coventry City Council warns of service cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City Council has warning of "unprecedented" cuts to services as it attempts to tackle a predicted £65m budget shortfall by 2018.

The local authority expects to publish detailed plans of how jobs and services will be affected, later in the year.
Councillor Damian Gannon, in charge of finance, said the city was facing "some stark choices over the coming months".
He said there was "no doubt people will be losing services they've come to take for granted".
The Labour-led council has blamed cuts in central government grants.
The Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities accounted for a quarter of all public spending and that government had delivered a "fair" settlement to every part of the country.
A spokesperson added that government had yet to announce any spending allocations for councils beyond the 2015-16 financial year.
Coventry City Council is predicting a £15.1m budget gap for 2015-16 is likely to rise to £65m by 2017-18 unless savings are made.
"We're absolutely determined to use scarce resources to make sure our most vulnerable residents - children and old people alike - continue to be protected."
He said savings plans would include cutting the number of council-owned buildings, particularly in the suburbs, but services would inevitably be affected.
"Over the coming couple of months councillors will be looking at the detail of options being developed by council officers to help us meet the budget gap, but they'll have very little choice about where to make cuts," he said.
