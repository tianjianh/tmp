The hosts went closest in the first half, with Josh Passley's effort from the edge of the box well saved by Mark Gillespie.
And Gillespie produced another superb stop to deny Christian Doidge just after the interval.

Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: "Whoever we play, I think we're matching teams.
"We're working so hard, we're organised now, we're looking strong. I'm really pleased with everything that we're doing, but it's about both boxes.
"I'm more than pleased with what we're doing, but we've got to maximise the opportunities."
