Twenty-eight pets needed treatment last year after swallowing corn on the cob, according to vet charity the PDSA.

It was the third most common item pets need treatment for after swallowing, with only bones (59) and stones (29) proving to be more hazardous.
PDSA vets dealt with 398 cases in total in 2015, with surgically removed items including toy balls, dummies and socks.
The charity warned owners to keep anything dangerous or easy to swallow "out of paws' reach".
Bradford topped the list of places which saw the highest number of incidents requiring treatment, with 33 in a year. Glasgow was second (23), followed by Gateshead (19).
An American bulldog called Hooch required treatment after eating a corn on the cob husk from a bin.
Owner Sarah Baldwin, from Elland, West Yorkshire, said: "The next day he wasn't himself at all.
"He was sick, he wasn't eating and didn't want to walk."
Hooch had emergency surgery and was discharged two days later.
Rebecca Ashman, a PDSA vet, said: "Pets, especially puppies and younger dogs, like to use their mouth to investigate objects as well as to eat.
"Sometimes a pet will swallow an item by mistake, even though they had only meant to investigate it."
She added: "We might think it's comical but in some cases it is incredibly dangerous and can even prove fatal."
