The 22-year-old woman's car hit a tree in Gibbins Road, Selly Oak, on Thursday at 15:55 BST.
She was held on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and child neglect.
West Midlands Police said the woman would be interviewed in connection with the collision at a later date.
She was one of four people who had been travelling in the car and needed treatment following the crash.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the toddler was confirmed dead at Birmingham Children's Hospital.
A post-mortem examination would take place in due course to determine the precise cause of death, police said.
The child's uncle, Brendan O'Reilly, said she "was always smiling, and never stopped smiling - she was a happy-go-lucky little girl".
He said the last time he had seen the girl was the night before the collision, when she had been her usual happy self.
"She had beautiful blue eyes," he said. "I cannot believe it."
Henna Rai was one of several members of the public, including a medical student, who tried to resuscitate the child at the roadside.
In tears, she returned to the scene on Friday clutching a bunch of flowers.
She said: "We were trying to resuscitate her, and I gave her mouth-to-mouth. A doctor came over to help.
"I just held her, and just wanted her to make it through. When I held her, I saw my own daughter - she was so peaceful."
