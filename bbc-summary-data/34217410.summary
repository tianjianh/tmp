The two boats had been carrying 21 Indian crew members when they were hit - 14 were rescued, and one remains missing.
Reports said the boats may have been hit by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.
Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition fighting rebels who took control over the capital, Sanaa, last September.
The bodies of the six Indians were recovered on Thursday night and were taken to a military hospital, foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
The funerals will be held on Friday in the city of Hodeida, Yemen's second biggest port after Aden and a key source of supplies for the country's capital, Sanaa.
The Indian foreign ministry did not say who it thought had carried out the airstrikes.
However, Yemeni coast guard officials said a Saudi-led coalition attacked more than five boats off the Yemeni coast on Tuesday.
In recent months Yemen has seen conflicts between different groups, pushing the country "to the edge of a civil war", according to a UN official.
The main fight is between forces loyal to the beleaguered President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and those allied to Zaidi Shia rebels known as Houthis, who forced Mr Hadi to flee Sanaa in February.
