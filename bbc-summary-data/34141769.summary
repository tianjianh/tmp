Luton Town: Cameron McGeehan suspended by Irish FA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town midfielder Cameron McGeehan is likely to miss Saturday's League Two match at Cambridge after being suspended by the Irish FA for rejecting a Northern Ireland Under-21 call up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old, who has three Northern Ireland caps at that level, turned down the call to face Scotland and Iceland.
As a result the Irish FA have imposed a Fifa statute which suspends him for the current international window.
Luton have appealed against the Irish FA's decision.
McGeehan had a six-match loan spell at Cambridge last season, where he played against Manchester United at Old Trafford, and joined the Hatters on a permanent contract in the summer, scoring twice in six games.
