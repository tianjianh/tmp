The 35-year-old scored 19 goals for the Royals last season, helping them reach the Championship play-offs.
"We are now looking at a rehabilitation process which will stretch across weeks rather than months." Reading's head physiotherapist Jon Urwin said.
Reading start their Championship campaign with a trip to Queens Park Rangers on 5 August.
