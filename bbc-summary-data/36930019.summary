[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-3 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gillingham fought back from an early setback to start their League One season with a 3-1 win at Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers went in front midway through the first half with Stephen McLaughlin on target but Gillingham hit back to secure all three points at Roots Hall.
Southend, who had manager Phil Brown in the stands serving a touchline ban, started well with David Mooney threatening from 12 yards before they broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute when McLaughlin's long-range shot squirmed under the body of Gillingham goalkeeper Stuart Nelson.
The visiting number one soon made amends by denying Mooney from six yards before Gillingham hit back in the 38th minute with Jay Emmanuel-Thomas firing home Paul Konchesky's left-wing corner.
Gillingham took the lead two minutes into the second half when Max Ehmer headed home a long right-wing throw from Ryan Jackson.
Southend rarely looked like grabbing an equaliser and the visitors completed the scoring in the 79th minute when Emmanuel Osadebe sent a controlled right-footed shot into the bottom left corner of the net.
