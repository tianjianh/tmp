UKIP's Nigel Farage rules out quitting as leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP's Nigel Farage has ruled out standing down as leader of the party despite a bitter row over his future.

MEP Patrick O'Flynn earlier claimed Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of "inexperienced" advisers, which was followed by the departure of two aides.
However, Mr Farage told the BBC's Question Time he had a "phenomenal" level of support within the party.
Leaving as the PM addressed the UK's EU membership ahead of a referendum would be a "massive mistake", he said.
Mr Farage also cleared up a row over Â£650,000 in public funding available to UKIP under a scheme to help minor parties fund their MPs' activities, saying he would recommend the party accepted none of it.
The UKIP leader stood down after failing to win the South Thanet seat in the general election, but was reinstated three days later when the party refused to accept his resignation.
UKIP's economic spokesman Mr O'Flynn had written in the Times that Mr Farage had gone from being a "cheerful, ebullient... daring" politician to a "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive" man.
He said that some around Mr Farage "would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement" and risked turning the party into a "personality cult".
Mr O'Flynn later clarified that he wanted Mr Farage to remain leader. However, party secretary Matthew Richardson and chief of staff Raheem Kassam both left the party.
Several senior figures - including deputy leader Suzanne Evans and donors Arron Banks and Richard Desmond - declared their support for Mr Farage.
But party treasurer Hugh Williams, donor Stuart Wheeler and ex-MEP Godfrey Bloom all suggested he should go, amid claims MEPs were under pressure to publicly support the leader.
When asked on Question Time about Mr O'Flynn's comments, Mr Farage said that although he was disappointed by the remarks, people were merely "letting off steam and... fighting personal wars"  after a high-pressured election campaign.
Pressed on why he had not honoured his pledge to resign if he failed to be elected to Kent's Thanet South seat, Mr Farage repeated that he had formally offered his resignation but that it had been rejected.
"The level of support for me in the party is phenomenal and, frankly, to go through a leadership contest at a time when [David] Cameron says he's renegotiating our relationship with the European Union would be a massive, massive mistake."
