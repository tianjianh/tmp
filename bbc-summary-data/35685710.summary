Rat pack rehomed by Godmanchester's Wood Green shelter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal rescue charity that took on hundreds of rats after a family in Oxfordshire "became overwhelmed" by their pets, has rehomed them all.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wood Green Animal Charity took 219 rats to its Cambridgeshire base. Some were passed to other shelters, but it made a plea for new homes to be found for 140.
A number of the females were on "pregnancy watch" and in the end they had an additional 50 babies.
Before the pack arrived, the shelter had just one rat looking for a home.
The family had started out with just a few rats, but "they were both boys and girls - and stuff happens", a spokeswoman said.

The charity put out a plea for new owners saying: "We have a higher than normal number of rats currently living at the Godmanchester centre. We have males and females of varying ages, all very friendly and lots of different colours."
Dozens of people came forward offering homes.
To prevent owners ending up in the same situation as the Oxfordshire family, the charity usually homes rats with others of the same sex.
"Most people take either boys or girls and we always home at least two together as they're very social animals," the spokeswoman said.
"There was such a lot of interest so it was nice that we could be selective and make sure we got only the very best homes for our rats."
