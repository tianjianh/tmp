[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Federici made the 420-mile round trip from Enda Bolger's County Tipperary yard to claim victory in Sunday's Ulster Grand National at Downpatrick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ridden by Adrian Heskin, the 7-1 shot stayed on strongly from the final fence to win by five-and-a-half lengths.
Previous course winner The Mooch was the 10-1 runner-up with 7-2 favourite Futuramic in third place.
It completed a double for Bolger and Heskin following Lofgren's win in the opening Maiden Hurdle.
Bolger celebrated a winner at the Cheltenham festival on Friday when the JP McManus-owned On The Fringe won the Foxhunter Chase for the second year running.
