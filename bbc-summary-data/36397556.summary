Forest Green Rovers manager Mark Cooper says agents are wrong to think the club has endless finances for new players.

The beaten National League play-off finalists, owned by Dale Vince, had debts of Â£5.4m as recently as December.
The Gloucestershire club are currently building an 'Eco Park', consisting of an all-seater stadium and a 100-acre sports and green technology centre.
"I think every agent thinks at Forest Green there's a gravy train there and loads of money," Cooper said.
"From the outside everybody thinks that, but that's not the case.
"I want to bring in some real good characters, not just people that are coming for a payday or an easy life."
Vince has recently said the club's long-term goal is to reach the Championship, and wants to be in the Football League by the time they move into their new ground.
Cooper was named as the new boss earlier this month and has since given new deals to Sam Wedgbury and captain Aarran Racine.
"We're trying to run things properly and correctly, and any player that comes in certainly won't be for money only," he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"They want to come and progress their careers. If they don't want to and they're just coming to sit on a contract, they're not right for us.
"The chairman has been brilliant in what he's done for the football club - if we need to go and try and attract what we think is a top quality player for the club, I'm sure he'll do it."
Meanwhile, midfielder Marcus Kelly has signed a new one-year contract with Forest Green.
