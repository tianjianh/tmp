Moussa Dembele guided in Michael Madl's header to give Fulham the lead but Hal Robson-Kanu levelled from the spot when he was fouled by Fernando Amorebieta.
Just before the break, Reading went in front when Robson-Kanu latched on to Ola John's precise cross to head home.
But Fulham restored parity when Jake Cooper felled Ryan Fredericks and Ross McCormack scored the spot-kick.

The result means Fulham move up a place to 19th after Bristol City's defeat by Cardiff, but now lie just five points off the relegation places after Rotherham beat Sheffield Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Reading move up a place to 11th and are unbeaten in their last six matches in all competitions.

Robson-Kanu made sure he notched three goals in as many matches thanks to his first-half double, but was replaced by Garath McCleary at the break after picking up a knock in the first half.
Reading tried to force a winner towards the end but despite efforts from Stephen Quinn, John, McCleary, Cooper and Yann Kermorgant, there was to be no repeat of their heroics which earned them a last-minute win in their 4-3 victory against Charlton last week.
Reading manager Brian McDermott: "We were unfortunate not to go 3-1 up against Fulham and, had we done that, it was game over. They were hanging in there.
"We were trying to win the game late on but we take the point, we go up the table one more place, we're unbeaten again and that's about the gist of it."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: "We opened the game very well but, after they scored their goals, we showed some character to come back to score the equaliser.
"We are suffering in this competition by making mistakes. We need to be more solid and Reading pushed us hard during the last 15 minutes.
"When we created half-chances, we weren't clinical enough in the moment. But if we can't get three points, it's better to get one."
