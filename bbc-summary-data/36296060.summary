Clyde: Barry Ferguson enthusiasm not dented by defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barry Ferguson insists that missing out on promotion with Clyde for a second season running has not dampened his enthusiasm for management.

And the former Rangers and Scotland captain, whose side lost to Queen's Park in the play-off final, is already making plans for another attempt.
"I've signed up five players from different clubs for next season, so there will be a few changes," he said.
"There needs to be a few changes and I need a bit more quality."
Ferguson, capped 45 times for Scotland, took over at Broadwood in June 2014 after a six-month spell as caretaker manager of Blackpool during which his side avoided relegation from England's Championship.
"This club's been in the doldrums for the last 10 years," he said of the Cumbernauld outfit who have slumped since being relegated from the second tier in 2009.
"Last year, it wasn't my squad - I think there's only two remaining of the 19 - and obviously I brought my own squad this season.
"I thought they would have been good enough, but a couple of injuries have hampered us, although I am not going to use that as an excuse.
"Overall, we should have had enough quality to win the league, but we weren't consistent enough and I am first to admit that."
Ferguson stressed that he would not be abandoning his "attack-minded" style of play.
"I have had a bit of criticism about that in the past," he admitted.
"I've got my own philosophy. Since I started my coaching badges, I've got a way of playing and sometimes the chairman says I need to calm down a wee bit.
"But that's the way I want to go. I want to play attacking football and take the game to teams."
Clyde finished third in the League Two table, beat runners-up Elgin City in the play-off semi-final but lost to the fourth-top Spiders on aggregate despite winning the second leg 1-0 at Hampden Park.
"In the first 10 minutes, we didn't start well, but then we took control of the game after that and started to pass the ball about like I wanted," added Ferguson.
"We got the penalty and then the second half petered out a bit and it wasn't what I expected.
"I told them they had to go for them and we didn't do that - and we didn't do enough on the day."
