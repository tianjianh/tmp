The Environment Department says the contract has not yet been signed, but it will see the States buying a new fleet of buses over a number of years.
The five-and-a-half year contract went out to tender six months ago.
CT Plus already runs the island's scheduled bus service and claims the new contract will see a number of improvements.
Dai Powell, CEO of parent company HCT Group, said there would be better online information, including real-time data on bus movements through an App.
He said the new terms will also see improvements to the service itself and increased training for the staff to help them deal with the specific needs of islanders.
"We are still in discussions with the States and therefore at this stage we are unable to go into great detail, but we are excited about the possibilities of taking the bus service in Guernsey to the next level," he said.
Environment Department Minister Yvonne Burford said she had received assurances CT Plus would deliver according to the improved terms of service.
No details have been released about how the States intend to provide or pay for a bus depot.
