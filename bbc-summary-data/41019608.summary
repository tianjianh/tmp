In a statement on Twitter, the band said it was "with great regret, due to illness, we cannot perform at Customs House Belfast".
Organisers said they were working to re-schedule the concert.
Many concert goers said they were disappointed with the last-minute cancellation.
Stephen Nelson said the stage was set-up for the band when the news was announced to the audience.
"They had set up everything, all the gear, their background was up, their roadies were on stage.
"Then 10 minutes before an announcement came on the PA that the gig was cancelled.
"People were like, 'are you serious?' Then the announcement was repeated and there was some booing."
Kathryn McKeown said the crowd were "disappointed" when the announcement was made.
"It was lashing rain on and off, everyone was drenched. Blossoms (the support band) were saying, 'are you excited for Kasabian?' before they finished.
She added: "About 10 minutes before the band were due on stage there was an announcement to say that due to last-minute illness the band would be unable to perform, tickets would be valid for a re-scheduled show.
"At first, I think everyone thought it was a joke. After about the third announcement it started to sink in and everyone started booing, some people were even chucking pints and plastic cups at the stage."
In a statement, organisers said: "Due to a last-minute illness we regret that the band have had to cancel tonight's show.
"We are working at this minute on scheduling a new date for Belfast. We will communicate with all ticket buyers via Ticketmaster and on the Custom House Square social media.
"Tickets will remain valid for the new date. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
The band were due to play as part of a series of concerts at Custom House Square.
