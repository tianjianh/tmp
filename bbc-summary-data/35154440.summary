2015 in review: Education in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
2015 ended on a positive note in education, with news of a multi-million pound scheme to provide up to 500 jobs to newly-qualified teachers.

But the year was dominated by concerns about resources.
While the schools budget was relatively protected, if still stretched, higher and further education will face more uncertainty in 2016.
Northern Ireland's two universities suffered cuts of more than £16m from the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) in 2015.
These funding cuts followed years of previous reductions.
Both Queen's University and Ulster University subsequently announced they were shedding hundreds of staff jobs, and jointly cutting more than 2,000 student places.
Ulster University also decided to close its schools of modern languages and maths, among other cuts to departments, provoking an angry reaction from staff unions and some students.
Queen's are due to announce which courses and subjects they will close in spring 2016, leaving many staff concerned about the future shape of the university.
There is little prospect of increases in public funding, or agreement on whether students should pay higher tuition fees, in the new year.
Further education colleges also faced cuts in 2015, and voluntary redundancy deals were offered to almost 500 staff, over 10% of the workforce, in July.
Meanwhile, the Education Authority (EA) finally came into being in April, seven years after it was proposed.
It replaced the five education and library boards, but the original vision for a more wide-ranging Education and Skills Authority had to be abandoned due to a lack of political agreement.
The EA's chief executive Gavin Boyd embarked on money-saving exercises almost immediately, including seeking to lose about 400 of the authority's 3,500 staff through a voluntary redundancy scheme.
Seven years after unregulated tests took the place of the 11-plus exam, the transfer procedure was in the headlines again.
The BBC revealed details of the draft of a wide-ranging report commissioned by the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) that recommended ending academic selection.
The Investigating Links in Achievement and Deprivation report also found that pupils in disadvantaged predominantly Catholic areas outperformed their disadvantaged Protestant counterparts.
It set out a "road map" of good practice to change this, but, as yet, the OFMDFM has not said when the final report will be published.
But amid all the controversies and worries about money it is important to remember that Northern Ireland's education system still produces many successes.
Sixty-seven per cent of year 12 pupils achieved at least five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths in 2014-15, compared with 65.2% the previous year.
This is the first time in Northern Ireland that more than two-thirds of pupils have achieved at least those grades at GCSE since new statistical measurements were introduced in 2008-09.
Northern Ireland schools also continued to deliver learning in innovative ways, leading to national and international recognition for some.
St Patrick's High School in Keady, County Armagh, was voted best secondary school in the UK in the 2015 TES school awards.
About 80% of pupils achieved at least five GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and maths there, making them the highest performing non-selective school in Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, teachers from as far afield as Russia, Greece, Denmark and Iceland travelled to Fairview Primary School in Ballyclare, County Antrim, in November.
They were there to find out how Fairview became the first primary in Northern Ireland to recycle all of its school waste.
With the possibility of a new education minister to replace Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd after elections in May, and DEL being merged into a new Department of the Economy, 2016 is set to be a year of more change.
