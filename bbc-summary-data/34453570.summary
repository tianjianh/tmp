Two police constables who filmed themselves near the Shoreham air crash site have been interviewed by a chief officer over their conduct.

The probationary officers made the video while working near the scene where 11 people died after a jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August.
The recording was made by the police cordon and accompanied by an inappropriate and offensive message.
Sussex Police said the outcome of the interviews would be known this week.
Both officers attended Regulation 13 meetings - which are specific to probationary officers - on 30 September.
After the evidence had been assessed, a recommendation will be made to the Chief Constable as to their future, a spokesman for the force said.
Last month, Sussex Police Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said the pair would face disciplinary proceedings over the video, which was sent on social media, and a private message.
Ms Pinkney said they had behaved in a "wholly disrespectful way".
