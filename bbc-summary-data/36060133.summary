[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Sinister' Thames Valley Police police officer sacked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police sergeant who shot at fellow officers with a BB gun and threatened colleagues with a knife has been sacked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Michael Bromell, of Thames Valley Police, was found to have committed gross misconduct and breached the standards of professional behaviour.
He was dismissed without notice at a misconduct hearing.
Det Chief Supt Tim De Meyer said the officer's behaviour was "bullying" and "oppressive".
Mr Bromell, who was based in the Cherwell area, was dismissed on Friday.
The incidents, which took place between 2011 and 2014, included:
Det Chief Supt De Meyer, who is head of the professional standards department, said: "A sergeant should lead, support and encourage officers to serve the public to the highest standards.
"This is what Thames Valley Police expects of those who operate in this crucial rank. Sergeant Bromell did quite the opposite.
"This bullying behaviour, from an officer in a position of power, caused considerable distress to junior colleagues who simply wanted to get on with their job of keeping people safe.
"Instead they were subjected to sinister and overbearing treatment from the very person who should have been looking out for them.
"It is to their credit that they stood up to him by reporting his misconduct and providing the evidence that has today seen him dismissed."
