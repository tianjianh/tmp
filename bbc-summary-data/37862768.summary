A review of the deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1988 and 2000 found an "almost routine use of opiates had almost certainly" shortened the lives of some patients.
The investigation, launched in 2014, was due to conclude in December 2017.
The government said the work was now likely to end in spring 2018.
Police investigated the deaths of 92 patients but brought no prosecutions.
During a written parliamentary statement, health minister Philip Dunne said: "As a consequence of the greater number of families now in contact with the Panel and the increase in the volume of material the Panel is reviewing, the Panel now expects to complete its work in spring 2018."
The Gosport Independent Panel is headed by the former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, who led the Hillsborough inquiry.
