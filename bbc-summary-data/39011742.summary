[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa v Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa are without striker Scott Hogan, who suffered an ankle injury in their defeat by Newcastle on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading goalscorer Jonathan Kodjia is also a doubt, but full-back James Bree could return from a knee injury.
Derby County midfield duo Craig Bryson (hip) and Johnny Russell (hamstring) could return after injury.
But striker Nick Blackman is likely to remain sidelined with a knee problem, as the Rams look to end a four-game winless Championship run.
