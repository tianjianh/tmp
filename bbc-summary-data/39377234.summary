Police visited the house where Khalid Masood's mother lives in Trelech, along with properties in Birmingham and London on Thursday.
Four people were killed and dozens were hurt after Masood drove a car on to a pavement, stabbed a policeman before he was shot dead by police on Wednesday.
Police said nobody living at the house was a suspect.
A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said on Thursday: "The Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by officers of Dyfed-Powys Police, have today provided assistance to The Metropolitan Police, following yesterday's incident in London.
"In doing this, they have conducted a search of one property in Carmarthenshire - this search has concluded.
"The occupants are receiving appropriate support. They are not suspects and have not been arrested."
The force added there was no threat to the area.
Police said more arrests were made overnight and officers have seized thousands of items which were now being analysed.
South Wales Police and Gwent Police have said they are reviewing respective security arrangements in light of the incident and there would be an increase in police presence in busy areas.
The so-called Islamic State group has said it was behind the attack.
The Metropolitan Police said there had been no prior intelligence about Masood's intention to carry out an attack.
He was known to the police and had previous convictions for causing grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.
He was believed to have been living in the West Midlands and is also believed to have lived at various times in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex.
But it is unclear if he had any contact with his mother in west Wales.
