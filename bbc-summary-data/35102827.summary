Alice Hooker-Stroud, assembly election candidate for Mid and West Wales, will take over from Pippa Bartolotti.
"This is an exciting time for the Wales Green Party - we enter the Welsh assembly election as a determined and energetic party, we can and we will win seats," said Ms Hooker-Stroud.
Hannah Pudner will succeed Anthony Slaughter as deputy leader.
"The Wales Green Party has the solutions to many of the problems we face in our communities," said Ms Hooker-Stroud, an activist and events assistant from Machynlleth, Powys.
"Solutions that tackle not just social, but environmental problems, solutions not just for local problems, but global problems too."
Ms Bartolotti, who is stepping down after four years at the helm, said:  "Over the last few years the Wales Green Party has gone from strength to strength and, as we build momentum to the Welsh assembly elections in May, it will carry on doing so.
"Voters are ready to hear people speak out with real solutions and that is what the Wales Green Party offers.
"I look forward to working with Alice over the coming months and supporting her during her leadership."
The new Wales Green Party office will be run by campaign manager Dan Boyle, a former Green MP in Ireland.
He said it was a "momentous time" for the party and he had "every confidence" the first Green AMs would be elected in May.
"We have an excellent set of candidates, a strong and motivated supporter base, and the infrastructure to realise our potential," he said.
