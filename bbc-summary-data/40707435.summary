The 23-year-old was a free agent after Notts County's liquidation and played for Yeovil in the 2017 Women's Super League Spring Series.
"It's been a tough few months with everything at Notts County but I'm excited to get started," she said.
"Hopefully I can bring some experience. I'm still a young player but I've played in this division before."
