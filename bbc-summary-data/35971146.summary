Welsh election: Boris Johnson claims Tories on the rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boris Johnson has said the Conservatives are "on the rise" in Wales ahead of May's assembly election.

The Mayor of London spent Tuesday campaigning in Wales, visiting Newport, Cardiff and Brecon, Powys.
He claimed Labour was "complacent" on health and education, and had no "divine right" to rule Wales, saying people "deserve better".
On the steel crisis, Mr Johnson said the UK government was "doing its absolute best" to sort it out.
"What you've seen in Wales over the last 17 years is a very, very complacent Labour administration," he said.
"They think that they can get away with anything. Services to the best of my knowledge have been deteriorating - you haven't got the proper health care that you need in this part of the country and I really want to see some progress.
"I really think that when you look at what has been happening in this part of our country in the last 17 years of Labour administration it isn't good enough - the people of Wales deserve better."
"They deserve not to have to wait so long for their appointments, they deserve access to the kind of cancer drugs that people in England can get automatically."
Mr Johnson would not be drawn on the subject of the EU referendum - both he and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies support the campaign for the UK to leave the union.
Responding for Welsh Labour, a spokesman said: "That Andrew RT Davies's own party colleagues have to resort to vacuous bombastic attacks because of the dearth of policy ideas from the Welsh Conservatives speaks volumes.
"While the Welsh Tory leader joked around with Boris Johnson, Carwyn Jones was working to secure a future for Welsh steel."
