Repsol Sinopec said production had been shut down after a sheen was seen on the sea surface near the Montrose Alpha and Arbroath platforms on Saturday morning, 200km (124 miles) east of Aberdeen.
A spokesman said: "There has been no further evidence of any sheen in the area and the original sheen has now naturally dispersed."
A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is being used as part of the probe.
