Wedgbury, 28, came on as a substitute in Forest Green's 3-1 win over Tranmere in the National League promotion final.
He started his career at Worcester City and has also played for Macclesfield Town, Stevenage and Sheffield United.
"He's a fit lad, goes box to box, sits in there to break things up and he's a good size," Wrexham manager Dean Keates said.
Wedgbury is Wrexham's fifth summer signing, with James Hurst, Shaun Pearson, James Jennings and Chris Holroyd having already joined.
