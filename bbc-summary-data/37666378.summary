Police had initially asked for help to trace Farrah Fadli, 29, McKenzie Scullion, 10, and Eva Kerr, 4.
They had been missing since about 11:00 on Wednesday, and officers were concerned for their welfare.
At about 19:15 on Friday Ms Fadli, who lives in Ayr and is also known as Farrah Gillespie, left the children with a friend in Irvine.
Ms Fadli remains missing. She is 5ft 4in, of slim build with dyed blonde hair.
Officers said she has not gone missing before.
A police spokesman said: "Farrah is still missing. She dropped off the children at a friend's house in Irvine around 7.15pm last night but left soon after.
"Police are continuing their search for Farrah and would appeal to either herself to get in touch with them or her family or for anyone who knows where she is to contact officers at Ayr Police Office via 101."
