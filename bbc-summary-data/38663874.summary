Blackburn are hopeful that Tommie Hoban will return from injury in February.

The 22-year-old defender, on loan from Watford, had only played 10 times for the club before dislocating a shoulder.
Manager Owen Coyle told the club website: "He's got a meeting with the surgeon that did his operation and then hopefully he can get the all-clear.
"To my mind I would love to have Tommie available from the middle of February towards the end of the month because that would add a real quality player."
Hoban joined Blackburn in August but his last game for the club was in mid-October, before he dislocated his shoulder in training.
Rovers are 22nd in the Championship, a point adrift of safety.
