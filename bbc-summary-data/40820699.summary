The 70-year-old Spaniard won 13 titles and 90 grands prix in a 22-year career between 1964 and 1986.
MotoGP described Nieto "as a true giant of motorcycling history who will be greatly missed".
Nieto was taken to hospital after the quad bike he was riding collided with a car on 26 July.
MotoGP said he had remained in intensive care for a week after the accident, before his condition deteriorated.
Nieto was an expert on smaller machines, winning titles in both the 50cc and 125cc classes.
