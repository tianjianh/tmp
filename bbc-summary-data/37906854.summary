The Blues take on the League One side in the Checkatrade Trophy on Tuesday.
Zouma, 22, needed surgery after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury during a 1-1 Premier League draw with Manchester United in February.
The Â£12m signing from Saint-Etienne has featured in Chelsea's past two development squad games.
"I have been training with the development squad for a couple of weeks and I've enjoyed the experience a lot," Zouma told Chelsea's official website.
"I have been going step by step with my rehabilitation and the games were a good test for me and my knee."
