Plans have been hatched to remodel New York's Lyric theatre for the arrival of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
Potter creator JK Rowling said she was "delighted" her team were "one step closer" to transferring the play.
The two-part production has been a sold-out success since opening at London's Palace Theatre in June.
Formerly known as the Foxwoods Theatre, the 1,900-seat Lyric was bought by the Ambassador Theatre Group in 2013.
It is proposed that the theatre - one of Broadway's largest - be reconfigured into a "more intimate playhouse" with approximately 1,500 seats.
According to producers Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, the remodelling will result in "a unique theatre space tailored to the specific needs of the production".
Rowling, who devised the play's story with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, said she was "very excited by the proposed plans".
The Lyric currently plays host to Cirque du Soleil show Paramour, tickets for which are available until the end of July.
