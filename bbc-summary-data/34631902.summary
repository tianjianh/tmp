The team of Amy Tinkler, Ruby Harrold, Ellie Downie, Becky Downie, Claudia Fragapane and Kelly Simm finished third - behind the US and Russia but ahead of China - with eight places at the Rio Olympics in Brazil up for grabs.
"We are incredibly proud," Becky Downie said of their achievement.
"Coming in to this championships all our focus was on producing the best team results we could and to have placed third is very special."
As well as claiming the team final place, several GB gymnasts have booked places in individual finals.
15-year-old Tinkler will go in Thursday's all-around final on her senior World Championships debut along with Harrold, who will also take part in uneven bars.
Ellie Downie will challenge on vault and floor, where she will be joined by Fragapane.
