The image, one of three taken by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, shows the Queen surrounded by her five great-grandchildren and her two youngest grandchildren.
Viscount Severn is the younger child of Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.
Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex.
Mia Tindall was born in January 2014. She is the daughter of the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and former England rugby player Mike Tindall.
Princess Charlotte is the daughter of William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She was born in May 2015. She is fourth in line to the throne and is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.
Savannah is the eldest daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips and was the Queen's first great-grandchild.
Prince George of Cambridge was born in July 2013. The eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is third in line to the throne, after his grandfather and father. His full name is George Alexander Louis.
Isla is the second daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips. Her father is the son of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips.
