Scott Brown believes it could be to Scotland's advantage if Gordon Strachan fields several Celtic players in his starting line-up against England.

Strachan started six Celtic players in Scotland's last World cup qualifier against Slovenia, and Brown believes that makes sense.
"When Spain [won] the World Cup and the Euro's, they had seven or eight Barcelona players," Brown said.
"It shows that the club mentality can go onto international level as well."
Celtic could have a seventh player in the mix for Strachan's Scotland squad against England in Callum McGregor. The 23-year-old midfielder is being heavily tipped for a call up for the qualifier at Hampden on 10 June after impressing for Celtic since the start of the year.
Brown, McGregor's club captain, believes he's "due a call-up".
Speaking to BBC Scotland, Brown said: "The wee man has been brilliant since he's come in. He's scored goals, and against Aberdeen [last Friday] he sat in front of the back four and did fantastic.
"It's great for the wee man to get the run out to get the experience as well, and he's probably due a Scotland cap and what a time to get it [if he does] against England."
On his own long-term international future, Brown says he's talked to Strachan "a couple of times" and "will see what happens there".
Brown has previously said he'll make himself available for the game against England, but wouldn't comment on the remaining World Cup qualifiers, which will be played in September and October.
"My body is feeling good and and I hopefully can maintain the level that I've been playing at next season as well.
"We're still talking about this [England] game, so me and Gordon will sit down and we'll see what happens."
Brown is also about to reach a milestone at Celtic. It'll be 10 years to the day tomorrow [Tuesday 16 May] that he signed for the club from Hibernian.
"It's been great, there's been a lot of ups and downs, but I came to Celtic wanting to win trophies and that's why I'm still at Celtic. Here's hoping I've got a few more years left to win more trophies, and entertain the fans - as that's what we're here to do."
Brown admits he had the opportunity to leave Celtic, but decided against it.
"I had the chance to go down to England, but I decided to stay [for] the love of the club, plus we're in Champions League football where you're playing against the best players in the world. That's what you want to do when you're at a huge club like this and that's what I've managed to do."
Reflecting on his decade at Celtic, Brown admits that he "felt young" when he arrived.
"I was a cocky 21 year old, so not a lot has changed," he joked. "I've matured a wee bit and I've understood how the gaffers, especially this one, have wanted us to play. I've enjoyed every single moment of it."
