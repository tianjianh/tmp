Lavezzi's treble was supplemented by two goals from Edinson Cavani and one for defender Maxwell, while Marko Basa scored Lille's only goal.
The champions are three points clear of second-placed Lyon in the table, both having played 33 matches.
Lyon will regain top spot on goal difference should they win away at Reims on Sunday evening.
Brazil left-back Maxwell put PSG, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona during the week, ahead in the first minute of the game and three minutes later Uruguay striker Cavani doubled the lead.
Argentina forward Lavezzi added two more goals before half-time, but Montenegro defender Basa pulled one back for Lille after the break.
Any hopes of a comeback were dashed when Sebastien Corchia gave away a penalty - converted by Cavani - and was sent off.
Lavezzi rounded off the scoring with his third goal 13 minutes from time as PSG notched their fifth successive league win.
In the pick of the day's other Ligue 1 games, 18-year-old Francois Kamano scored twice as Bastia came from behind to beat relegation rivals Evian 2-1. They are now three points clear of 18th-placed Evian.
Bordeaux drew 1-1 with Metz, Guingamp beat Caen 2-0, Rennes beat Nice 2-1 and Toulouse drew 1-1 with Nantes.
