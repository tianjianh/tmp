200% council tax plan to tackle Newport's empty homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to charge double the amount of council tax on long-term empty homes in Newport are being considered to try and tackle the issue of vacant properties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newport council claims they have a detrimental impact on communities and can cause problems for neighbours.
There are currently 2,516 vacant properties in the city, with 1,142 exempt from council tax because they are undergoing major work.
The council hopes the move will urge owners to bring them back into use.
Under the plans, the council would charge 200% council tax on properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.
Based on the average annual council tax bill for Band D properties in Newport, between Â£1,149 and Â£1,174 depending on the area, the council could recoup about Â£2,200 per property a year.
Of the 1,104 empty homes in the city for which council tax is charged, 755 have been vacant for more than a year.
The council already has ways to tackle the issue, such as the Houses into Homes loan scheme.
But it hopes the extra premium will discourage long-term disuse while also bringing in more money to help it work with owners to bring properties back into use.
As well as improving the quality of life for nearby residents, the authority said the move would help increase the availability of affordable homes.
Other councils in Wales have already brought in similar measures to cut the rising number of second homes.
Anglesey council voted through a 25% increase while Pembrokeshire agreed a 50% increase from April 2017.
The move comes after new powers were introduced by the Welsh Government in March.
Residents can have their say on the proposals until 31 October.
