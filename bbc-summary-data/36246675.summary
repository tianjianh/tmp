Reality Check: Do 100,000 North East jobs depend on EU?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Over the weekend, former Foreign Secretary David Miliband told an audience in Sunderland 100,000 jobs in north-east England were dependent on EU membership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The claim: 100,000 jobs in north-east England are dependent on EU membership.
Reality Check verdict: The research does not suggest all these jobs are dependent on EU membership, so there is no reason to think they would all disappear if the UK left.
The Britain Stronger in Europe website also makes this claim, sourcing it to the Treasury, meaning it is likely to be based on the same research that gave us the much-used claim that 3.3 million UK jobs were linked to exports to the European Union.
In a speech at Ellesmere Port on 10 March, Prime Minister David Cameron said there were "three million jobs dependent on trade with the European Union".
How the Treasury worked this out is important.
It worked out what proportion of the country's total economic output was made up of exports to the EU.
Then, it calculated that proportion of the UK labour force.
In a parliamentary answer in 2014, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury Lord Deighton said: "This figure is based on the assumption that the share of UK employment associated with UK exports to the EU is equal to the share of output that is exported to the EU"
"It is not an estimate of the impact of EU membership on employment."
So, it is clear not all of these jobs are dependent on the UK remaining part of the EU - nobody is suggesting all exports to other EU countries would immediately stop if the UK left.
Other expressions have been used for this research, such as saying the jobs are linked to the EU or related to the EU, which may be argued to be the case.
But saying all the jobs are dependent on EU membership is a step too far for this research.
