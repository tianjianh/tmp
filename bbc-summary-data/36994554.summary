[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 2-0 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover claimed their first win of the National League campaign with a comfortable 2-0 win over newly-promoted North Ferriby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dover striker Ricky Modeste tested Rory Watson's reactions early on after his third-minute strike hit a post, but the North Ferriby goalkeeper was quickest to the rebound.
Chris Kinnear's side finally got their breakthrough 11 minutes before the interval, with Moses Emmanuel profiting from Ross Lafayette's unselfish cross in the box to score his first goal for The Whites.
Lafayette got his reward in the 75th minute as he pounced on a defensive mix up to curl it in and wrap up the win for Dover.
