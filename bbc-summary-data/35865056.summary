[SN]TITLE[SN]
Men linked to Birmingham 'gun or gang crime' named

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The names of 18 men banned from parts of Birmingham for what police say are their links to "gun or gang crime" can be revealed by the BBC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Interim injunctions were obtained by West Midlands Police, but the force had declined to reveal the men's identities until permanent orders were granted.
However, details were revealed in County Court documents seen by the BBC.
Labour MP Khalid Mahmood criticised police using civil action to tackle gun crime rather than criminal charges.
West Midlands Police said any criminal offence would "always take precedence over a civil matter".

On Friday, the city saw its fourth fatal shooting in six months, although there is no suggestion these 18 men are linked to the ongoing inquiry.
The orders were designed "to prevent gang-related violence and drug-dealing activity".
There will be an application to make the injunctions permanent at another hearing later in 2016, said the force.
Police said even if individuals were found not guilty at court, then on the civil "balance of probabilities" threshold they could have breached their injunction and face up to two years behind bars.
That is compared to the burden of proof in criminal cases in the UK of "beyond reasonable doubt".
Possession of a firearm carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.
Mr Mahmood, whose Birmingham Perry Barr constituency includes part of the exclusion zone, said: "We should not be looking at civil powers to deal with this when there is sufficient other legislation in place.
"The case is if you are carrying a gun that is a criminal offence.
"Gun crime is a huge concern and I will be asking the Chief Constable if we have a problem with policing personnel to tackle this after cuts."

All 18 men have been banned from parts of Lozells, Newtown, Winson Green, Hockley, Handsworth and parts of the city centre - with exceptions only for those who need to go to and from their homes.
Six of the men have been ordered not to carry guns or imitation firearms.
The whole group has also been ordered not to use or threaten to use violence and avoid associating with each other.
West Midlands Police said: "These injunctions are aimed at preventing individuals being in certain postcode areas, as it has been documented that it is in these areas that they have committed crime in the past or intelligence suggests that they have been involved in criminal activity.
"Civil injunctions are one way of managing people that are involved in crime or victims of crime due to gang connections. It is seen as a first step to placing initial restrictions which then allows other preventative work to be carried out with the individuals concerned."
The men made subject to interim injunctions
In January, police expressed "great concerns" over a spike in gun crime in Birmingham.
Det Supt Mark Payne said on Friday while there has been a recent surge of gun crime in the city he could not pinpoint a single root cause.
He said he had worked at the force when gun crime was rife a decade ago and said cuts had not affected the police response.
He said: "I was doing those jobs 10 years ago and I can tell you there were no more resources then than there are now."
