Syria chemical weapons removal plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Joint Mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations has outlined its plans for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for the complete elimination of its chemical arsenal by 30 June 2014 after Syria agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in September.
It came after rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin were fired at towns in the Ghouta agricultural belt around Damascus on 21 August, killing hundreds of people. Western powers said only the government could have done it, but President Bashar al-Assad blamed rebels.
