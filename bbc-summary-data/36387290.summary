Adam Voges and Dawid Malan both hit tons as Middlesex dominated Hampshire on day one at Merchant Taylors' School.

The hosts lost both openers cheaply, as Nick Gubbins was caught off the bowling of James Tomlinson, and Sam Robson edged Tino Best to Jimmy Adams.
But Voges and Malan's 279-run stand put Middlesex firmly on top, before Malan edged Liam Dawson to slip for 147.
Voges remained unbeaten at the close on 128 alongside John Simpson (28) as Middlesex finished the day on 342-3.
Middlesex's third-wicket partnership leaves them in strong position to claim their first win in the County Championship this season, having drawn all six of their games so far.
Voges' ton, his first of the season, came off 200 balls, taking the former Australia batsman beyond 13,000 first-class runs in his career.
Malan was more aggressive in dismantling Hampshire's bowling attack, hitting 17 fours and two sixes before getting dismissed attempting to drive a Dawson delivery.
The visitors could take few positives from their performance, but they will remain hopeful of salvaging a draw from the game, with poor weather forecast for Tuesday's third day.
