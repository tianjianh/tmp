Stephen Garrett scored the game's only goal with a low left-foot shot into the bottom corner in the 39th minute.
Andy Mitchell grabbed an 89th-minute winner as Dungannon Swifts defeated Glenavon 1-0 at Mourneview Park.
Adam Lecky claimed a hat-trick as Ballinamallard United drew 3-3 at Ards, with all six goals coming in a frantic 20-minute period in the second half.
Ards had coach John Bailie in charge for the game as manager Niall Currie watched from the side of the pitch, having been heavily linked with the managerial vacancy at Portadown.
Lecky blasted a right-foot shot past Aaron Hogg three minutes after the interval but Craig McMillen levelled three minutes later after his initial effort was palmed out by James McGrath.
Lecky's neat finish restored the Mallards' lead but Emmett Friars equalised again with a free header from a McMillen corner.
There was a hint of an own goal as the Fermanagh side took the lead for a third time but Lecky indicated that he scrambled the ball home to complete his treble.
Michael Ruddy restored parity with a 68th-minute penalty after Joe McKinney had been fouled by Ross Taheny to earn his side a point.
Gavin Dykes's outfit, who had failed to pick up a point in their previous six league outings, move above Carrick Rangers on goal difference into 10th spot in the table.
Garrett's seventh goal of the season proved enough to make it four league victories in a row for Cliftonville, taking advantage of some poor defending by the home side.
The Bannsiders had the better of the early openings but Jordan Allan squandered a good opportunity and then the same player headed against the woodwork.
The Reds wasted a gilt-edged chance to extend their lead before half-time, but Chris Johns dived to push away James Knowles' penalty after Steven Douglas had brought down David McDaid from behind inside the area.
It was a second successive league defeat for Coleraine, whose manager left out James McLaughlin, Neil McCafferty and Lyndon Kane because they are one booking away from missing the League Cup semi-final with Ballymena United on 13 December.
Cliftonville manager Gerard Lyttle: "I thought we were very solid defensively and if we keep clean sheets, we have players who can score goals.
"If we had been a wee bit more clinical with our chances in the second half, we could have been two or three to the good, but I am absolutely delighted with the effort, commitment and workrate from the boys."
Coleraine manager Oran Kearney: "Games are judged on goals scored and we weren't in top gear tonight.
"There were parts of our game that weren't quite there and I hoped we would have created a bit more. At times we were toothless to be fair."
Glenavon had lost just once in their last 13 games in all competitions before entertaining a Dungannon side who boasted just one win in their last eight matches.
In the first half, Greg Moorhouse saw his header well saved by Andy Coleman and Andy Hall's half volley from inside the area was deflected behind for a corner.
Jamie Glackin had a shot well saved by Jonny Tuffey, while the Lurgan Blues keeper also denied Mitchell, turning his close range effort behind for a corner.
Mitchell tucked home the winner at the back post from four yards out after meeting a right-wing Cormac Burke cross.
The win saw the Stangmore Park club move ahead of Glentoran into seventh position prior to Saturday's top-flight fixtures.
"I thought we deserved a point but credit to Dungannon - they kept going until the last minute and they got their goal. We got hit with a sucker punch near the end," said Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton.
