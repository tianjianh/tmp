Will President-elect Trump live in the White House or New York?

Since last week's election upset, rumours have been swirling over whether newly appointed President-elect Donald Trump will leave his $100m (Â£80m) New York penthouse for the White House.

The billionaire's 58th floor residence in Trump Tower offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and has been decorated in a "Louis XIV style" decked in gold and marble.
Photos of the penthouse, published by the Daily Mail, show enormous chandeliers, plush sofas, and gold-encrusted Corinthian columns.
Mr Trump once told biographer Michael D'Antoni about his penthouse, expressing great pride in its construction.
"This is a very complex unit. Building this unit, if you look at the columns and the carvings, this building, this unit was harder than building the building itself."
And, according to the New York Times, Mr Trump has been speaking with advisers about how many nights a week he would spend in the White House, saying he would like to spend time in New York when he can.
The business mogul is reportedly a homebody who flew long hours during the campaign just to sleep in his own bed.
It is unclear if Mr Trump, his wife Melania and the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, who is currently halfway through his school year, will live at the White House.
But if he opted out of his presidential quarters he would certainly turn Washington's historical status quo on its head.
The White House is seen as a symbol of American history and tradition and has been occupied by every office holder since John Adams, America's second president.
In 1902, the president's offices were relocated to the building's second floor, making the commute to a busy job a bit easier.
The White House is a quick two miles from the Capitol building where the US Congress is held - Trump Tower happens to be over 220 miles away.
Also, if Mr Trump chooses to reside in New York he could greatly disrupt city traffic. New Yorkers frequently take to social media in frustration when President Obama's motorcade disrupts the city's busy grid.
Whenever the president travels, roads are blocked, traffic can back up for miles and delays can last hours, but this would be exacerbated in a crowded city like New York.
Then there is the issue of security. On election night, the US Federal Aviation Administration established a no-fly zone over midtown Manhattan until 21 January, the day after the US presidential inauguration.
The directive cites "VIP movement" as the reason behind the flying ban, which prohibits planes, helicopters and drones from flying below 3,000ft and within a two-nautical-mile radius of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.
Secret service flights are exempt.
Nevertheless, were Mr Trump to remain in New York, security at Trump Tower would have to be bolstered.
The White House has multiple layers of defence, making a veritable fortress.
An outer iron fence is reinforced by groups of armed guards at the gates and inside the perimeter.
Snipers are perched atop the building and windows have bullet-proof glass. Additionally, infrared alarms, lasers, and missiles are all reportedly part of the building's defence system.
For a tycoon accustomed to jetting to lavish residences as he pleases, his new job may be an adjustment.
