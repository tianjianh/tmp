The complex would be built off William Street where the turnstiles and part of the old North Bank once stood.
There would be minimal impact on green spaces and allotments unaffected.
The work should be finished by summer 2018 and will replace the Llys Dewi Sant sheltered housing complex on the St David's development site in the city centre.
It is being funded by housing association Pobl Group and a social housing grant from the Welsh Government.
"Maintaining and creating high quality housing is our priority and the new scheme will allow us to provide more homes to modern standards," said Pobl's director of development, Jonathan Hughes.
