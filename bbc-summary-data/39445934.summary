The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners.
They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register.
The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a "world-first for Wales".
He added it was "a bold and welcome step".
"By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education," Mr Llewellyn said.
Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work "saves young lives".
"The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues," Mr Towler said.
"Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision."
Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system "supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives".
