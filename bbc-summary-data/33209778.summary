Seven people died at the scene. They were found naked or half-naked. Another three people died on their way to hospital.
The attack took place in the municipality of Garcia.
Authorities say they are investigating links to organised crime, possible involving drugs cartels.
Mexico's El Universal newspaper said (in Spanish) that the attack happened in a centre that distributed Corona brand beer to shops in Garcia, 40km (25 miles) from the city of Monterrey.
The victims were believed to be employees at the centre.
An official said the gunmen entered the property, demanded money from the workers and then started shooting.
Nuevo Leon State Attorney General Javier Flores said a weapon and drugs were found in the warehouse.
Garcia is the hometown of the next governor of Nuevo Leon state, Jaime Rodriguez, who battled the Zetas drug cartel while mayor.
