Jamal Moghe, 26, from Wembley, north-west London, also worked as a civilian employee of the Met based at Ealing in west London.
He is believed to have been killed by bandits while travelling on a charity trip.
Ealing borough commander Andy Rowell said: "We were all shocked and saddened to hear of Jamal's death."
Mr Moghe was a criminal exhibits officer in Ealing and also worked as a special constable - a volunteer police officer - in his home borough of Brent.
Cdr Rowell said: "He was a popular member of the team at Ealing borough and he also chose to serve his community by volunteering as a special. Our thoughts are with his wife and family at this time."
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national on 12 January and we are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."
A source told the BBC Mr Moghe had been on the way to Marsabit, towards the border with Ethiopia, to see his family.

North-eastern Kenya is a remote and arid region which borders Somalia to the east and Ethiopia to the north. It is sparsely populated - most people are cattle herders - and usually it is poorly policed. As a result incidents of banditry and cattle rustling are frequent.
Armed bandits, mostly from war-ravaged Somalia, raid villages to steal animals and in some instances attack public transport convoys for cash and other valuables. The road infrastructure has been neglected - and in many parts is non-existent - making travellers easy prey. The influx of illegal arms from Somalia and the huge number of unemployed youth have also complicated the security situation.
Although incidents of banditry are common, they are not likely to affect Kenya's tourism industry. North-eastern Kenya does not feature on the tourist circuit - most foreigners visit the area for the purpose of research or work for aid agencies.
It was Mr Moghe's first visit to the region in about 15 years, the BBC understands. He is understood to have been buried in the town of Isiolo within 24 hours of the attack - in line with Muslim tradition.
North-eastern Kenya, bordered by Ethiopia and Somalia, is a remote and sparsely populated area where lack of security is a problem.
The BBC understands the bus in which Mr Moghe had been travelling was sprayed with bullets by the bandits and no passenger was singled out.
But the BBC's Noel Mwakugu, in the capital, Nairobi, says official details of the attack are sketchy and Kenyan police do not have further information about the incident.
Odiambho Joseph, from the BBC's Swahili service, says banditry has been on the increase recently and in the last year several Kenyan policemen have been attacked and killed by suspected Islamist militants from Somalia.
The Somali al-Shabab group vowed to take revenge when Kenya sent troops into Somalia in October 2011 to help the UN-backed government seize territory from the militants.
The Times's Africa correspondent, Jerome Starkey, tweeted: "Brit cop Jamal Moghe was shot in a moving vehicle and nothing was stolen once the truck overturned, say provincial Kenyan police chief."
He said there were only nine passengers in the vehicle.
