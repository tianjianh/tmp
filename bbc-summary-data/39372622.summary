The 2010 Commonwealth Games gold medallist and 2014 bronze medal winner faces Brett Fidoe in Manchester on the undercard of Anthony Crolla's rematch with Jorge Linares.
"I'm excited," said McGoldrick, 25. "Ever since I started boxing I've been looking forward to this.
"Hopefully I add a bit to the card. I'm excited to get my pro career started."
McGoldrick is looking to follow in the footsteps of his stablemates such as world champion Lee Selby and British champions Andrew Selby and Gary Buckland.
"I've been boxing since I was 10 years of age so I've been an amateur for 15 years and I have done pretty much everything possible apart from the Olympic Games," he said.
"I had close to 200 amateur fights and turning pro is something I've always wanted to do.
"I have been with St Joseph's [in Newport] since the age of 10 and I'm still with them now as a professional.
"They've trained a lot of professionals over the years, they know me inside out, they know what works and what doesn't work for me and what I need to work on."
McGoldrick is targeting the top titles in the pro ranks and believes an association with Matchroom and Eddie Hearn enhances that prospect.
"I want to go all the way to the top. I'm not in the pro ranks just have a few fights to say I've been a professional boxer," added McGoldrick.
"I have come in to really go for the big titles and challenge for the big things and hopefully do myself justice and come away from the sport in many years' time with significant titles.
"Matchroom and Eddie Hearn speak for themselves. I've seen all the GB boxers turn professional with Matchroom and I have seen what a good job Eddie has done."
