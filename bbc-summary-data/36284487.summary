Swansea man has 'chemicals thrown over him' in Poland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chemicals were thrown in the face of a Swansea man on a stag weekend in Poland, his brother has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Davies, 36, was in a Krakow bar when he was attacked with the liquid, thought to be a cleaning product.
He was treated for third degree burns to his face, upper body and ankle and will require months of treatment after flying home on 7 May.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have provided assistance to a British man who was hospitalised in Krakow."
Mr Davies' brother Steve claimed the group was attacked after a row over faeces left on the wall of a toilet.
The group had gone into the bar to use the toilet, but Steve Davies, 39, said they left after seeing the mess.
But he said they were blamed for it and had the chemical thrown over them they sat in a beer garden 10 minutes later.
"It was an industrial alkaline - some kind of cleaning product," said Steve Davies.
"One of the boys was burned on his ankle, another on his leg and another on his arm."
Since returning to Manselton, Swansea, father-of-two Mr Davies has received further treatment at the city's Morriston Hospital.
Steve Davies said he believed someone had been charged in connection with the incident and his brother would speak to a solicitor about any other action.
