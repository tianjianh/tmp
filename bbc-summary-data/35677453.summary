Josh Hanson, of Kingsbury, was stabbed in the neck at the RE bar in Eastcote, Hillingdon, on 11 October last year.
Mr Hanson did a skydive in 2014 to raise money for a girl's operation. His mother Tracey and sister Brooke said they would "feel closer" to him by skydiving on his 22nd birthday.
Police want to question Shane O'Brien, 27, of Ladbroke Grove, over the murder.
There is a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution.
Tracey Hanson, said: "Two years ago, Josh did a skydive to raise money for a girl in America who needed an operation, and he was so brave.
"It was suggested that a skydive would be a great way to celebrate his birthday this year. I am excited to feel closer to Josh through the sky dive, but I am also petrified.
"Every day is a living nightmare and no one deserves to go through this. I do not know how we will get through today."
Describing the skydive as a "privilege" sister, Brooke, said: "The best birthday present that anyone could give Josh would be justice, and making the call to the police telling them where Shane O'Brien is."
About 40 people were in the bar at the time the 21-year-old was attacked, police said.
A post-mortem examination gave cause of death as haemorrhage, inhalation of blood and a wound to the neck.
