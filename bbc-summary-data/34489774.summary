The plane, which had been en route from Gatwick to Heraklion, was diverted to Venice and the co-pilot performed a "routine landing", the company said.
It said the plane's captain had briefly lost consciousness while receiving treatment but by this time the co-pilot was already in control.
The captain has been taken to hospital but his condition is not known.
An Easyjet spokesman said: "The first officer performed a routine landing in line with procedures.
"The aircraft landed safely and was met by emergency services on arrival.
"The safety and wellbeing of its passengers and crew is Easyjet's highest priority."
