An online fundraising appeal set up to pay for the young mother's funeral has exceeded its target within a day.
Friends of Ms McAuley started the page after news of her death emerged.
The original target of the appeal was Â£5,000. It currently stands at more than Â£8,000.
Kendall Jarrett said she wanted to do something to help the family.
"I just thought that would be one less stress that they would have to deal with," she said.
"Kerri was such a loved girl, her friendship group was huge.  I've even had florists contact me saying they are willing to donate flowers for the boys saying 'mummy'."
