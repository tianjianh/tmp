Botica was part of the side which won the WRU National Cup and reached the tier one semi-finals in their first Premiership season.
"The Scarlets would be a nice place to play," said Botica.
"If any Welsh region approached me that would be a massive honour."
Botica senior represented New Zealand in both rugby union and rugby league, while also playing two seasons for Llanelli from 1996-97.
His son now has designs on donning the famous red shirt as well.
"I would love to play professional rugby and hopefully next season is a stepping stone towards that," Botica said.
"I have decided to stay at RGC 1404 for another season.
"I am happy up there and I feel I have developed under coach Mark Jones."
Botica came up against a familiar face last week when he featured for RGC 1404 in their 88-19 defeat against Wales.
"It was an epic match and it was good to play against Gareth Anscombe," said Botica.
"We played against each other in high school when he was 17 and I was 16.
"He got the better of me then but there has always been a good rivalry.
"We are good family friends and we spend a lot of time with them.
"To play against him when he is in a good team was a massive chance."
Neath centre Kieran Williams won the best newcomer award, with team-mate Ed Howley named Tier Two player of the year.
Aberavon head coach Jason Hyatt was named coach of the year.
Merthyr's Matthew Jarvis and Neath's Aaron Grabham were recognised for scoring the most points and tries for their respective clubs.
Bargoed's David Evans won try of the season, Adam Jones was named best referee and Llanelli won the fair play award for best discipline.
Aberavon team manager, groundsman, social club manager and general club stalwart Steve Jones received the unsung hero award.
