Why transport matters in this election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transport dominates our lives. It's the second biggest household expense for most of us. Whoever forms the new government will have to deal with the two most expensive and controversial transport decisions to be made by politicians - HS2 and a new runway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport is a devolved power in some parts of the UK.
Eventually, two of the biggest building projects this country will have ever seen. MPs will vote once and for all on HS2, the new high-speed rail line with a £50bn budget, in the next couple of years, though the project is vulnerable before that.
The other big decision is where to build a new runway in south-east England. None of the parties will commit to anything until the Davies Commission makes its final recommendation, straight after the election. But once it does, stand back and watch the fireworks.
It will also be interesting to see whether Labour sticks to the road-building plans announced by the coalition a few months ago. They said they need to check that they are value for money.
Airport expansion: What are the three options?
HS2 explained
£50.1bn
maximum budget
1 in 20 official likelihood of exceeding that budget
£1bn spent so far on HS2
1,960 petitions lodged against the project
2026 year the first train is due to run
The issue of airport expansion in the South East has split politicians, so don't expect any commitments to build a new runway wherever the Airports Commission recommends.
It is also unlikely that any party will declare that transport budgets are safe for years to come. Unlike health and education, transport is not a protected government department and may well face cuts in the future.
"Transport at the general election will be dominated by promises of massive new infrastructure - additional runways, big new roads, HS2. But what people are really interested in is local transport problems like potholes, high rail fares and savage cuts to bus funding. Politicians from all parties should shift their focus from expensive building projects to improving the kinds of transport people use every day" - Stephen Joseph, chief executive, Campaign for Better Transport
"In our polling AA members have said that the most important message which should be conveyed to politicians and government is: 'We pay too much motoring tax yet so little is spent on the roads'" - Edmund King, AA president
"In the next parliament, decisions will be made around rail services for the years 2019 to 2024. Passengers tell us that their priorities for the railway are better everyday performance, and value-for-money tickets. We also hope that the new government would put an end to the policy of above-inflation fare increases" - Passenger Focus
