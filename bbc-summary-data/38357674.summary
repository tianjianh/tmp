PC Sally Baines of West Yorkshire Police posted the appeal on Twitter on Friday, for two boys she said had never had pillows, toothbrushes or toys.
"Thousands" of gifts have been given.
Ms Baines, from Huddersfield, said she was "overwhelmed" by the generous donations, and said the boys now had "more than enough" presents.
She said a few would be chosen for the boys, who may not be able to take many with them as they are moved around the care system, but that she hoped the rest of the toys could go to children in similar situations in the Kirklees area.
The donations started after Ms Baines's first tweet, on Friday, which said: "Just been told about 2 kids under 6 who have been taken into foster care. Never had pillows, toothbrushes, toys. I am heartbroken."
She then tweeted: "Been asked if I can donate any toys or books for them, I think I will be going shopping this weekend to get them some stuff."
The Huddersfield Examiner launched an appeal on Saturday and tweeted: "Can you help two little boys in foster care who have never had any Christmas presents?"
Ms Baines, who is herself a mother, said before counting the presents she thought "hundreds" had been donated to the boys.
They include teddies, books, a football and a Star Wars scooter.
One little boy gave two of his toy cars. Ms Baines said: "He brought them in from his toy box at home."
