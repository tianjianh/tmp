The Danish-maker of the perennially popular plastic bricks said the Star Wars set was one its best-selling products in 2015.
It was topped only by sales of Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle from the Disney film Frozen.
Revenue for the year rose to DKr35.7bn (Â£3.72bn) from DKr28.5bn in 2014 on pre-tax profit up 29% at DKr12.1bn.
Lego said it had achieved sales growth across the majority of its regions, though it said that while most of the Asian toy markets reported solid growth, it has slowed compared with more recent periods.
John Goodwin, chief financial officer of Lego, told the BBC that the Chinese market continued to generate sales: "Domestically we are still seeing a continual very strong growth and importantly for us the aspiring middle class within China continues to grow, and they are showing a great degree of interest in these great play materials that we think bring a high degree of creativity to those children.
"We continue to be very excited and bullish about the Chinese market."
The new Star Wars film, The Force Awakens, was released towards the end of 2015 and its box office takings have so far reached $1.9bn (Â£1.3bn) worldwide.
