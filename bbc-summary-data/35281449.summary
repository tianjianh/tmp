The 23-year-old has played for the under-21 and under-19 sides of Super Rugby's Natal Sharks and in the Vodacom Cup for Eastern Province Kings.
Jersey have not disclosed the length of contract that Kerrod has agreed.
"Simon has progressed through age group and Vodacom Cup rugby in South Africa and has been close to getting an opportunity at Super Rugby level," said Jersey head coach Harvey Biljon.
"However he is now seeking to develop his game in Europe, and I believe his ambition and potential mean that he can make a real impact for Jersey at Championship level."
Kerrod could make his debut in the British and Irish Cup, where Jersey host the Dragons Premiership Select side on Saturday before going to Doncaster Knights on 23 January.
