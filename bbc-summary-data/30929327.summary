Gemma Green-Hope, from Newport, has joined actor and writer Stephen Fry and five other British artists to retell stories from survivors.
The Memory Makers project, run by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, saw artists paired with Holocaust and Bosnian genocide survivors living in the UK.
Ms Green-Hope met Ivor Perl, 82, who was 11 when he was taken to Auschwitz and survived with the help of his older brother.
