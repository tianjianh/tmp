Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland have paraded down the Royal Mile in Edinburgh to mark the 10th anniversary of its creation.

A new exhibition was also opened at Edinburgh Castle looking at the first decade of the regiment's operations.
The creation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006 was controversial at the time.
It meant names of famous regiments such as the Royal Scots and the Kings Own Scottish Borderers would disappear.
Others such as the Black Watch and the Royal Highland Fusiliers would reform as one of the new six battalions of the new regiment.
Now a decade on, senior offices said the Royal Regiment of Scotland had been almost continuously on active operations, creating its own history.
That history was marked earlier with a parade down the Royal Mile leaving the castle at 11:00 led by the regimental mascot, the Shetland Pony Cruachan the fourth.
Major General James Cowan, the regiment's senior officer, said: "Our soldiers will be proud to parade in Edinburgh on Friday symbolising the support we receive from the wider community across Scotland and we are very grateful for Edinburgh City Council for allowing us to 'Exercise our Freedom'."
"Since the Regiment was formed in 2006 our soldiers have deployed almost continuously on operations around the world, so the Regiment is now building its own proud history as we head into the future.
"The service in the Canongate Kirk will provide us with an opportunity to reflect on our first ten years and commemorate those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country."
Steve Cardownie, Edinburgh's Depute Lord Provost, said: "It is a true honour to welcome The Royal Regiment of Scotland to the City Chambers.
"This parade is a fitting demonstration of Edinburgh's steadfast support for the brave men and women who continue to put their lives at risk in service of this country.
"Of course, as we celebrate the last decade, we will also remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice."
