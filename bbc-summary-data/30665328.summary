But images of famous civil rights campaigners, including Martin Luther King Junior, Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley with the same string around their heads have appeared on the singer's Facebook page.
It's causing controversy with some people claiming she's comparing herself with them and exploiting their images to promote her album.
Next to anti-apartheid campaigner, Nelson Mandela, Madonna wrote 'This #rebelheart fought for freedom!'
But the promo campaign's faced criticism on social media.
The star later posted another picture of Princess Diana saying "Yes Princess Diana was. #rebelheart! Anyone who fights for freedom is a #rebelheart" -Madonna".
She also issues an apology: "I'm sorry, I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm admiring and acknowledging there (sic) Rebel Hearts. This is neither a crime or an insult or racist!"
Some of the songs from Madonna's latest album, Rebel Heart, were recently leaked online.
She compared it to 'artistic rape' and urged fans to wait for their official release on March 10.
