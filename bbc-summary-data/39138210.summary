The 39-year-old is in his second season as assistant to Wayne Pivac after joining from Wasps.
Jones left Scarlets for Wasps in 2012 where he made the transition from player to coach.
He  said he was pleased with the deal "especially as we head towards a pivotal period in the season".
Scarlets' announcement did not specify the duration of the new contract.
Jones added: "We've been working tirelessly behind the scenes over the last few years and the players have bought into the ethos with great enthusiasm and energy.
"We're seeing the improvements on the field and it's great to see such a high number of the region's young talent making a name for themselves in the Pro12 and stepping up to the plate in Europe."
Jones' fellow assistant Ioan Cunningham's contract extension was announced in the same week as they prepared to travel to Leinster in the Pro12 on Saturday.
Scarlets go into the weekend's round of games fourth in the table hoping to remain there or higher to be part of the play-offs that determine the cross-border competition's winners.
Head coach Pivac said: "We have another big challenge ahead of us this weekend as we do everything within our power to secure a place in the top four.
"A big part of the success is the compatibility of the management group and the fact that it's enjoyable coming to work every day.
"Stephen is a tireless worker and his enthusiasm, as well as his technical and tactical ability rubs off on the boys and that is evident both on and off the field."
