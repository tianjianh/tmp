Coronation Street, which celebrates 50 years on the screen in December, picked up a special honorary award.
Doctor Who won best family drama prize - with actress Karen Gillan, who made her debut this year as assistant Amy Pond, on hand to accept the award.
The awards were hosted by Alexander Armstrong at London's Dorchester Hotel.
The BBC 1980s cop drama Ashes To Ashes was named best drama while best new drama went to hit US musical comedy Glee.
Philip Glenister, who played DCI Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes, admitted that the show had ended at the right time.
"All good things come to an end. I think that was enough, the danger is you start repeating yourself. There's only so much you can have him talking, shouting and nicking people," he said.
ITV1 show Emmerdale took the titles for best soap actor, Danny Miller, who plays mechanic Aaron Livesy, and best soap newcomer Adam Thomas who plays Adam Barton.
It also collected the prize for best soap storyline over Aaron Livesy's sexual confusion.
Coronation Street stars on the red carpet were both nervous and excited about the prospect of a "live" episode to mark the soap's 50th anniversary.
William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, said: "We'll get through. We're used to working in short spurts, so to do an hour live is frightening."
Earlier this year it was revealed that key characters will be killed off in a tram crash which occurs in Weatherfield in December.
Anthony Cotton, who plays Sean Tulley, said: "We don't know who's going to be on the receiving end of any of the disasters. I'm hoping it might be back like the days when we didn't know who shot JR."
EastEnders took the top soap prize in a year that saw its first live episode. Lacey Turner won best soap actress for her portrayal of teen mother Stacey Branning.
Later this week the show sees a blaze at the Queen Vic and the departure of landlady Peggy Mitchell, played by Barbara Windsor.
Scott Maslen, who plays Jack Branning, said Windsor leaving was a "massive loss" to the programme.
"Barbara is very small, but a massive personality and she's going to be sorely missed," he said.
Britain's Got Talent triumphed over Dancing On Ice, Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor to land the best TV talent show prize. Assault course show Total Wipeout was named best gameshow.
James Corden and Ruth Jones's BBC series Gavin and Stacey was named best comedy.
Denise Welch was named best actress for Waterloo Road while Jack O'Connell from Skins was best actor.
