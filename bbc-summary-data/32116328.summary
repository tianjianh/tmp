The base at Speirs Wharf will feature one of the largest rehearsal rooms in Scotland, space for technical and costume production and community drama.
Work to revamp the former cash and carry building will begin in July.
Since the theatre company was set up in 2006 it has created hundreds of productions, including the award-winning Black Watch.
Laurie Sansom, artistic director at NTS, said: "For the first time ever we have the opportunity to create a space that brings together our company, our colleagues and all our communities.
"A place of imagination, learning and play. A space from which we can begin to fulfil our ambitions, not just for the National Theatre of Scotland but for the wider theatre community and the entire nation."
The overhaul of the disused building in Glasgow's Craighall Road, in the north of the city, is expected to be completed by spring 2016.
It will provide the NTS with about 3,700 sq m (40,000 sq ft) of space over two levels.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "The new Speirs Wharf centre for creativity, production and talent development will be a hub of innovation within the Scottish theatre industry.
"It will become a dedicated and inspiring space where work will be devised and developed, sets and costumes designed and creative expression explored.
"Not only will the facility assist with new productions and work, by redeveloping a disused building the facility will help to regenerate the canal area at Speirs Wharf."
The estimated cost of the redeveloped building is £5,875,000,
So far, NTS has secured £3,454,481 towards the cost-  a £2m grant from the Scottish government and £469,481 from its vacant and derelict land fund, £500,000 from Glasgow City Council, £400,000 from The Robertson Trust, £75,000 from The Wolfson Foundation and £10,000 from The Binks Trust.
The new look of the canal-side building has been designed by Gareth Hoskins Architects.
