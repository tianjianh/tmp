On Friday night, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service was told about an information security breach relating to employees' personal data.
A 59-year-old woman from Bridgend has been arrested in connection with data protection offences.
The fire service did not disclose how many people were affected, but said it was limited to its own employees.
The matter has been reported to the Information Commissioner's Office and the fire service said it was working with employees and unions to "mitigate any potential risk to its staff and also to assist individuals taking their own actions to mitigate such risk".
