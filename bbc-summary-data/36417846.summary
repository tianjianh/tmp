[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Leeds Rhinos 12-24 Catalans Dragons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos remained bottom of the table as Catalans Dragons inflicted a sixth successive Super League loss on the reigning champions at Headingley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Brett Ferres try gave Leeds an early lead but Justin Horo, Fouad Yaha and Jason Baitieri put Catalans in control.
Josh Walters gave the Rhinos hope and they had a spell of late pressure before the French club secured victory with Eloi Pelissier's last-gasp try.
Catalans remain third in the table, two points behind leaders Hull FC.
In contrast, Brian McDermott's Leeds have won only three of their 17 league games in 2016.
The Rhinos have six more games to play before the top two tiers split into three divisions of eight teams, and they must make up an eight-point gap to eighth-placed Widnes if they are to avoid a spot in the Qualifiers.
Hooker Rob Burrow and forward Adam Cuthbertson were both unavailable for the match against Catalans because of injury, adding to Leeds' troubles.
Leeds Rhinos: Sutcliffe; L. Briscoe, Watkins, Moon, Handley; McGuire, Lilley; Galloway, Falloon, Garbutt, Delaney, Ferres, Jones-Buchanan.
Replacements: Keinhorst, Mullally, Walters, Hallas.
Catalans Dragons: Escare; Broughton, Gigot, Duport, Yaha; Carney, Albert; Mason, Pelissier, Casty, Stewart, Horo, Baitieri.
Replacements: Bousquet, Bosc, Maria, Navarrete.
