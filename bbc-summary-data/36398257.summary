Lincoln Cathedral appoints first female dean

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln Cathedral has appointed its first female dean.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Venerable Christine Wilson, 58, who is currently the Archdeacon of Chesterfield, replaces the Very Reverend Philip Buckler, who retired from the post at the end of January.
She said: "I was thrilled, and a little daunted, to be offered the post of Dean of Lincoln."
Mrs Wilson, the Church of England's eighth female dean, will be installed at Lincoln Cathedral on 22 October.
"Recently I have begun to build associations with Lincoln, and the fabulous opportunity to lead a world-class cathedral in inspiring worship, ministry and mission is one that I will... be delighted to undertake," she said.
Mrs Wilson added: "Interestingly, my father has a fantastic link [to the area]. He was in Bomber Command as a radio mechanic on the Lancaster bombers during the war, so I feel I have some roots here that I've just discovered recently."
The Bishop of Lincoln, the Rt Rev Christopher Lowson, said he was "delighted that Christine has accepted the post of dean".
Mrs Wilson is married with two daughters and has two grandchildren. Her middle daughter died from cancer in 2008.
