A 36-year-old man has been charged with causing a dangerous article to be on a road.
Another man, 46, has been charged with riotous behaviour.  Both are due to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court 28 July.
A crossbow was among items seized after the PSNI dispersed what they described as "a large crowd of men".
A police spokesperson said: "Reports suggested some of the males were masked and may have been armed with weapons such as hammers.
"Officers attended and dispersed the crowd seizing a number of items including a crossbow."
Pictures from the Castlemara estate show a burning bonfire and police officers removing tyres and pallets from the road.
At least one fire appliance was in attendance.
The DUP MLA for the area, Gordon Lyons, said: "People in Carrickfergus are very disappointed at the disturbances that look place last night.
"It's not what we want to see in 2016."
