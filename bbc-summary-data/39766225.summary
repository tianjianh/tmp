Team Sky's Gianni Moscon is facing disciplinary action from Team Sky after it emerged he used racially abusive language towards FDJ's Kevin Reza at the end of Friday's stage three.
Italian Moscon apologised and rode in Sunday's final stage.
"Any complaint will be investigated," the UCI told BBC Sport.
Team Sky chose not to withdraw Moscon from the race following discussions with FDJ. Moscon has apologised to Frenchman Reza and his team-mates but the British team will consider what action to take after establishing all of the facts of the incident.
