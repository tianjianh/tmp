A police force has said it has found no evidence to link Sir Edward Heath to a crime in its area.

However, North Yorkshire Police said it had passed a "piece of intelligence" to Wiltshire Police, the force leading inquiries into the former prime minister.
The force added the intelligence was "not connected to the North Yorkshire area".
Wiltshire Police said it "wouldn't discuss any intelligence passed to us".
North Yorkshire Police launched the search of its records earlier this month following allegations of child sex abuse levelled against Sir Edward, who was Conservative prime minister between 1970 and 1974.
It conducted the investigation after a photograph emerged of the late politician meeting ex-Scarborough mayor and suspected paedophile Peter Jaconelli, who was a close friend of Jimmy Savile.
Last year North Yorkshire Police said opportunities to prosecute Savile and Jaconelli over claims of historical sex abuse of children in the resort had been missed.
Savile died in 2011 and Jaconelli, who ran an ice cream company in the resort, died in 1999.
In a statement, North Yorkshire Police said: "Following a comprehensive search of force systems, North Yorkshire Police can confirm that nothing was found to designate Edward Heath as either a suspect or a victim of crime in North Yorkshire."
Former friends and colleagues of Sir Edward have rallied to defend his reputation in the wake of the allegations.
The former MP died at his home in Salisbury aged 89 in July 2005.
