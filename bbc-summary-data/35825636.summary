Budget 2016: Museums and galleries to get tax relief

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Museums and galleries are to get tax relief to help cover the costs of developing temporary or touring exhibitions, the chancellor has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In his Budget, George Osborne also said the museum VAT refund eligibility would be extended to any museum or gallery that offers free entry.
The Museum Association's Alistair Brown said he was "delighted" with the plan.
However, he said Mr Osborne had failed to address "the fundamental problem of diminishing local authority funding".
The refund scheme, which allows organisations to "claim back VAT incurred on most goods and services purchased in order to grant free rights of admission to collections", has previously only been available to national and university museums and galleries.
A consultation into the tax relief for temporary and touring exhibition costs will be launched this summer.
