Bake A Cake Catering in Halesowen ceased trading on Monday and cannot refund or fulfil orders, from cakes to table decorations.
Action Fraud and Dudley Council's trading standards department have received complaints.
Company owner Lisa Holt said a "hate campaign" of burglary and arson ruined her business.
Facebook group 'Bake A Cake Catering customers looking for replacement suppliers' has more than 2,500 members.
Dozens of caterers, florists and events companies posted offers of help on the page.
Laura Nolan, of the Nuthouse Bakery in Brierley Hill, used the page to offer five brides free wedding cakes and home made chocolates.
She said: "It's heartbreaking for the brides.  I just wanted to help. The brides are just flabbergasted when I tell them.
"One lady couldn't stop crying - you could see the relief."
Katie Battle, of Kits Green Birmingham, is marrying partner of 10 years Richard Washbourne on 26 September.
The couple paid Bake A Cake Â£600 for a cake, catering, a photo booth, room and table decorations and a sweet cart.
She said: "I was absolutely gutted. This wedding was a stretch for us anyway - we have saved for years to get married and this has now put me into debt.
"It's awful when this is supposed to be the happiest time of my life.
"This lovely lady rang me and said she could do the cake for me. There are just some amazing people out there."
West Midlands Police is investigating a burglary and an arson at Bake A Cake headquarters in Albert Street, Halesowen.
A spokesman for Action Fraud said reports had been sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.
And Dudley Council said anyone affected should call the Citizen's Advice Bureau on 03454 040506.
