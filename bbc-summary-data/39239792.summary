[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 1-1 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Accrington Stanley held Yeovil Town to a draw at Huish Park despite playing almost 70 minutes with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Brown was sent off for the visitors before they took the lead through Omar Beckles in the 51st minute.
Francois Zoko equalised for the Glovers but they were unable to find a winner.
Accrington were reduced to 10 men after just 22 minutes when Brown was dismissed for a lunge on Zoko.
Referee Nigel Miller did not hesitate in producing the red card and John Coleman responded with a defensive double substitution.
However, it was the visitors who took the lead against the run of play as a Shay McCartan cross was flicked into the far corner by the head of Beckles.
Coleman's men defended well but Yeovil were back on level terms through Zoko in the 74th minute, and both sides had to settle for a point.
