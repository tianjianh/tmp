[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Jones, 28, died on 30 January 2013 when a wall collapsed on him in St Albans while working for Linley Developments in Welwyn Garden City.
Trevor Hyatt, 50, of Letty Green, Hertford and Alfred Barker, 59, of Gazeley, Suffolk admitted contravening health and safety regulations.
Sentencing is due to take place on 22 September at St Albans Crown Court.
Mr Hyatt was a contractor and Mr Barker a project manager.
Mr Jones, of Welwyn Garden City, was excavating in Mile House Lane when the incident happened.
His widow Lianne, 34, said in a statement: "I didn't just lose my husband, I lost my best friend, my future and a big part of myself.
"Gareth was a devoted father and husband; he was hard working and didn't deserve to lose his life."
The couple had a son Casey who was two-and-a-half when his father died.
Mrs Jones said: "Gareth was Casey's hero... he has had to come to terms with the fact that he will never see his Daddy again.
"Gareth was one of life's good guys and his untimely death has devastated all of those who knew and loved him."
Nick Godwin, of Slater and Gordon solicitors representing Mrs Jones, said: "Gareth's death... has robbed his young son of a father and his wife of a husband."
