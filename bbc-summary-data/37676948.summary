Gordon Highlander Alistair Urquhart believed the bomb prevented a Japanese plan to massacre Allied PoWs.
He was blown off his feet by the Nagasaki bomb. He also survived a ship being torpedoed. He died on 7 October.
The celebration of Aberdeen-born Mr Urquhart's life was at the Gordon Highlanders Museum on Monday morning.
Mr Urquhart, of Broughty Ferry, died in a Dundee care home, aged 97.
The Nagasaki and Hiroshima atomic bombs killed up to 250,000 people, but are credited with hastening the end of World War Two.
His ordeal began when Singapore fell to the Japanese in February 1942.
He was among thousands of soldier taken prisoner, and ended up helping to build the infamous Burma-Siam railway.
When completed, the prisoners who survived were taken back to Singapore to be shipped to Japan.
The Americans, not knowing the cargo, torpedoed the vessel. The ship Mr Urquhart was on sank.
For five days he drifted on the ocean in a raft, until he was picked up by a whaler.
He ended up in a labour camp 10 miles from Nagasaki where, on 9 August 1945, the second atomic bomb exploded.
The Japanese surrendered nine days after the first blast, ending World War Two.
