Swansea centre-half Williams, 31, is having a medical before a £12m move to Goodison Park.
Fellow centre-half John Stones moved from Everton to Manchester City for £47.5m earlier on Tuesday.
Everton have signed Idrissa Gueye and Maarten Stekelenburg this summer.
Twenty-seven-year-old DR Congo international Bolasie, who joined Palace from Bristol City in 2012, has scored nine goals in 89 Premier League appearances.
Ivory Coast's Lamine Kone, also 27, who joined Sunderland from French side Lorient in January, scored twice against Everton in May to save the Black Cats from relegation.
