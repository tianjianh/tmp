Andrew Stocker 'exposed apple workers to risk of death'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farm manager, accused of being responsible for the deaths of two workers at a Hampshire fruit storage unit, has admitted exposing the men to a risk of death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Cain and Ashley Clarke died in February 2013 after entering a container that had dangerously low oxygen levels.
The men were trying retrieve apples for an agricultural competition.
Their boss at the time, Andrew Stocker, denies manslaughter.
Appearing before Winchester Crown Court, Mr Stocker said he knew the units were potentially life-threatening but he never fully appreciated the risk.
When asked whether he accepted that allowing the men to enter the units amounted to gross negligence, Mr Stocker replied: "Yes, I was negligent."
Previously the court heard how Mr Stocker, 57, "encouraged" a practice nicknamed "scuba diving" on Blackmoor Estate to find the best specimens in storage.
Employees held their breath while in the container with 1% oxygen.
Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said anyone entering the container would "die immediately" if they ran out of breath while in the facility.
The court heard that days before the deaths the former manager of Tory peer Lord Selborne's estate had instructed Mr Cain to collect fruit samples for the Marden Fruit Show in Kent.
Mr Cain, 23, and Mr Clarke, 24, died while Mr Stocker was on holiday in the Maldives.
Mr Stocker, of Bordon, denies two counts of manslaughter and the trial continues.
