Bieber, 23, is familiar with Manchester Storm, visiting the Elite Ice Hockey League side for a third time.
"We think it's fair to say Mr Bieber feels right at home here at the Storm Shelter," said the club.
The Toronto Maple Leafs fan was given his own Storm jersey on his previous visit to their Altrincham base.
He also invited the whole squad to London for one of his gigs at the O2 Arena.
