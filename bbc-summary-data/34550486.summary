The 20ft (6m) tall Giant's Chair was crafted out of local oak by Czech artist Magdalena Jetelova in 1986.
Despite being strengthened in the past, the trust which manages the trail in Gloucestershire said the structure had shifted and was now "falling down"
The artwork will be taken down and "recycled" on Tuesday.
The chair was one of the first sculptures to be installed along the 4.5 mile (8km) forest trail near Coleford.
Commissioned by the Forestry Commission, it was originally intended by the artist to be in place for just a year.
"Over the past few years we have noted that it was in decline," said Judith Lack, from the commission.
"This was particularly hard for me as I have fond memories from when I had my wedding photos taken there.
"The sculpture will be dismantled and two of the larger legs placed nearby to provide a wonderful habitat."
To honour Magdalena Jetelova's original wish and "create a permanent legacy", the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trust also intends to turn some of the timber into charcoal on site for artists to use in new artworks.
