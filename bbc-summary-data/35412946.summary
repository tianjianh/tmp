[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A children's novel has been named Costa Book of the Year for only the second time in the prize's history.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The judges said Frances Hardinge's Victorian murder mystery The Lie Tree would "grip readers of all ages".
Hardinge beat bookmakers' favourite, debut author Andrew Michael Hurley's gothic horror The Loney, to win the Â£30,000 prize.
The previous children's novel to win was Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass in 2002.
Receiving the award, a clearly surprised Hardinge said: "It is a fantastic time to be writing children's fiction and YA (young adult) fiction.
"For those people who might be hearing this who think that children's and YA fiction is not their thing please do come and explore - there's a beautiful jungle out there."
The Lie Tree, the author's seventh novel, tells the story of Faith Sunderly whose family have left England for a remote island to escape a scandal.
When Faith's father is found dead under mysterious circumstances, she sets out to uncover the truth and discovers a strange tree that feeds off whispered lies.
James Heneage, chair of the final judges, said: "Part horror, part detective, part historical, this is a fantastic story with great central characters and narrative tension."
Hardinge, he added, "brilliantly articulated" the voice of a precociously intelligent 14-year-old in a male-dominated Victorian society.
"There is something deep inside me that wants it to be a bestseller," he said. "It's a book to read in one or two sittings.  It is a real page turner."
