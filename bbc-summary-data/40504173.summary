Dawn Clark, who was 15 at the time and known as Dawn Bridgeman, was attacked as she walked alone in the east Alderney area of Poole on 3 May 1982.
Ms Clark has waived her right to life-long anonymity in a bid to find her attacker.
"I just feel like he has turned my world upside down," she said.
Ms Clark's attacker put his arm around her neck and held a knife to her throat before raping her in a wooded area near St Brelades Avenue.
"It really changed my attitude towards men," she said.
"It changed my attitude towards trusting anybody. I feel like I am stuck in a rut all the time."
She added the attack had stopped her from maintaining a "normal relationship".
"I need justice," she said, adding: "Someone must know him."
Ms Clark's attacker, who apologised to her after the rape, was described as white, aged 25 to 30, 5ft 6in (1.67m), of medium build and with a pale complexion.
He had straight sandy-coloured hair, a full bristly blonde beard with a small moustache that was "barely noticeable", wore square gold-rimmed glasses, black trousers, black shoes and a dark jacket, police said.
Ms Clark said the 1980s e-fit re-issued by police was a "good likeness" of her attacker.
Det Insp Neil Phillips said officers had a DNA sample from the offender and eliminating potential suspects was "a very quick and easy process".
"The man responsible for this crime will now be aged in his 60s and has probably moved on with his life but due to his wicked actions Dawn cannot," he added.
