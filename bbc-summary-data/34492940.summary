Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is set for a month out with a hamstring injury suffered on international duty.

The 27-year-old, who scored five goals in City's win against Newcastle last weekend, lasted just 22 minutes of Argentina's defeat to Ecuador.
"I think I'll be a month without playing," Aguero told TyC Sports in Buenos Aires.
City's problems increased on Friday as David Silva came off in Spain's 4-0 win over Luxembourg with a sprained ankle.
The 29-year-old midfielder hobbled off early in the first half as a result of a challenge by midfielder Lars Gerson. Spain manager Vicente del Bosque said he had no timeline on a return for Silva.
Aguero could miss four Premier League games - including the first Manchester derby of the season on 25 October - and two Champions League fixtures against Sevilla.
His absence leaves City with just Wilfried Bony as a recognised central striker, with youngster Kelechi Iheanacho in reserve.
