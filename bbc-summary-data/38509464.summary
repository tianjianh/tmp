An extension will be opened at Ysgol Glan Clwyd, in St Asaph, on Thursday as part of a £15.9m modernisation project.
The council said it "marks the start of a new chapter" in the school's history.
Refurbishment of existing buildings as part of the scheme's second phase begins this month and is due to be finished in September.
