New musical Only The Brave, based on the D-Day landings, opens in Cardiff on Monday.

It is the first musical to be produced by Wales Millennium Centre (WMC), which is normally used to hosting shows that tour from the West End.
It is the creation of Cowbridge songwriter Matthew Brind.
His previous work includes big musicals and TV shows like the X Factor and Britain's Got Talent.
This musical is the first to be produced by the WMC's creative team as they try to build a reputation for making original shows that may go on to tour the world.
It is a story of the heroism of D-Day on 6 June 1944.
This defining moment in World War Two has already been enshrined in TV series and Hollywood blockbusters.
Brind's interest came from his own family - his grandfather was on Sword Beach on D-Day.
"I really quizzed him and wanted to get all the gory details and it was quite difficult to get him to open up but he did," he said.
"Me and my cousins took him to Normandy to some of the places and it was an amazing experience, seeing how he reacted and how the French reacted to the veterans - there's a tremendous respect."
He said it had been an "incredible journey" and hoped it would be the start of more productions.
There is huge pressure to get it right and to show the Welsh team can compete alongside the West End musicals that normally stop here on their tours of the UK.
The cast list certainly has echoes of London's big shows - including some of the stars from Les Miserables and Mamma Mia.
Caroline Sheen - cousin of actor Michael Sheen - plays Joy Howard, wife of Maj John Howard, who led the operation.
"She's more a symbol of what women did during the war... it's about the emancipation of women, taking on jobs that men did and hoping it carried on after the war.
"The writers have been good about making sure the women's role is told too."
Neil McDermott - whose credits range from EastEnders to Shrek the Musical - plays Lt Denham Brotheridge - Maj Howard's right hand man and the first Allied soldier shot by enemy fire. He died of his wounds, aged 28.
Lt Brotheridge's daughter was born two weeks after his death and she is expected to come and watch the show.
McDermott said it was important to be as true to the real person as possible.
"He led the charge across Pegasus Bridge, he ran straight at a machine gunner and was involved in some pretty brave and selfless acts to ensure D-Day was successful," he said.
"I was aware what had happened and had seen films and come across novels but being cast to play a certain character you start researching it more.
"I've learnt how fortunate they were on the day, lots of things went their way - they were brave enough to dare to believe things could happen and exceptionally well prepared, highly-skilled, determined and well trained but overall very brave."
The auditorium is a familiar place for one of the musical's leading men, Neath-born David Thaxton, an Olivier award winner.
"My first professional job was the opening ceremony of this theatre - I was young, green and had two weeks off from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and had the best time," he said.
"So it's great to be part of their first creative output."
Only The Brave runs for a week but the reaction from audiences and critics will be crucial in deciding whether the WMC's ambition to produce world-class musicals can be realised.
