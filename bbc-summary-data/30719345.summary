Wilfried Bony's sale from Swansea City to Manchester City should be completed soon, says his agent Francis Kacou.

The Premier League champions are in advanced talks with Swansea to sign the 26-year-old Ivory Coast striker for a fee expected to be in excess of £30m.
Kacou, speaking to Sky Sports, said he believed a deal for Bony was close to being finalised.
"It's about some small details about money but I think things will go all right in a few days," Kacou said.
"I will fly with him to Abu Dhabi and let's see what will happen."
Kacou added no other clubs had bid for Bony, despite previous reported interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham.
Instead it is Manchester City who seem set to sign Bony, who was the Premier League's top scorer in the calendar year of 2014 with 20 goals.
"Talks are going on and we are waiting but I really hope things will happen soon," Kacou added.
When interviewed alongside his agent, Bony said he was aware of the negotiations for his sale but is concentrating on the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations.
"It's going on, the discussion is still on, so now I am going to join my national team so just focus on that now," said Bony, who added he had not undergone a medical to move to Etihad Stadium.
"It's good to hear [of Manchester City's interest] - every player wants to play Champions League."
Bony joined Swansea for a club-record £12m from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013.
The fee being discussed would break the Welsh club-record sale of £15m that Liverpool paid Swansea for midfielder Joe Allen in August 2012.
