Senegal have reportedly complained to Fifa after Sakho missed the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury, but then played for his club.
Fifa rules say a player cannot play for a club if he was meant to be on international duty.
But Allardyce said: "We've stuck to every rule and regulation in the book."
He added: "I'm not worried at all that he could be facing a ban whatsoever. We have not breached any rules and regulations whatsoever and I have to say I'm extremely disappointed by Senegal's reaction."
Sakho, 25, withdrew from the squad before the tournament and Senegal were told he could not fly to them for assessment because of his injury.
He then played - and scored the only goal - in Sunday's 1-0 FA Cup win over Bristol City which led to Senegal boss Alain Giresse claiming that West Ham had "set a dangerous precedent".
Senegal have since been knocked out of the tournament, and Allardyce is also not happy with the handling of midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate, who was with the squad and is now free to return to West Ham.
"Kouyate has been difficult to find over the last 48 hours," Allardyce said.
"We know where he is but we have had trouble finding him. We are expecting him back today after chasing him down for the last 48 hours. He could play against Liverpool on Saturday."
