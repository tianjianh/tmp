[SN]TITLE[SN]
M1 fatal crash driver 'deleted calls from her phone'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who lost control of her car on a motorway causing a fatal eight-car pile-up "deleted call records from her phone" immediately after the crash, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christy George, 38, of Lime Tree Road, Hucknall, Nottingham, denies a charge of causing death by dangerous driving.
Leicester Crown Court heard she deleted a record of calls made and received during her journey in November 2014.
One motorist died in the crash and another suffered serious injuries.
The court was told Ms George's car spun out of control and hit a lorry which crashed into the central reservation between junctions 21a and 22 of the M1 in Leicestershire.
The lorry crashed through to the northbound carriageway where it spilled its load of beer barrels, closing the road for 18 hours.
Graham Huston, prosecuting, told the jury Ms George's "mind was somewhere else, her attention was on something else and that appears to be her phone".
Her mobile phone was examined after the crash and showed she had deleted "a record of the calls made and received during her journey from Nottingham to a work as an agency nurse at Coventry hospital", the court learned.
Mr Huston said it showed she had wanted to "disguise her phone usage because she knew the cause of her being distracted was due to her being on the phone".
Her actions were undertaken "calmly, cynically and callously", he added.
Ms George also denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.
