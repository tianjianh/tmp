Plans to convert a former steelworks building in Wrexham into a visitor centre have taken another step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brymbo Heritage Trust has received £50,000 to fund architectural designs to convert a 1920s machine shop building on the sprawling site.
The plans will be used to seek a further £1.15m from the Big Lottery Fund for the regeneration project.
The trust aims to re-use nine buildings, opening a heritage centre, learning facilities and business units.
The site employed about 2,500 people at its peak, but closed in 1990 after almost 200 years.
