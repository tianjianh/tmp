It looked all but over as a contest by the break after Rovers ran in six first-half tries, spearheaded by a hat-trick from centre Thomas Minns.
By the end, James Greenwood (2), Iain Thornley, Matthew Marsh, Ben Cockayne and Maurice Blair had all crossed too.
Winger Josh Mantellato claimed Rovers' final try on top of his nine goals.
Championship side Batley scored first-half tries through Alister Leak and Tom Lillycrop, while they also claimed the final score of the game from prop Chris Rowe, Patrick Walker landing two kicks.
Hull KR head coach James Webster: "To score 58 points is always pleasing.
"I'm disappointed with the 18 points they scored, but we had guys out there who hadn't played for three weeks.
"Batley were always going to come here and play. They have played well all season and they are very dangerous near the try-line.
Batley head coach John Kear: "They were better than us.
"They did a number on us and paid us a great deal of respect to us in the way they prepared.
"Their attitude was first class and that's why the score was what it was."
