[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Payam Moradi Mirahessari, 25, and Farein Vahdani, 20, completed the 31-mile (50.5km) journey in October 2015.
The pair were arrested in Folkestone, Kent, a day after 120 migrants broke into the train terminal in Calais.
Mirahessari was jailed for 14 months and Vahdani was sentenced to 14 months in a young offenders institution.
They were sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court after pleading guilty to obstructing an engine or carriage using the railway .
A spokesman for Eurotunnel said the firm would not be commenting on the sentencing.
The operator previously expressed the hope that a conviction would help deter other people from trying to cross through the tunnel illegally.
