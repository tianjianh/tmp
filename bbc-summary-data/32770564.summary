The Navy said people had started falling ill at HMS Raleigh in Torpoint about 10 days ago.
Those affected were placed in quarantine in an attempt to stem the spread of the contagious virus.
A Royal Navy spokesman said control measures included "intense cleaning and isolating those with symptoms".
He added: "The virus started about 10 days ago. It peaked towards the end of last week at about 70 and numbers fell rapidly after that."
There is no treatment for the virus, which causes sickness and diarrhoea, but most people recover within a few days.
HMS Raleigh provides training for the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the Royal Navy Reserve.
According to its website: "On a typical day there are around 2,200 people on site."
