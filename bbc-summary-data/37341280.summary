Police said all the affected livestock had neck and leg injuries and were thought to have been attacked at the weekend.
Officers said the incident happened on land off Groes Road, Colwyn Bay, Conwy county.
North Wales Police said the dogs responsible for the attack had not yet been traced.
In June, the force's rural crime unit said 1,500 sheep had been lost to dogs in the past two years, with "weekly or even daily" attacks.
