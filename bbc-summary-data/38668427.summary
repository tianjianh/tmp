The Chinese New Year will begin on Saturday 28 January 2017.
The reason the new year falls at this time is because it marks the start of the lunar new year, which is when there is the start of a new moon.
This is different to the "Gregorian" calendar that we traditionally use in the UK, which always starts on 1 January.
Because it depends on the moon, the date of Chinese New Year actually changes each year, but it will fall some time between 21 January and 20 February.
Next year, the new year will start on 16 February.
Chinese New Year is also known as the Spring Festival.
It is the most important celebration in the Chinese calendar.
In Chinese tradition, each year is named after one of twelve animals, which feature in the Chinese zodiac.
So the animals will have a year dedicated to them once every 12 years, in a cycle.
It is believed that the rooster is a messenger from heaven, so it is traditionally seen as a symbol of trust and honesty
2016 was the year of the monkey, while this year will be the year of the rooster.
The next time it will be the year of the rooster is 2029, as this is in 12 years' time.
Do you want to know which sign of the Chinese zodiac you are and what it says about you?
Find out here by checking which year you were born in! (If you were born in January or February before Chinese new year that year, though, your animal will be the sign for the year before)
Before the festivities begin, people clean their homes really well to make them ready for the celebrations.
Then, when New Year's Day comes, there is a tradition not to pick up a broom, in case you sweep the good luck for the New Year out of the door!
In China, schools and businesses can close for the first few days of the new year, so that everyone can spend time with their families.
People enjoy eating lots of delicious food, including noodle soup, which traditionally brings luck for the year ahead.
There will be parades and performances, with people dressed in traditional clothes.
Fireworks are also set off, because it is thought that noise and lights will scare away any evil spirits for the coming months.
Adults might give red envelopes to children with money inside too.
The festivities continue for two weeks, finishing with a special lantern festival, which signals the end of the New Year celebration period.
