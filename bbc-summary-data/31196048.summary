Chris Pratt: Indiana Jones would be an 'awesome opportunity'

It would be an "awesome opportunity".

That's how Chris Pratt has reacted publicly after being linked to the role of Indiana Jones in a possible reboot of the legendary franchise.
Everything is speculation at the moment, but the star is now one of the go-to men for blockbuster producers.
The Jurassic World actor was speaking as he picked up the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award at Harvard University.
The award is presented annually by America's oldest undergraduate troupe to famous actors and actresses.
Responding to the Indiana rumours, he said that he knew as much as anybody else but that it would be awesome to play the role - made famous by Harrison Ford and River Phoenix.
As part of the Hasty Pudding ceremony - where the university acting society honours big stars - winners are treated to a traditional comedy roast.
He was teased about some of his earlier TV and film roles, including a 2009 comedy he made with Kim Kardashian called Deep In The Valley.
The Hasty Pudding troupe said that audiences asked for refunds after watching it.
Pratt responded: "Joke's on you. It didn't even open in theatres."
As if he hadn't shown off his genial, funny and all-round-nice-guy personality enough already, he'd visited a children's cancer centre in Boston earlier in the day.
The reason? He was fulfilling the Super Bowl bet he made with fellow actor Chris Evans.
Pratt's a Seattle Seahawks fan, whilst Evans supports the New England Patriots.
The two stars agreed that whoever's team lost the Super Bowl would visit the other's chosen charity, dressed as the superhero they're known for playing.
As the Seahawks lost, Pratt got his Guardians Of The Galaxy Star-Lord leather jacket on and surprised the children at Christopher's Haven in Boston.
