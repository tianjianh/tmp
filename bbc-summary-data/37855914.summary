The alleged incident happened when the England forward, 27, was driving home from training at about midday on Wednesday.
Carroll is believed to have driven away from his pursuers and headed back to the club's Rush Green training ground.
A West Ham spokesperson confirmed that police were handling the incident.
It is understood police were called at 12:45 GMT after Carroll returned to the ground.
The former Newcastle and Liverpool forward is recovering from a knee injury, having not played for West Ham in the Premier League since the opening day of the season.
He signed for the Hammers from the Reds for Â£15m in 2013, but has only made 38 starts.
