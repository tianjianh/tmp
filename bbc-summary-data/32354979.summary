A woman aged in her late 20s was found dead, having suffered multiple injuries, at an address in Worcester Road, Bootle at 21:15 BST on Thursday, Merseyside Police said.
The body of the second woman, who was in her 50s, was found at 04:00 in a property in nearby Brookhill Road.
Officers believe the suspect was known to both victims and their deaths are being treated as suspicious.
The roads where the bodies were found are within 200m of each other.
Neither victim has been formally identified and post-mortem examinations are due to take place.
"At about 9.15pm on Thursday, April 16, a concern-for-safety call was received about a woman residing on Worcester Road," said Det Supt Tim Keelan.
"A patrol attended and a search was conducted resulting in the discovery of the body of a woman believed to be in her late 20s with multiple injuries."
He said the second victim's body was found after officers gained entry to the property after they got no answer.
"The investigation into these deaths is at an early stage and although the motive is unclear at this time, officers believe the offender may be known to the victims," added Det Supt Keelan.
