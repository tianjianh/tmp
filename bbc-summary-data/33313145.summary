A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said they were in custody for questioning over "illicit activity".
Uber, which puts vetted drivers in touch with passengers, is unpopular with registered drivers in many cities because they tend to undercut prices.
A recent French taxi-drivers' strike turned violent. The US company is banned in some places, but it says it will keep operating in France.
Last week, France's interior minister ordered a ban on the low-cost car-sharing service UberPOP after a day of nationwide protests by taxi drivers.
Bernard Cazeneuve said the service was "illegal" and ordered police and prosecutors to enforce its closure.
Uber says it will stop operating if ordered to do so by a court.
Last week's protests saw US singer Courtney Love Cobain caught up in the unrest, which she compared with a war zone.
Taxi drivers complain Uber is stealing their livelihoods as its drivers do not have to pass the same tests, nor pay the same taxes, as more established taxi services.
