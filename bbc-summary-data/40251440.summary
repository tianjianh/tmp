Images released by Derbyshire police show a man's leg in flames at the blaze at Oxygen Freejumping, in Derby, early on Friday 9 June.
Officers said they were concerned for the man's safety, as he may have burns.
David Stalker, from Oxygen Freejumping Ltd, said the trampolines were destroyed in the fire, and the building may have to be demolished.
He added: "The whole trampoline park is covered in dust and particles, it is a fairly horrible scene."
Powerleague Derby Soccerdome is also based in the same building, in Pride Park, and both venues are closed indefinitely while the investigation is carried out.
A Derbyshire police spokesman said: "We have released CCTV images of a man we want to speak to about an arson at a trampoline park.
"We are also concerned for his safety as the footage appears to show that he may have suffered burns."
Officers have asked witnesses or anyone with information, including anyone who has a friend or family member with unexplained burns, to come forward.
