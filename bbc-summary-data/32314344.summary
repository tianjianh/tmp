Legal action against Angela Court care home owner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inspectors are taking legal action against a care home owner after they found elderly residents were being put at risk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All 37 residents were moved out of the Angela Court nursing home, in Tipton St John, Devon, after the Care Quality Commission rated it as inadequate.
The watchdog said PSP Healthcare was failing to provide care which was safe, effective or well led.
PSP Healthcare has not yet commented on the move.
In the report, the firm said it had struggled to fill staffing posts and there had been a problem with staff sickness.
The CQC'S legal action could lead to fines or it could cancel the home's registration if it does not improve within six months.
Adrian Hughes, deputy chief inspector for the CQC, said: "When we are faced with a residential or nursing home failing their residents, our first instinct is to make sure the service improves.
"But there are times when we have no confidence that the service will improve. When this happens, we must take action to protect people.
"Since these concerns were first raised, we have been working closely with Devon County Council and the Northern, Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group.
"We are now taking further action in relation to this provider and will report on this when it is completed."
