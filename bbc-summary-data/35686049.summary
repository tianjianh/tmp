A record-breaking filibuster by South Korean opposition members of parliament has entered its seventh day.

The opposition is determined to block a vote on a government-backed anti-terrorism bill which they argue threatens personal freedoms.
Their tactics have enraged President Park Geun-hye, who says the bill is vital security measure.
The filibuster is believed to have broken the previous world record of 57 hours set by a Canadian party in 2011.
Filibustering is a parliamentary delaying tactic by which MPs drag out speeches to the end of the allocated time, so that no vote can be held.
Twenty-five lawmakers from South Korea's opposition Minjoo Party and Justice Party have now spent more than 140 hours taking turns to stage monologues in parliament.
For their filibuster to succeed, they need to carrying on talking until midnight on 10 March, when the parliamentary session is due to end.
The opposition party is demanding changes to the anti-terrorism bill supported by the governing Saenuri Party. The proposed legislation allows the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to collect a wide range of personal  information - including phone records - on anyone deemed to pose a security risk.
They argue that the bill would violate privacy rights and could be used by the authorities to stifle political dissent.
"The law not only gives the the National Intelligence Service (NIS) unprecedented, unconstrained power to spy on every detail of our lives without our knowledge but also violates freedom of expression," lawmaker Hong Jong-haak said during a five-hour speech on Monday.
Those behind the filibuster have used parliamentary time to read from related laws, academic studies, news articles and internet comments. One lawmaker reported read extensively from George Orwell's 1984 novel - about ubiquitous government surveillance in a totalitarian superstate.
The government argues that the legislation is necessary to counter growing threats, especially from North Korea.
Correspondents say the NIS still has a bad reputation because of its record of enforcing authoritarian rule in South Korea before the country embraced democracy in the 1980s. It has recently been at the centre of a number of scandals including election meddling.
