The 29-year-old Belfast boxer now adds Quigg's WBA belt to his own IBF crown.
"I'm proud to have beaten a good fighter. He's a solid puncher but he never rocked me," said Frampton.
"I knew it was going to be a bit timid and a tactical fight. I had to be smart and do what it took to win."
Frampton added: "It came to life in the last four or five rounds and turned into a good fight in the end.
"I needed to be on my guard the whole time, keep it simple and use my boxing brain."
Frampton dominated the early rounds, but Bury's Quigg came back, and had his opponent in trouble in round 11.
One judge gave the English boxer the fight 115-113, but the other two scored it 116-112 in favour of Frampton.
"I couldn't believe it was split but as long as my hand was raised at the end of the fight that's all that matters," the Northern Ireland fighter said.
"There was so much tension before the fight, a lot of rivalry, and a lot of history between the two teams too.
"The travelling support was unbelievable and it felt more like Belfast than Manchester.
"I beat a very good opponent and I'm happy, if a re-match happens, I'd be fine with that. Either way there are some big fights out there for me. I'm in the driving seat now.
"I'm happy to continue at super-bantamweight as I made the weight comfortably for this fight but if a big fight comes calling at featherweight, I'm ready for it."
