The animal strayed on to Kidderminster Road in Bewdley and was spotted in a residential area on Sunday evening, police said.
One witness said it was chasing someone before it was stopped.
Police said the animal's owner assisted in locating it but because of its agitated state and being in a built up area, the bull was put down.

Witness Sheree Jenkins told BBC News: "There was one point it went up the road and out of sight and there were lots of police cars there.
"We assumed it had been contained and it ran past shortly afterwards.
"It was actually chasing one person at one point."
Insp Carrie Thompson said: "It is with regret I announce that officers were forced to humanely dispose of this animal after it was located in a busy area of Bewdley.
"The animal's increasingly agitated state and the fact it was found in a densely populated residential area gave officers no choice."
No-one was injured during the incident.
