[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 150 photographs and film clips capturing nearly half a century of life in the North East of England have gone on show.

The images, belonging to the Amber Films collective, capture cultural, political and economic changes in the region.
Titled For Ever Amber, the work is rooted in social documentary.
The exhibition opened at Newcastle's Laing Art gallery at the weekend and runs until 19 September.
Amber Films member Graeme Rigby said: "When Amber set out to do this it may be they didn't realise the extent of the changes that were coming, but that is what has been captured."
