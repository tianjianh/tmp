Gestede, 26, and 22-year-old Frenchman Veretout have both signed five-year deals for undisclosed fees.
Benin international Gestede scored 22 goals for Blackburn last season, including 20 in the Championship.
He becomes manager Tim Sherwood's ninth summer signing, while Veretout - who made 146 appearance for the French side - is the fourth recruit from Ligue 1.
Jordan Amavi of Nice, Idrissa Gueye from Lille and Lorient's Jordan Ayew have all joined from the French top flight, alongside deals for Micah Richards,Scott Sinclair,Mark Bunn and Jose Crespo.
Gestede started his career in France at Metz, before joining Cardiff, where he scored just nine goals in 63 games. He went on to join Championship side Rovers, netting 34 goals in the last two seasons.
"I've known about Rudy since he was at Cardiff and he is a player I've always admired," said Sherwood.
"His goalscoring ratio last season was fantastic and he is someone who certainly knows how to find the back of the net."
France youth international Veretout has represented his country at Under-18 to Under-21 levels, including winning the Under-20 World Cup in 2013.
"I know Veretout is very highly rated over in France," added Sherwood, "so we are delighted to get this deal over the line."
