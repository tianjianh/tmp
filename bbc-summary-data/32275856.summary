[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major commuter route in County Durham, hit by landslip damage, is to reopen next month after being closed for more than two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A67 at Low Carlbury, near Darlington, was shut for safety reasons in March 2013, resulting in a major repair project costing more than Â£4m.
That scheme is now complete, with Darlington Council confirming the road is due to reopen on 26 May.
Work included stabilising an embankment along a 400m section of the road.
Dave Winstanley, assistant director of transport with Darlington Council said resurfacing work would now be carried out on the route used as a diversion while the A67 was closed.
"It has deteriorated due to the significant increase in traffic using the route since the landslip was identified," he said.
Work on sections of the B6279 Staindrop Road and B6275 Roman Road will be carried out between June and August, he added.
