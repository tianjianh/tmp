The prop, 35, will be making her 115th international appearance, equalling Scotland's Donna Kennedy as the record caps holder in the women's game.
Clarke made her debut in 2003 and helped England win the 2014 World Cup.
England have made five changes to the team which beat France 10-5 at the Twickenham Stoop on Wednesday.
Clark equalled fellow prop Leonard's 114 caps in that game.
Vicky Fleetwood will start at hooker against Ireland with Amy Cokayne moved to the replacements' bench, while lock Harriet Millar-Mills, scrum-half La Toya Mason and outside-half Emily Scott also start.

Head coach Simon Middleton said: "Our plan was always to rotate the squad and look at different player combinations.
"I am confident that, with the quality and strength of our squad, whatever combination we use we can produce a positive result."
Sunday's match at University College Dublin does not form part of the autumn international series.
The Red Roses will return to the competition against the world's number one side New Zealand at Twickenham on 19 November before facing Canada, ranked second in the world, a week later.
