[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 1-1 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester's Elliott Durrell salvaged a 1-1 draw at Boreham Wood with a late wonder strike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morgan Ferrier's fifth-minute effort looked like it would be enough for the hosts after the 24-year-old evaded Blaine Hudson to get in behind and tap the ball home.
After that the game became scrappy, with neither side creating many clear-cut chances, although Chester's Ryan Astles was forced into a goal-line clearance after 70 minutes to block a Matthew Paine drive.
Just when it looked like Chester boss Jon McCarthy was staring at a fourth defeat in his first five games, Durrell picked the ball up around halfway, spotted Grant Smith off his line and struck from distance to level things up with seven minutes remaining.
