Everton midfielder Ross Barkley should be sold if he does not sign a new contract, says manager Ronald Koeman.

The 23-year-old England international, who set up the first of Romelu Lukaku's two goals in Sunday's 4-2 victory over Leicester, has a year left on his deal.
"We offer him a new contract, and there are two possibilities," said Koeman.
"One, he signs that contract. If he doesn't sign that contract then we need to sell the player. It's simple, it's not so difficult in my opinion."
Barkley, who was born in Liverpool and came through the Everton academy, has scored five goals and provided eight assists this season.
Team-mate Lukaku, the Premier League's top scorer with 23 goals, last month turned down a new five-year deal thought to be worth about Â£140,000 a week.
The Belgian, whose contract expires in 2019, recently stated his desire to play in the Champions League next season.
The Toffees are seventh in the table - seven points shy of a Champions League spot.
"We try to keep the best players," said Koeman. "We spoke a lot about Ross and Rom because they are really important.
"Most of the time the quality of the players can be the difference between Everton and the opponent, and they played really well.
"We know Rom is a great finisher but Ross played really good football between the lines.
"I think he should have scored one but it is what you like to see - your best players performing like they showed, because they were outstanding. The whole team was outstanding."
