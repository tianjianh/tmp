A horse-drawn carriage has been touring Kent in the finale of national celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.

In June 1815, the Duke of Wellington sent a dispatch to tell Britain about the victory.
Major Harry Percy took it by boat to Broadstairs and then by fast carriage through Kent to London.
A replica horse-drawn post chaise visited the three places in Kent where Major Percy changed horses.
The route included Faversham and Sittingbourne on Saturday.
Major Percy also changed horses in Rochester but the carriage then visited Medway's Armed Forces Day at Great Lines Heritage Park, Gillingham.
New Waterloo Dispatch chairman Peter Warwick said the carriage would visit Walmer Castle, which was where the Duke of Wellington died and where he was also Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
The final Waterloo dispatch was being presented to the current Lord Warden, Admiral of the Fleet the Lord Boyce, on Sunday at Walmer at the end of this year's celebrations.
Following the victory of the Duke of Wellington's allied forces over Napoleon's French army, Major Percy set out from Belgium carrying the letter written by the Duke relaying news from the battlefield to an expectant nation.
But the ship carrying the dispatch began to drift in the Channel, resulting in the men having to row the 20 miles to shore at Broadstairs.
From there, the dispatch was taken by carriage to the Prince Regent, who was at a dinner party in London.
Once there, the Prince Regent initially thought Major Percy - who was still covered in blood from the fighting - was bearing bad news.
But after Wellington's victory was announced, guests rushed into the street to celebrate.
