[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barclays is creating more than 200 jobs in Sunderland in what it claims is the first "centre of excellence" for fraud detection.

The company is expanding its 16-year-old operation at the city's Doxford Business Park, where about 1,500 people are already employed.
The centre will deal with customers worldwide hit by bank account and credit card fraud.
In February 100 posts were created with the launch of a video banking service.
Christine Allenson, Sunderland site president, said: "We are seeing a rise in fraud and attempted fraud on the back of new channels like mobile and online banking, which are being used more and more by our customers.
"These new jobs are also in response to customers telling us how they want to be dealt with when there is fraud. We want to be one step ahead at all times and make sure that our customers' money is as safe as possible."
Sunderland City Council chief executive Dave Smith added: "Barclays is a shining success story for Sunderland and I am delighted that the bank has chosen the city as the base for its new fraud detection centre.
"The creation of at least 200 jobs, coming hot on the heels of the 100 positions created for video banking, is great news for the city's economy."
Sunderland is currently home to 14,000 call centre jobs.
