Scott McDonald's first-half tap-in from Marvin Johnson's pass put the visitors in front.
Harry Forrester levelled for the home side, firing in from outside the box midway through the second half.
And the hosts, who paraded new signing Joe Garner at half-time, took the lead in stoppage time through Kenny Miller's strike.
Mark McGhee's Motherwell arrived at Ibrox believing they were better equipped to be competitive than for their recent visit to Celtic Park in the Betfred Cup, when they conceded five goals.
With Lionel Ainsworth and Marvin Johnson providing pace and threat on the flanks, they were also able to take advantage of the home side's familiar failings.
There were claims of offside from the Rangers players when McDonald tapped in Johnson's cross from close range, but the striker was unmarked as he pounced on the ball after it bounced off Rob Kiernan's leg.
Motherwell were bright and confident, while the home side lacked assertiveness. They toiled to create openings and were booed off at half-time.
Rangers started with the same central trio for the second consecutive game - Joey Barton, Jordan Rossiter, and Andy Halliday - but the chemistry still does not seem right. As individuals they all contribute to the team, but collectively the dynamic is less effective than last season.
It was once Niko Kranjcar came on that penetration and guile was added to the home side's passing.
It was the Croat's clever lobbed pass that sent Miller scurrying into the penalty area, and although Motherwell goalkeeper Craig Samson rushed out to thwart him, the ball ran to Forrester and he swept it in confidently.
Kranjcar was the creator again in time added on, although his cross was aimed at another substitute, Michael O'Halloran, who failed to connect. The ball ran to Miller, though, and he finished ruthlessly.
Having pressed the Rangers players and performed on the front foot in the first half, Motherwell were less convincing after the break. There was an inevitable response from the home side to being a goal down, but the visitors were unable to build on their good work from the opening period.
McDonald troubled Rangers goalkeeper Wes Foderingham with a smart volley, while Danny Wilson had to head over his own crossbar to clear another Motherwell attack.
The Rangers goalkeeper also had to push away a Johnson effort, but Motherwell did not have the wherewithal to hold on to their lead. There is progress being made by the likes of Chris Cadden, Craig Clay and Ben Heneghan, but Motherwell need to find consistency.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton: "We lacked penetration in the first half and conceded a poor goal but the second half was much, much better. Thankfully we got our reward in the end.
"How concerning is the performance? We can turn around and say we were below bar but got three points. We'll take that."
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: "If you play poorly, you go away thinking how can we talk? You can't look each other in the eye, we're all down and wondering what we do next. We're scratching our heads.
"Instead of that we've got a lot to build on, a lot to be positive about. I thought the performance was superb."
