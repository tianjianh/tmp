The 26-year-old former Glasgow City player scored 51 goals in 82 games during her spell in Scandinavia.
"I've really enjoyed my time over in Sweden; it was more physical, with higher-tempo matches," she told her new club's website.
"I think it's going to be similar here in England. It's going to be different again but a very high standard."
Ross has been playing for Scotland since 2009, scoring 38 goals in 88 appearances.
And she joins international team-mate Jennifer Beattie at the Super League runners-up.
"I spoke to Jennifer before I signed and she only had positive things to say about the club," Ross said. "She's really enjoying her time here and it'll be nice to have a friendly face around.
"Everything at the club is really impressive - the facilities, the support, the staff. I'm excited to get to work."
