Striker Hal Robson-Kanu says he will be fit enough to start Wales' opening Euro 2016 game against Slovakia on Saturday.

Various leg and ankle injuries mean Robson-Kanu, 27, has missed Wales' last four friendly matches.
But the unattached player, who left Reading in May, has resumed full training at Wales' base in France and says he is ready to play 90 minutes.
"I've trained. I'm feeling good, feeling fresh. Come Saturday I'll be 100%," said Robson-Kanu.
Wales' meeting with Slovakia in Bordeaux will be their first fixture in the finals stage of a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
Chris Coleman's side face a potentially gruelling schedule of three group games in 10 days, with England and Russia their other opponents.
Asked if he could cope with such demands following his recent injuries, Robson-Kanu said: "I'm a fit player, I've got good levels of fitness and I've been training for the last few weeks.
"I picked up a knock, which obviously you don't want, but having trained the last few days in the build-up to the game I feel 100% fit."
Robson-Kanu was one of Wales' three primary injury concerns when they departed for France.
Midfielders Joe Ledley and Joe Allen also missed Sunday's 3-0 friendly defeat in Sweden, but Coleman has said all three players could feature against Slovakia.
Fellow midfielder David Vaughan missed training on Thursday morning, though the rest of the squad took a full part ahead of their journey to Bordeaux on Friday.
