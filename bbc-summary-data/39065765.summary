[SN]TITLE[SN]
Deeside skirt-row school to consider 'tailored trousers'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Deeside school which planned a skirts-only policy for girls will now consider "tailored trousers".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connah's Quay High School widened a consultation to include the alternative after an outcry from parents.
Alyn and Deeside AM Carl Sargeant had called the potential ban "antiquated and sexist".
The school said it wants to change uniform policy to "tailored trousers for the boys and tailored trousers/skirts for the girls".
Mr Sargeant had suggested the school modify their plans to an enforced policy of "tailored trousers or skirts".
Flintshire council said school uniform was "a matter for individual schools and governing bodies."
In the letter, head teacher Ann Peers has said there were "ongoing issues" with girls wearing "denims, leggings and skin-tight trousers".
In a statement posted on their website, the school said: "Following the feedback the school has received to date during the consultation process, a decision has been made to widen the consultation to include the choice to wear tailored trousers as an option to skirts for the girls.
"Once the consultation period has ended, the governing body will carefully consider all feedback before making a decision about the proposed school uniform changes."
The consultation is due to end on 10 March.
