Mohammad Hafeez: Pakistan bowler banned for illegal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez has been banned from bowling in international cricket for a second time after his action was again judged to be illegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old, who was previously suspended in November 2014, will not be allowed to bowl for 12 months.
Hafeez was reported by match officials following his country's first Test win over Sri Lanka in Galle last month.
The spinner can appeal against any procedural aspect of the assessment leading to his suspension.
Hafeez was previously banned following the first Test win against New Zealand but, following work on his action, he was reassessed and permitted to resume bowling in April.
Because this is the second time Hafeez's action has been deemed illegal within a two-year period he incurs an automatic suspension in international cricket for 12 months.
Last Saturday, Hafeez was the star performer for Pakistan, taking four for 41 and scoring 103 to help Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in their five-match one-day international series against Sri Lanka.
Hafeez has taken 52 wickets in 44 Tests at an average of 33.90 and has 129 one-day wickets at 34.87.
