Giles has penned his first professional deal only a year after signing development terms with the Welsh region.
The 18-year-old won an U20 Grand Slam in March and was called up to Warren Gatland's senior squad as injury cover for the New Zealand tour in June.
"It's been a pretty surreal year for me if I'm honest," Giles said.
"I want to kick on from where I am and keep improving."
Giles made an impact for Swansea in last season's Championship and featured for Ospreys' Premiership Select team in the British & Irish Cup.
He was an ever present in Wales Under-20's Six Nations Grand Slam winning campaign and also featured at June's Junior World Championship in Manchester.
During the same month he was called up to Wales' summer tour of New Zealand as injury cover but did not feature for Warren Gatland's side.
"Keelan is a young man who potentially has a very bright future ahead of him," said Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy.
"His development over the last year or so has been impressive and is a sign of his character and attitude.
"He's a level headed and diligent individual who is prepared to work hard and put the effort in on and off the field."
