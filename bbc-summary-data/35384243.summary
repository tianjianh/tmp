[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibrahim Anderson, 38, and Shah Jahan Khan, 63, had denied inviting support for a proscribed organisation.
The Old Bailey heard they were in a group that set up a stall near the store on 9 August 2014.
The pair have been remanded in custody and will be sentenced later this month.
Prosecutor Mark Seymour had told jurors Khan, of St Catherine's Avenue, and Anderson, of Dallow Road, spent two and a half hours speaking to passers-by and distributing a leaflet.
He said both "would have been well aware that this is what they were doing".
Anderson's home was later searched and a notebook computer was seized which contained three images that "formed part of a set of instructions for travel to Syria to support jihad", the prosecutor said.
The Muslim convert, who represented himself in court, appealed to jurors to  "see who I really am - a devoted father to my family", saying he only wanted to practise his religion and exercise his freedom of speech.
He had denied knowing the other people who had gone to Oxford Street that day for dawah (call to Islam) - and said he only glanced at a leaflet he was given.
Anderson was also found guilty by majority of possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist, in December 2014.
