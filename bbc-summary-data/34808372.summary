The annual event was scheduled to take place in George Square on Sunday evening.
It has been cancelled for the safety of staff and the 13,000 members of the public who had tickets.
The organisers said that due to the complexity of the event it would not be rescheduled this year.
A spokesman for Glasgow Life, which is behind the event, said: "The stormy weather battering much of Scotland has created real problems for our teams working on the Glasgow Christmas lights switch-on.
"Now, with a weather warning in place for further significant wind and rain over the weekend, public safety issues have been raised."
Ticket holders will be able to exchange their ticket for a free hot drink at George Square's Glasgow on ice from 27 November - 31 December.
