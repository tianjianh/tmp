The horse, named Puzzle, was taken to Rowcroft Hospice in Torquay, Devon, to visit Pat West, 77, who has motor neurone disease.
Sue Harvey, who runs the inpatient unit, said it was "tremendously beneficial for her wellbeing".
Mrs West, from Ipplepen in Devon, was a keen horse rider in her youth. The horse was ridden in to the hospice by her granddaughter, Megan Hayes.
Mrs West's daughter, Sally Hayes, said it was "lovely" for her mum and thanked the hospice for allowing the visit to take place.
