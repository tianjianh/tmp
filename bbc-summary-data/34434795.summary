[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drama after just 15 seconds, an ex-England striker caught in traffic, hope for a struggling club and a former Premier League legend finding life difficult in the basement division.

BBC Sport has picked out some of the day's main talking points from Saturday's action in the Football League.
Every side dreams of scoring straight from kick-off and Reading managed just that against promotion-chasing Middlesbrough at the Madejski Stadium.
USA international Danny Williams gave the Royals a perfect start with just 15 seconds on the clock, heading in Hal Robson-Kanu's lofted cross.
It was the Berkshire club's third-fastest goal ever and helped Steve Clarke's side beat a Middlesbrough team who had won their previous five.
Nick Blackman added a late second for Reading, who move up to third in the Championship and two points behind Boro.
Reading 2-0 Middlesbrough
Former England international Darren Bent has had to accept a place on the bench following his summer move to Derby County, only starting twice this season.
He scored as a late substitute against MK Dons last week but getting stuck in a traffic jam in the Midlands meant he was omitted from the squad to face Brentford.
"It wasn't his fault and it can happen," Rams head coach Paul Clement told BBC Radio Derby.
"I couldn't be totally sure exactly what time he would arrive and I had to name the team and the substitutes in his absence.
"Anyone can get into traffic and that was the case with Darren. Is it harsh? It's unfortunate and not something I wanted to do."
Derby 2-0 Brentford
Leon Clarke's ninth goal of the season helped Bury extend their unbeaten run away from home to 17 matches - stretching all the way back to January.
The Shakers, promoted from League Two last season, won by a single goal at Colchester.
David Flitcroft's side have won their last six games in League One and are now third in the table, three points off leaders Burton Albion.
Their last defeat on the road came when they were beaten 1-0 by the Brewers at the Pirelli Stadium on 31 January.
Colchester 0-1 Bury
Blackpool have endured a difficult time since their relegation from the Championship last season.
Manager Neil McDonald has had to mould a new-look squad through supporter protests while chairman Karl Oyston has been involved in spats with fans and the club president.
However the Tangerines have recorded back-to-back wins for the first time since September 2013, following up victory over Chesterfield last week with a win over Swindon Town.
Mark Cullen's first-half goal was enough to secure all three points. Things may be looking up at Bloomfield Road, although the club remain in the League One relegation zone on goal difference.
Blackpool 1-0 Swindon
Former Tottenham and Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham took his first managerial post at Stevenage this summer, following a spell as attacking coach at West Ham.
However the 49-year-old, who won the treble with United in 1999, has found the transition to the dugout far from plain sailing.
A 1-0 defeat at home to Carlisle on Saturday, courtesy of Tom Miller's late goal, meant Stevenage slumped to their fourth consecutive defeat in League Two,
Boro are now six games without a win and are just two points above the relegation zone.
