The mother of two Nottinghamshire swimmers has said how proud she is after they took gold and silver at the Paralympic European Championships, in Berlin.

Helen Hynd watched sons Sam (20) and Oliver (16) come first and second in the men's 400m freestyle on Tuesday.
She said it was "nerve wracking" and wished it could have been a dead heat.
Both swimmers have neuromuscular myopathy, a condition which weakens their legs.
Sam Hynd is the British and World champion over 400m freestyle but the European Championships was Oliver's first international competition.
Oliver also won a bronze for the 100m backstroke on Sunday.
"If they could have both won that would have been fantastic," said Mrs Hynd.
"I was well behind both of them."
Mrs Hynd revealed that Sam was involved in a "horrific car crash" a year ago which prevented him from training for several months.
"Credit is due to Sam," said Mrs Hynd. "He's getting himself back there and there's more to come from him."
The brothers' condition affects their walking, meaning they rely on upper body strength in the water.
Sam was diagnosed in 2007 and Oliver in 2009.
"They're not letting it stop them," said Mrs Hynd.
"He didn't have me worried," said Sam, who finished three seconds ahead of his brother. "I knew he'd always be there for the whole of the race.
"I'm chuffed to win and for [Oliver] to get second as well. It's a really good achievement for his first international."
The brothers will go head-to-head again on Saturday in the 200m individual medley.
