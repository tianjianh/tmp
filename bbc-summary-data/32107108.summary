Stroud Beresford Group said the money would help it boost provision for vulnerable victims of domestic abuse and their families.
The charity offers accommodation, advice and support to women and their children affected by domestic abuse.
The group has provided aid over the past 40 years and has helped to look after about 1,400 women.
"Domestic abuse affects one in four women throughout their lifetimes and between six and 10 per cent of women suffer from it in any given year, so it is a very real and significant issue," said Jill Cooper, from the Stroud Beresford Group.
"Refuges are a vital source of safety and help for women and children experiencing domestic abuse.
"We are extremely grateful to [Stroud District] council for its support and the government for providing £100,000 to help us continue our work... to help those in desperate need."
The charity provides two refuges which offer support, outreach and children's services, support groups and workshops.
It is able to support up to eight families at a time and families stay at the refuge for an average of 12 to 16 weeks.
