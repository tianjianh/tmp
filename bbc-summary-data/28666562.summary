[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since the launch of Israel's Operation Protective Edge at the beginning of July.

Some 66 Israelis - all but two of them soldiers - have also died in the mission to destroy rockets and tunnels used by the militant Islamist group Hamas.
What do we know about who died and where they were killed?
According to figures from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), up to 6 August, 1,890 Palestinians had lost their lives in the conflict.

Among the dead were 414 children and 87 men and women over the age of 60.
The youngest to be killed was 10 days old, while the oldest was 100.
While the UN puts the number of militant dead below 200, Israel claims about 900 Palestinian militants were killed in the fighting.
Palestinians were killed right across Gaza - a strip of land 40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. The highest numbers lost their lives in Khan Younis, in the south of Gaza, and Gaza City in the north.
Many took refuge in shelters run by the United Nations, including schools. However, these UN schools also came under fire, including in North Gaza, Jabaliya and Rafah.
Meanwhile, two Israeli civilians were killed - one near Dimona and the other near the Erez border crossing into northern Gaza; and a Thai farm worker was killed in Netiv Haasara, which borders Gaza.
