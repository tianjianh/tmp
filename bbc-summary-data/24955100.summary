Computer-guided hip surgery 'more accurate' says Glasgow study

Computer-guided surgery achieves more accurate results in hip replacement operations, a new study has suggested.

Standard practice is for surgeons to judge the position of the hip by eye and currently about 70% of replacements are correctly positioned.
A study of 229 patients across Scotland between 2008 and 2012 suggests that accuracy increases to more than 90% when surgeons use detailed 3D imaging.
The study was conducted at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Clydebank.
Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Kamal Deep recently told the British Orthopaedic Association Congress that the research aimed to prove the effectiveness of computer navigation software in hip replacements.
"At the moment, standard practice for most procedures relies largely on the surgeon's best judgement and pre-operative x-rays to ensure the replacement joint is in the correct position," he said.
"However, with computer assisted navigation, we have detailed 3D orientation of the surgical area and instruments which can dramatically improve accuracy, reduce the risk of complications at a later date and improve the quality of a patients care."
Mr Kamal said further research was necessary to determine the long-term advantages of this approach to patients.
The study looked at a cross section of 229 post-operative x-rays of patients from across Scotland between 2008 and 2012.
