Tata Steel awaits result of ballot for strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unions representing Tata Steel workers in Wales are expected to announce the results of a ballot for strike action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of workers could strike in a dispute over proposed changes to pensions which could see workers retiring at 65 instead of 60.
Members of the Community, Ucatt and GMB unions have been voting on whether to protest at the plans.
Ballot results are expected on Friday, while Unite members will continue voting until next week.
