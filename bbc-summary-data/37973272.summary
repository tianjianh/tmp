Wicketkeeper De Kock's 104 off 143 balls and Temba Bavuma's 74 helped the tourists convert their overnight 171-5 into 326 - a first-innings lead of 241 - despite Josh Hazlewood's 6-89.
Australia reached 121-2 - trailing by 120 - when bad light ended play early.
David Warner made 45 and Usman Khawaja was unbeaten on 56.
The second day was washed out without a ball being bowled, Australia having been dismissed for 85 on Saturday.
Australia's defeat in the opening match of the three-Test series was their fourth in succession.
