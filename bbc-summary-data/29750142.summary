Wilson, 18, who won team and high bar gold medals, but struggled with injury at the World Championships in China earlier this month.
He withdrew from the all-around final, where replacement Max Whitlock went on to win silver.
However, he did compete in the high bar event, finishing an impressive fourth.
"Everyone has setbacks, it's how we deal with them that makes us the people or athletes we are," stated Wilson on his Facebook page.
"I will come back stronger, bigger and better."
Wilson is seen as a one of the world's leading young gymnasts, having claimed a record-breaking five European junior gold medals in early 2014, before his Commonwealth success.
Opting out of the World all-around final, which he had qualified for alongside Dan Purvis, prompted speculation that he had been substituted for Whitlock.
Rules allow nations to swap athletes as they only qualify berths for their respective nations and although Whitlock endured a difficult qualification round, his previous success suggested he was a stronger medal prospect.
British Gymnastics insisted at the time that the move was in the best interests of Wilson's long-term career.
It was a decision which was supported by medical experts this week, who insisted surgery on his right wrist was the best option for a full recovery.
The Glasgow World Cup will take place on 6 December, but many of the leading British gymnasts are expected to miss the event after a busy year of competition.
After the 2014 European, Commonwealth and World Championships Wilson and his team-mates are likely to return to action at the British Championships in early 2015.
