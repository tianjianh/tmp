Decision due on revised Spango wind farm proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision is expected next week on a revised bid for a wind farm about two miles north of Sanquhar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 14-turbine Spango scheme has been described as "unacceptable" by the RSPB and Dumfries and Galloway Council's landscape architect.
Developers Community Windpower withdrew a previous application in response to wildlife concerns over the project.
They said revised plans could "enhance the ecological and ornithological conditions of the local area".
They have also highlighted financial benefits to the community of Â£245,000-a-year over its 25-year operation.
The revised plans for the Spango or Mid Rig wind farm have been on the table since last November.
Developers withdrew a previous application following objections from, among others, Scottish Natural Heritage and the RSPB - who highlighted the site's importance for birds such as hen harriers and peregrine falcons.
The charity has since argued that the revised layout is virtually identical to the original.
The council's landscape architect, meanwhile, said the development would have an overbearing impact on the surrounding area, and as such, should be rejected.
Community Windpower has described the RSPB's failure to see the benefits of the wind farm as "disappointing".
It said that conditions in the area were likely to worsen unless the remedial action associated with the development was taken.
