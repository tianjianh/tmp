Manchester United have completed the double signing of Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and France international Morgan Schneiderlin.

Schweinsteiger, 30, has signed a three-year contract from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich for a reported £14.4m.
Schneiderlin has moved from fellow Premier League club Southampton for a fee in the region of £25m.
The 25-year-old midfielder has signed a four-year contract with the option to extend it by a further year.
United have already signed forward Memphis Depay and defender Matteo Darmian this summer and the two new arrivals take their spending to more than £80m.
Schweinsteiger played under United boss Louis van Gaal when the Dutchman managed Bayern between 2009 and 2011.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bayern Munich. It has been an incredible journey and I didn't take the decision to leave lightly," said the German. "Manchester United is the only club that I would have left Munich for.
"I feel ready for this new and exciting challenge in what I regard as the most competitive league in the world and I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal again."

Schweinsteiger made his Bayern debut in 2002 and appeared 536 times for the club.
He helped his country win the 2014 World Cup and has one Champions League medal, eight Bundesliga titles and seven domestic cups to his name from his time at the German club.
Schneiderlin joined Saints from Strasbourg in 2008 for £1.2m and has played for them in League One, the Championship and the Premier League.
"Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make," said the Frenchman.
"I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it's a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss."
The two will now join their United team-mates when they fly out to the USA on Monday.
The Old Trafford club, who will be based in Seattle for their first game against Mexican team Club America on Friday, have included David De Gea, 24, in the squad, despite the keeper being heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.
However, his understudy, former Barcelona number one Victor Valdes, 33 is not included.
Argentina internationals Angel Di Maria, 27, and Marcos Rojo, 25 were not selected after playing in the Copa America.
