The Hull City player, 28, scored a hat-trick as Gordon Strachan's side beat Malta 5-1 in Sunday's opening fixture.
"We got off to a good start this campaign and we've got to build on it," Snodgrass told BBC Radio Scotland.
"We look forward to the Lithuania game [at Hampden on 8 October] and then we know there's a tough game away at Slovakia [on 11 October]."
Strachan admitted Scotland had averted "a crisis" by recovering from a nervous period at 1-1 in Malta with four second-half goals.
"He wants to qualify more than anybody," said Snodgrass of Strachan.
"Once you get performances like the other night, it builds confidence.
"We set a statement out for the rest of the group. Scotland mean business and I think we've got personnel in the team now that can score goals."
After the double-header against Lithuania and Slovakia in October, Scotland face England at Wembley in November.
"One thing the Scottish boys want in the changing room is the bragging rights over the English lads," Snodgrass added.
"That's one game you've got your eye on. Hopefully we can go into that game high in confidence off the other games."
