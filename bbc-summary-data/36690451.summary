The Croatians went into the race with a 10-point lead and were never threatened, with their nearest rivals finishing behind them.
Australia's Matt Belcher and Will Ryan claimed silver, while Greece's Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis took the bronze medal.
Britain's Chris Grube and Luke Patience finished in fifth overall.
Later, four-time world champions Peter Burling and Blair Tuke won Olympic gold for New Zealand in the men's 49er two-person skiff class.
Grube, who was competing in his first Olympics, said: "The past eight months have been hard but we've had a good time along the way and we've had some good laughs.
"I was a bit teary-eyed when we came in the other day and realised we weren't going to get any medals.
"But thinking back to what we have achieved in the last eight months, we have moved mountains to get here and to race as well as we have - we need to be proud of ourselves.
"That fire burns inside to stand on the podium at an Olympics."
