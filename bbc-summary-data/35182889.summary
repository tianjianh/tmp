The Scottish Ambulance Service has said it will recruit about 300 paramedics over the next five years with new funds allocated from the budget.

The service saw a total increase in funding of £11.4m in the 2016-17 draft budget announced earlier this month.
Some of the funds will go towards additional clinical advisers and control room staff.
SAS chief executive Pauline Howie said ambulance crews were "busier than ever".
The draft budget announced by Finance Secretary John Swinney included an increase of 1.7% in funding for the ambulance service, equating to £3.6m.
The service will also receive £5m on a recurring basis to support its "Towards 2020" strategy, and £2.8m towards its baseline.
Ms Howie said the "Towards 2020" strategy was aimed at "ensuring that every patient receives the most appropriate care, whether at home or in the hospital".
Scottish government health secretary Shona Robison added: "We value the dedication of our ambulance workers extremely highly.
"They provide a first class service, often under challenging and physically demanding circumstances, and it is important we ensure they are equipped with the appropriate skills, training and clinical support to be able to deliver even more care in the community."
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour has criticised the amount of time taken to hand over patients from ambulances to accident and emergency departments at some Scottish hospitals.
The party said the average waiting time at the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow was 35 minutes, compared with a Scottish average of 21 minutes. In one week in September, it was more than 42 minutes.
The time for transfer from ambulance to A&E is not factored into government targets for waiting times.
Labour's public services spokesman Richard Simpson said that because the figures were taken as averages, some patients would be waiting "much longer".
He said: "The SNP government has managed to extend what used to be a winter A&E crisis all year round.
"These figures show another hidden waiting list, as some patients wait on average nearly three-quarters of an hour before they are handed over from ambulance to A&E.
"If patients are waiting to even get in the front door of A&E it should set alarm bells ringing. Our NHS today is suffering the consequences of the SNP government cutting the health budget."
