[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Duffy's two goals earned victory for Burton as the Brewers stretched their lead at the top of League One.

Albion broke the deadlock through Duffy's smart finish before Wes Burns' right-footed strike levelled the scores for Fleetowood against the run of play.
But the Brewers' pressure told as Duffy curled in from outside the box for his seventh goal of the season.
And Fleetwood's task was made more difficult by substitute Robert Grant's red card for violent conduct.
The result extends Burton's lead at the top of League One to six points after Wigan drew 3-3 at Colchester.
