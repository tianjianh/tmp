[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 2-2 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient staved off relegation from the Football League for another few days at least but they were denied a much-needed victory as Isaac Vassell's 73rd-minute goal helped Luton seal a 2-2 draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orient remain 10 points adrift of safety in League Two despite a battling display at Kenilworth Road, where Liam Kelly's penalty and Tristan Abrahams cancelled out Danny Hylton's opener, only for Vassell to grab a share of the spoils for the Hatters.
The visitors had the best opportunity in the opening 15 minutes when Victor Adeboyejo directed his header off target.
At the other end, Luton captain Scott Cuthbert saw his volley deflected over, with Glen Rea's header saved by O's goalkeeper Sam Sargeant.
But the hosts were rewarded for the endeavour in the 33rd minute when Olly Lee's wonderful through ball allowed Hylton to notch his 25th goal of the season.
Sargeant made two smart stops from substitute Luke Gambin, while Jack Marriott was inches away from a second before half-time.
Orient started the second half well and were level within eight minutes of the restart, Kelly rifling home his spot-kick after Rea had handled Michael Collins' powerful drive.
And the strugglers took a shock lead just after the hour mark as half-time substitute Abrahams slipped the ball under Luton custodian Stuart Moore.
Town, though, equalised when Vassell scored seven minutes after his introduction from the bench, racing clear to beat Sargeant.
They could not find a winner, though, and sit eight points behind third-placed Portsmouth while Orient could see their fate decided on Easter Monday, when they take on relegation rivals Hartlepool.
