The Shakers took an early lead when Danny Rose flicked in Chris Hussey's inswinging corner from six yards out.
Visiting keeper Daniel Bachmann denied Ian Henderson twice before the break as Dale searched for an equaliser.
Rochdale struggled to create chances after half-time and Bury striker Leon Clarke had a second goal ruled out for offside late on.
Hussey's set-piece deliveries caused problems for Rochdale in the first half, with Peter Clarke having a goal disallowed 10 minutes before the break for a foul inside the box.
The home side, who reached the fourth round in the last two seasons, came close to an equaliser when James Hooper forced Bachmann into a save and Donal McDermott shot wide.
Keith Hill's side failed to test Bachmann in the second period and Jim McNulty sliced an effort wide in injury time.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"For me, I want a style and I want to be able to play in the manner that we probably played today, but I want more of an end product.
"I've got a custodial job to do where I'm trying to develop a framework for success within a limited budget, and develop saleable assets.
"I think I've earned more than enough money over the last two seasons to support this club for the next 10 years.
"Is it disappointing to be out of the FA Cup? Yes. Financially will it affect us? I don't think it's affected us in a negative (way) being out of the cup."
Bury boss David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I know what my role is, to try and lead and motivate and inspire a group of players, but I've been inspired and motivated today when I came out to that wall of noise.
"The FA Cup's about the players, it's about the supporters that turned out in numbers and it's for them, it's about giving back.
"We started fantastically well, but we had to because you've got to peg this team back, because they're a very good, aggressive, dynamic team and they love attacking.
"I'd love Man U (next), I absolutely would. I'd love the supporters to go there in their numbers, and it's so local."
