The match will be the 37-year-old's 265th ODI and he has scored 7,240 runs including seven centuries.
Pakistan's leading Test run-scorer, he retired from Twenty20 cricket after lifting the World T20 title in 2009.
"I am retiring from ODI cricket after deliberation with my family, wife, and close friends," said Younus.
He made his one-day debut against Sri Lanka in Karachi in February 2000 but has struggled to hold down a place in the side recently, making scores of 6, 0 and 37 at this year's World Cup.
Younus, who overtook Javed Miandad's mark of 8,832 Test runs during the 2-0 series win over England, had already said he wanted to have a final fling in limited-overs cricket.
"I want to play a few more matches and then go out on a high," he said.
"I  have served the team well so it's my wish to retire after scoring a big knock."
