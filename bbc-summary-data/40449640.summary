Barry Hearn reappointed Leyton Orient honorary president after quitting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn has been named as honorary president of the club, just three months after resigning from the role.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 69-year-old sports promoter quit in April after the O's had failed to pay staff their wages for March.
His return comes a week after Nigel Travis' takeover of the National League side from ex-owner Francesco Becchetti.
"I have always been a fan and right now I couldn't be any happier for Orient as a club," said Hearn.
"I think it is another statement of how well Nigel and his team have started to turn this club around already."
