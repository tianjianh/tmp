Christchurch GP surgery out of special measures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP surgery in Dorset that was rated inadequate after inspectors found staff shortages put patients at risk has been taken out of special measures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Barn Surgery in Christchurch was criticised by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) following an inspection in May last year.
A new inspection in February found the practice had made a "significant number of improvements".
The surgery is now rated "good" overall, the CQC said.
But it still "requires improvement" in the assessment category for "being effective".
