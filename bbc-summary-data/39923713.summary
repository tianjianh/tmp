General election 2017: Plaid Cymru to launch manifesto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru is to launch its general election manifesto later, promising to "overcome threats and seize opportunities" from Brexit.

The party will pledge to "protect, preserve and promote" Wales.
Party leader Leanne Wood warned a divided Labour and an increased Tory mandate would see Westminster "do its worst" for the country.
Her party's "action plan" is designed to withstand the risks of a "cruel and reckless Tory party", she said.
The document - the first Welsh general election manifesto to be published and which Plaid Cymru claims is fully costed - is expected to pledge a "free trade deal shield" for Wales to protect the country's core industries and agriculture.
The plan would require the UK government to seek the endorsement of each UK nation before a post-Brexit trade deal is signed.
At the manifesto's heart, Ms Wood said "is a commitment to securing a resilient Welsh economy and to safeguarding the future of our treasured public services".
Ahead of the launch of the document in Rhondda, she said: "Be it on tourism, farming, higher education or jobs, we are determined to overcome the threats and seek out and seize upon the opportunities which may come with leaving the EU."
The party leader claimed Labour MPs from Wales have "too often... sat on their hands while a Conservative government pushed through measures to our nation's detriment".
Plaid is expected to pledge in the manifesto that it will "not rest" until every single penny Wales loses from Europe is replaced by Westminster.
It claims it will protect Wales' economy, identity, and assembly from a Conservative "power-grab".
The document is also expected to promise a "multi-billion pound investment programme" to build new hospitals, schools, roads and railways, and a new health and social care rescue plan.
Health and social care, education and roads are devolved in Wales while some aspects of control over the railways will be devolved in future.
The Welsh Government in Cardiff is currently Labour-led although Plaid Cymru helped ministers pass their most recent budget.
