Europa League: Borussia Dortmund prepare for Liverpool tie at non-league Marine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When you think of the pre-match preparations of Europe's elite football clubs, you imagine world-class facilities, not those of a seventh tier non-league club.

But that was the choice of Borussia Dortmund, who used the ground of Northern Premier League Premier Division side Marine to fine-tune their skills before Thursday's Europa League match against Liverpool.
The German side trained at the Marine Travel Arena in Crosby, Merseyside, on Thursday morning before the 20:05 BST kick-off at Anfield.
"I was approached by their agents in Manchester funnily enough on the morning of 1 April and I actually thought it was an April Fool," chairman Paul Leary told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"We were assured it was a serious enquiry and we were delighted to assist them."
Marine, who are 18th in their league, seven points above the relegation places, are most famous for having the longest-serving manager in football in Roly Howard, who left in 2005 after 32 years.
"We had to keep it absolutely confidential and I only told the remaining directors on Tuesday morning," added Leary.
"Had it got out in the public domain then it would've been a difficult situation to manage.
"They've donated two Dortmund shirts and all of their players have signed the shirts which will be framed and hung in our new boardroom."
