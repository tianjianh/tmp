Sean Reidy replaces injured Tommy O'Donnell in Ireland squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster flanker Sean Reidy has been drafted into Ireland's squad for the USA and Japan tour after the injured Tommy O'Donnell pulled out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Munster back row O'Donnell has withdrawn because of an ankle injury and coach Joe Schmidt has filled the void with the 28-year-old Reidy.
Leinster's Rhys Ruddock will captain Ireland in the three-Test tour.
Ireland start against the USA Eagles in New Jersey on 10 June before two Tests against 2019 World Cup hosts Japan.
Schmidt is taking a 32-man squad on tour with the Japan games on 17 and 24 June.
Ireland have been drawn against the Brave Blossoms in the group stage at the 2019 World Cup.
"I was there with the U20s back in 2009 and we had about three weeks there and I loved it," Ruddock told Irish Rugby TV.
"It was an amazing place to go and play and I think to be able to tour this year now ahead of them hosting the World Cup as well, where rugby is going to be at the forefront of people's minds, is a pretty special time to be able to do it as well."
Ireland are without 11 senior players because of their involvement with the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.
