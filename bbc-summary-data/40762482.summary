The 27-year-old was killed when his car collided with a pick-up truck in Ontario, local media reports say.
Mr Anker, who was born in Essex, moved to Canada last year and married his girlfriend, Cyndi.
The group said in a Twitter post that he "inspired so many with his talent and was taken far too soon".
