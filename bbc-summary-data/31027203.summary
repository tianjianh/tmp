The special maps, called Tate Worlds, are based on real-life pictures and sculptures on display at the Tate gallery.
Each world is different, and has many challenges and activities based on the theme of the artwork.
Paintings such as Soul of the Soulless City by Christopher Nevinson have been turned into a playable world.
It shows 1920s New York, with towering skyscrapers and a rollercoaster train ride.
