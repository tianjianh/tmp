The 23-year-old has been told he will be sold if he does not sign a new contract by the end of this weekend.
The Dutchman, who left Barkley out of the starting XI as 10-man Arsenal beat the Toffees 3-1 on Sunday, said he would speak to the board.
"Ross was one of the players who didn't show productivity today," said Koeman. "It's not about one player."
Barkley has a contract with his boyhood club until the summer of 2018 and has been offered an extension.
Everton finished the 2016-17 season in seventh, eight points behind Manchester United in sixth but 15 points above Southampton in eighth.
"We need to find players with more productivity," he said. "The board will back me. We want more quality in. That's what they will support."
