Lewis, the Paralympic champion in Rio, retained his European PTS2 title in one hour 10 minutes and 56 seconds.
Jones, who will compete at the World Para-athletics Championships in July, won gold in her first major event in the sport, in 1:22:22.
Lauren Steadman, Dave Ellis, Melissa Reid and Cassie Cava also won gold.
Steadman, 24, returned to action for the first time since winning silver at Rio 2016 in the women's PTS5 category to win European gold in 1:13:42.
"I've had seven months off since Rio. It's been a long time off, so it's really good to be back," she said.
Ellis, guided by Carl Shaw in the men's visually impaired class, won with a time of 1:05:19 after a three-year break from the sport.
There were also silver medals for Steve Crowley (men's PTS4) and Fran Brown (PTS2 women) while ParalympicsGB handcyclist Karen Darke and 21-year-old George Peasgood (PTS5) earned bronze.
"I think that's as many titles as we've ever won at a championship," said head coach Jonathon Riall.
"To have really quite a developmental team, still with people who are only two, three years into the sport, some of them a lot younger, is just fantastic."
