[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 0-0 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton's on-loan Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo was sent off in stoppage time as they played out a dour draw with fellow Championship strugglers MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an uneventful first half, Jorge Teixeira had the hosts' only effort on target, his header routinely saved.
The Dons were kept to long-range chances but Rob Hall tested Charlton keeper Nick Pope with a powerful shot.
Sanogo replaced Callum Harriott and was dismissed after appearing to elbow Dons defender Anthony Kay off the ball.
The result leaves the Addicks 23rd with 10 games to play, and seven points from the safety of 21st place, occupied by their visitors.
Before his dismissal, Sanogo came close to breaking the deadlock but could not get on the end of a dangerous left-wing cross from Zakarya Bergdich.
Bergdich and fellow substitute Ademola Lookman applied pressure in the closing stages, but Charlton are still without a win at home since 7 November.

Charlton boss Jose Riga: "We were expecting more from this game. We had the obligation to take more from this game. I didn't see what I wanted.
"The most important (thing) from this game was to get a win. The gap (to safety) is big.
"It's not what we were looking for and it's disappointing."
MK Dons manager Karl Robinson: "Charlton had to win here. We've come here and done a wonderful job. We've lost every time we've come here before. I felt we should have got more.
"Everyone has come back to us in the table, which is good, but we just need to nick a few wins here and there."
