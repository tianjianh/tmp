[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 1-2 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield's relegation fears deepened when they were beaten at home by fellow League One strugglers Bury and had defender Tom Anderson sent off in a dramatic finale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kristian Dennis gave Chesterfield a first-half lead, but after Thorsten Stuckmann had saved Ryan Lowe's penalty, Andrew Tutte equalised with a stunning strike before a terrible blunder by the goalkeeper gave George Miller the chance to seal Bury's first away win since late September.
Chesterfield gave a debut to the 35-year-old former Doncaster and Partick goalkeeper Stuckmann, but Bury top scorer James Vaughan was injured for Lee Clark's first game in charge.
Sylvan Ebanks-Blake's pass was misjudged by Cameron Burgess, allowing Dennis to run past him and touch the ball past Joe Murphy for the opening goal in the 32nd minute.
Ian Evatt made a vital block on Lowe as Bury looked for a quick response and the striker could not keep his header down when Greg Leigh helped on a cross in the 48th minute.
Lowe had a great chance to equalise in the 69th minute from Miller's cross, but he headed against the crossbar from six yards and his afternoon got worse when his 79th-minute penalty was saved after he had been barged over by Anderson, who was sent off.
But Bury levelled in the 80th minute when Tutte picked up the ball 30 yards out and sent an unstoppable shot inside the left post and Stuckmann gifted the visitors the points in stoppage time when he lost control of a back-pass and Miller scored.
