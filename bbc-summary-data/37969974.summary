Kelly Matthews took the sunset image looking between branches and leaves on Darwin Esplanade in the Northern Territory.
The emergency services phone operator travelled to Darwin from Western Australia for a wedding.
"I put it on Facebook and straight away all my friends said 'that looks like a map of Australia'," she told the BBC.
The photo was praised on social media, although some noticed a conspicuous omission.
"Tasmania absent as usual," William Lehmann said.
Elle Chicoli replied: "Mate, just go there and cut a hole in the bush."
