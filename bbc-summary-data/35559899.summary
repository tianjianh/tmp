Pro12: Benetton Treviso 13-7 Cardiff Blues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jayden Hayward helped Benetton Treviso to their first Pro12 win this season as the bottom club shocked Cardiff Blues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The New Zealander scored eight points as the Italians enjoyed their first victory for a year - and that was against the Blues in February 2015.
Blaine Scully had scored in the corner to give the Blues a half-time lead after two Treviso penalties by Hayward.
But the hosts won it with a penalty try as Blues were penalised for pulling down a scrum just after half-time.
The Blues' second defeat in Italy this season - following their loss at Zebre in October - ended their four-match winning run in the Pro12.
Treviso, meanwhile, celebrated their first win in 14 games this season with a commanding display against a Welsh side without a host of their international players.
After two early Hayward penalties, the visitors' United States international Scully gave the visitors hope of a fifth win in a row.
The American skipper broke through on the overlap to score, but a second-half Treviso penalty try earned the Italians a first victory following 20 successive defeats.
Blues number eight Manoa Vosawai had two good chances to score, but the defeat leaves Danny Wilson's side ninth and 16 points off the play-off places.
