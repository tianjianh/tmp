Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has given the go-ahead for the construction work.
The 21-mile scheme will include a new bypass for Huntingdon, the widening of a section of the A1, and improvements to five junctions.
Highways England said work will start in late 2016 and motorists will be able to use the widened carriageway by 2020.
Chris Taylor, of Highways England, said: "The scheme will provide much-needed additional capacity to improve journey times and safety."
The junctions at Bar Hill, Swavesey, Girton, Histon and Milton will be improved, the A1 between Brampton and Alconbury will be widened and the A14 widened between Swavesey and Milton.

Up to £100m will be provided by local funding partners, including Greater Cambridgeshire/Greater Peterborough Local Enterprise Partnership and Cambridgeshire County Council.
Highways England said its current estimated costs for the work are between £1.1bn to £1.6bn.
