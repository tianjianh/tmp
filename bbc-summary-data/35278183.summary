Croft, who played 21 Tests and 50 one-day internationals, will work with the spin bowlers for a 12-day period.
The 45-year-old is currently on the coaching staff at his former county Glamorgan.
England are also set to re-hire former limited-overs captain Paul Collingwood as a coach for the World T20.
Collingwood worked with England during the white-ball part of their tour of the UAE and assisted then coach Ashley Giles at the 2014 World T20.
Andrew Strauss, director of England cricket, said: "Robert has had success in both domestic and international cricket during his career and he'll have plenty to offer the dressing room."
Croft, who played first-class cricket until the age of 42, said: "It's extra experience for me and if the opportunity presents itself to help the lads I will. I'm there to observe and primarily be a sounding board for the spin bowlers, but will give any additional help as required.
"Looking from afar, this England team seems to have a no-fear attitude at the moment.
"There's a confidence about these England players and the side is well balanced in terms of age and experience."
