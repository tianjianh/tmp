Public Health England has confirmed that a woman in London has tested negative for Ebola, meaning she does not have the disease.

She is thought to have recently returned from West Africa and presented at St George's Hospital with a fever on Sunday evening.
UK officials have tested some 160 people for the virus since June - all have been negative.
Public Health England (PHE) says the risk to the UK is extremely low.
Ebola can only be spread through close contact with the bodily fluids (for example blood, vomit and faeces) of an infected person.
A PHE spokeswoman said: "It is important to remember that as yet, there has not been a case of Ebola diagnosed in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person.
"We have advised all front line medical practitioners and NHS call handlers to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas and following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing."
A spokesperson from St George's Healthcare NHS Trust said: "In line with national guidance the patient was moved to our clinical infections unit and underwent a series of tests, as a precaution one of which was for Ebola.
"The outcome of the Ebola test result is negative.
"We can confirm that the patient will remain at St George's Hospital.
"All appropriate actions have been taken by our staff to protect the public and the patient."
Volunteer nurse William Pooley was the first Briton to contract the disease during this outbreak while working in Sierra Leone.
He has now recovered and has returned to the country to continue his work.
The Ebola virus is a serious disease that has claimed more than 4,900 lives since December 2013.
The outbreak has centred around Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, where there have been more than 13,400 suspected and confirmed cases.
