Plans for £21m Dundee-based regional sports centre approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £21m regional sports centre in Dundee's Caird Park have been unanimously approved by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sports including badminton, basketball, netball, rugby and volleyball will be provided for in the new Regional Performance Centre for Sport.
Objectors had highlighted concerns over protected species in the area.
A new layout was included in an amended planning application after Dundee FC withdrew its interest in using it as a training facility last December.
Four deputations argued against the plans at a meeting of Dundee City Council's development management committee on Monday.
The council received 18 letters of objection to the proposal and 37 letters of support.
