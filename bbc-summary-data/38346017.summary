Teachers and hundreds of pupils have donned Father Christmas outfits and beards to take part in their secondary school's Santa fun run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The event at Grantown Grammar in Grantown on Spey in the Cairngorms was held to raise money for the school's funds.
Those taking part warmed up by dancing a jig in the school's playing field before running, jogging or walking.
The fun run involved about 340 "Santas" and even a few of their pet dogs.
