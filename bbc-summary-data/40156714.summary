Woman killed in 'tragic' dog attack named

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Ireland have described the death of a woman in County Galway as a tragic incident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 64-year-old woman has been named locally as Teresa McDonagh.
It is believed she died after being attacked by two Bullmastiff dogs at a family member's home on Sunday afternoon.
Emergency services were called to the scene but the woman was pronounced dead after efforts to resuscitate her failed.
Irish national broadcaster RTÃ‰ reports that nobody was home when the victim arrived at the property at lunchtime.
Emergency services were only alerted after the occupants returned to the home at 15:00 local time and discovered Mrs McDonagh.
Her body has been taken to University Hospital Galway, where a post-mortem examination will take place.
Bullmastiffs are listed in Ireland's 1998 Control of Dogs Act, which means they must be securely muzzled in public, but there are no restrictions on them on private property.
The dogs involved in the attack were later put down.
