An antique teddy bear which sparked an international search for its owner when it was left behind at Bristol Airport has been sold at auction for £2,200.

The teddy was found in the departure lounge of the airport in 2012. It was discovered in a carrier bag, along with a photo of two children dated 1918.
After a public appeal, the owner Robert Baker was tracked down in Cyprus.
He said he decided it was time to find the bear - nicknamed Bristol - a new home.
The photograph found with the bear proved crucial in the search for the owner.  On the back of it was a note to "our darling Daddie" from two children called "Dora and Glyn".
Airport staff spent months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names.
After a public appeal members of the online family history forum RootsChat.com came forward. They managed to trace the family after discovering that Mr Baker is the son of the Glyn mentioned, but they were unable to discover where he lived.
The teddy was finally reunited with Mr Baker after he was sent a newspaper cutting about the story.
Daniel Agnew, teddy bear specialist at Special Auction Services, said although the bear is "very worn and tatty", having the original photo, the provenance and the airport story "adds value".
