Cathedral doors locked as new Llandaff bishop chosen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The doors of Llandaff Cathedral will be locked for up to three days this month as a new bishop is elected, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An electoral college of 47 people drawn from all over Wales, including all the bishops, will meet on 21 February to vote on a confidential candidates list.
The election follows the retirement at the end of January of Dr Barry Morgan.
The new bishop will be the 72nd Bishop of Llandaff, a diocese which serves nearly half the population of Wales.
The college is made up of representatives from all six Welsh dioceses.
Once a bishop is elected, he or she will have up to 28 days to accept the position. If he or she accepts, the election will be formally confirmed in April.
