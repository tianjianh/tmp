A Met Office warning of heavy rain remains in place for parts of eastern Powys and the south eastern corner of Wales.
Around five properties were affected in Park Avenue, Kerry, following heavy rain.
Resident Gwyneth Down said: "You could just see the corner of the lawn, the rest was covered in water.
"It was quite scary for a while - it was getting deeper and deeper. It was getting up over my wellies and I was starting to worry.
"The fire brigade were very good, they came very quickly."
Heavy rain on Saturday morning in the south and east was expected to gradually clear but showers will affect most areas throughout the day.
Flooding was also reported near Holywell, Flintshire, on Friday evening as a fire crew spent two hours pumping water from a road.
