Chairs were thrown outside Sinclair's Oyster Bar in Exchange Square in Manchester city centre.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) tweeted the Polish football fans were held on suspicion of violent disorder.
A GMP spokesperson said the injured man was treated at the scene by paramedics for a head wound and the group of fans dispersed after officers arrived.
In a later tweet, the force said: "A fourth male was arrested after being found hiding in a restaurant near where the other three were detained."
The trouble flared before Manchester City's Champions League group match against Spanish side Sevilla at the Etihad Stadium, which kicked off at 19:45 BST.
Reports have suggested some of the people involved in the trouble were wearing the colours of Polish club Slask Wroclaw, whose fans have clashed with those of Sevilla recently.
