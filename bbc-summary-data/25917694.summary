Up Helly Aa fire festival lights up Shetland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shetland's spectacular annual Up Helly Aa fire festival has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up Helly Aa is a famous event that celebrates Shetland's Viking heritage, culminating in the dramatic burning of a replica Viking galley.
It features a band of latter-day Viking warriors known as the Jarl Squad, and draws visitors from around the world.
The Vikings traditionally spend much of the day making public appearances.
