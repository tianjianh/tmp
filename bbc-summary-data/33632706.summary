Kincora boys' home allegations in new cabinet papers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new batch of files referring to allegations of abuse at Kincora Boys' Home in east Belfast has been released by the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They have been given to NI's Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry
The papers refer to key figures, including former Northern Ireland minister William Van Straubenzee.
The Cabinet Office says the documents were not discovered in the initial search for information because they were not properly catalogued.
An official review into whether there was a Westminster cover-up of paedophile activity in the 1980s concluded last November, but 114 files were never found.
Now it has emerged that a number of those files do still exist. Some, referring to Kincora, were found in a set of miscellaneous Cabinet Office papers..
The contents of the documents have not been made public, but we do know that they have been passed to the chair of Northern Ireland's inquiry into historical abuse.
The official documents mention allegations about high profile figures including Peter Haymand and Maurice Oldfield from MI6, and the former Northern Ireland minister William Van Straubenzee.
References to Mr Van Straubenzee were discovered in a number of different documents. It is not clear if they relates to allegations made in England or Northern Ireland.
In a letter, the head of the Cabinet Office, Richard Heaton says "I can also confirm that relevant papers have been drawn to the attention of the Historic Institutional Abuse Inquiry led by Sir Anthony Hart; Sir Anthony has already started to review these."
Three senior care staff at Kincora were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys.
At least 29 boys were abused at the home between the late 1950s and the early 1980s.
