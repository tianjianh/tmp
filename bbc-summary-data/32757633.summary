The Leicester Tigers centre, 23, was fined Â£6,205 when he appeared before magistrates.
He had been charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer, assault by beating and causing criminal damage, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
Lancaster said he would not be considered for England until January.
BBC Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said Tuilagi was arrested in Leicester city centre at about 03:00 BST on Sunday 26 April.
He is understood to have grabbed a taxi driver by the throat and kicked the vehicle's wing mirror before pushing two female police officers in the chest as they attempted to handcuff him.
Tuilagi has missed most of the season after suffering a groin injury in October but had hoped to return in time to be included for the England World Cup squad.
The tournament, which begins on 18 September, is being hosted by England.
Lancaster said: "As role models and ambassadors for the game, the highest standards of behaviour are expected from every England player both on and off the field.
"Having spoken to Manu, he understands and accepts both the seriousness of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty and the consequences of his behaviour to his club, country and the game as a whole."
Tuilagi said: "I take full responsibility for my actions and unreservedly apologise to all those involved in the incident, Leicester Tigers and England.
"It is something I deeply regret and I totally accept the sentence given by the court. The club and Stuart have been very supportive and I understand their sanctions too.
"I know, as an England player, the need to conduct myself as a good role model for the game. I am very disappointed because my actions have let so many people down and I can only hope for a future chance to prove myself again."
