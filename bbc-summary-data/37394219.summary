[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Russell saved a late penalty to secure victory for Forest Green at Braintree in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keanu Marsh-Brown's second goal in two games was enough as he broke the deadlock, just when it looked like Braintree might survive through to the interval.
With 19 minutes to go the hosts had a golden opportunity to earn a point but Russell got down well to his left to deny Chez Isaac from the penalty spot.
Mark Cooper's side remain second in the table, one point behind leaders Dagenham, while Braintree stay 22nd.
