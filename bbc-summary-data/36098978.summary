The BBC has agreed a three-year deal to show the London Marathon until 2021.

Under the agreement, the broadcaster will hold exclusive UK television, radio and digital rights to the race.
Barbara Slater, the BBC's director of sport, said: "The London Marathon is an event that unites the nation via huge participation.
"The BBC's coverage brings audiences to the heart of the action while telling the incredible stories of those taking part."
Having televised every London Marathon since the event's inception in 1981, the BBC's coverage will continue up to and including its 40th anniversary.
Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge won last year's men's race while Tigist Tufa of Ethiopia won the women's event. Both will attempt to defend their titles when this year's race takes place on Sunday.
