Wales want to "salvage" three wins out of five by beating France in the Six Nations Championship on Saturday.

A Welsh victory would be a sixth in a row against France since they lost in the semi-final of the 2011 World Cup.
Triumph in Paris could also lift Wales to second place in the final table, if other results go their way.
"It's another massive game for us and we want to win to try and salvage three wins out of five," said skills coach Neil Jenkins.
Wales were under pressure after losing 21-16 to England following a late Elliot Daly try and 29-13 in Scotland before beating Ireland in Cardiff last time out.
Record points scorer Jenkins believes Wales need another good performance to atone for lapses against Eddie Jones' Championship-winning side and a second-half capitulation against the Scots.
Asked if he thought salvaging was too strong a word, Jenkins replied: "It is salvaging three because we've lost the other two games - it's as simple as that.
"We can't go back, we can't play that second-half against Scotland again, we can't play the last five minutes against England again, it's gone,
"You want to try and salvage something out of it don't you, and if things go our way tomorrow we could end up being second in the Six Nations.
"It's a game we need to win, we want to perform well in and we want to finish the Six Nations on a high."

Wales have won five consecutive matches against France, two of them in Paris, since their 14-man side fell agonisingly short in Auckland in 2011.
Jenkins says the pain of that defeat has stayed with the team, although only five of Saturday's starting XV played in the match that saw Sam Warburton sent off in the first half.
"We've still got a lot of hurt from that day and the game in Auckland when we lost 9-8 and missed out on a chance to play in a World Cup final," added Jenkins.
"We take a lot of pain from that to be truthful and it's stuck for a long time.
"But France are an outstanding side and a couple of games could have gone either way. Hopefully we can do it again tomorrow."
