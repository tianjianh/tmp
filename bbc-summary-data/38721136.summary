With five tonnes of explosives that's how!
The demolition happened in Wuhan, China and was to make way for a new 700m tall skyscraper and business park.
Officials said â€œThe demolition effect was quite ideal." And also that the massive explosion "didn't affect the light rail and public facilities around the blasted buildings."
Which is a good job as right next to the demolition site are a number of busy roads and also a railway line!
