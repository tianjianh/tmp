The 28-year-old has taken 32 wickets in all formats so far this season.
"Toby is an outstanding cricketer who has become one of the leading domestic players in the country," managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"There are very few, if any, better bowlers than him who are yet to play international cricket."
Roland-Jones, Middlesex's leading wicket-taker this summer, made his debut for the club in 2010.
He has taken 268 first-class wickets in 73 appearances at an average of 25.20 and featured for the England Lions against the United Arab Emirates over the winter.
Meanwhile, fellow seamer Tom Helm has been ruled out for the rest of the season after damaging ankle ligaments.
The 22-year-old was injured while fielding in the One-Day Cup fixture against Sussex on Sunday and will require surgery.
