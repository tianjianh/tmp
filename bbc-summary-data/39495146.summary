Oxford United boss Michael Appleton has confessed he will never watch video of their latest EFL Trophy final defeat.

The Yellows lost 2-1 to Coventry City on Sunday, their second defeat at Wembley in successive seasons.
"I never watched the Barnsley game (in 2016) back," Appleton said. "I don't intend ever to look back at the game (this year), and I mean ever."
Oxford return to League One action on Wednesday at home to Fleetwood as they bid to creep into the play-off places.
"Bear in mind being injured and having to retire cost me 10 years of my career, Sunday was my worst moment in football," Appleton added.
"It's gone now, it's one we put in the history books and we move forward. It's about 18 points now and nothing else."
Oxford are seven points behind sixth-placed Southend United in the final play-off position with six games to play.
They face third-placed Fleetwood and then a trip to Walsall in the next four days.
"The next two games are huge," Appleton added. "If you're within four or five points going into the last three or four games, the pressure mounts on the teams above you."
