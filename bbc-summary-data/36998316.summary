A French duo attempting to cross the English Channel in a pedal-powered submarine have aborted their mission one day in after they found faults.

Antoine Delafargue, 33, and Michael de Lagarde, 36, left Plymouth on Friday bound for St Malo in Brittany.
But the pair discovered a fault with the sonar and later found traces of carbon monoxide inside the vessel.
"The cruise can only be made in perfect security conditions," the team wrote on Facebook.
Their trip was expected to take seven days.
