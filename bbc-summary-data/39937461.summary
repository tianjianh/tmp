[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A giant baby sculpture by artist Marc Quinn left local people baffled when it turned up next to a skip on an industrial estate.

It is a copy by Quinn of his painted bronze and steel sculpture Planet, which is 30ft (9.2m) long.
On social media residents have likened it to the "marshmallow man" and talked of a "baby invasion" in Royston, Hertfordshire.
The artist's studio said the "editioned work" is at a depot for "maintenance".
Quinn's original six tonne "Planet" was commissioned by Chatsworth House in Derbyshire in 2008, where it was displayed in the grounds.
It was exhibited in 2012 at the Musée Océanographique de Monaco before moving to its permanent home in the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore in 2013.
The massive Royston baby might seem hard to miss, but it is usually covered with a marquee-like structure or tarpaulin.
However, it has been spotted in its full nakedness several times by people walking through the industrial estate.
"Anyone know why there is a giant baby wrapped in plastic on the industrial estate?" wrote a member on a local Facebook page, having spotted the structure earlier this week.
Others who spotted it were "intrigued" while one "screeched with laughter" at the sight.
It is being housed at an art storage and transportation company which was responsible for installing the original Planet at the Monaco exhibition.
A spokesman said he could not comment on what the sculpture was doing there, citing "client confidentiality".
A representative of Quinn said the Royston baby is an "editioned work by Marc Quinn", adding: "The work was undergoing maintenance... as is common to all painted bronze sculpture."
