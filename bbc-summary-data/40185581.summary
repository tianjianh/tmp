Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and Pierce, 13, were killed in Stourbridge on 30 March. Mrs Wilkinson's husband, Peter, 47, was also seriously injured in the attack.
The pair arrived at St Mary's Church, Oldswinford, in a single white coffin.
Lydia Wilkinson told hundreds of mourners they had been "as close as a mother and son could be."
The 18-year-old said they "shared a true bond of love that could never be broken".

Miss Wilkinson, who was at university at the time of the attack, described her mother - a champion ballroom dancer - as her "best friend".
The teenager said the pair would go shopping as her mother had a sharp eye for fashion and had once jokingly been told she "could make a sack look like a Dior gown".
"My mum was gorgeous, not only in terms of looks and fashion but she had a beautiful soul.
"I still cannot believe my closest friend has been taken from me," she said.
Of the brother she had taught to swim on holidays in Crete, Miss Wilkinson said: "I still fail to believe he has left me."
She said he had an "infectious" laugh, enjoyed Carry On, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings films, and was "destined to be an engineer".
The student added: "He'll always be my baby brother, and I'll never forget the fantastic times we had together."
The Reverend Stephen Agnew called on those gathered to remember two "wonderful" people, "rather than allow the memories to be tarnished by the horror of what ended their lives".
Aaron Barley, 23, of no fixed address, has been charged with the murders of Mrs Wilkinson and her son and the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson.
