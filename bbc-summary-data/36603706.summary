Ascot: Retired jockey Hayley Turner to come back for Shergar Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's leading female jockey Hayley Turner is to come out of retirement to ride in the Shergar Cup at Ascot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turner has been called up because of injuries to riders in the female side for racing's team event on 6 August.
The 33-year-old, awarded an OBE in the Queen's birthday honours list this month, retired in November.
But the women's team has been hit by withdrawals, including Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Michelle Payne.
They will seek to retain the Shergar Cup, competing against male riders representing teams from Great Britain and Ireland, Europe and the Rest of the World.
"I wouldn't have considered coming out of retirement for any other event," said Turner.
"It's a real shame that Michelle Payne is unable to join the team and I wish her a speedy recovery.  I'm looking forward to the challenge and hope myself, Emma-Jayne and Cathy Gannon can recreate the magic of our team's victory from last year."
