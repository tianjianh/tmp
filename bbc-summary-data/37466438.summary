Ian Bashford, 60, from Bromley, died when he hit a support vehicle during the 35th Duo Normand race, French media have reported.
Police are said to be investigating why the vehicle had swerved into his path 200m (650ft) from the finish line.
His cycling club, Old Portlians, confirmed his death in a statement, saying it happened during the final descent to the finish.
Club secretary Julian Hutchings said that a van swerved into the path of Mr Bashford and his cycling partner Peter Gray. He added: "They were travelling at about 34mph to 40 mph. They were going downhill or into the flat.
"I saw an ambulance and police car and recognised the Old Portlians shirt.  They worked on him for about 30 to 40 minutes to try to revive him but he died."
Secretary of the West Wickham-based club Julian Hutchings said: "He had been in the club about 20 years. He was passionate about cycling and the club. Everybody loved him and he always helped people out."
The Foreign Office said it was in contact with local authorities and was ready to provide assistance to the father-of-two's family.
The Duo Nomand is a time-trial race on a 54km (33 miles) road circuit in Normandy.
Britain's Chris Boardman has the most wins with three victories.
