Rhun Williams: Cardiff Blues back's injury threatens Wales tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues back Rhun Williams is a doubt for Wales' June tour for Tests against Tonga and Samoa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He limped off with an injured ankle in Blues' Champions Cup qualifier 46-21 loss away to Stade Francais on Friday.
Williams, 19, who had his foot in a protective boot and was walking with crutches on Saturday, will have the injury assessed this week.
The Caernarfon RFC product was named in Wales caretaker Robin McBryde's 32-man squad after a fine Blues debut season.
The full-back or wing was in line for a first Wales cap after impressing for his region in scoring four tries in 13 appearances.
Scarlets wing Steff Evans is also in danger of missing out on his first Wales cap, after the 22-year-old was sent off in their 27-15 Pro12 semi-final win against Leinster in Dublin on Friday.
Evans was red carded by referee Marius Mitrea for a first-half tip tackle on Ireland centre Garry Ringrose, which could earn a ban of between four and 12 weeks.
