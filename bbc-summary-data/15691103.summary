A man who barricaded himself into a house in an armed siege in Norfolk has been jailed for three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Cawston, 46, was arrested after a 32-hour stand-off with police negotiators and armed response teams in New Costessey which ended on 6 May.
Cawston, of New Costessey, admitted two counts of possessing an air pistol with intent to cause fear or violence at Norwich Crown Court.
It was claimed he felt frustrated over complaints to police.
The court heard armed police were called when Cawston telephoned officers, saying he had a weapon.
Cawston then barricaded himself inside the property and left a list of demands to police on a shed roof.
At one point, Cawston came out of the house and told police "Fill me full of bullets", the court was told.
It was claimed Cawston did not point the gun at police but had tapped the window with the weapon, which later turned out not to be loaded.
Prosecuting, Nick Methold said Cawston had been frustrated over information he claimed to have on criminal issues.
Ian James, on behalf of Cawston, said his client had wanted to help police, not thwart them.
Sentencing Cawston, Recorder of Norwich Judge Peter Jacobs said: "For reasons not fully explained, you seem to lose all sense of self-control."
