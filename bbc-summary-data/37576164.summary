Educational material on dementia is being made available to schools, in conjunction with the Alzheimer's Society.
Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the resources would help develop young people's "understanding and compassion for people affected by dementia".
It is estimated there are 45,000 people with dementia in Wales.
The initiative was launched at Ysgol Maesydderwen in Ystradglynlais on Friday.
Ms Williams said ministers were committed to making Wales a "truly dementia-friendly nation" and that "starts with education and raising awareness".
Sue Phelps, director of the Alzheimer's Society in Wales, added: "These resources will help young people to better understand dementia and how to support people living with the condition in their family or community.
"Young people today have an important role to play and can change the future for people with dementia in Wales."
