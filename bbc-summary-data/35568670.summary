Akhtar Javeed, 56, from east London, was shot outside the building in Digbeth, Birmingham on 3 February.
West Midlands Police said the suspect was detained at a property in Leicester on Friday evening.
A 19-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and an 18-year-old man arrested in Derby remains in custody.
Police said on the day of the shooting two masked men in a silver Renault Megane entered Direct Source 3 Ltd on Rea Street South.
Five staff members were handcuffed with cable ties and it is believed Mr Javeed was shot while fighting off the attackers.
He was found outside his business premises with a "major neck wound" and pronounced dead in hospital.
The robbers escaped empty-handed, detectives said.
