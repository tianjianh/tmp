Louis van Gaal: My style is working at Manchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louis van Gaal insists his style "is working" at Manchester United, with the club still competing on three fronts.

Sixth-placed United sit three points off a Champions League spot and host West Ham in the FA Cup on Sunday.
Liverpool then visit Old Trafford on Thursday, with United looking to overturn a 2-0 deficit in the Europa League last-16 second leg.
"I think it is working," said Van Gaal, rejecting the accusation United had fallen short in his time at the helm.
"It is not giving the best results. It is not good enough when you think you have to be a champion, or win the Europa League or the FA Cup.
"There are many of my colleagues who are not in three competitions any more."
The Dutchman suggested United should win a home FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham and has not ruled out the prospect of progressing in Europe.
"It is not impossible," said the 64-year-old. "Against West Ham United, it is also possible. At Old Trafford, we normally win our games.
"We are still in three competitions, so we can fight for a lot.
"It is possible that we are going out (of the Europa League) and then it is a very difficult situation for everyone, but still we have the chance to win something and you have to believe in that."

Van Gaal says injuries and forced rotation have caused United's inconsistencies this season, but he remains confident under growing pressure.
"This (defeat to Liverpool) of course gives us much more pressure," added Van Gaal, whose side fought back from a first-leg defeat to Danish champions FC Midtjylland in the last 32.
"We are in three competitions and after the defeat in Midtjylland you have sacked me already. Then we are standing up, and then we are in the next round - and it is possible also against Liverpool.
"We have to play that match for the second time and at home. Then we create that atmosphere and then maybe we score some goals. It shall be very difficult, I know that, but it is possible."
