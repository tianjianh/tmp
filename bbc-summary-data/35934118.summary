Salford Red Devils supporters have begun a collection to fund gifts for those affected by crowd trouble after the win at Huddersfield on Monday.

Players' wives and children were among those affected by the incidents, which saw players go into the stand to assist their families.
The appeal, which has exceeded an initial target of Â£500, was set up by Red Devils supporters on Wednesday.
In addition, the fans plan to issue a full letter of apology.
The statement from a group of Red Devils fans read: "Salford Red Devils fans are a proud and passionate bunch. We have always enjoyed a great relationship with the players and their families of our club and we are adamant that this incident will not affect this.
"Instead, we see it as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between players and fans and ensure they are fully aware that the actions of a few do not represent that of the majority.
"As a token of our compassion and in an attempt to say 'we are sorry' to the players, the coaches, the owner and their families, we are aiming to raise enough money to purchase the wives of the players involved in the incident with a bouquet of flowers, as well as gift vouchers for the children with any spare funds donated to a charity of the players' choice."
It is hoped that gifts will be presented at Salford's home game with Leeds Rhinos on Saturday, 9 April.
