[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 3-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet scored three times in nine second-half minutes as they came from behind to beat Cheltenham and record a first win under manager Kevin Nugent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheltenham, without a goal in six hours of football, opened the scoring after 16 minutes when Danny Wright latched onto Billy Waters' flick on and clipped the ball over Jamie Stephens.
The Robins almost doubled their lead immediately after the break when Stephens misjudged Carl Winchester's free-kick and the ball came back off the crossbar.
Barnet levelled against the run of play in the 70th minute when substitute Curtis Weston lashed home a volley after Scott Brown's poor punch.
The Bees were ahead seven minutes later when John Akinde got a touch on Charlie Clough's towering header from Jamal Campbell-Ryce's corner.
And striker Akinde moved back level with Doncaster's John Marquis at the top of the League Two scoring charts in the 79th minute, finishing with aplomb when through on goal.
