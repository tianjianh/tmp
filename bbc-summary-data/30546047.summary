The 17-year-old has already made seven first-team appearances for the Scottish Premiership outfit this term.
But Dundee manager Paul Hartley thinks he will benefit from more starts.
"This will stand him in good stead, it will be great experience for him and he needs to go get experience of first-team football," Hartley told his club website.
"He will come back a better player.
"It will do him the world of good at this point in his development to get more first-team experience."
Wighton, a product of the Dens Park youth system, broke into the first-team squad last season as they headed for the title and promotion.
The Scotland Under-17 cap has scored one senior goal this season, taking his total for Dundee to three as he found the net in a 1-1 draw with Partick Thistle in August.
