Mother murder accused Ross Taggart 'never snapped'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his mother has told his trial that he has never "snapped" in his life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Taggart, 31, told the High Court in Edinburgh: "I didn't kill my mum."
Taggart has denied murdering his mother Carol, 54, on 21 or 22 December last year at the house they shared at Hill of St Margaret in Dunfermline.
He told the court his relationship with his mother had "its ups and downs" and said: "Growing up we had quite a close relationship."
He said his mother had become concerned about the possibility of him moving away. He said he had told her he did not have to move out but she would have to give him "a bit more breathing room".
He said that when she left the house she grabbed her bag and keys.
"I heard the door slam at the back of her," he said. "I thought she had maybe just gone off in the car for a bit to cool down."
Her said that when his mother failed to return he thought she had gone to the caravan.
He said that on 22 December he had gone to see a woman in Dunfermline he had met on a dating site and later travelled to Edinburgh for a meal and the cinema.
It is alleged that Mr Taggart repeatedly struck his mother on the head by means unknown, seized hold of her neck and compressed her throat using his hands or an unidentified item.
He is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice between 21 December last year and 14 January by hiding her body under a caravan at Pettycur Bay Caravan Park, Kinghorn, Fife, near the caravan owned by his mother.
He is also alleged to have tidied, cleaned, removed and tried to remove blood staining and other forensic evidence from the house and her caravan at the site and to have removed bedding from the properties.
Further charges of theft and fraud against Taggart were withdrawn by the Crown.
The trial continues.
