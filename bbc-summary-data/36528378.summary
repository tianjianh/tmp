The 72-year-old died on Tuesday morning.
Mr McCullough grew up in Portstewart, County Londonderry. He recorded with a number of very well-known musicians including Sir Paul McCartney and Wings, featuring on the hit James Bond theme, Live and Let Die.
He played with Joe Cocker at the legendary Woodstock concert in 1969, the only Irishman to perform there.
Mr McCullough also toured with rock acts such as Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd.
He had received critical acclaim in recent years for albums such as Belfast to Boston and Poor Man's Moon.
Sir Paul McCartney said he was "very sad" to hear of Mr McCullough's death.
"He was a pleasure to work with, a super talented musician with a lovely sense of humour," he told the BBC.
"The solo he played on My Love was a classic that he made up on the spot in front of a live orchestra. Our deepest sympathies from my family to his."
Singer and musician Sir Van Morrison said he was "very sorry" to hear about Mr McCullough's death.
"I know he had some difficult times recently, but he will be remembered for his long and productive career in music," he said.
"My thoughts are with his friends and family at this time."
Mr McCullough spent 18 months touring and recording with Wings in the 1970s, after being invited to join the band following a number of jamming sessions with Sir Paul McCartney.
He was hailed for his guitar work on the US number one hit, My Love.
Mr McCullough later signed to the Dark Horse record label of another Beatle, George Harrison, for his solo album, Mind Your Own Business.
