Laura Robson out of Australian Open and plans February return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former British number one Laura Robson will miss the Australian Open and plans to return to action in February after more than a year out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robson, 20, underwent wrist surgery in April and has chosen not to make her comeback at the first Grand Slam of 2015 later this month.
She has not played since losing to Kirsten Flipkens in the first round of last year's Australian Open.
Robson has slipped from a career-high ranking of 27th in 2013 to 916th.
The 2008 Wimbledon junior champion will return with a protected ranking, allowing her to enter eight WTA tournaments with a ranking of 58th - Robson's position after the last tournament she played in.
There are also likely to be wildcards on offer as she tries to make her way back among the world's top 50, but she will begin on the second-tier ITF circuit next month.
