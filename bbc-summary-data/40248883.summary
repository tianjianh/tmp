The World Cricket League match was halted twice by rain on Sunday, with Scotland finishing their innings on 268-5.
Namibia reached 26-0 before play was abandoned and finished on Monday on 217 from 39.4 overs.
The teams will meet for a second WCL match on Tuesday at Edinburgh's Grange.
Namibia opted to field first after winning the toss and Scotland were 42-2 when the rain first caused a stoppage.
The home side's innings were underpinned by Richie Berrington's 110, his highest score in a one-day international.
After the game was restarted on Monday, the visitors managed to score 217 from 39.4 overs, with Zhivago Groenewald scoring 42 before being caught by Calum MacLeod to signal the end of the tie.
"Richie Berrington played a fine knock on Sunday alongside Craig Wallace who helped get it going, and Preston Mommsen in his comeback game batted brilliantly too," Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer told BBC Scotland.
"A lot of hard graft goes into scoring a hundred like Berrington did, but what made it even better was that Richie had to come on and off about three times because of the weather. That was challenging because he couldn't just get himself set. For Richie to get to 110 and take the team towards that score was something special.
"With Scotland at the moment we've got a pack of bowlers who can really have an impact on the international scene and some batters that are just coming into their real prime, as well as some other players waiting in the wings."
