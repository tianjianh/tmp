The 27-year-old medium-fast bowler, who was out of contract at the end of the season, only featured in one County Championship game for Notts this summer against Worcestershire in July.
Carter said: "I'll have more chance to play all three formats at Derbyshire, which is where I think I should be.
"I am aiming to get a good run of games and kick on with my career."
Carter has played 29 first-class matches, taking 91 wickets at an average of 27.95 with best figures of 5-40. He has also made 20 List A and 23 Twenty20 appearances.
Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said: "His attitude has always been very good and he's a talented bowler. We wish him all the best."
