Abergavenny cattle market: Morrisons signs £17.75m deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deal to bring a supermarket on to the site of a former cattle market in Abergavenny has been completed for £1m more than originally agreed.

Supermarket giant Morrisons has renegotiated with Monmouthshire council after missing a payment deadline earlier this year.
It has given £13.75m up front to build the 25,000 sq ft (2,322 sqm) store and will pay another £4m over 25 years.
The shop should open in late 2017 but the number of jobs created is unknown.
Abergavenny's historical cattle market was controversially moved to a new £5m facility 10 miles (16km) away in 2013, leaving the town centre site derelict.
After Morrisons missed July's deadline, campaigners called for a rethink over the plan, favouring other retail and housing.
The council's deputy leader Bob Greenland said: "We would've preferred not to have a delay that we've had but I recognise the difficulties the grocery market has had over the years and the new management wanted to rethink their strategy.
"Instead of having all of the money up front, we've converted some of it into a rental agreement."
