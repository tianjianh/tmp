Tilda Swinton: Making a silent Splash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
She once slept for seven consecutive days as part of an art installation. Now for her latest film, A Bigger Splash, actress Tilda Swinton plays a rock star - and doesn't speak.

To accept the role of Marianne Lane in the movie, her fourth collaboration with Italian director Luca Guadagnino, co-starring Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson, Swinton herself specified that her character should be silent.
"It was a time in my life when, for personal reasons, I was all out of words; I didn't want to say anything," Swinton elaborates. "I wanted to do the film though, and this was the only way I could make it happen."
In the re-interpretation of a 1969 Jacques Deray film, La Piscine, Marianne Lane is, according to the actress, a "Bowie-esque" glam rock star who is forced to rest her vocal chords in order not to lose her voice completely.
She retreats to the Italian island of Pantelleria, between Sicily and Tunisia, with her new boyfriend Paul, played by Belgian star Matthias Schoenaerts, but their tranquillity is soon disturbed by the arrival of a garrulous Fiennes, playing Harry - who is a record producer and her ex-boyfriend - and his supposed daughter, played by Johnson.
"Luca really wanted me to do the film," Swinton explains. "But the moment came to shoot it, and I really just had nothing to say. So I just got into a fight with myself - on the one hand, I wanted to go and be with all these extraordinary performers and crew, but I also needed to be authentic to myself.
"Eventually I said to Luca: 'Look, I'll come if I don't have to speak', and the more I thought about it, the more I felt it would work. It wouldn't be just about making me relax, but it would be good for the film.
"It would ramp up the tension with Ralph's character Harry, who is nothing but words, but also explore a character forced into silence when her whole career has been about her own noise.
"Luca had to tell the head of the production studio that 'Marianne Lane wasn't speaking any more' and he just shrugged and said: 'She knows what she's doing'."
In the past, Swinton's pale, androgynous style has been compared to David Bowie's, who was a close friend - she even played his wife in the 2013 music video The Stars Are Out Tonight.
But since his death,  Swinton's representative has told the Daily Mail she would not play him in any future biopic about his life, as some   reports had suggested.
However, the actress says that Bowie's Aladdin Sane look from his 1973 album was an inspiration when it came to creating Marianne - for a brief flashback in the film, Swinton filmed on stage in front of 80,000 people, wearing a sequined one piece.
"We knew we wouldn't get that much time on screen of Marianne in her former life, so we had to ping out an image that everyone would recognise," she explains.
"I wanted David Bowie, but a little bit of Chrissy Hines, a little bit of PJ Harvey too. I wanted to make people feel they'd have her records somewhere."
The title of the film comes from David Hockney's pop art painting of 1967, which shows an empty swimming pool that has been recently disturbed by someone jumping in.
Guadagnino says that in this instance "a bigger splash" could mean "greater events are going on outside than in our own small lives  - ripples that we are barely aware of".
He refers to Pantelleria, where filming took place in the summer of 2014. Due to its location between Africa and Europe, boats of migrants   were arriving daily.
Some are included on the periphery of the film, which Guadagnino says is deliberate. "Without it we would have made a summer postcard movie," he states. "With it there's a clash with reality included in the film, something that raises its own moral and ethical questions for the cast, never mind audience members."
The director and actress will work together again next year on his thriller, Suspiria.
Guadagnino says of Swinton, who won an Oscar in 2008 for her supporting role in Michael Clayton: "In years to come, film enthusiasts will dissect her body of work, and it won't be that of an actress, but it will be of a true cineaste, a film-maker, that they discover".
But Swinton disputes that - she started her career working with art-house director Derek Jarman on Caravaggio in 1985, and collaborated with him until his death in 1994.
She then found what she terms "new playmates" in the Coen Brothers - she stars in their latest film Hail, Caesar! - Wes Anderson and Guadagnino, as well as appearing in the Chronicles of Narnia, and Amy Schumer's Trainwreck.
"It's not about making choices," she says. "I don't have that much to do with what we might term the film industry and I don't choose roles. I look for interesting portraits of people, and I like to dream things up with my pals and think of things that we want to do and see.
"My advice to everyone is never wait for someone else to have that good idea and do it.
"I don't understand what people term as actors really, even though technically I am one. It's more about putting on someone else's clothes. And I liked putting on Marianne's; she's on the back foot in her life and really trying to embrace it, but finding it hard.
"She doesn't know what she's doing and I have a lot of fondness for those of us, like myself, who don't know what they're doing."
A Bigger Splash is released in the UK on 12 February.
