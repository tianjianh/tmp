The 51-year-old will take a short time off work to recover after the bronchial carcinoid tumour is removed.
The BBC said he was aiming to be back working prior to May's general election.
Nick Robinson joined the BBC in 1986 as a trainee producer. He has been in his current role since 2005, having left the BBC for ITV for a short period.
A BBC spokesman said: "Everyone at the BBC wishes Nick a speedy recovery."
The sentiment was echoed by Prime Minister David Cameron and leader of the opposition Ed Miliband who both tweeted their best wishes.
The broadcaster, who has a wife and three children, thanked people on Twitter for their "many kind and generous messages".
The BBC said he had asked that he and his family be allowed "the space and privacy he needs in order to rest and recover fully before returning to work".
Carcinoid tumours are rare and tend to be slow growing and may not cause symptoms for several years, according to Cancer Research UK.
Around 25% start in the lung.
