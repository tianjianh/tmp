Batman fans asked to save real Gotham's building

It may not look as grand as Wayne Manor, but villagers hope Batman fans might be able to help them save a community building in the real Gotham.

The building in the Nottinghamshire village - historically connected to the fictional Gotham City - closed amid financial problems and is up for sale.
Campaigners are raising money to buy it and hope Batman fans will aid them.
"We all need a superhero around occasionally, don't we?," said John Anderson, who is leading fundraising.
"We are likely to be up against the big bidders, but this is worth fighting for," continued Mr Anderson, chairman of the Gotham & District Community Venture committee.
"It would be fantastic to hear from any American friends of Gotham who might also invest in this exciting venture."

The building was built for the Royal British Legion in 1966, but closed in January.
Rushcliffe Borough Council designated the site as an Asset of Community Value in July, allowing villagers extra time to find money for their venture.
They have already attracted more than Â£100,000 in pledges from residents, but are now looking for investment from beyond Gotham.
"It went on the market for Â£210,000 but we think we need to raise a bit more than that because it's a popular site to buy," said Mr Anderson.
Their plan, dubbed Destination Gotham, would see the creation of an expanded shop on the site, as well as a community-run cafÃ© and visitor hub where the village archives can be stored and displayed.
Steve Smith, from the Gotham Geeks Podcast, thinks the appeal could work.
"I think that comic fans take their community seriously and I think if they have the opportunity to help the town that gave such an important piece of the Batman universe its name, especially with all the press about Bill Finger lately, they'd absolutely be willing to help," he said.
"The power of social media is incredible and if fans heard about something like this, they'd be willing to help out."
