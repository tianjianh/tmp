Arthur Jones, 73, has not been seen since 19 June - two days after he arrived, and missed his flight home.
Officers spent nearly a week on Crete, staying an extra two days as the search narrowed to an area between Mr Jones' hotel and a World War Two cemetery.
His name was found in the cemetery's visitor book, signed on 18 June.
Det Ch Insp Gareth Evans and missing person co-ordinator Mark Owen arrived in Crete on Sunday along with Phil Benbow, chair of the North Wales Mountain Rescue Association, to help police on the Greek island with the search.
They were flying home on Saturday after staying an extra two days than planned to take part in a more concentrated search for the former soldier and experienced walker.
Supt Steve Williams of North Wales Police said: "We are pleased to have been able to provide support to the Greek authorities and also to Mr Jones's family who have been on the island.
"We will continue to support the family and we will remain in close contact with the authorities in Crete."
On Monday, police found Mr Jones's name in the visitor book at the Souda Bay World War Two cemetery where he had hoped to lay a cross on the grave of a friend's relative.
An appeal was issued to British people who signed their names next to his on 18 June to come forward.
"We have spoken to people who were at the cemetery," said Mr Williams.
"This has enabled us to confirm that Mr Jones was at the cemetery early that morning, but has provided no further lines of enquiries to assist in identifying his future plans for his time in Crete."
Anyone with any information about Arthur Jones has been asked to contact their local police force on 0300 3300101 quoting the North Wales Police reference number R103354.
