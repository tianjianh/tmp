Prince William placed the wreath at the police memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.
A hand-written note attached to the floral tribute read: "For PC Keith Palmer and all those who have served our community so valiantly; your legacy is our way of life. William."
He was at the site to officially open its Â£15.7m new Remembrance Centre.

Prince William is a patron of the National Memorial Arboretum Appeal, which funded the construction of the centre, which opened in October 2016.
During his visit he met with veterans, volunteers and school pupils and also unveiled a commemorative plaque.
He also visited the centre's Landscapes of Life exhibition, which includes interactive activities and an audio guide for use around many of the site's memorials.
In the programme for the event, he wrote: "This is a place for special memories, many of them sad, but hopefully, many of them happy too.
"We all have an important job to do in keeping these memories alive for future generations and this new Remembrance Centre will play a significant role in that duty."
The 150-acre (61 hectare) site contains more than 330 memorials dedicated to all the armed forces, emergency services and civilians.
