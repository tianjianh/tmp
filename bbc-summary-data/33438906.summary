The Welsh Blood Service in south, mid and west Wales will merge with NHS Blood and Transplant in north Wales to form a single service from May 2016.
The move will create 16 new jobs in Wrexham and south Wales, as well as an extra 25 donation clinics.
The Welsh government said the new service will create long-term savings of Â£596,000 per year.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "The service will use the latest technology and scientific developments to ensure every Welsh pound invested in blood-related services meets the needs of the people of Wales."
