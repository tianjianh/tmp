[SN]TITLE[SN]
New guidance to benefit Muslim swimmers and those with medical conditions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New swimwear guidance that will enable more people, including Muslim women, to compete has been introduced by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The governing body has relaxed a rule banning swimwear covering the whole body, allowing those who wear full body suits for religious beliefs or medical conditions to swim at English events.
The Muslim Women's Sport Foundation said it was "extremely pleased".
ASA chairman Chris Bostock called the move "a very positive step forward".
