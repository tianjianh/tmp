Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe kept an eye on Chelsea and Arsenal fans while perched on police horse Oliver.
The top of the table clash attracted 41,490 fans to Stamford Bridge.
A spokesman said Sir Bernard has attended patrols "quite a lot" since being appointed in September 2011.
He is due to retire next month, after five years in the role.
