Wales won 3-0 in all three ties of the European Championship qualifier.
"I was a little bit nervous but it was good. I played well, but I think I could do a little bit better," Hursey told BBC Wales Sport.
The result sees Wales finish second in qualifying Group F, and they will face Belarus away on 10 April.
The match in Cardiff was originally scheduled for early March but was called off twice as Kosovo encountered visa problems.
Beth Roberts, 19, also won on her debut with captain Charlotte Carey, 20, setting the ball rolling with a dominant display in winning the opening game.
