New Hearts striker Juanma Delgado believes he has joined a "big club" after leaving Greek Superleague outfit Kalloni for Scotland's top flight.

The 24-year-old Spaniard, who has agreed a three-year deal, scored seven goals in 26 games last season.
"The facilities are great," he told the club website. "I've been particularly impressed by the family feeling here."
Juanma becomes Hearts' second striker signing in a week after the arrival of Gavin Reilly from Queen of the South.
The Spaniard began his career with Jove Espanol in his homeland before moving to Denia, Alaves and Asteras Tripoli before switching to their Greek top-flight rivals last year.
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson said: "We spent a lot of time over the summer speaking to Juanma and meeting him.
"We thought it was going to get done a few weeks ago and we had some issues with the contractual situation in Greece, but we finally got it over the line.
"He'll be a big asset for us. He brings physicality and he'll hopefully bring goals as well.
"He's a good player, technically very good, great in the air and has good link-up play - and he's a great character."
