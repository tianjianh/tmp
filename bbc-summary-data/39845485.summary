South Yorkshire Fire Service said up to 500 tonnes of plastic could be on fire at Universal Recycling, on Wharf Road near Kilnhurst.
Seven fire engines are attending the blaze and there has been disruption to local transport services.
People have been told to avoid the area, stay indoors and close windows and doors, and get children inside as soon as possible after school.

The fire service, police and ambulance service are in attendance, and a cordon is in place.
Incident Commander Andy Hayter, from South Yorkshire Fire Service, said the fire mostly involves plastics, but some metal is on fire.
No oil or vehicles are ablaze and oxy acetylene canisters, which have not caught fire, are being moved to a safe place.
Mr Hayter said there had been "quite a high number of explosions from aerosols" earlier.
He warned: "Don't come and spectate. It's not a spectator sport and it's not good for your health to be breathing in large quantities of this stuff.
"My concern is around school time. If you are picking your children up from school locally and you do see the plume, make it as brief as you can and get indoors as soon as you possibly can."
BBC reporter Andy Kershaw said he had been told dust masks were being handed out at the two nearest schools to protect children from the smoke.
