[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died last month in Northern Punjab.
Deputy Inspector General Abu Bakr Khuda Bux revealed to the BBC how she died, following the launch of a murder inquiry based on information they got from her husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam.
No arrests have been made in the case, he confirmed.
However, Ms Shahid's father Mohammad and a cousin known as Mobeen have both been interviewed by officers, though neither have been detained.

Her first husband Choudhry Shakeel, who was previously reported to be on the run, is in Pakistan on pre-arrest bail order, which means police know his whereabouts, but cannot arrest, or demand to interview him, until the order expires on Saturday.
Pakistani daily The News revealed the forensic report, released earlier, confirmed Ms Shahid had been murdered and her death had not been from natural causes.
The paper said the report stated clearly her death was caused by suffocation, having been physically stopped from breathing.
Post-mortem tests stated her death was as a result of strangulation.
The report was handed to the chief minister's investigating committee, it said.
Ms Shahid's family had initially claimed she had died of a heart attack.
Syed Mukhtar Kazam believes his wife, who had gone to Pakistan to visit relatives, was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
He said that before she left, her family had threatened her life.
