Keepers have named the pups Ronnie and Reggie after London gangsters the Kray twins, as a group of meerkats is known as a mob.
The slender-tailed meerkats, which join a family of 11 at the park, are believed to have been born at the beginning of August.
Headkeeper Lisa Smith said: "Our visitors are overwhelmed at how cute the pups are."
She said: "They are definitely more adorable than gangsters, however, because meerkats are so good at looking out for their siblings, it's a fitting name for the brothers."
The park has also seen the births of alpacas, lemurs and lions this year.
Meerkats are native to the Kalahari Desert and have an average life span of 12 to 14 years in captivity and about half of that in the wild.
