San Marino v England: How the players rated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England made no mistake in qualifying for Euro 2016 with victory over San Marino, keeping up their 100% record in the group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Wayne Rooney joined Sir Bobby Charlton at the top of the all-time England goalscorers' list by netting for the 49th time for his country.
Midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was impressive in the middle of the park on his return to the side.
So how did England's players fare overall? Chief football writer Phil McNulty runs the rule over the players on duty.
As expected, barely any action of note. One piece of mishandling late on but that was the result of the poor surface rather than anything to do with Hart.
Showed plenty of pace to retrieve one situation in the first half and worked hard to get forward on a night when his defensive qualities were not required.
As with Clyne, not needed defensively so was able to use his attacking instincts as England exerted complete control throughout.
Elegant and composed as ever and also showed glimpses of how he will help England break out of defence with the ball, particularly with one first-half run.
Solid as ever but was pretty much a spectator for most of the match. The mark is a reflection of his redundancy rather than performance.
A superb return after almost three years away from the England side. Showed good composure, a fine range of passing and that he could be a creator as well.
Usual workhorse effort. Utterly dependable and a man that manager Roy Hodgson can trust completely.
Had too much pace for the San Marino defence and used it to good effect. Perfect cross for Barkley's goal.
A good night for this wonderfully gifted Everton youngster. Scored his first England goal and was always looking to try things. Even the rather hard-to-please Mr Hodgson was impressed.
Equalled Sir Bobby Charlton's England record with his 49th goal, this time from the penalty spot. Took on his usual workload. History can wait - at least until Tuesday against Switzerland.
Worked his socks off and was aggressive, particularly in a second-half spat with San Marino defender Giovanni Bonini, but not everything worked. He will hope for another chance soon.
Came on with England dominant and did well, created a goal for Theo Walcott.
Perfect, morale-boosting finish for England's fifth goal. Took it well, showing great composure. He will hope his first goal of the season gets him going.
Great impact with two goals, the first seconds after coming on. Pace will always provide a threat and a potent extra option for Hodgson.
