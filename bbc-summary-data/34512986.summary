[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Sheridan celebrated his first win in four attempts as Newport County manager as Wycombe fell to a third successive League Two defeat.

The league's bottom club took the lead when Marcus Bean scored an own goal after being hit by an attempted clearance inside the six yard box.
Lenell John-Lewis and Zak Ansah went close before Scott Boden's low drive secured the win a minute from time.
Wycombe's best efforts came from Max Kretzschmar and Garry Thompson.
Only an inferior goal difference now keeps Newport on the foot of the table as their second win of the season moves them level on points with Yeovil and Dagenham and Redbridge.
Newport manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Wales:
"It's not going to do us any harm coming to one of the top teams in the division and putting on a performance like that.
"We were well worthy winners and I'm just pleased for everyone involved because they haven't won many games.
"It's a good feeling for the fans that we brought here and I've already started to think about Saturday's game."
