Wales could return to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium for a possible friendly against Netherlands in November following qualification to the 2016 European Championships.

Wales have reached a major finals for the first time since 1958.
Qualification came despite defeat by Bosnia-Herzegovina and was celebrated at a 2-0 win over Andorra on Tuesday.
"It would be great if it was Holland [next] - that's another good test for us," said Coleman.
"And if it's at the Millennium, great.
"It's not been decided, but that's the type of quality we're looking to test ourselves against."
Netherlands failed in their bid to qualify from Group A to be in France next summer, while Coleman saw his side rise to international prominence.
Wales are hoping to confirm the details for next month's friendly by the end of this week. The last time the countries met, Gareth Bale was among a host of Wales players absent from a 2-0 defeat.
"It's kind of strange playing them next month when only two years ago they were going to the [2014] World Cup and we were very much at the start of our rebuilding, if you like," said Coleman. "It's funny how times change."
Wales last played at the Millennium Stadium, the home of Welsh rugby, in a 2-0 Euro 2012 qualifier defeat by England in March, 2011.
They have since made Cardiff City Stadium their home venue, and are unbeaten there in their last eight games.
