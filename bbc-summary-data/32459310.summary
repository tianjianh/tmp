Another adult and two children were taken to hospital following the crash, but all three have since been discharged.
Martin McBrien, from Derrylin O'Connells GAA Club, said: "Shane just had so much to offer our club. He was a man of immense talent particularly in the field of hurling.
"Just this very morning he was due to start coaching our under-eights in the skills of gaelic football, hurling and camogie.
"That's just an indication of what Shane was prepared to contribute to our club and what I know he would have contributed had he been spared."
Cavan GAA county chairman, Gerry Brady, said he had seen Mr Mulholland on Friday and described his death as a "total shock".
"He had been working yesterday, the staff and fellow coaches and other members of staff naturally enough were all looking forward to a Friday evening said goodbye to each other," he said.
"Little did anyone know that a few short hours later that the tragic and untimely news would come to us that Shane had been taken from us.
"It's just unbelievable that someone so full of life, a brilliant coach could be taken away from his family, his young wife and baby and his extended family, it's just terrible."
The Gaelic Players Association described Mr Mulholland as "an outstanding ambassador for his teammates and his sport".
Sports Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n expressed her sadness at his death.
"Shane was a talented and energetic person who gave so much in life and his untimely passing will leave a deep void in the lives of those who were fortunate to know him," he said.
"I am deeply saddened by his loss and offer my sincerest condolences to his wife Vanessa, his young daughter Aisling and the entire Mulholland family circle. It is a time of unimaginable grief for them and they are very much in my thoughts at this time.
"Shane's loss will also be felt amongst his hurling colleagues in Lisbellaw and Fermanagh, in his native Loughguile and by the young people he coached in Cavan, and I am also thinking of them all at this time."
