The 44-year-old has previously been head coach at Middlesex and Glamorgan.
Ireland hope Radford will help in their long-term goal of becoming a full member of the International Cricket Council, and playing Test cricket.
"I'm looking forward to joining Cricket Ireland at such an exciting time for the organisation," said Radford.
"Ireland have forged a strong and well-established reputation for producing high-quality young cricketers, and its national team has performed with great distinction on the international stage over the past decade," he added.
"I have always been passionate about unearthing and coaching young talent and the opportunity to do so with Cricket Ireland, as it seeks to obtain full Test match playing status, is hugely motivating."
Radford has also had coaching roles with West Indies and England Lions.
"We are now looking to develop our talent into world-class players who are capable of performing against the best in the world in all three formats," said Cricket Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth.
"Toby's experience of coaching at international and first-class level will bring great understanding of what it takes to perform at the highest level."
Ex-England batsman Chris Adams was appointed as national academy manager in May - but two days later, reversed his decision for family reasons.
