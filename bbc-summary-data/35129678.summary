[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquiry has been ordered by the government over claims a woman suffered up to 50 rat bites at her care home.

Pamela Hudson, 75, suffered injuries to her face, body and arms caused, her family believes, by a rodent at the council-run home Glen Lodge, in York.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for the investigation after seeing graphic pictures in the Sun newspaper.
But after its own inquiry, City of York Council said it could not determine how Mrs Hudson came by her injuries.
Mr Hunt said: "These pictures are appalling and show the suffering of a vulnerable woman who, along with her family, was stripped of her dignity and badly let down.
"Working across government, ministers are ordering an investigation which will be launched in the coming days.
"Whatever the sort of social care provider, patients have a right to expect the highest standards, and that is what we are determined to secure."
Mrs Hudson's daughter Jan Derry told the Sun she thinks the rat probably got trapped in the bed during the incident in June and attacked her mother as it tried to get free.
She said: "The thought of how many times she was bitten is awful."
Mrs Hudson was later transferred to alternative accommodation, before dying three months after the incident.
Martin Farran, director of adult social care at the council, said: "It is with regret that, despite extensive efforts by professional experts, environmental health and independent inspectors, we have been unable to determine the exact circumstances of how Mrs Hudson's injuries occurred."
