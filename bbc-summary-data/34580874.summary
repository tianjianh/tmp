The January festival of music and culture in Glasgow features concerts, ceilidhs and talks over 18 days.
Those taking part include Rickie Lee Jones, Lucinda Williams, The Unthanks, Karine Polwart and Robert Plant.
Speaking as the programme was launched, Ian Smith of Creative Scotland said Celtic Connections was "one of Scotland's creative treasures".
Artistic Director Donald Shaw said: "For 2016, we are bringing superstars and cult heroes, new talent, and artists who were legends long before the first Celtic Connections was staged.
"This year we weave stories of pilgrimage, of crossing continents, we celebrate anniversaries and the Auld Alliance."
Ian Smith of Creative Scotland added: "Celtic Connections is one of the world's great music festivals and to have established such a global presence in a comparatively short time underlines its place as one of Scotland's creative treasures.
"Every January we gather in Glasgow in mid-winter to be thrilled and inspired by great music from around the world, but with its roots and traditions firmly in Scotland.
"With Showcase Scotland at its core, Celtic Connections represents all that is great about Scotland's cultural identity expressed so brilliantly through its music."
Celtic Connections 2016 starts on 14 January.
