The Latics opened the scoring through Chris McCann before Will Grigg added a second after Yanic Wildschut hit the post and Grigg scored the rebound.
Grigg then slotted home for his second and Michael Jacobs fired into the top right-hand corner for Wigan's fourth.
The Seasiders got a goal back when Wigan captain Craig Morgan turned the ball into his own net.
Wigan sit on 84 points at the top of League One, nine points clear of Walsall who have three games left and three points ahead of second-placed Burton who have two games remaining.
However, the Latics have a far superior goal difference compared to their rivals.
