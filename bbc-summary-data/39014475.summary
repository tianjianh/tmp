This is the first ever time that Sutton have ever made it this far in the competition, and it'll be the first competitive game ever played between the sides.
Sutton may be the underdogs, but they're playing at home on an artificial pitch and haven't lost there in five months. It could be an interesting tie!
Have a watch to find out more from some of Sutton's younger players.
