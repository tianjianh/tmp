[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors, who have also been struggling for form of late, were the better side during the opening 45 minutes, at the end of which they led 1-0 courtesy of Ian Henderson's header four minutes before the break.
Having earlier forced a fine stop from home goalkeeper Luke Daniels from point-blank range, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing teased a cross to the far post from where Henderson nodded home.
Scunthorpe were better in the second period and Paddy Madden glanced in a header from Stephen Dawson's cross in the 55th minute to get them back on level terms.
And having breathed a sigh of relief in the closing stages when visiting substitute Peter Vincenti had a close-range finish ruled out for offside, the Iron were toasting a late winner when Crooks fired in from the edge of the box.
