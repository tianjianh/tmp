Defender Mickey Demetriou, one of the heroes of Newport County's unlikely League Two survival, has signed a two-year contract.

Demetriou, 27, scored four goals in the last seven matches of the season as Newport escaped relegation.
The former Shrewsbury Town and Kidderminster player was named League Two's player of the month for April.
"I'm really happy to get the deal over the line and I'm looking forward to next season," Demetriou said.
Newport manager Mike Flynn said: "I am delighted to get Mickey's signing over the line.
"Mickey has a great left foot and is now entering a stage in his career where his experience and quality is going to be vital for us."
Newport signed five players last week, including the return of David Pipe and Robbie Willmott.
However, they released midfielder Mitch Rose, the brother of Tottenham defender Danny who has since signed for Grimsby.
