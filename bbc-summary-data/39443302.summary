[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex all-rounder Delray Rawlins has signed a one-year contract to stay at Hove until the end of the 2018 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rawlins has yet to play a competitive first-team game for Sussex, but scored 274 runs at an average of 78.42 for England Under-19s in two youth Tests during their recent tour of India.
The Bermuda-born 19-year-old also took one wicket with his left-arm spin.
"I always back myself to do well, but even I exceeded my expectations there," he told the club website.
"I want to play as much cricket as I can in the first team and do as well as I can."
