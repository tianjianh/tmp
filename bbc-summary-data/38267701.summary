The incident happened in Briarcroft Road, in the Robroyston area of Glasgow, at about 22:55 on Thursday.
The 26-year-old man was in his black VW Golf when a silver Land Rover was deliberately driven into the car.
Police said the Golf driver got out of his car and was chased along Briarcroft Road by two men from the vehicle who then assaulted him.
The injured man was treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary before being released.
A short time later the Land Rover vehicle was found burnt out in Robroyston Road, near Rushyhill Farm.
Det Sgt Cheryl Kelly, of Police Scotland, said: "This would appear to be a deliberate, targeted attack and as such we are currently trying to establish the exact circumstances of the incident.
"I'd like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or anyone who may have seen the Land Rover vehicle in the area around 2255 hrs last night or being set alight shortly afterwards."
