[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frenchman Alexander Levy extended his lead to six shots on day two of the fog-delayed European Open in Germany.

Levy completed a nine-under first round of 62 earlier on Friday and moved to 17 under, before bad light halted him on the last hole of his second round.
He was six clear of German Martin Kaymer, England's Ross Fisher and Swede Robert Karlsson, all on 11 under with several holes to play.
Kaymer's form will be a timely boost before the Ryder Cup.
European team-mate, Belgian Thomas Pieters, was further down the field on three under after 16 holes of his second round.
Austrian Bernd Wiesberger, who trailed Levy by a shot after the opening round, begins his round two at Bad Griesbach on Saturday.
