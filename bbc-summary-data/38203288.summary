Coventry, FA Cup winners in 1987, have now been knocked out by a team from a lower division three seasons running.
"I feel for everyone connected with the football club," said Venus.
"I feel for the goalkeeping coach, who played in the Cup final (Steve Ogrizovic). I feel for the kit man, who's been at the club for 30 years."
Former assistant manager Venus, 49, was asked in October to take charge of the Sky Blues until January, while the League One side search for a permanent successor to Tony Mowbray.
However, Coventry have now lost four games in a row, conceding 11 goals and scoring only two in that time.
"The performance from my football team wasn't good enough to be deserving of the manager, to be honest - I've got to take that into consideration," Venus told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"It's been a terrible afternoon and I have to take responsibility for everything, which is fine. But I think the team and everyone should be stood here taking responsibility as well."
