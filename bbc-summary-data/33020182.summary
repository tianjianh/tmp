[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boy who was born without ears has been granted his wish of wearing sunglasses for the first time.

Kieran Sorkin, 9, from Hertfordshire, was told at a hospital appointment on Thursday that his new ears had healed sufficiently to support his shades.
Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, which means he just had small lobes where his ears should have been.
He had an operation last summer to create a pair of ears made of cartilage taken from his ribs.
It took place at the world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.
He then had a second procedure in February to lift his new ears away from the sides of his head and forwards into the correct position. They were covered in skin taken from his scalp.
But it was not until Thursday that he was told by lead surgeon Neil Bulstrode that he could wear sunglasses, just in time for summer.
"Awesome!" Kieran said before immediately putting on the glasses and admiring himself in the mirror.
"Mr Bulstrode is the best surgeon as he made my wishes come true," he said.
His mother said the family, from Bushey, were delighted with the results.
"Kieran has been very brave throughout this journey and the results today are overwhelming.
"We know we all made the right decision with Kieran to go ahead with surgery. It's already made such a huge difference to his self-esteem and confidence."
Kieran was born deaf as a result of the condition but can already hear, thanks to previous surgery to implant a hearing aid.
