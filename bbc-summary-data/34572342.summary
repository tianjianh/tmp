But they're not the only record breaking bakers in the world - here's Newsround's pick of the biggest and the best food creations...
In February chefs in Guadalajara, Mexico, broke a world record by making a line of tacos nearly two miles long. A team of 130 cooks were together for six hours to create the masterpiece.
At eight and a half metres tall, this is the largest handmade Easter egg in the world. It was made in April in Argentina, South America, and 8,000kg of chocolate - that's about the same weight as two elephants - was used to make it.
Bakers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, served up a massive 450-metre-long cake to celebrate the city's 450th anniversary in March. The cake was made from around 30,000 eggs, 2,500 bags of flour and lots of butter, and took 10 bakers three days to make it.
The largest gingerbread house was made in Texas, USA and was not something that would fit in your regular baking tin! In fact it was 18.28 m long, 12.8 m wide and 18.28 m tall at its highest point. Money raised from visitors was given to the local hospital.
Sixty French and Italian bakers worked nearly seven hours to bake this record-breaking 122 metre-long bread. They used a specially designed portable oven to bake the dough and had to be very careful that the massive baguette didn't break.
