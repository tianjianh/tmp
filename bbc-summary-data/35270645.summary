[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Terry scored a controversial 98th-minute equaliser to earn Chelsea a point in a thriller against Everton.

The Toffees took the lead when Terry put through his own net, and Ross Barkley hit a post for Everton before Kevin Mirallas put the visitors 2-0 up.
Diego Costa reduced the margin and Cesc Fabregas's deflected shot made it 2-2.
Ramiro Funes Mori restored Everton's lead in the 90th minute only for Terry to back-heel in from close range - although he was a yard offside.
Relive the drama from Stamford Bridge
Everton's players were angry Terry's goal was allowed to stand while manager Roberto Martinez was also furious referee Mike Jones played more than the seven additional minutes indicated.

Yet in a pulsating game the visitors, who lost defender Bryan Oviedo to injury, only had themselves to blame for blowing a 2-0 lead.
They appeared to be coasting to a first win in four league outings when Mirallas doubled the lead with a crisp shot after Leighton Baines' cross.
Baines had also been instrumental in the first goal, Terry getting his feet into an awful tangle while attempting to clear his cross.
Costa comfortably rounded Howard to make it 2-1 after Phil Jagielka failed to deal with a long ball forward by Fabregas, who made it 2-2 with a deflected shot which deceived Howard.
There are signs Costa could be returning to his best form. The Spain international has five goals in his last four league and cup outings, but is he facing a spell on the sidelines?
He was involved in a couple of minor rows with Everton players after Chelsea fell 2-0 behind but he launched his side's fightback after a determined run which ended in him beating Howard and rolling the ball home.
However, the Spaniard missed a great chance at 2-2 from six yards out and then limped off with a shin injury after a foul and went to hospital. Chelsea's interim boss Guus Hiddink will be hoping he will be back on his feet sooner rather than later.
Chelsea started the day six points above the relegation zone and with Hiddink warning that the threat of relegation was hanging over the club.
While Terry's dramatic late goal sparked jubilant scenes at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea will be just four points above the relegation places should Swansea win at home to Watford on Monday.
This was their fourth draw in five Premier League games since Hiddink returned to Stamford Bridge last month. The Blues are still without a home league win under the interim manager and have conceded five goals in the last two games.
Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: "I took some risks [at 2-0 down] and it paid off in a spectacular way. The team is very resilient.

"Of course I'm not happy with the goals conceded but very happy with the attitude."
Everton manager Roberto Martinez: "It's a difficult game to analyse. When we were 2-0 up we would have liked to have controlled the game more. We deserved the three points.
"We were part of an exciting game of football. Once we got a 2-0 lead it became a little bit too open."
Chelsea have a full week to recover before making the journey across London to face leaders Arsenal on 24 January (16:00 GMT). On the same day, Everton host Martinez's former club Swansea City (13:30 GMT).
