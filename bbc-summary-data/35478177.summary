England have sent eight players back to their clubs as coach Eddie Jones confirmed his squad of 23, plus two travelling reserves, for the Six Nations match against Scotland.

Jack Clifford, Ollie Devoto and Paul Hill could make their debuts in what will be Jones' first match in charge.
Uncapped duo Maro Itoje and Elliot Daly will travel to Edinburgh as reserves.
Saracens' Itoje may yet feature in the match-day squad, with Courtney Lawes battling a hamstring injury.
Assistant coach Steve Borthwick told BBC Sport that Northampton lock Lawes did not train on Tuesday but was hopeful he would play.
"Courtney is working hard on his recovery. He was working well with the physios and hopefully he'll be fit and healthy for Saturday," said the former England second-rower.
Sale forward Josh Beaumont, one of seven uncapped players in England's original 33-man squad, is one of the eight to return to their clubs this weekend.
Kieran Brookes (Northampton Saints), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), Matt Kvesic (Gloucester Rugby), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Sam Hill (Exeter Chiefs), Semesa Rokoduguni (Bath Rugby) and Marland Yarde (Harlequins) have also been freed up to play in the Premiership.
England have a new coach, and a new captain in Dylan Hartley, and will aim to atone for becoming the first host nation to fail to progress beyond the World Cup group stages in 2015.
The statistics bode well for Jones, as Scotland have not beaten England in their last eight attempts since 2008, with one draw in 2010.
Scotland have only won their first game of the Six Nations once, in 2006, and have not scored a try against England at Murrayfield since 2004.
Backs: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Ollie Devoto (Bath Rugby), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath Rugby), Alex Goode (Saracens), Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby), Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby), Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers).
Forwards: Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Jack Clifford (Harlequins), Jamie George (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints), James Haskell (Wasps), Paul Hill (Northampton Saints), George Kruis (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens).
