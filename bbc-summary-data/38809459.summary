Crofting row convener Colin Kennedy seeks re-election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colin Kennedy, whose actions at the Crofting Commission have been the source of a row, is standing for re-election to the public body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year, the commission's board apologised for its handling of a dispute with crofters over the management of common grazing land.
Board members also asked Mr Kennedy to resign. He has refused to do so.
His name has been put forward for re-election as the representative for the South West Highlands.
The ballot takes place in March. The other South West Highlands candidates are Ronnie Campbell, Catherine MacKinnon, Billy Neilson and Uilleam Smith.
Mr Kennedy has argued he did nothing wrong in the months-long dispute with crofters over their grazings, and that the board's vote last September asking him to resign was not valid.
In October last year, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish government ministers had the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled Crofting Commission.
Ms Sturgeon said ministers would not ordinarily get involved in the internal operations of the commission.
However, during a First Minister's Questions session in Holyrood, she said legislation did give ministers the power to intervene if required.
