Joseph Harvey, of Sea Cliff Road, Scarborough, was sentenced on Monday to 12-and-a-half years in prison for offences including attempted rape and sexual assault.
The 62-year-old denied 18 charges at his trial at Sheffield Crown Court earlier this year but was found guilty.
The attacks happened in the Doncaster area.
South Yorkshire Police said the sentence reflected "the gravity of his offending".
Det Con Brian Thompson said: "While he pleaded guilty to some of the offences, he still put his victims through further trauma and distress by taking this to trial.
"I hope that the sentence handed to Harvey offers his victims reassurance and closure that, after so many years, their abuser is finally behind bars for his despicable crimes."
