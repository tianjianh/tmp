Nigel Farage calls US President Barack Obama a 'loathsome individual'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has described US President Barack Obama as a "loathsome individual" and a "creature" who "couldn't stand our country".

He told Talk Radio he "couldn't be happier" about Donald Trump's US election victory and that he would work to further trade relations.
Mr Farage said he would advise him: "Come and schmooze Theresa [May], but don't touch her, for goodness' sake."
Mr Trump and Mr Farage campaigned alongside one another in August.
Asked about the Republican's unexpected election victory against Democrat Hillary Clinton, UKIP's interim leader - in place following the resignation of his successor, Diane James - said he "couldn't be happier".
He described the result as "Brexit times two", adding of his own role in events: "I'm the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites and all these dreadful people who, working hand-in-glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, have made themselves rich and ruined our countries."
He claimed Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated in January, "hates the EU even more than I do" and predicted an improvement in US-UK relations, saying: "That Obama creature, loathsome individual, couldn't stand our country. He said we'd be at the back of the queue [for trade deals], didn't he?
"What was interesting was that Trump said we'd be at the front of the queue."
Mr Farage said it was unlikely the US president-elect would take him on as an adviser, as he was not an American citizen, but told Talk Radio: "I will be encouraging him to make the United Kingdom his number one global priority."
During the election campaign, a 2005 recording of Mr Trump apparently bragging about groping women was released. This prompted many senior Republicans to abandon support for him.
Promising to give Mr Trump "a drill on British etiquette", Mr Farage joked: "I'm now going to become a diplomat. I've got to say, 'Come and schmooze Theresa - don't touch her, for goodness' sake'."
He added: "If it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult, make sure everything's OK."
Meanwhile, UKIP MEP William Dartmouth called Mr Farage the "best choice" for the next UK ambassador to Washington.
He said: "On Brexit, the special relationship will be even more important. Nigel Farage already has good ties and a relationship with the US President-elect, Donald Trump - much better than anyone else in British public life.
"His appointment would  materially assist the UK in getting a UK-USA trade agreement for the first time. We in the UK would then  be 'at the front of the queue'."
