Marcos Baghdatis confirms Aegon Nottingham Open appearance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis is to play at the Aegon Open in Nottingham next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
World number 38 Baghdatis had to pull out of last season's tournament in the semi-finals because of injury, but will return for the pre-Wimbledon grass-court event, which starts on 18 June.
South Africa's world number 19 Kevin Anderson is the highest-ranked entrant.
Great Britain Davis Cup trio Kyle Edmund, Dan Evans and James Ward will also be in the draw.
They were all part of the Great Britain squad that won the Davis Cup in 2015 - Britain's first title in 79 years.
