Cai Griffiths: Ospreys prop joins Italian side ASR Milano

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys prop Cai Griffiths has moved to Italian side ASR Milano, where he will take up a joint playing and commercial role.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bangor-born Griffiths, 32, joined from Caernarfon RFC in 2003 and made over 130 appearances during three spells.
Griffiths has combined playing with a role in the region's commercial team over the last 20 months, and the move to Italy is an extension of that role.
"This is a really exciting opportunity for me," Griffiths said.
"I've been thinking more and more about my future, and life beyond professional rugby, for some time now and in terms of my personal development this is a great role."
Griffiths has also played for Neath, London Irish and London Welsh.
