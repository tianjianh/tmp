Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the Swansea Bay City Region Deal would be given approval by the end of 2017.
Mr Bebb told BBC's The Wales Report there were some things that needed to be "tweaked".
It had been speculated that the deal would be given the formal green light in Wednesday's budget.
But Chancellor Philip Hammond told MPs the UK Government "continues to make good progress" on the deal.
Mr Bebb said the bid, which aims to create thousands of jobs in Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea, was "very exciting".
"It's certainly been described as better than some of the deals which have been signed in England," he said.
"There are some issues that need to be tweaked and improved but I am confident that we will have a good deal for Swansea which shows that Westminster not only delivers for the capital city of Wales but also for Wales' second city."
He added: "I am confident that we will also have a cross-border growth deal for north Wales as well."
Cllr Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council, said the deal would "improve people's lives" by generating up to 10,000 jobs and investing in technology.
