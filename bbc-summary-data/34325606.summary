Scottish cyclist David Smith has delayed having lifesaving surgery to concentrate on his bid to compete at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio.

Smith, 37, from Aviemore, said an operation to remove a spinal cord tumour came with a high risk of leaving him paralysed from the neck down.
He was first diagnosed with a tumour in 2010. After further surgery 11 months ago, the tumour has reoccurred.
Smith told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to "give it everything" to get to Rio.
Before competing at cycling, Smith won a gold medal in rowing at the 2012 London Paralympics and was an ambassador for Glasgow's Commonwealth Games.
He received news of the reoccurrence of the tumour, which is rare and linked to a faulty gene, during Glasgow 2014.
Smith told 5 Live that his surgeon, a former competitive cyclist himself, understood his situation and there was potentially enough time for him to compete at Rio before surgery became unavoidable.
The cyclist said: "It's my dream.
"I would rather live these next 11 months and give it everything I've got to try and make it to Rio than go for surgery now and run the risk of being paralysed from the neck down.
"The risks of surgery are very high."
Smith, who was born with a clubfoot and came close to having his right foot amputated at birth, won a gold medal at London 2012 in the mixed coxed four.
A post box was painted gold in Aviemore in his honour.
