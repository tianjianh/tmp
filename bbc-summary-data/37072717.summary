Livingston and Brechin City also preserved their 100% records in the division with wins over Airdrieonians and Albion Rovers, respectively.
East Fife remain unbeaten in the league after a comfortable 3-0 away victory against Peterhead.
And Queen's Park got their first win, 2-1 away to Stenhousemuir.
Though Alloa would go on to win comfortably, it was Stranraer who took the lead through Craig Malcolm.
Doubles by Greig Spence and Jordan Kirkpatrick and an Iain Flannigan goal before half-time put the Wasps firmly in charge with Malcolm's second of the game after the break proving only to be consolation for the hosts.
In Airdrie, Danny Mullen put Livi ahead and Liam Buchanan got their second. The Diamonds' Andy Ryan netted either side of team-mate Daniel Boateng's own goal and Josh Mullin completed the scoring for the visitors at 4-2.
Alan Trouten's first-half penalty and Andy Jackson's effort shortly after the break gave Brechin a 2-0 away win against Albion Rovers.
East Fife moved on to four points with their first league win of the season - Jason Kerr, Kevin Smith and Mark Lamont netting without reply for the Fifers against Peterhead.
Stenny led against the Spiders through Stephen Stirling but Darren Miller's penalty levelled matters before Josh Watt got Queen's Park's winner.
