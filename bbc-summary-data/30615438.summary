Assistant general secretary Steve Hedley from the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union confirmed just 10 posts will remain across the Taffs Well, Swansea and Gaerwen, Anglesey, sites.
City Link announced on Christmas Eve it had gone into administration, putting 2,727 in the UK at risk.
Across the country, more than 2,000 staff will lose their jobs.
Mr Hedley said: "The depots in Wales are relatively small.
"At the very most they'll keep 10 people across the three sites."
Talks between the RMT and administrators Ernst and Young were held on Saturday afternoon.
The administrators warned of "substantial redundancies over the coming days".
Coventry-based City Link called in Ernst and Young on Christmas Eve after years of "substantial losses".
Following Saturday's talks, the RMT demanded an immediate meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable and called on the UK government to launch a rescue plan to save the company as a going concern.
Mick Cash, RMT general secretary, called the situation a "despicable and callous manipulation" of thousands of workers.
Ernst and Young said it was currently assessing the company and the status of existing orders.
"This process will have a bearing on the number of employees retained and those that unfortunately face redundancy in the next few days," it said in a statement.
"It is anticipated that there will be substantial redundancies over the coming days, at which point the administrators will provide a further update."
It said it anticipated "a portion of employees" would be retained for up to three months.
