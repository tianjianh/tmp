Rochdale 2-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Henderson's brace kept alive Rochdale's slim League One play-off hopes as already-relegated Coventry were beaten at Spotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dale's win - combined with Millwall and Southend losing - saw Keith Hill's side close the gap to three points between themselves and the top six.
The home side took the lead after 18 minutes with a terrific breakaway goal.
Jamie Allen and Joe Rafferty combined on the edge of the Dale area to free Nathaniel Mendez-Laing up the right flank. He outpaced Chris Stokes before dinking an inviting cross to the back post for Henderson to head past Lee Burge.
A similar break down the right channel saw Henderson return the favour, his delivery sitting up just as Mendez-Laing was poised to fire at goal and the chance slipped by.
The second goal arrived in the 52nd minute, Mendez-Laing slipping a neat pass down the middle for Henderson and he wrong-footed Burge with a clever first-time finish.
Coventry's misery was compounded when Ben Stevenson was stretchered off wearing a neck brace late on following an innocuous clash.
