Rotherham abuse: Ofsted changes procedures after MPs' criticism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A government watchdog said it had improved its inspections after failing to detect child sexual abuse in Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ofsted was responding to criticisms made by a Parliamentary committee of MPs in March.
A report by the Communities and Local Government Committee said inspections had been "ineffective".
Ofsted said it had strengthened its ability to "effectively uncover where children are at risk".
Committee members found that Ofsted "relied on the appearance of, and the paperwork describing, Rotherham's system, rather than the actuality" and that its inspections were "too short and narrowly focused."
Inspectors were also criticised because they did not probe beyond "what the officers at Rotherham told it."
In its response, Ofsted said that it had "learned lessons in the wake of Rotherham" and now spent more time directly speaking to children and their families.
It also acknowledged "that testimony from one source is not sufficient for its inspectors to assess children's experiences".
Ofsted said it had improved its use of intelligence to prioritise which local authorities needed inspecting and had made its ratings system much clearer.
