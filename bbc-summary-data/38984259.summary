Robson joined the Saints as commercial director in 2000, before being promoted to chief executive in 2006.
Saints have posted profits for the past 16 years, winning the Premiership and two European Challenge Cup titles in Robson's time as chief executive.
"I want to retire whilst I am still young enough to enjoy it," he said.
"You have to be 100% committed to what is an all-consuming job and I now feel that the time is right to hand over the reins to a new chief executive, who can build on what we have achieved."
