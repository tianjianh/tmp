Nathan Priestley set up an online fundraising page for the Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba workers after 90% of guests left after Friday's massacre.
"They were incredibly heroic," said Mr Priestley, 21, of Norwich, who fears the workers' jobs are under threat.
The 30 British victims out of the 38 killed have now been identified.
Gym instructor Mr Priestley was on a day trip at the time of the beachfront assault by gunman Seifeddine Rezgui.
He said the scene when he returned was "absolute carnage".
"Walking back into the hotel, I still have images of the blood and body bags... and where they were taking them out to hospital," he said.
The fundraiser was launched on Tuesday to help the staff at the Rui Imperial Marhaba and the neighbouring Hotel Rui Bellevue Park.
"One had to run and cover up dead bodies so the fleeing children wouldn't see them on their return to the hotel," said Mr Priestley.
"Our head waiter was absolutely distraught - he was hugging everyone and crying and saying he was so sorry."
Mr Priestley, who will fly back on Thursday night after his seven-day stay, initially wanted to raise £1,000 to give to the workers.
"Many of them have been told not to come into work because there are barely any guests left," said Mr Priestly.
"The staff are overwhelmed from the support and cannot thank us enough."
