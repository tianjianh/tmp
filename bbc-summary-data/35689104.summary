Iranian billionaire Moshiri, 60, has bought a 49.9% stake in the Toffees.
Martinez says his aims as Everton boss have always been to qualify for the Champions League and win silverware.
"With a new investor and fresh blood into our club, all of a sudden you have a new opportunity to get to those aspirations quicker," he said.
"The chairman and myself will embrace that pressure and that need of delivering the right outcome as we have a strong belief in what we are doing."
Martinez said Moshiri's investment was a "big moment in the club's history".
He added: "Farhad Moshiri will bring us a different dimension. The vision he is sharing will take Everton to the next level - and every single department will be assessed."
Everton are 12th in the Premier League and through to the FA Cup quarter-finals, where they will host Chelsea on Saturday, 12 March.
They lost to eventual winners Manchester City in the League Cup semi-finals.
Moshiri, who sold his stake in Arsenal to business partner Alisher Usmanov so he could buy into Everton, has a net worth estimated at Â£1.3bn.
"I met Moshiri and the impression I got was of a gentlemen with values who knows the Premier League inside out," said Martinez.
"You can get businessmen who don't understand it but this is not the case. I think he has fallen in love with what Everton means.
"This is the start of a new era with an incredible drive. As a human being and as a winner, Moshiri is the perfect person to come into Everton."
