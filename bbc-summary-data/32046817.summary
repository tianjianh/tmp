Plymouth slavery trial: Workers 'forced to live under stairs'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vulnerable eastern Europeans were trafficked to Plymouth and ordered to live under the stairs "like some grotesque Harry Potter concept", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victims, mainly from the Czech Republic, were brought to the UK and forced into compulsory labour by a gang of five based in the city.
Plymouth Crown Court was told they had to sleep on the floor or in a garage, urinate in bottles and eat outside.
The defendants deny all charges.
Malcolm Galloway, prosecuting, said the victims were used as house servants, cleaning the house, car and cutting the lawn.
The defendants are:
Police originally arrested eight people in September but the prosecution offered no evidence for the other three - Lenka Cmejlova, 32, of Union Street, Plymouth, Jiri Sebelik, 37, of Union Street, Plymouth and Sandra Tancosova, 25, of Flora Court, Plymouth - and not guilty verdicts were offered.
Mr Galloway said the defendants would use threats of violence of "a few slaps" if they did not do what they were told, or a "punch to the face" if they were being rude.
He said the victims "would have to sleep on the floor or in a garage, urinate in bottles and eat outside".
The trial continues.
