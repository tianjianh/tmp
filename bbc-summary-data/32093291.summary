The former England and Great Britain international, 37, had already stated his intention to quit playing at the end of the 2015 Super League campaign.
"I have had a great time at Leeds and learnt so much about how the club is run from top to bottom," Peacock said.
"Hull KR are a club with huge potential in a city that is rugby league mad."
He added: "Now that I have the next chapter of my career finalised, I am fully focused on finishing my time with Leeds as strongly as possible and leaving my home town club in the best possible position."
Going into this weekend's Super League fixtures, Leeds were second in the table with Hull KR 11th.
Peacock has won numerous honours at club level with Bradford Bulls and Leeds, including eight Super League titles and three Challenge Cups.
Named Super League's Man of Steel in 2003, Peacock played 21 times for England and earned a further 26 caps for Great Britain.
