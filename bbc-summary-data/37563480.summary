Reial Phillips, linked to Birmingham's Burger Bar gang, was "at the heart" of the shootings, targeting rival members of the Johnson Crew, police said.
At Birmingham Crown Court he admitted firearms offences and conspiring to sell cocaine and heroin.
Police said his actions "brought fear" to people in the West Midlands.
Ashai Gray, 22, from Tanacetum Drive in Walsall, also admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin and was sentenced to nine years in jail.

Both men were among 18 the BBC named in March when they were banned from parts of Birmingham for what police then said were their links to "gun or gang crime".
West Midlands Police said 20-year-old Phillips, of Musgrave Road, Winson Green, and Gray were believed to be the "armed response" faction of the Burger Bar gang.
The shootings occurred over several months last year and escalated when members of the rivals groups uploaded rap videos online to taunt one another, the spokesman said.
Det Supt Mark Payne said: "For a period of time last year these men and their associates brought fear to the people of the West Midlands through their actions."
The two gangs took their names from two cafes in Handsworth where black youths congregated in the late 80s and early 90s.
