[SN]TITLE[SN]
Further checks for contamination at former Nairn quarry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Further investigations are to be carried out at a former quarry to check for potential harmful contamination.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Kingsteps Quarry at Nairn has already been examined for the remains of aircraft instruments which were illuminated using radioactive paint.
Highland Council ordered the survey following "word of mouth" suggestions that planes were buried at the site after World War Two.
No evidence of such radioactive contamination was found at the quarry.
Highland Council has asked contractors to check for other forms of contamination by making a series of excavations next month.
The site was formerly a sand and gravel quarry and later used as an unofficial local dump. There are informal paths on the site used by local people for dog walking.
A report on December's investigations will be given to councillors in March.
