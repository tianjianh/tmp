'Recruit women spies from Mumsnet' say senior politicians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forget James Bond, when it comes to recruiting spies needed to protect Britain there aren't enough Jane Bonds.

That's according to a new report by a senior group of MPs.
Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee said recruiters should try websites like Mumsnet to help increase the proportion of female spies.
It wants more of them working in places like MI5, MI6 and communications spy centre GCHQ.
The report says women in the intelligence services are being held back by a layer of male, middle managers labelled "the permafrost" who have a "very traditional male mentality and outlook".
Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts responded to the call for recruiters to use things like her website but we're thinking she wasn't being entirely serious.
"I'm afraid I'm unable to comment as I have an urgent appointment with a rock in St. James's Park."
While the report showed 37% of staff at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are women, it also pointed out they make up less than one in five senior staff.
However, things have been changing in recent years.
Stella Rimington became the first female boss of MI5 in 1992.
That was three years before actress Judi Dench took over as James Bond's boss, M, in the British film franchise.
In response to the report the government said: "We are committed to ensuring the most talented people succeed and reach top positions, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability."
