Rob Evans: Wales and Scarlets prop out with wrist injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets and Wales prop Rob Evans will miss the start of the 2016-17 season because of a wrist injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans has had surgery to repair a tendon in his wrist and could be sidelined until November.
The 24-year-old's most recent appearance was Wales' 46-6 defeat by New Zealand in the third Test in June.
"I don't think we will see Rob until near the autumn internationals," Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac told the South Wales Evening Post.
"He suffered the injury during the Six Nations and carried it through for the rest of the season."
