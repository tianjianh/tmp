[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth 1-0 Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton lost in the league for the first time under Ronald Koeman as Junior Stanislas' superb shot gave Bournemouth a deserved victory.

Jack Wilshere hit the crossbar with a deflected shot before Stanislas' 25-yard drive flew into the top corner.
Harry Arter and Callum Wilson also went close as the Cherries won for the second time in the league this season.
Romelu Lukaku's early header was brilliantly saved by Artur Boruc but Everton rarely threatened.
This match produced a 3-3 thriller last season with four late goals and a 98th-minute equaliser from Stanislas, who proved Everton's undoing again.
The 26-year-old's shot gave Toffees goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg no chance and was the least the Cherries deserved as they dominated throughout.
The best chances came early in the game this time, with Wilshere very close to his first Bournemouth goal as Everton right-back Seamus Coleman dived across to divert his shot on to the bar.
Cherries boss Eddie Howe said before the game his side needed to find the "determination" they showed in last season's fixture if they want to stay up, and his players certainly heeded his words as they climbed to 13th in the table.
Everton have been revitalised under Koeman and came into this game second in the table following four wins and a draw from their first five league games.
However, the Toffees were outplayed in every department as Bournemouth hustled and harried them and prevented Koeman's men from showing any fluency.
Lukaku's downward header from a Ross Barkley free-kick was the closest they came, while the midfielder was off target with a header of his own.
With left-back Leighton Baines missing with a hamstring injury, this was Everton's second successive defeat after the EFL Cup loss at home to Norwich.
They slipped to fifth in the table after Arsenal beat Chelsea 3-0.

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: "To a man, we were absolutely brilliant.
"It was an outstanding performance against a very good team. You need a result like this and a performance like this to really get the belief into the players.
"In this league, every week is extremely tough but if we can match that performance each week, we'll do well."

Everton boss Ronald Koeman: "Bournemouth were the better team, the more aggressive team, and that was the problem in the first half.
"You can't win if you play like we did in the first half. We lost every second ball, we lost every battle.
"But we know we will not win every game. Bournemouth are really a good team, they will not fight against relegation."
Bournemouth travel to Watford in their next Premier League game on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Everton host Crystal Palace on Friday at 20:00.
