[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Navidi has has signed a new contract with Blues that will keep him at Cardiff Arms Park until at least 2019.
The 24-year-old Wales flanker has been Blues' player of the year for the last two seasons and is glad to be staying at the region.
"I had offers from elsewhere but it was a good offer from the Blues," Navidi said.
"They've been a good club to me and another three years with Danny [Wilson, head coach] coming in as well, a lot's going to change."
Navidi made his senior Blues debut in 2009 against Leinster and is closing in on a century of appearances for the Welsh region.
The Bridgend-born forward captained Wales at Under-20 level and made his senior international debut in 2013 against Japan in Tokyo.
He was overlooked for Wales' World Cup training squad but is pleased to have resolved his Blues future ahead of the new Pro12 season.
"I'm delighted to get it done and dusted so early in the season with another year left on my other contract," Navidi added.
"I can just concentrate on my game now."
Blues begin their 2015-16 Pro12 campaign on home soil against Zebre on 6 September.
