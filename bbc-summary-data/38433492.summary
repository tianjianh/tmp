[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-3 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Omar Bogle bagged a brace and provided an assist as Grimsby ended Carlisle's unbeaten home record in League Two with a 3-1 win at Brunton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carlisle led at the interval through a Charlie Wyke goal, his 16th of the campaign, but Bogle's double made it 18 league goals for the season and the striker also helped lay on a debut strike for substitute Adi Yussuf.
It took Carlisle until the 28th minute to find a shot on target, Shaun Miller forcing an alert save from Dean Henderson at the near post.
The home side then made the breakthrough in the 31st minute, Miller sliding the ball through to Wyke who kept his cool as he beat the advancing goalkeeper.
Minutes later the same combination almost produced a second goal, Miller picking out Wyke at the far post only to see Henderson get his fingertips to the ball and turn the header over the bar.
Grimsby missed a clear chance to level just before the break when Andrew Boyce met a Danny Andrew cross at the far post but contrived to send his close-range header wide.
Carlisle were caught napping three minutes after the restart when Bogle muscled his way through and kept his composure to squeeze the ball past Mark Gillespie from a tight angle.
Bogle was proving a handful for the Carlisle defence and he was on target again in the 74th minute, rising to meet Andrew's corner from the right and plant a header into the bottom corner.
Debutant Yussuf came on as a substitute and made it 3-1 to the Mariners in the 78th minute. The ex-Mansfield forward latched on to Bogle's backheeled pass and picked his spot calmly, beating Gillespie low down from 10 yards.
Jabo Ibehre missed a sitter and Jamie Devitt hit the post as Carlisle tried in vain to rescue the situation late on.
