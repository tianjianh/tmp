Rubbish sent to landfill on South Tyneside has been reduced by two thirds, the council has said.

Of 77,000 tonnes of municipal waste and 67,000 tonnes of household waste collected yearly, the amount sent to landfill has gone down from 66% to 3%.
Non-recyclable material has been sent to an energy-from-waste facility on Teesside, South Tyneside Council said.
Area management lead member Tracey Dixon said it was "a significant achievement".
"We are delighted that the amount of waste sent to landfill has been reduced so dramatically and that we are seeing more and more recyclables collected from the doorstep across South Tyneside," she said.
In 2010, South Tyneside, Gateshead and Sunderland councils were awarded government funding of Â£73.5m to develop the waste treatment plant on Teesside.
At the time it was anticipated the plant would save more than Â£300m over 25 years compared with the cost of sending waste to landfill sites.
The waste treated on Teesside would be converted into enough energy to power more than 30,000 homes, Ms Dixon said.
