A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a father-of-two found dying in a Fife street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Adie, 42, died after being found injured on Tweed Avenue in Kirkcaldy at about 18:45 on 28 May.
Gordon Coventry, 51, from Kirkcaldy, is accused of killing him.
Facing a single charge of murder on petition at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court, Mr Coventry made no plea or declaration during a brief private appearance. He was remanded in custody.
The case was continued for further examination.
Mr Coventry is expected to appear in court again next week.
His arrest on Thursday came just two days after Mr Adie's parents made an emotional appeal to catch his killer.
At a press conference on Tuesday, his father John, 68, said: "He will never see his kids grow up.
"Our family have lost a son, a brother, a nephew and an uncle. Darren's kids, a son aged seven and a daughter aged nine, have lost a father.
"We want to bury our son and we can't do that until Darren's killer has been arrested."
Police earlier said 60 detectives were working on the case and that officers had carried out door-to-door inquiries at more than 700 addresses.
