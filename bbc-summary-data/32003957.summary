About 100 people took part in the protest by National Action on the city's Quayside, Northumbria Police said.
A counter-demonstration of about 70 people was also held.
Assistant Chief Constable Winton Keenen said the force would not "tolerate people engaging in behaviour that could negatively impact on our communities".
The event was mostly peaceful but a number of arrests were made for public order offences including inciting racial hatred, the force said.
Last month the first rally by the British branch of German "anti-Islamisation" group Pegida was held in the city.
