'Jihadi John' movements mapped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The masked Islamic State militant known as "Jihadi John" has been named as Mohammed Emwazi - a Kuwaiti-born British man in his mid-20s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emwazi, from west London, made a number of journeys abroad before heading to Syria in 2013, according to London-based human rights group Cage.
He came into contact with security services on those travels, the organisation said, beginning with a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 - just after graduating from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi first appeared in an Islamic State video last August, when he apparently killed the US journalist James Foley.
He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.
