Trial of former Fort Augustus Abbey priest adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a former priest accused of assaulting eight boys while teaching at Fort Augustus Abbey School has been adjourned until next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Father Benedict Seed, 83, denies the charges, which include striking pupils aged between 11 and 18 with a cane and a spiked golf in the 1970s and 80s.
A trial date has been fixed for 23 January for further investigations.
It also allows time to arrange for one witness to give evidence via a video link from Hong Kong.
Appearing at Inverness Sheriff Court under the name Thomas Seed, the former priest had his bail conditions continued.
