A police spokesperson told the BBC they had received a "disturbance call" on Monday afternoon, but did not name the singer.
The disturbance was later deemed a medical incident, he said, and the fire department responded.
A spokesman for the LA Fire Department said an unnamed man had been taken to hospital for "further assessment".
"At 13:20 Pacific Time, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to an unspecified medical aid request," a spokesperson for the service said.
"An adult male described as medically stable was taken to an area hospital for further assessment."
West's wife Kim Kardashian West was photographed getting off a private jet at Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles a few hours after he was taken to hospital.
Further details of the incident naming West varied in conflicting reports from multiple news sources.
NBC News said officers had been responding to a "medical welfare call" and the decision to hospitalise West was for his own health and safety, citing "multiple authorities familiar with the case".
Gossip website TMZ said that West was taken to hospital for "psychiatric evaluation" and had been seeking treatment for "severe sleep deprivation".
The Los Angeles Times reported that there had been a 911 call from the address, citing a fire department source.
Neither West nor his representatives have made an official statement about the incident.
Before news broke of West's hospital treatment, Kardashian West's mother, Kris Jenner, spoke to US media about the rapper's reasons for cancelling his shows.
"He's exhausted, he's just really tired. He's had a gruelling tour and it's been a grind so he just needs some rest," she told US TV show Extra.
Some celebrities took to social media to voice their concern and offer well wishes to West.
Rapper 9th Wonder tweeted: "Been knowing the brother upwards of 13 years. Mental healing is a serious thing, no matter what. Stay strong Kanye West."
US actor and comedian Ronald Funches wrote: "I wish Kanye West love and support through his journey. Mental health is no joke and a constant battle and I hope he makes more dope music."
Chance The Rapper, who was performing in BBC Radio 1Xtra's Live Lounge on Tuesday, began a song by saying: "I want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother Kanye West."
Kardashian West was expected to appear at a New York City social event on Monday - her first public appearance since she was robbed in Paris in October - but she did not attend.
The rapper had cancelled all remaining dates on his current tour after abandoning a Sacramento performance at the weekend.
He had performed just three songs on Saturday night, before embarking on an unscripted rant, criticising Facebook, Jay Z and Hillary Clinton.
He criticised Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg for failing to give him $53m (Â£42.5m) to get out of debt and said he was hurt that Jay Z failed to visit his family after last month's robbery.
West then appeared to suggest that Jay Z employed hit men, saying: "Jay Z, I know you got killers, please don't send them at my head."
"Get ready to have a field day, press, because the show's over," he said, as he dropped his microphone and walked out.
His promoter, Live Nation, has announced refunds for all tickets from the show.
No reason has been given for the cancellation of the remaining dates.
