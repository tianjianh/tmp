Many of the 260,000 population were left homeless after winds reaching 185mph (300km/h) ravaged the island nation last month.
The International Development Committee (IDC) will donate £25,000 to UNICEF and £10,000 to Oxfam.
During the category five cyclone, 96% of food crops were destroyed.
The Committee is also donating £20,000 to the charity HelpAge International for their work with Sudanese refugees in Uganda.
A spokesman said the money will be used to provide shelter, warm clothes and bedding for older people and those with special needs in Uganda.
More than 639,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda following civil unrest in South Sudan.
