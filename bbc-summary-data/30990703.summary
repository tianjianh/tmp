[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A kidnap gang who cut off a man's finger to get a £20,000 ransom have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim, 26, was kidnapped at gunpoint and taken to a garage, where he was bound, gagged and beaten.
Five of the 10-man gang received life sentences for charges including kidnapping, false imprisonment, blackmail and GBH at Warwick Crown Court.
Police said the victim's family had been "distraught".
West Midlands Police said the man, from Coventry, was abducted in Milverton Road, Woodend, in September and taken to a lock-up garage. He was left in a van, bound and gagged without food or water, and beaten with a metal bar.
The gang demanded a £20,000 ransom from his family but, when they felt his relatives had not responded quickly enough, the victim's little finger was cut off and left under a brick on a garden wall.
After the family paid the ransom, the victim was thrown out of the back of the van in McDonnell Drive, Coventry.
The money was recovered after police raided a house in Dovedale Avenue, Longford.
Three of the defendants - Ralph McLeod, Lewis Poyser and Yusuf Akbar - were found guilty of false imprisonment, blackmail and grievous bodily harm.
Seven other men had pleaded guilty to charges including kidnapping, blackmail, false imprisonment, and grievous bodily harm.
Det Ch Insp Simon Wallis said: "The family were understandably distraught at the thought of what else could happen to their loved one."
Four of the defendants, Anthony McLeod, Kofi Poyser, Lewis Poyser and Lamar Grant, were also sentenced for their part in an assault on a man outside a Coventry nightclub in June.
