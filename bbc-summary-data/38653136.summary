[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flood damaged Elland Bridge reopened to pedestrians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bridge severely damaged by flooding has reopened to pedestrians, more than a year after it was closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elland Bridge, in West Yorkshire, had to be rebuilt at a cost of Â£5m after it partially collapsed during the 2015 Boxing Day floods.
It was reopened to walkers and cyclists on Tuesday. Vehicles are expected to have access later this month.
A temporary footbridge across the Calder and Hebble Navigation was installed while the work was completed.
Joanne Wood, who runs a nursery in Elland, was among the first people to cross the restored bridge.
"It's a fantastic day. We've been waiting for this for just over a year now," she said.
"This is a bridge that is used by so many people and we you do not realise how much you use it until it's not there."
