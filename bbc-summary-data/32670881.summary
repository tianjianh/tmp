[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City will need to beat Manchester United on the final day of the season to have any chance of survival, after losing to Tottenham.

The Tigers are two points adrift of safety with one game remaining.
Goals from Nacer Chadli, latching on to Erik Lamela's through ball, and a Danny Rose effort from Ryan Mason's superb pass were enough for Spurs.
Abel Hernandez and Dame N'Doye failed to finish a goal-mouth scramble that might have given the Tigers hope.

But it turned out to be a limp finish from Steve Bruce's men after a difficult and emotional few days for the club.
Hull were without midfielder Jake Livermore, a former Spurs player, after he was suspended on Friday for testing positive for cocaine, a situation Bruce described as the most difficult in his managerial career.
The Tigers, who were preparing for their first ever FA Cup final almost a year ago to the day, can still secure a third consecutive season in the top flight.
But it will need Newcastle United to fail to beat West Ham next weekend or Sunderland to lose at Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as a victory for Bruce's side at home to United.
Hull were bright in the first half at White Hart Lane, creating chances for the returning Nikica Jelavic, who struck a half-volley against the top of the bar.
But sixth-placed Spurs recovered from a sluggish opening period to put a run of one win in six behind them, and lay a claim to a Europa League spot.
Lamela made the first after 54 minutes, disguising a pass through the middle of the Hull back line and allowing Chadli to round Steve Harper and finish.
And while Mauricio Pochettino's men were not at their free-flowing best, Mason showed a touch of quality with a delicate chip over the visitors' defence that Rose caught first time to send in off the crossbar.
Hull wilted as the game drew on and they will need a final-day-of-the-season victory if they are to pull off survival.
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: "The first half was not easy because Hull are playing to survive.

"We're still in the fight to finish fifth. The fans needed that - it was a tough season for them too.
"I want to play in Europe next season - we need to win our one more game to be sure of getting in the Europa League and that is very important."
Hull boss Steve Bruce: "You can't come to Tottenham and create five or six good chances and not take one. We've switched off at the back and they have taken their chances.
"We have to believe we can beat Manchester United next week.
"Six or seven of the players got me into the league a few years ago. They have big hearts. We've missed some of those big players during this season.
"We have a chance. Is there one final twist? Can we upset the apple cart? Let's hope we can do it."
