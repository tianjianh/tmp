Prince Edward installed as University of Bath chancellor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, has been installed as the chancellor of the University of Bath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The prince took part in a ceremony at Bath Abbey which was attended by over 240 dignitaries and university staff.
In his speech, he said that he did not feel "either senior or distinguished enough" for the role but that he was "very excited".
One of his first acts was to present Paralympic gold medal-winning swimmer Ellie Simmonds with an honorary degree.
Vice chancellor Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell said it was "a tremendously exciting day for the university and the city of Bath".
"We know that he is the man for the job," she said.
"I think he will bring connectivity [and] influence. He will also bring a great deal of wisdom."
