Edrington Group wants to expand production and warehousing at its Macallan distillery near Craigellachie, as well as creating a new visitor centre.
Moray Council's planning committee  unanimously approved the plans.
Work on the project is expected to start later this year, with completion due in 2017.
When the plans were announced, Edrington chief executive Ian Curle said they were a "confident investment in the future of The Macallan and its home on Speyside".
The Glasgow-based whisky and rum distiller, which also produces Famous Grouse whisky, announced increased profits and turnover last summer.
