French national Jimmy Sainte, 29, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria, attacked the girl at a flat in Glasgow between November 2007 and June 2009.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the abuse only came to light when the girl told a friend.
Sentence on Sainte was deferred. He was placed on the sex offenders register.
Judge Lady Wolffe told him: "This is clearly a very serious and anxious matter."
The court heard how Sainte raped the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, while babysitting.
The offences were carried out a flat in Charing Cross, Glasgow.
His young victim, who is now 13, told a friend about the abuse while she and her friends were playing "telling secrets".
One of her friends told her mother, who told a teacher, who in turn told the school's head teacher. The police were then called in.
The young victim's mother told the court that when she phoned Sainte and told him about the accusation, he admitted raping the girl.
The woman said: "He told me it was the work of the devil."
In her evidence, the young girl said: "He raped me up to twice a week for about a year."
She said she was too scared to tell any adults about the abuse.
