It follows the 19-year-old's PFA Scotland young player award and is the second time in succession he has been chosen by the writers.
"I'm actually surprised," said the Scotland international. "Because it doesn't usually go to someone who's had two or three months out injured.
"I've still played nearly 40 games."
Tierney has helped Celtic retain the Scottish Premiership title, lift the League Cup and reach the Scottish Cup final on 27 May.
"It wouldn't have been possible without the help of my team-mates, all the staff at the club and the supporters," he said of his latest award.
"There's a cabinet I've got for medals and trophies in my house. It's getting full, but I hope I can keep filling it."
