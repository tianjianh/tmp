Welsh Labour to launch council election campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones has promised "a fair deal" to Welsh communities as his party's election campaign gets underway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Welsh Labour is launching its council election campaign in Newport on Monday.
Mr Jones said Labour set the bar "exceptionally high" in the 2012 elections - when it gained 231 seats - but he claimed it was beginning the campaign from a "position of strength".
His party is defending 580 seats in Wales.
The launch comes after the Welsh Labour leader said it would be "tough" for the party to avoid losses.
It had celebrated its best local election results in 16 years in 2012. Labour is defending overall control of 10 authorities.
Mr Jones said: "The elections in May will see a record number of Welsh Labour candidates standing across Wales.
"Our results in 2012 set the bar exceptionally high but we begin this campaign from a position of strength."
Mr Jones said Labour councils had "built new council homes... helped to deliver the best GCSE and A Level results ever, supported small business and led ambitious regeneration programmes in towns and cities all over the country".
