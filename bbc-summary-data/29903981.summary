Twenty-three moulds that have been decorated by artists are being sold on behalf of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, with bidding starting at Â£50 each.
Kerry Farrant, who has taken part, had surgery after her left breast was removed while she was pregnant.
"I wanted to share my breast cast with everyone to show that you can still look normal," she said.
The fundraiser was the brainchild of Keri Bird, who makes plaster casts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
Deborah Blumfield had the plaster cast made after having a mastectomy in 2006.
"Having breast cancer is a life-changing journey and I wanted to share a very positive outcome," she said.
Nicola Daykin said her family had been affected by breast cancer and she wanted to raise money and awareness for research.
"I have witnessed the devastation that a diagnosis, treatment and unfortunately loss that breast cancer had in a close friend and their family and, if I am honest, it strikes fear into me," she said.
Sue Smith, from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, also had a plaster cast made and said the project was an "amazing" way of raising awareness.
"Having my breasts cast and put on display for all the world to see is the least I can do," she said.
Artist Stefan Marner said the project covered an "extremely delicate issue" and the aim of his monster-themed design was to "lift the spirits".
"It's not every day you see monsters with their willies out hugging monster boobs," he said.
The auction ends on 16 November.
