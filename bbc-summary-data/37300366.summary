Vuelta a Espana: Chris Froome trails Nairo Quintana as Mathias Frank wins stage 17

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome made no ground on Vuelta a Espana leader Nairo Quintana as Mathias Frank won stage 17.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Team Sky's Froome remains three minutes 37 seconds behind Colombian Quintana after they finished together.
Swiss Frank, riding for IAM Cycling, won the 177.5km stage from Castellon to Llucena in four hours 34 minutes and 38 seconds.
Froome is bidding to become the first man for 38 years to win the Tour de France and Vuelta in the same season.
The top four in the general classification - Quintana, Froome, Esteban Chaves and Alberto Contador - crossed the line together three minutes 27 seconds behind breakaway rider Frank.
Froome's rivals attacked in the closing stages of the steep finish to the summit of the Alto Mas de la Costa, but he twice clawed back lost ground.
Team-mate Leopold Koenig finished second, six seconds behind Frank, and Robert Gesink third, a further five seconds adrift.
Four stages remain in the third and final Grand Tour of the season, with Thursday's flatter 200.6km stage from Requena to Gandia expected to suit the sprinters.
Froome's hopes of a first Vuelta victory appear to rest largely on his gaining time in the 37km individual time trial on Friday.
