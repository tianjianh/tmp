Airdrieonians have appointed Danny Lennon as acting head coach while his close friend Eddie Wolecki-Black recovers from a stroke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former St Mirren boss has been put in charge until the end of the season.
Wolecki-Black, 50, became ill during the half-time break of the Diamonds' victory at Cowdenbeath on Saturday.
The League One side have opted for an experienced manager to help first-team coach Donald Jennow with their play-off push.
The club's chief executive Ian King has backed Wolecki-Black to return to the dugout.
Lennon's last managerial role was an eight-month stint in 2015 at Alloa, which followed four years at St Mirren.
