Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has praised the service of Andrew Surman, who has been ever-present in the club's first Premier League season.

Howe has labelled Surman's 36 league appearances this term "a huge achievement", with the 29-year-old playing every minute of the campaign.
"I think he has been a real model of consistency," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "He's a great trainer.
"I thought he was good for us in the Championship last season as well."
Howe added: "He has been even better this season. He's a dream to work with and his performances have been nothing short of outstanding.
"He has earned the right to be first choice and the way he conducts himself and understands what we're trying to do is key.
"Full credit to him for that and hopefully there's more to come."
Surman, 29, is expected to take his place in the Bournemouth line-up for their final home game against West Brom on Saturday, but defender Adam Smith will not feature again this season.
A hernia sustained against Manchester City last month has ruled the 25-year-old out, although forward Max Gradel is set to return.
