[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 4-3 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sub Ryan Hedges scored an injury-time winner as Barnsley saw off Morecambe in the EFL Cup at rainswept Oakwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Bradshaw gave the Tykes an early lead and Mitchell Lund deflected a cross into his own net to make it two.
Sam Lavelle and Bradshaw exchanged goals either side of the break before Michael Rose scored the League Two side's second from the spot.
Vadaine Oliver looked to have taken the tie to extra time but Hedges curled home to send Barnsley through.
Having lost to Bristol City on the opening day of the Championship campaign, when Hedges scored their consolation goal in a 3-1 defeat, Barnsley dominated possession in the first half.
But Lavelle's goal from a corner put heart into Morecambe. After Oliver was fouled to enable Rose to score their second, they appeared to have earned an extra half-hour thanks to the former's header when Hedges struck in the fifth minute of added time.
