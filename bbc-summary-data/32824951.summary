[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cyril Smith police cite security clause over M1 probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force says laws relating to the security services prevent it from divulging information it holds on Cyril Smith.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the Liberal MP, who died in 2010, was stopped on the M1 in Northamptonshire during the 1980s.
A cold case unit is investigating claims he was released after images of child abuse were found in his car boot.
He was released after making a telephone call to an unidentified third party in London, it has been claimed.
Smith was the Liberal, then Liberal Democrat, MP for Rochdale, from 1972 to 1992.
So far, seven men have come forward to Greater Manchester Police saying they were abused by Smith, whose family maintains he had always denied claims of abuse.
Labour MP Simon Danczuk first made the claim about the M1 arrest in his book about Smith, published last year.
He alleged Smith was stopped on suspicion of a driving offence, but quickly released after he made the phone call.
Despite being taken into the police station, the material said to have been found in his boot disappeared, Mr Danczuk said.
A Freedom of Information Act request from the BBC asked Northamptonshire Police for "any information held by the constabulary relating to the arrest on the M1 during the 1980s" of Cyril Smith.
The constabulary said that other than a press release from March, it could "neither confirm nor deny that it holds any other information" relating to the case.
In doing so the force cited Section 23(5) of the act which concerns "information supplied by or concerning certain security bodies".
The force did not specify which branch of the security services it is referring to.
It also cited a number of other exemptions under the act, including those relating to law enforcement, personal information and investigations.
Ivan Balhatchet, assistant chief constable, said the force was committed to "complete and utter transparency" and said leads from Mr Danczuk were being "followed up".
