The Â£3,000 prize has been awarded to Ruth Bidgood for her latest collection of poetry, Time Being.
Ms Bidgood, 88, who lives near Llanwrtyd Wells, has been publishing poetry more than five decades.
The Roland Mathias Prize has been awarded biennially in the fields of poetry, short stories, literary criticism and Welsh history.
In future years, it is to be incorporated into the Wales Book of the Year.
The chair of the judging panel, Glyn Mathias said: "We felt this was the crowning collection of her long career.
"It is so evocative of place and time, and she packs such an emotional punch. The quality of writing is sustained throughout, and yet she makes it look so easy."
Ms Bidgood was awarded the prize during a ceremony in Roland Mathias' home town of Brecon, supported by BBC Wales and hosted by Nicola Heywood Thomas, presenter of Radio Wales' Arts Show.
The Roland Mathias Prize was established in honour of the poet and author who died in 2007.
