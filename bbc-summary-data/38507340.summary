Peterborough DC's 'misconduct' to be heard in private

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The misconduct hearing of a detective accused of failing to declare a relationship with a "criminally convicted person" will be heard in private, a panel has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case against Det Con Nina Bartlett, based at Peterborough, had been due to be held in public.
But a panel on Wednesday decided for it to be heard behind closed doors due to concerns around "medical evidence".
Cambridgeshire Police has not stated the nature of the criminal conviction.
In a public notice, the force said DC Bartlett is accused of searching for her partner's details on the constabulary's computer system without a policing reason.
The detective also allegedly brought discredit upon the force.
Her alleged conduct had "compromised her position as a police officer" and served to "undermine public confidence in the police force", the notice said.
It was ruled for the case to be heard in private at City College Peterborough.
Chairman Peter Nicholls said: "The overriding concern is the physical and mental health of the officer impacting on the ability of the panel being able to do its job fairly to all parties wherever possible and to balance the interest of the public with that of the individuals concerned."
He added: "We would be unable to elicit the full information to do justice not only in the public interest but in fairness and justice to the officer.
"Therefore, balancing these two different factors we have reached the conclusion with some reluctance that these proceedings will proceed in private."
He said the outcome of the case will be made public in "due course".
