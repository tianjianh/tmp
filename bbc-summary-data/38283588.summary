The 27-year-old Armenian was fouled by Spurs right-back Danny Rose and after lengthy treatment was taken off on a stretcher in the 85th minute.
United manager Jose Mourinho said it was not a serious injury.
"It looks like next match not, but not needing surgery. Hopefully we have him for Boxing Day," Mourinho told MUTV.
Mourinho was initially "afraid the injury was serious" but said he would be without him for a maximum of "a couple of weeks".
He will miss Wednesday's trip to Crystal Palace and Saturday's match at West Bromwich Albion but should be back for the Premier League match at home to Sunderland on 26 December.

Mkhitaryan's winner against Tottenham was his first Premier League goal for United and his first at Old Trafford.
It came on the back of his first for the club in last week's 2-0 win over Zorya Luhansk in the Europa League.
Mkhitaryan was signed for Â£26m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer but had been left out of United's first team until recently.
Mourinho urged more of United's squad to follow the example shown by the creative midfielder.
"He crossed the line to be a better player," Mourinho told Sky Sports "He crossed the line mentally, that others have to cross. I want more from some of my attacking players.
"For a player like him who spends time working and working it means a lot. Not just the way he's creating but his defensive participation in the team."

Mourinho said he wanted to "dedicate this victory to Marouane Fellaini" in his post-match interview.
The Belgium midfielder, who gave away a late penalty in the Red Devils' 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend, was jeered by some United fans while he warmed up as a substitute on the touchline at Old Trafford.
"I am dedicating the victory to Marouane because in the last match, it was him who was involved in the loss of two points," Mourinho said. "That's why I want to make it clear he's an important player for me."
Mourinho added that the Old Trafford crowd "can do what they want" and he "cannot complain because they are phenomenal with us".
