[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force criticised for not doing more to stop a porn-obsessed murderer is being investigated over its handling of another man who went on to kill.

West Mercia Police admitted failings over its previous dealings with Jamie Reynolds, who was later jailed for hanging 17-year-old Georgia Williams.
The force called in the police watchdog because Jason Conroy allegedly throttled a teacher in March 2013.
He was later jailed for strangling 18-year-old Melissa Mathieson in Bristol.
A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said: "We received a referral from West Mercia Police in January 2015.
"It concerned the police handling of allegations made against Jason Conroy in connection with an incident in Shropshire in March 2013.
"The IPCC investigation was paused due to the criminal prosecution of Mr Conroy but has now resumed following his convictions."
Reynolds, described in court as having morbid sexual fantasies, tried to strangle a girl in 2008, before going on to hang Georgia five years later.
The force and social services were criticised in a serious case review last week after it emerged they knew about the earlier attack.
A subsequent investigation resulted in misconduct meetings for four officers and a member of police staff.
Reynolds is now serving a rare whole-life term in prison after a judge said he had the potential to become a serial killer.
Conroy allegedly throttled a teacher at a school in Shropshire in March 2013, but it was not reported to police at the time.
A West Mercia Police spokesman said: "Police were made aware of the incident several months later as an officer attended the address for a separate matter."
It is understood the officer advised the victim no action could be taken as a time limit had passed.
Conroy, 18, strangled Melissa Mathieson last year at the Bristol centre where they both lived and was jailed for a minimum of 19 years.
His trial at Bristol Crown Court was told he had indicated as a child he wanted to have sex with a dead woman and he was described as having an "abnormal sexual drive".
