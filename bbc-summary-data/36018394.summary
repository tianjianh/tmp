Spanish police have arrested former top banker Mario Conde on suspicion of money laundering.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Media reports say Mr Conde, 67, and six other people were arrested over the charges, including his two children.
Mr Conde was previously jailed for embezzlement committed when he was chairman of the Banesto bank.
The latest charges relate to an alleged attempt to launder â‚¬13m (Â£10.4m; $14.8m) in Swiss accounts of money that he had embezzled from the bank.
Banesto had to be taken over in 1993 after an audit revealed a shortfall of billions of euros.
Mr Conde was sentenced to 20 years in jail in 2002 for embezzlement and fraud but was released on parole in 2005. That 36-month-long trial was the longest in Spanish history, according to El Pais newspaper.
