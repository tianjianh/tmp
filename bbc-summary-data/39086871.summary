[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took a 45th minute when John Baird was fouled on the edge of the area and Lewis Kidd curled home the free-kick into the bottom corner.
Falkirk made the points safe in the 79th minute.
Andy Dowie took out Nathan Austin inside the area and Craig Sibbald made no mistake from the penalty spot.
The Bairns had lost James Craigen to injury with only 20 minutes gone.
But his replacement, Fraser Aird, played a part in almost giving his side the lead as his corner was met by Luke Leahy, only for his header to be tipped over by Lee Robinson.
Luca Gasparotto and Baird both went close for Falkirk as the first half was drawing to a close but eventually made the breakthrough.
The Bairns move a point above Dundee United, although the Tannadice side have two games in hand, six points behind leaders Hibernian.
