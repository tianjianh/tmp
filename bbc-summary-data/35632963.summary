[SN]TITLE[SN]
Real Madrid 0-1 Atletico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid won a third consecutive La Liga Bernabeu derby to practically end Real Madrid's title hopes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Diego Simeone's visitors are now five points off leaders Barcelona, who have a game in hand, while Real are nine points below the champions.
Antoine Griezmann scored the only goal, early in the second half, when he steered Filipe Luis' pass home.
Real, who were two points off Barca when Zinedine Zidane took over, had not lost in his first eight games as boss.
The result means Atletico are the first side in La Liga history to win three times in a row at the Bernabeu, as Real fans called for club president Florentino Perez to resign.
Champions and leaders Barcelona, who are unbeaten in 33 games, host Sevilla - the last side to beat them - on Sunday (19:30 GMT).
