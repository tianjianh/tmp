Bogdan Nawrocki, 21, went missing from his Radford home in January 2014, prompting a major police appeal.
In February, Robert Marcinkiewicz-Szurkowski, 27, of Sneinton, was jailed for 27 years for killing Polish national Mr Nawrocki.
The 10-day blaze at the Player Street building is not connected to the murder inquiry, officers said.
Det Ch Insp Tony Heydon, who led the investigation, said: "We succeeded in seeing justice carried out for Bogdan but despite a vast amount of searches, we have been unable to give his family the opportunity to give him the funeral he deserves.
"We still have a Â£5,000 reward for information so if you know anything that could help, it's not too late."
Nottingham Crown Court heard traces of Mr Nawrocki's blood were found during a search of a property in Osborne Street that he shared with his killer.
He had been the victim of "a prolonged and violent attack" and his body taken away from the property.
Police have searched more than 40 sites, including previously at the former Player's cigarette factory, but Mr Nawrocki's body has never been located.
Det Ch Insp Heydon said they had received new information several weeks ago and had already planned the search when the fire took hold.
He said: "We have had to allow the fire service get on with their job and now that is completely out, we can access the site safely.
"The site is extensive and there are underground tunnels so there were safety issues for officers conducting the search."
The blaze broke out in part of the Player's building which was being renovated into student accommodation.
About half the structure had to be pulled down to allow crews to get to pockets of fire.
An investigation into how the fire started is currently under way.
