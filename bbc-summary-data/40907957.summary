[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 2-3 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers brushed aside their poor start in League One by cruising to an impressive 3-2 win at Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pirates were bottom after losing their first two games but Tom Lockyer headed them into a 55th-minute lead before Billy Bodin struck twice to secure their first points of the season.
Jermaine Beckford and Nicky Ajose scored consolations in stoppage time but the scoreline flattered a woeful Bury side.
Beckford and Harry Bunn tested Sam Slocombe in the first half but otherwise Rovers played some fine football, with Bodin firing wide as they racked up 26 shots.
Ellis Harrison and Tom Nichols were then denied by Bury keeper Joe Murphy before Chris Lines fired over.
Nichols and Ollie Clarke also went close before the break but 22-year-old centre-back Lockyer - in his 200th appearance for Rovers - then headed home from Lee Brown's corner.
The hosts offered little in reply and Bodin headed home from Joe Partington's 72nd-minute corner before poking in from close range after 86 minutes.
Beckford headed home from Tsun Dai's late corner while Ajose converted Greg Leigh's cross in stoppage time but Bury could not avoid a second straight defeat.
