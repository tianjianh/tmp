The gallery, which will host the Turner Prize in the city's 2017 City of Culture year, is being fitted with new lighting, humidity and temperature control systems.
The paintings and sculptures will be kept in a high-security storage facility until the gallery, which closed to the public in August, re-opens in early 2017.
