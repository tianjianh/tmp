Walters netted a hugely controversial 24th-minute penalty after Bosnia's Ervin Zukanovic was harshly adjudged to have handled a Daryl Murphy cross.
That put the Irish 2-1 up on aggregate and the win was all but secured when Walters volleyed in on 70 minutes.
The Republic join Northern Ireland, England and Wales in reaching France.
Ireland's win came six years after Thierry Henry's infamous handball denied the Irish a place at the 2010 World Cup.
On that occasion, the referee's failure to spot the France forward's blatant infringement in the play-off second leg in Paris led to the Republic's heartbreaking failure to qualify for the finals in South Africa.
But six years on, a hugely contentious decision by Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers sent the Irish on their way to Euro 2016 as he ruled that Bosnian defender Zukanovic had handled Murphy's cross.
It looked more a case of ball to hand as Zukanovic had no chance to avoid the contact but Walters, back after his first-leg suspension, held his nerve to send his former Stoke City team-mate Asmir Begovic the wrong way from the spot.
It was to prove the game's pivotal moment.

Republic football fans had long wanted Martin O'Neill as the country's manager but his decision to appoint Roy Keane as his assistant led to raised eyebrows as many wondered how two such strong characters could work together.
After the encouragement of a battling 1-1 draw against world champions Germany in Gelsenkirchen 13 months ago, the Republic's qualification hopes looked in grave doubt as a defeat by Scotland was followed by home draws against Poland and the Scots.
But last month's unlikely home victory over the Germans reignited the Republic's prospects and, despite the defeat by Poland three days later, they had put themselves in a position to challenge for a place in France via the play-offs.
With the Football Association of Ireland having already offered O'Neill a new deal, the duo will now be expected to remain in charge for the foreseeable future.
The Republic are not blessed with the strength in depth they once possessed - former defender Mark Lawrenson said afterwards that O'Neill "probably had the least talented group of players available of any Irish manager who has qualified".
With captain John O'Shea and influential striker Shane Long not risked from the start because of injury, the under-strength Republic line-up included three Championship players - Derby duo Richard Keogh and Jeff Hendrick, plus Ipswich striker Daryl Murphy.
They looked to have a daunting task against a Bosnian side which included Chelsea goalkeeper Begovic, Roma duo Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic, plus other Serie A stars Zukanovic and Lulic.
Hamburg's Emir Spahic was also in the Bosnian starting XI along with another Bundesliga player, Schalke's Sead Kolasinac.
Of the Republic's eight Premier League starters, Aston Villa defender Ciaran Clark had played only six times this season, while goalkeeper Darren Randolph had made only three starts for West Ham.
But a performance full of tenacity and endeavour ensured it was the hosts who were celebrating, leaving their more celebrated opponents contemplating an empty summer.
Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill:

"I never once dared to dream about getting to France, never once because of the group that we were involved in, so it is special.
"That moment when the referee blows the whistle and you are in France, it is just very, very special, very special indeed.
"It's more special because it means so much to a lot of people, naturally the players first and foremost, but to the nation as a whole."
Republic of Ireland goalscorer Jon Walters:
"The whole team on the pitch are heroes. We got there in the end, we did it the hard way, but we got there.
"You've got to take it in because these moments don't come round often in a career."
Bosnia manager Mehmed Bazdarevic:
"I'm very disappointed about the game. We lost and unfortunately, it's very hard for me to speak about it.
"We tried to answer the Irish players with the correct mind of an aggressive game and we did our best.
"I don't want to speak too much about the Ireland penalty because it could have consequences, but the referee had a terrible night. He was the worst on the pitch."
