The Super Falcons took the lead when Asisat Oshoala challenged for a header and the ball bounced in off Ghana's Portia Boakye.
But three minutes before half-time Ghana won a penalty and captain Elizabeth Addo the equaliser.
Ghana's Samira Suleman and Florence Dadson missed chances to win it.
The result leaves both teams on four points, with one game each remaining.
Kenya and Mali, both looking for their first points, play in Group B's late game on Wednesday.
Mali were vastly improved from their 6-0 loss to Nigeria in their opening Group B match as they overcame Kenya 3-1 in Limbe on Wednesday.
The result means that Kenya cannot progress to the semi-finals at their first ever Women's Africa Cup of Nations finals.
Mali now know a win over Ghana in their final group match on Saturday in Yaounde will see them progress.
The Malians opened the scoring in the 34th minute through Coulibaly Sebe's free-kick.
Seven minutes after the break, Mali doubled their lead with a well taken finish by Bassira Toure.
Toure then sealed the scoring from the penalty spot after she was fouled in the box.
Kenya, who once again impressed with some neat passing moves, pulled a goal back as Cheris Avila fired home from inside the area.
After the match, former Kenya player Doreen Nabwire, who is now part of the coaching team, said: "Today's display was the worst because we have had very good preparations ever since we qualified for these finals and we only have ourselves to blame."
Mali and Ghana both now travel to Yaounde where they will play their final group match on Saturday while Nigeria face Kenya in Limbe.
