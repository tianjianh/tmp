The married father-of-two paid for the men to visit him one evening last month at a flat he owns in London, it claims.
Mr Vaz, 59, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee which monitors crime and drugs policy, told the paper he was referring the claims to his solicitor and would be seeking advice.
The Mail on Sunday says he has stepped aside as committee chairman.
It says Mr Vaz responded saying: "I have referred these allegations to my solicitor Mark Stephens, of Howard Kennedy, who will consider them carefully and advise me on what is published."
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Keith Vaz has issued a statement on this matter. As with all departmental select committees, Keith was elected to the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee by the House of Commons, and his position is a matter for him and the House".
According to the Sunday Mirror, Mr Vaz's meeting with two male escorts included a discussion about using the party drug Poppers.
The MP for Leicester East had opposed government attempts to criminalise the drug. Ministers later announced they would remain within the law.
His committee is also currently overseeing a review of the UK's prostitution laws.
