Police confirmed the body is that of missing Kirsty Aitchison, who was last seen in the early hours of Sunday after leaving a social event for deaf people in the city centre.
The 30-year-old mother-of-four had left Campus bar in Sauchiehall Street at about 03:00 BST.
The death is not being treated as suspicious, Police Scotland said.
The discovery was made by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service from the Clyde near to the Kingston Bridge at about 16.35.
Chief Inspector John McBride said: "We would like to thank members of the public and the Deaf/BSL community for their support and assistance throughout this investigation.
"Our thoughts and condolences are with Kirsty's family and friends during this difficult time."
After leaving the bar, Ms Aitchison was seen on CCTV images heading towards the Broomielaw, holding her high-heeled black sandals and walking barefoot.
It had been reported she may have been planning to meet friends at a casino moored on the river.
During the week, police divers were brought in to search the river, and an air support unit was used to assist community policing officers as they conducted inquiries.
