Wales Under-20s stayed on course for a Grand Slam as they consigned 14-man France to a first Six Nations loss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales defended stoutly in the face of French pressure and led 6-0 at half-time with two Billy McBryde penalties.
France went ahead after the break with Alex Arrate's try but they then had wing Gabriel N'Gandebe sent off after he received a second yellow card.
George Gasson finished a brilliant team move to give Wales a third win from three which puts them top of the table.
