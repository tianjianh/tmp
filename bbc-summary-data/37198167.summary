Brett Ryan was arrested on Thursday and charged with three counts of first-degree murder.
Police had responded to reports of a stabbing in Scarborough, a suburban area east of the city's downtown area, when they found the three victims.
The injuries appeared to have been caused by a crossbow bolt, which was found near the victims.
All three victims, two men and a woman, sustained life-threatening injuries and died at the scene, police said.
Authorities have not released the victims' identities pending notification of family.
Hours later, authorities evacuated a Toronto building due to a suspicious package.
Police said the two incidents were connected, but gave no further details.
Mr Ryan is expected to appear in court on Friday.
