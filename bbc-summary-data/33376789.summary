[SN]TITLE[SN]
Second woman bishop Alison White consecrated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Church of England's second female bishop has been consecrated during a ceremony at York Minster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rev Canon Alison White was made the Bishop of Hull in a service led by Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu.
She and her husband, Bishop Frank White, are the UK's first husband and wife bishop partnership.
The Church formally adopted legislation last November to allow women bishops, following decades of argument over women's ordination.
Dr Sentamu paused the service at midday to observe the minute's silence remembering those killed in the Tunisia beach attack last week.
Earlier in the ceremony, a man wearing a dog collar interrupted the proceedings by holding up a banner and shouting in protest against the consecration of the bishop.
The 58-year-old bishop became a priest in 1996 and has served in Durham, Sheffield, Peterborough and Newcastle.
The Rt Rev Libby Lane was the Church of England's first woman bishop, who was consecrated as the eighth Bishop of Stockport at York Minster in January.
