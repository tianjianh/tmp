Barrow 4-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Byron Harrison scored a second-half hat-trick as Barrow boosted their promotion bid with a crushing victory over 10-man Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisive moment of the match arrived immediately after half-time when, with the game goalless, Eastleigh captain Ryan Cresswell conceded a penalty and was sent off for a foul on Richie Bennett.
Bluebirds' leading scorer Harrison slotted home the resulting spot-kick, and there was no way back for Barrow's fellow promotion hopefuls Eastleigh after that.
Full-back Nick Wilmer-Anderton fired into the top corner to make it 2-0 before Harrison wrapped up the win, and his hat-trick, with contrasting headers in the final 15 minutes - one from less than a yard after Bennett had hit the bar, and the second a towering stoppage-time effort.
Barrow, now unbeaten in 14 matches, also enjoyed the better of the first half with Bennett hitting the bar again with a brilliant looping shot.
That effort came during nine minutes of first-half stoppage time, a result of the treatment needed by Eastleigh goalkeeper Ryan Clarke after he suffered a facial injury in making a superb double save early on.
