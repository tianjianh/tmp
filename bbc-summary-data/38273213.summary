[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raith Rovers 0-0 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Andreu missed a second-half penalty as Dundee United dropped two points in the Championship title race with a draw at Stark's Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time.
United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was sent off in 55 minutes after collecting a second yellow card.
Rudi Skacel struck the bar for Raith but neither side could find the net.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon is desperate to add more of a goal threat to his team and Dutch trialist striker Felitciano Zschusschen watched from the stands.
The Tangerines struggled to make clear cut chances but with 15 minutes to go Scott Fraser went down in the box as he tried to go between Jean Yves M'Voto and Kyle Benedictus.
Cuthbert produced an impressive save to deny Norwich City's on-loan striker Andreu to ensure the points were shared.
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "It was a great save from Kevin but he shouldn't have had to make it. It was a poor decision.
"I'm not one that likes to go about these things as the referees have got a hard job and it's not something I want to talk about too much but it was a soft, soft decision.
"It was great that he saved it though as we wouldn't have deserved to get beat in that game."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I'm so proud of the players today as I thought we were the better team for the entire 90 minutes and even when we were down to ten men we were excellent.
"We created a few chances but there will be twists and turns in this league all season and we have lots of positives to take forward.
"To get a point against a tough team like Raith with just ten men was absolutely outstanding and if you had said to us three months ago we would be up at the top of the league we would have taken that."
