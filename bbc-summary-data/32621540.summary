The woman, in her 70s, was alone at her home in Poole, Dorset, when two men knocked on her door and forced their way in.
They tied her up with duct tape before stealing her belongings.
Dorset Police are trying to trace a dark-coloured VW Golf, following the raid in Egmont Road, Hamworthy, which happened on Monday night.
Det Sgt Neil Wright said: "This was obviously a frightening ordeal for the victim, who was thankfully not injured.
"I would like to trace the whereabouts of this specific VW Golf and am appealing for information."
