In pictures: Syria refugees at Turkey border

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 35,000 Syrians are waiting on the Turkish border opposite Kilis after fleeing a Syrian government offensive on rebel-held positions near Aleppo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turkey says the refugees are receiving food and shelter inside Syria and there is no need yet to allow them to cross.
Turkey already hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees - at least 2.5 million.
