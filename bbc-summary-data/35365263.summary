Caledon farmer charged with causing father's death by dangerous driving

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Tyrone farmer has appeared in court charged with causing his father's death by dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Alexander Brady, of Minterburn Road in Caledon, is accused of causing the death of Phelim Brady on the A4 road in Dungannon on 25 June 2014.
The 45-year-old is also charged with causing death by driving while disqualified and without insurance.
Another man, 51-year-old William Mark Murphy, is also charged with causing Mr Brady's death by dangerous driving.
Both Mr Murphy, of Prospect Road in Ballyward, County Down, and Paul Brady appeared at Dungannon Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
The charges against them arose after a tractor driven by Paul Brady was in collision with a lorry driven by Mr Murphy, causing injuries that claimed the life of 69-year-old Phelim Brady.
The judge said he was satisfied there was sufficient evidence to return the case to Dungannon Crown Court for trial.
Both men chose to remain silent during the hearing.
The judge released both defendants on bail of Â£200 and ordered them to appear again on 18 February.
