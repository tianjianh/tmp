On 23 June 2016, the UK made a historic decision. It voted to leave the European Union (EU).
The UK has been a member of the EU for more than 40 years, so this was an extremely important moment.
More than 33 million adults voted. Around 52% of them chose to leave the group of 28 countries, while 48% wanted to stay in it.
The majority of people in Blackpool voted to leave the EU, while the majority of people in Brighton voted to stay.
More than six months have passed since the initial vote, so we went to see how kids in these two towns feel now about Brexit...
