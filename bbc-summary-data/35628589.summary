Cahill, 36, who had his contract with Shanghai Shenhua terminated last week, said the deal was an "amazing opportunity".
"I'm very happy to be back playing football," Cahill wrote on Instagram. "I have signed a contract for five months. The future now is clear."
The Australian moved to China in 2015 from the New York Red Bulls.
