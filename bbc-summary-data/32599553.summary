The "high visibility operation" aims to counter a "severe" dissident republican threat, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
ACC Stephen Martin has apologised in advance for any inconvenience the operation may cause.
He said the service took the decision "in light of the four attacks in Belfast and Londonderry over the last two weeks".
"This is not a decision we take lightly and we will endeavour to ensure that the balance of how we police this threat is right, as well as trying to keep disruption to a minimum.
"There is no perfect security solution to terrorism.
"I would ask people to continue to be vigilant at all times. If you see any suspicious activity or any suspect objects, please report it to police immediately," he said.
