Gregor Townsend believes Glasgow Warriors are well placed to make the top four of the PRO12 after an impressive recovery to beat Ulster.

Tries from Iain Henderson and Stuart McCloskey put Ulster in control, but Stuart Hogg and Tommy Seymour crossed for Warriors to seal the win.
"We've got a game in hand and we're right back in it," Townsend said.
"We have four away games out of our five remaining games so the next two weeks are going to be important."
Glasgow struggled to live with Ulster in the opening exchanges. Having lost Hogg to the sin-bin with just two minutes on the clock, Henderson strolled over after relentless Ulster pressure.
Three Finn Russell penalties kept the home side in touch at 10-9 down at the break, but McCloskey's controversial try early in the second left Glasgow in trouble.
Terrific tries in quick succession from Hogg and Seymour turned the tide, and Hogg's long-range penalty with the last kick of the game sickened Ulster by denying them a losing bonus point.
Townsend was thrilled with the way his players responded in adversity.
"The players kept the belief and a couple of great opportunities we took as well," the Warriors head coach told BBC Scotland.
"I just said to the guys in the changing room, last week we showed our character defending a lead and tonight we showed our character in having to go out and attack and score the points to see home the victory.
"We weren't as fluent as we would like to be. A big reason was the Ulster defence. They put so many bodies into the contact area. It did upset our rhythm but I felt there was space all the time. When teams put so many bodies into that area there's going to be less bodies defending outside the rucks.
"I think we only gave away four penalties so our discipline in such an important game with such a physical team up against us was great."
Jonny Gray returned to captain the side after missing Scotland's final Six Nations match against Ireland through injury, and Townsend was thrilled to have him back leading his charges.
"He's a great player and he's growing into that captaincy role. He was asking the right questions, you could hear him speaking to the players, inspiring those around them.
"He's played well every game he's played this season so that was just another one."
