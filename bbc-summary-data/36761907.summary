The 22-year-old scored 27 league goals in the Dutch top flight last season and netted a penalty on his international debut against England in March.
He is Spurs' second summer signing, after the £11m arrival of Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama.
French champions Paris St-Germain and German club Wolfsburg were also reported to be interested in Janssen.
His performances in his debut top-flight season earned him the Johan Cruyff Trophy, awarded to the Eredivisie's young player of the year.
Janssen has played five times for his country, scoring three goals.
