A man who got stuck on a Swansea rooftop trying to capture his missing parrot has been reunited with the bird, an animal charity says.

Fire crews had to step in when the man became stranded on the Penlan Leisure Centre on Tuesday evening.
The pet owner was trying to recover the bird, but it flew off.
The RSPCA said a pineapple conure bird was later discovered at St Helen's Road and is back with its family.
"We believe that this parrot could be the one that we helped to safely return to its owners," said Sally Hyman, chair of the RSPCA at the Llys Nini animal centre.
"If this isn't the same one, there seems to be a spate of escaped parrots in Swansea."
The bird was spotted by a member of the public, who managed to take it to Birdline Parrot Rescue in Swansea. Another animal charity, Glynneath Guinea Pig Rescue then alerted the RSPCA, who in turn put the find up on Facebook.
