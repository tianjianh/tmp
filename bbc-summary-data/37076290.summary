TV presenter Ms Jackson gave birth at lunchtime on Saturday, with the baby weighing 9lbs 1 oz.
The couple, who married last year, also have an 18-month-old son together, Finley.
Ms Jackson tweeted to announce the birth, saying her daughter was "worth the wait!"
The heavily pregnant Sky Sports presenter had been spotted cheering on Wales during Euro 2016 and it had been feared the baby could have been born during the later stages of the tournament.
Former Swansea player Coleman, who helped Wales make history by getting to the semi-finals of the competition in France, also has four older children with his first wife.
