The missing: 40 years of seeking Renee and Andrew MacRae

Today marks 40 years since a Highlands mother and her young son vanished. The mystery of their disappearance continues to cause distress to their family, and challenge police.

The case of Renee and Andrew MacRae, from Inverness, remains open and under investigation, Police Scotland said earlier this week.
Also this week, the family of the missing two told of their heartache of still seeking closure, but of also a hope they will one day get answers.
The four-decades-old unsolved case has had many twists since the day the pair went missing on 12 November 1976.
Mrs MacRae, a mother-of-two, was estranged from her businessman husband Gordon MacRae, and involved in a relationship with Bill MacDowell, a married accountant at Mr MacRae's building firm.
At 17:00 on 12 November, Mrs MacRae set off in her car with Andrew, who was three, at her older son from their home in Inverness.
She dropped her eldest son off at her husband's home, before driving off, reportedly to meet Mr MacDowell in Perth. Mr MacDowell says they never met up.
At about 22:00, Mrs MacRae's BMW was found on fire by a passing bus driver about 12 miles (19km) south of Inverness.
The car was parked on a loop road that was being used as a lay-by during the construction of then new A9 trunk road.
There was no sign of the mother and son and police began their investigation into what would become one of the UK's longest missing persons cases.
Journalist Iain MacDonald, who covered the story of the disappearance in 1976 and has continued to do so over the last 40 years, said other motorists reported incidents on the same stretch of road.
Mr MacDonald told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: "Witness told of seeing someone dragging a sheep, and Renee MacRae was wearing a sheepskin coat that night, and another saw a man with a pushchair.
"There was a bloodstained rug recovered from the car but that was it."
In the fortnight following 12 November, more than 100 police officers and large numbers of volunteers searched moorland around the site of where the BMW was discovered. RAF Canberra aircraft flew in to make wider sweeps of the area.
"Searches were made of flooded quarries and of the wide, rough ground which abounds there. Nothing was ever found," said Mr MacDonald.
The police investigation and their appeals for information continued over the years.
More recent developments in forensic science offered new opportunities to examine the case. The year 2004 saw some of the most dramatic developments in the case.
New tests were carried out in a laboratory in Aberdeen on traces of blood found in the boot of the BMW.
Detectives said the blood was among evidence from the 1970s that experts had been able to "clean up and amplify".
Also in 2004, police drafted in internationally experienced forensic archaeologists and anthropologists to sift 35,000 tonnes of soil from the disused Dalmagarry quarry, close to where Mrs MacRae's car was found.
This renewed effort to solve the case followed up on reports of a smell of decomposing flesh at the quarry several months after Mrs MacRae and Andrew vanished.
Mr MacDonald said: "Police sergeant John Cathcart and a digger driver were investigating Dalmagarry quarry. They got a very strong smell but, he claimed, they were recalled before they got any further because of a lack of funds.
"Over the subsequent years John Cathcart told that story to a number of people, I was one of them, and in 2004 police launched a major operation.
"They spent over Â£100,000 digging up the quarry in August of that year over a three-week period, moving tonnes of earth and 2,000 or so trees and they found nothing but crisp packets, some men's clothing and animal bones."
Two years later came a fresh twist in the case when police submitted a report to the procurator fiscal naming a person suspected of killing Mrs MacRae and Andrew.
Just months later the Crown Office said there was insufficient evidence to take the case to court.
But, as the 40th anniversary falls, there is anticipation again of possible further developments.
It has been reported that "an anomaly" has been detected by ground penetrating radar in the foundations of a bridge near the lay-by where the car was found.
However, Police Scotland said this week its inquiries indicated construction work did not start in this area until some time after Mrs MacRae's disappearance.
The force said it would nonetheless liaise with contractors involved in the current A9 upgrade in an effort to explain the radar anomaly.
On the wider investigation, Police Scotland said this week that it continued to be actively pursued.
Det Supt Jim Smith, of the force's Major Investigations Team North, said: "As in all cases such as these, there is a family quite rightly seeking answers and closure.
"We are determined to do all we can to find those answers, and to that end continue to maintain contact with the family of Christine MacRae and Andrew MacRae as the years go on.
