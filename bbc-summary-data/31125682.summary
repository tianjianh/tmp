[SN]TITLE[SN]
Patrick Lyttle out of Sydney hospital weeks after coma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim man has been discharged from an Australian hospital, a month after he was left critically ill when allegedly punched by his brother.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Lyttle, 31, fell and hit his head in Sydney on 3 January.
The Ballycastle man was on life support at St Vincent's Hospital for almost a week before regaining consciousness.
His 33-year-old brother Barry is charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm. He has been released on bail.
In a court appearance last month, his bail conditions were changed to allow him to move closer to the hospital where his brother was being treated.
Patrick Lyttle had been travelling around Australia for some months before his brother and father came to visit him.
