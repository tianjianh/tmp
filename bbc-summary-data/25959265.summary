[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 700 officers have taken part in UK-wide raids to break up "one of London's most harmful gangs".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty-nine people aged 18 to 47 were arrested in the simultaneous raids at 23 properties at 05:30 GMT.
The Metropolitan Police co-ordinated the raids - connected to a Lambeth gang - with the Thames Valley, Essex and Bedfordshire forces and Police Scotland.
Police said about 300 rocks of crack cocaine and heroin were also found.
Those targeted as part of Operation Nasurem are believed to be the most senior ranking members of the Lambeth gang and were all taken to a London police station for questioning, Scotland Yard said.
Arrests were made on suspicion of offences including conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, money laundering, possession with intent to supply, fraud and immigration offences.
Met officers were assisted by police officers from the Thames Valley, Essex and Bedfordshire police forces in carrying out the raids as well as Police Scotland, Scotland Yard's Dogs Unit and the force's Air Support Unit.
