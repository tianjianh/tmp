Instruments made from vegetables!

We were always told to not play with our food, but these two brothers from China clearly never listened!

Nan Weidong and Nan Weiping have been transforming vegetables into musical instruments for two years.
Their dad was a music teacher and encouraged them to be musical from a young age - but carrot panpipes probably weren't what he had in mind!
Weidong says it's important the veg is fresh - otherwise it risks being out of tune.
And no vegetable is too much of a challenge: they've turned a sweet potato into an ocarina, a bamboo shoot has become a flute, and a yam has doubled up as a whistle.
Watch the clip to see them in action!
