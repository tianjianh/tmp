Permission granted for Hayle South Quay development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning consent has been granted for a multi-million pound development of a derelict quay in Cornwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The development of South Quay in Hayle will see the construction of a supermarket, 30 homes, a restaurant and a retail unit, developers said.
The consent comes after the Secretary of State for Communities said he was not calling in the application.
The plans have been criticised because they are to be based in a prominent part of a World Heritage Site.
South Quay has been derelict for 40 years and is owned by ING Real Estate.
As well as the quay development, three other retail units are planned for the nearby site of the town's former foundry.
The planning consent included an obligation requiring ING Real Estate to complete repairs to Hayle's historic harbour walls, Cornwall Council said.
English Heritage has been opposed to the plans; as has Icomos, which advises Unesco on World Heritage sites.
Both described them as "incongruous".  English Heritage added that the proposals were "unacceptable in this sensitive location".
The area was granted World Heritage status in 2006 because of its mining and industrial history.
