Election 2017: Which MPs are standing down, and who might be standing?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The surprise election called for 8 June has brought things into sharp focus for MPs looking for a way out of politics - and offers a possible way back for their former colleagues wanting to return.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some of the big names stepping down include former chancellor George Osborne and veteran Labour MP Alan Johnson, who had been tipped as a potential party leader in the past.
But while some doors are closing, others are opening.
Sir Vince Cable is among several Lib Dems hoping to return to Parliament, alongside Sir Simon Hughes and Sir Ed Davey.
Here are the latest Westminster comings and goings...
George Osborne
The former chancellor once feted as the successor to David Cameron as prime minister has announced he will not seek re-election as an MP.
He was elected as MP for the Conservatives in Tatton, Cheshire, in 2001.
After roles as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and shadow chancellor, he became chancellor in 2010 when the coalition government with the Lib Dems came to power.
He was widely seen as one of the favourites to succeed his friend David Cameron as the next Conservative prime minister.
But following the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, Mr Cameron stood down as leader and Mr Osborne was sacked as chancellor the following month when Theresa May became the leader.
He has since taken jobs as the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper and for the fund manager BlackRock, among others, prompting calls for him to stand down as an MP, which he had resisted.
Announcing his decision not to seek re-election in the 8 June election, the 45-year-old said he was stepping down "for now".
Eric Pickles
Former Conservative Party chairman Sir Eric Pickles is standing down as MP for Brentwood and Ongar after 25 years.
He announced the news on Twitter, saying he was looking forward to the election "as a canvasser, not a candidate" and thanked his constituency for its "support and friendship".
The 65-year-old said he was going to "miss it dreadfully" but that there always came a point when things must end.
Sir Eric was also communities and local government secretary between 2010 and 2015 before being ousted in David Cameron's post-election reshuffle in 2015. He went on to become anti-corruption tsar.
He said he had enjoyed "success and setbacks" as an MP but had "always been sustained by the friendship back home in the patch".
Sir Eric added: "I have served in elected office, either as a councillor or a Member of Parliament for just short of 40 years, starting with the wonderful Margaret Thatcher up to and including Theresa May.
"I strongly believe that it is in the national interest for Theresa to receive the clear endorsement of the British people for her difficult task of removing this country from the EU."
Douglas Carswell
Douglas Carswell, the former UKIP MP who became an independent, will not be seeking re-election in Clacton.
Instead, he'll be lending his support to the Conservatives, the party from which he defected in 2014.
A political maverick, Mr Carswell joined UKIP saying he wanted to see a "fundamental change in British politics".
He made history when he became the party's first elected MP but fell out with its leadership, and quit last month.
If Mr Carswell had defended his seat, he would have faced former UKIP party donor Arron Banks.
In a statement, he said: "I have done everything possible to ensure we got, and won, a referendum to leave the European Union - even changing parties and triggering a by-election to help nudge things along.
"It is sometimes said that all political careers end in failure - it doesn't feel like that to me.
"I have stood for Parliament five times, won four times, and helped win the referendum last June. Job done. I'm delighted."
Alan Johnson
Regarded by some in Westminster as the best leader Labour never had, Mr Johnson was a former home secretary and health secretary, serving in the governments of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.
A former postman and union official, he was elected as MP for Hull West and Hessle in 1997.
He ran for the job of deputy to Gordon Brown in 2007 but was pipped to the post by Harriet Harman by the slenderest of margins.
Mr Johnson was seen as a possible successor to Mr Brown but ruled himself out of the contest in 2010, instead backing David Miliband, who was ultimately defeated by his brother Ed.
Mr Johnson led Labour's fight to remain in the European Union but clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, claiming that the leader's office had been "working against" the party's efforts.
Speaking about his decision not to fight the next election, Mr Johnson said it was "best for the party".
Gisela Stuart
Labour's Birmingham Edgbaston MP, who was a key figure in the campaign to leave the EU, has decided not to seek re-election.
Ms Stuart, who has represented the Midlands seat since 1997, told local supporters it was "time to stand down and pass on the baton".
She chaired the victorious Vote Leave campaign, touring the country with Boris Johnson, and was seen as a key figure in winning Labour voters over to the Brexit cause.
"Whomever is selected as the Labour candidate will have my full backing," she told Labour members.
"I will be with them and you, not just in spirit but on the campaign trail."
Andy Burnham
Andy Burnham, a former health secretary and now tipped as favourite to become Mayor of Greater Manchester, says he will not stand again in June.
Mr Burnham, MP for Leigh for 16 years, had two shots at party leadership, coming fourth in 2010 and second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015.
In a message to constituents, he said there was now "a crisis in politics" and the Westminster system was a "major part of the problem".
"We could hold as many general elections as we like and yet Westminster would still be structurally incapable of developing a real response to the deep-rooted issues revealed by last year's referendum," he said.
Real change was needed, he added, and devolution in England was the best chance to secure a more equal country.
The election for Greater Manchester mayor is on 4 May.
Sir Vince Cable
Sir Vince, who served as former business secretary in the coalition government from 2010-2015, is one of a batch of Lib Dems who have confirmed they will stand again.
A former Labour councillor, the 73-year-old was first elected as MP for Twickenham in 1997 but was defeated by Conservative Tania Mathias in 2015 after the Lib Dems lost dozens of seats.
Announcing his decision to stand again, Sir Vince said "Bring it on!".
Sir Simon Hughes
A former Lib Dem deputy leader and minister of state for justice and civil liberties in the coalition government, Sir Simon Hughes said he intends to be the party's candidate to fight the Bermondsey and Old Southwark seat in south London, which he lost in 2015.
Making the announcement, the 65-year-old said: "In Bermondsey and north Southwark we are determined to win back the seat from Labour and really clear we can do so."
Sir Ed Davey
Sir Ed, 51, is another Lib Dem heavyweight to announce their return to the political fray.
Confirming his intention to stand again for election, the former energy secretary in the coalition government told the Independent: "We will be the surprise in this election, we will do far better than people currently think.
"Clearly the Tories are going to hammer Labour. But we can take some [seats] back."
He plans to attempt to retake his Kingston and Surbiton seat, which he held from 1997 until 2015.
The former Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, Sir Bob Russell, is to stand again, despite retiring from politics after his defeat in 2015 to Conservative Will Quince. Sir Bob, who is 71 and had served his constituency for 18 years, denied he was too old to stand, adding he was younger than the region's longest-serving MP, Saffron Walden's Sir Alan Haselhurst.
Ed Balls
Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls will not be standing in his former Morley and Outwood constituency. He is not expected to stand anywhere else.
Mr Balls, who was MP for the constituency for five years, lost his seat in the 2015 general election.
Since leaving Parliament, he has become a visiting professor of King's College London, a senior fellow at Harvard University, and was appointed chairman of his hometown football club Norwich City.
But he perhaps has become best known for his dance moves on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he became a fan favourite.
David Miliband
It is a long shot but there has been speculation about whether David Miliband might stand again.
The former foreign secretary under Gordon Brown was expected to become the leader of the Labour Party after Mr Brown stood down, but was surprisingly defeated by his brother Ed in 2010.
In 2013 he stepped down as MP for South Shields in Tyne and Wear to become president of the US humanitarian aid charity International Rescue Committee.
In February the 51-year-old said Labour was at its weakest point in half a century in an interview with the Times and declined to rule out a return to UK politics.
