The pups were born on 3 June and are being raised by their parents Ruby and Jax.
It is the latest litter of European wolves, a subspecies of the grey wolf, to be raised at the park.
Previously, pups were born there in 2013 and Ruby was born at the site in 2012.
Ruby's siblings went on to join other collections as part of a European wolf management programme in the UK.
The latest pups, which are four females and two males, have been named Fearn, Eadha, Rose, Cora, Darach and Simon.
A series of photographs of the pups were first released by the park in July.
In the wild, European wolves are found throughout Scandinavia. Some are also found in southern and eastern Europe and western Russia.
Wolves were hunted to extinction in Scotland in the 1740s.
