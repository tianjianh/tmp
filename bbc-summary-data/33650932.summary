[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jason Morgan manslaughter: Landowner 'not responsible for health and safety'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A landowner accused of manslaughter after a builder was electrocuted by a cable, has blamed a co-defendant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farm owner Roger Matthews told Truro Crown Court he did not want to tell other people "how to do their job".
Jason Morgan died when his ladder touched an 11,000 volt power cable at Great Brynn Barton Farm near Roche, Cornwall, in June 2011.
Mr Matthews, 48, said co-defendant Philip Tucker, 57, from St Wenn, had been responsible for health and safety.
Mr Tucker was hired to do the roofing on a large steel barn extension and in turn hired Mr Morgan's employer, Intanet Safety Net Ltd to install safety netting.
When asked by his defence barrister, Michael Vere-Hodge QC, who was responsible for health and safety during the project, Mr Matthews replied: "Mr Tucker."
He told the court: "It was very much that netting and roofing was a specialised job that required a competent person, ie Mr Tucker, to supervise it."
When asked what was in his mind as a landowner Mr Matthews replied: "I could not tell Intanet or Mr Tucker's men how to do their job."
The court previously heard Mr Morgan, from Bristol, was working on a 4m (13ft) ladder within 2m (6ft 6in) of the power cable.
Giving evidence Mr Matthews said as far as he knew "there was no need to be diverting the cable".
Mr Matthews and employee Norman Treseder, 55, from Wendron, deny a charge of manslaughter.
Matthews Plant Hire Ltd and Mr Tucker deny health and safety at work charges.
The trial continues.
