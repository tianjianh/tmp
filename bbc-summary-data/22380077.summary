The Care Inspectorate highlighted the incident at Queen's House in Kelso.
It graded staffing at the facility as "weak" compared with excellent ratings in the three other categories.
Queen's House chairman Alastair Turnbull said it was an "isolated incident" which had been dealt with and there was "no issue with care".
It is understood an investigation took place into the nurse which involved the police, while Scottish Borders Council's social work department was made aware of the issue.
An inspectorate spokesman said: "A member of staff was appointed to a position within Queen's House for which they were not suitably qualified.
"Since care services often work with the very young, the very old and other vulnerable people, this is potentially a serious issue.
"That is why we regularly review recruitment practices in care services and take prompt action and demand improvement whenever we find failings."
The spokesman said that in this instance the problem was identified by the care service, which "acted swiftly and took the appropriate action".
"The safety, welfare and dignity of people who use care services are our priorities at all times," he said.
"We are satisfied in this case that the well-being of service users was not affected."
Queen's House is a private, not-for-profit home run by a voluntary management committee, which looks after 32 older people.
Chairman Mr Turnbull said: "There was an incident involving a member of staff who was dismissed.
"We wrote to all the residents and there was no issue with care.
"We were marked six (excellent grade) in all other sections of the inspection.
"This was an isolated incident which we have taken steps to address."
However, relatives of residents have expressed concerns that the woman was not a registered nurse.
In her report following a visit in January, inspector Lesley Smith wrote: "Queen's House have a recruitment policy which complied with safer recruitment.
"However, there was a recent issue where this process was not strenuously followed."
Ms Smith said the matron and management were open and honest about the incident but added: "We have to reflect the potential seriousness of the error in the grade for this (staffing) section."
