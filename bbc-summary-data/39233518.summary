Konta, ranked 11th to Watson's 108th, struggled for rhythm in the first set but dominated the second to lead 5-1.
Watson served nine double faults before fighting back but Konta came through.
In the men's event, Kyle Edmund beat Portugal's Gastao Elias 6-1 6-3 to set up a second-round meeting with world number two Novak Djokovic.
British number three Dan Evans registered a 6-1 6-1 win over Germany's Dustin Brown in just 53 minutes.
He will face Kei Nishikori, ranked fifth in the world, in the second round on Sunday while Konta goes on to face Caroline Garcia in round three..
"It was definitely a brilliant experience for both of us as Fed Cup team-mates and I am very happy to have come through it," said Konta, who was playing her first match in a month after a foot injury.
It was the first meeting on the WTA Tour between Britain's two leading women.
Their only previous contest was at a second-tier tournament in Barnstaple in 2013 when Watson retired after losing the first four games.
Watson broke serve first but then gifted the advantage back as she made three double faults in the third game.
With both players making errors, the pair traded serves again before Konta, who received a bye in the first round, struck the decisive blow by winning the ninth game.
She went on to hold her serve to love to take the first set.
Konta won eight points without reply at the start of the second set and looked on course for a quick victory.
Watson, who threw her racquet in frustration after making three more double faults in the sixth game, found herself 5-1 down before she rallied.
Konta served two double faults in the seventh game and won only two points as Watson, 24, won three consecutive games.
But the 11th seed composed herself to seal her place in the next round after 94 minutes.
