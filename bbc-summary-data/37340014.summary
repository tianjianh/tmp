Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter says being bottom of the Premiership could represent the biggest challenge yet for his side.

Last season's beaten finalists lost to Saracens on Sunday, and have one losing bonus point from their first two games.
"We're going to have to man up and be tough on ourselves," said Baxter.
"I've actually always said that the biggest test that we would ever have as a Premiership side would be if we don't pick up points early in the season."
He added to BBC Radio Devon: "Well now at least we can see how we're going to react to it."
Exeter are in their seventh season in the top tier, yet this is the first time they have lost their first two games of a campaign.
Last season's runners-up have not finished lower than eighth in the Premiership since gaining promotion in 2010.
"It's going to be a great test for us," Baxter said.
"The top of the table looks a little way off now, but the reality is you've got to stay strong and keep working on the important elements."
