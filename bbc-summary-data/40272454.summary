Dame Katherine - Great Britain's most decorated female Olympian - retired from rowing after winning a medal at a fifth Games last summer. She has Maryculter links and did much of her training in the north east.
Footballer Kim Little, who was born in Aberdeen and attended Mintlaw Academy, was a London 2012 Olympian.
They will get honorary degrees.
They are among 12 people selected, also including Sir Moir Lockhead - the former chief executive of Aberdeen-based FirstGroup - and former Lord Provost George Adam.
Prof Sir Ian Diamond, principal and vice-chancellor of the university, said: "Our honorary graduates have achieved so much in their fields while making a significant contribution to society, and I am delighted to welcome these talented and successful individuals to the university family.
"They provide an inspirational example to our graduates as they move onto a new chapter in their careers."
