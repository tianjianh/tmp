Apple and Google settle patent row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mobile phone industry giants Apple and Google have agreed to dismiss lawsuits they had brought against each other over technology patents.

In a joint statement, the companies said they would work together in "some areas of patent reform".
But the deal did not include licensing their technology to each other.
Apple - which produces iPhones - and firms that make phones using Google's Android software earlier filed dozens of lawsuits against one another.
Earlier this month, a jury in California ordered South Korea's Samsung firm to pay Apple $119.6m (Â£71m) for for infringing two of its patents.
The court also ruled that Apple infringed Samsung's patents and awarded $158,000 in damages.
Android software is now installed on some 80% of new phones sold every year.
