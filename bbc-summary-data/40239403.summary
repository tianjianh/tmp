Stuart Hogg faces an anxious wait to discover whether a facial injury could end his British and Irish Lions tour.

The Scotland full-back was hurt in the first half of Saturday's 12-3 win over Crusaders after being caught by the elbow of team-mate Conor Murray.
Hogg, 24, left the field with blood streaming from a gash on his cheek.
Head coach Warren Gatland said: "We're hoping he'll be OK, but we're just getting someone more qualified than me to assess that."
It was the Glasgow Warriors back's second appearance of the tour, having also started the win over New Zealand Provincial Barbarians.
"We're getting a specialist to have a look at that cheek of his, to get some idea in the next 24 to 48 hours in terms of how serious an injury that is," said Gatland, whose side face the Highlanders on Tuesday then the Maori All Blacks on Saturday.
Irish scrum-half Murray suffered a suspected dislocated finger on Saturday, but Lions staff are unconcerned by the minor issue.
Sam Warburton has shaken off his ankle problem to captain the Lions in Tuesday's Highlanders clash in Dunedin, while Jared Payne is fit to start at full-back as Gatland assesses his options given Hogg's injury doubt.
Centre Jonathan Davies must complete return-to-play protocols after a head knock but is already free of any concussion symptoms, while Ross Moriarty is still carrying the after-effects of a back spasm.
Dan Biggar is fit to return and start at fly-half having completed all the relevant concussions testing.
"Ross Moriarty had a bit of a back strain that he got in that first game," explained Gatland.
"He hasn't taken a huge part in training, the physios have been working with him. Hopefully he's back training fully in three days' time.
"He definitely would have been an option. That's why CJ Stander is backing up again.
"Sam Warburton hadn't had a lot of rugby under his belt, so it was important to get him involved for this game.
"He could potentially back that up against the Maori All Blacks."
