[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour MP for Cynon Valley, Ann Clwyd, has said she will stand for re-election in 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In February Ms Clwyd, 77, announced she was standing down, after being the area's MP since 1984.
But she now says she intends to contest the seat after all, after "many requests from Labour voters in the Cynon Valley".
Plans for an all-women shortlist to choose a new candidate were strongly opposed by the local party.
In a letter to constituents, Ms Clwyd said: "I hope to stand again for re-election with your support."
She said the decision was taken after "careful consideration of the arguments put to me".
The MP told BBC Wales that Labour party figures in London and locally have known about her change of heart for "several weeks", but she held back from announcing it because the party had been busy with the Scottish independence referendum campaign.
Ms Clwyd said she had received a "very enthusiastic" reaction from people to her decision.
She revealed in July that she was "weighing up her options", after being contacted by constituents asking her to stay on.
It followed a row over Labour's decision to use an all-women shortlist to select her successor, which has been strongly opposed by the local party.
Cynon Valley Labour constituency secretary Alun Williams said the local party would go on "strike" and not take part in the candidate selection process if an all-women shortlist was imposed.
Welsh Labour responded to Mr Williams's comments by saying it would run the selection process if necessary.
Ms Clwyd, a former Labour shadow minister, has recently been outspoken on the state of the NHS following failings in the care of her husband at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in the days leading up to his death.
David Cameron appointed her as an adviser on how hospitals in England should handle complaints.
