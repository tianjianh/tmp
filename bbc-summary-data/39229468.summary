Leicestershire Police said the incident in Keightley Road had been resolved "peacefully and without injury".
A woman, 48, was found in the flat unharmed and is now being treated as a witness, the force added.
Officers and negotiators were called at around 07:00 GMT and cordoned off the road.
Police had been stationed outside the property in the New Parks area of the city for around 10 hours after the man refused to leave the property.
The subsequent cordon left a number of people unable to get back home, but the road is now set to reopen.
Residents are also being advised that it is now safe for them to go about their normal business.
A Leicestershire Police spokesperson said: "We regret the inconvenience that this incident has undoubtedly caused local people, but I am extremely grateful for their patience and understanding.
"Public safety, and that of our officers, has been of paramount importance throughout this 10 hour operation and I am pleased that it has been resolved peacefully."
