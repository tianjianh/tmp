Eastleigh 0-1 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln remain top of the National League after Sean Raggett's second-half header lifted them to a 1-0 victory at mid-table Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Wilson spurned an early chance for the hosts as he struck wide when well placed but the Imps grew into the contest and efforts from Luke Waterfall and Nathan Arnold produced smart saves from Eastleigh goalkeeper Graham Stack.
Wilson wasted another gilt-edged opportunity after heading over from close range while the striker was then denied by Lincoln shot-stopper Paul Farman, who then kept out Matt Tubbs' bundled effort.
Those saves proved crucial as Raggett's header in the 77th minute looped over Stack and into the net to give Lincoln a third successive league win and one that keeps them above Tranmere on goal difference.
