At the end of the inspection, the head of Caf's delegation, Leodegar Tenga, said Cameroon was ready to "organise a good competition."
"We visited hotels and stadia, work is progressing. The competition is not tomorrow but in November and we believe that everything will be perfect by then," Tenga declared.
"The grass on the field is good, exactly what is needed - the best in the continent.
"Issues of visas and transportation may have to be resolved before the tournament, and Cameroon will organise a good competition," Tenga added.
The inspection team, who visited Yaounde, Buea and Limbe, thanked the organising committee for the reception they received in Cameroon which Tenga said "facilitated our work."
Acknowledging that the competition is not easy to organise, Tenga also extended the appreciation of Caf President Issa Hayatou to the Cameroon government for accepting to host the competition.
Eight teams in total will take part in the African competition which is scheduled to run from 19 November to 3 December.
Holders Nigeria and hosts Cameroon will be joined by Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Egypt, Zimbabwe and South Africa at the tournament.
