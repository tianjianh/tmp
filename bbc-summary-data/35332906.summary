The property was empty, apart from the animals, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said.
Jennie Griffiths, head of the service's fire control room, said: "Crews confirmed the fire was extinguished by 6.43am but sadly confirmed two domestic cats had not survived the fire."
The cause of the fire is being investigated.
