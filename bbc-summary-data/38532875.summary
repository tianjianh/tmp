It's almost time for Donald Trump to officially become the president of the US.

However, he has found himself being criticised this week for things he has said on social media.
But what did he say and why are people cross about it?
Since winning the election, Donald Trump has often used social media to tell people what he thinks.
One of the things that Donald Trump has tweeted about recently is to do with how he won the election.
He has disagreed with something that his own American spies have said.
The spies have said that Russia got involved with the US election to try to help Trump win.
They say Russia hacked into Hillary Clinton's team's emails and released embarrassing information about her.
However, Donald Trump has said on Twitter that he does not believe that the American spies have got it right.
Many people don't think that the way that Donald Trump has been sharing his opinions on social media is appropriate for a man who is about to become president.
Recently, his opponents have criticised him for not supporting the work of his own US spies.
The current vice-president of the US called Joe Biden - who is second in command to President Barack Obama - said in an interview that he needs to "grow up".
It is unusual for a US president to speak out in this way disagreeing with what his own spies are saying.
However, those who support him say it is a good thing that he is doing things differently to politicians in the past.
