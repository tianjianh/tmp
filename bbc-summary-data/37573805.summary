Officers seized the drugs from a property in Bellefield Avenue, on Tuesday, after executing a search warrant.
Two men, aged 27 and 25, have been charged and are expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court.
The search was part of Police Scotland's intelligence-led initiative to tackle drug-related criminality.
Det Insp Stewart Forsyth, of Police Scotland's specialist crime division, said: "A significant amount of heroin and cocaine was recovered, highlighting our ongoing commitment to remove controlled drugs from our communities and reduce the harm caused by illegal substances.
"I want to thank our communities for their support. By providing information to us about drug-related criminality we can take positive action to search properties under warrant, seize controlled drugs and arrest those involved in their supply.
"Report it and we will take action."
