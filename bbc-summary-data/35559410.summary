Man sorry over 'suspicious' lift offer in Pontprennau, Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Range Rover driver who offered a woman and child a lift outside a school has apologised for causing concern after police issued a warning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 41-year-old came forward after a South Wales Police appeal over five "suspicious incidents" in Pontprennnau and Pentwyn, Cardiff, since 26 January.
He said he offered the mother and son a lift in bad weather near Pontprennau Primary School on 8 February.
Officers said they were satisfied his intentions were "genuine".
Insp Paul Arkontopoulos said: "As a result of the publicity, a local man has contacted us and confirmed he offered the lady and her child a lift due to the bad weather conditions."
The force said it was continuing to investigate other reported incidents in the area and patrolling near schools to reassure the public.
