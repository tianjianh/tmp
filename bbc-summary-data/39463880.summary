[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County clawed their way to within just three points of safety in League Two with five games to go as they beat play-off chasing Exeter City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a delayed start due to heavy traffic before kick-off, Exeter came close to taking the lead when Joe Day saved David Wheeler header.
The visitors took the lead when Tom Owen-Evans fired in from long-range.
Alex Samuel could have doubled their lead with an ambitious shot two minutes later but shot just over the bar.
Hartlepool's draw with Morecambe and Cheltenham's draw away at Wycombe means the Exiles reduce their five-point deficit from safety to just three with victory.
