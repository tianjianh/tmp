James Delaney, from Telford, has broken the terms of his licence following his release from prison in December last year, West Mercia Police said.
It is believed he may be with his partner and children. Police said they are being treated as "missing".
Delaney, 27, is thought to be in Birmingham.
The public is being advised not to approach Delaney who was jailed for a robbery carried out in the Birmingham area in 2011.
Sgt Kevin Jones, from West Mercia Police, said: "We are keen to trace James Delaney as soon as possible and would ask the public not to approach him if they see him, but to call police.
"It is believed that Mr Delaney may be with his 25-year-old partner and their children, and there is growing concern for their welfare."
He added Delaney was believed to be in the Sparkbrook or Moseley area of Birmingham.
Police have not named Delaney's partner or said how many children are involved.
