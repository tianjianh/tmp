Jake Hudson, who has Asperger syndrome, said worrying about the end of the world used to be one of his "78 fears".
Since working with SELFA, he said he now had "about five", one of which was not looking smart enough at school.
Jake, from Skipton, said: "It's a massive thank you. They've been helping me through my life."
SELFA works with disabled, disadvantaged and vulnerable children by running after-school clubs and residential trips.
Since joining at the age of four, Jake said his self confidence had increased by taking part in "amazing activities" such as fencing and archery.
"Before I went to SELFA I used to be very overwhelmed. I had little self esteem and I was very pessimistic."
Asperger syndrome is a mild form of autism and has an impact on the way someone interprets their environment.
Children with Asperger syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence and may be particularly good at learning facts and figures.
Karen Roberts, who works with Jake at SELFA, said there was concern for his mental health when he became obsessed with the end of the world happening in 2012.
She said: "I went into his school and did a lot of work with Jake, making sure he had quiet time and using visual tools to keep his mind off his worries."
She said the youngster's fears were now primarily around obsession and failure.
She added: "Academically he is incredibly bright, but if he gets one thing wrong in maths he has a meltdown.
"Anything that changes in his routine is also a massive worry for him.
"The work we're doing with Jake now is all about getting him ready for life as he grows.
"He is an amazing young man and we want to make sure things are as worry free as they can be in his circumstances."
The youngster, who enjoys memorising road maps, said all the SELFA staff were amazing.
