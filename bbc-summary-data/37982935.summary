[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-1 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ollie Watkins' priceless goal allowed Exeter to collect a 1-0 win at Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The beleaguered O's paid the price for some abject defending when Watkins found himself unmarked and able to slip the ball past keeper Alex Cisak from close range after a cross from the impressive Liam McAlinden eluded the home defence.
The Grecians should have doubled their advantage on 39 minutes when McAlinden again tormented the opposition and delivered a cross that striker Reuben Reid headed over the bar from six yards with the goal at his mercy.
Reid though was unlucky when a shot four minutes later was blocked by an Orient defender as the visitors dictated affairs.
The home supporters vented their feelings with a chorus of boos ringing around Brisbane Road before the half-time whistle as the Londoners produced a display with precious little lustre.
The introduction of Sandro Semedo raised Orient's tempo but despite a series of crosses by the young winger, the O's were unable to capitalise against a solid Grecians defence superbly marshalled by skipper Jordan Moore-Taylor.
Pierce Sweeney saved the day for his side on 66 minutes when he blocked a Jay Simpson shot that appeared goalbound but the visitors, who created the better chances, were good value for their sixth league success on the road this season.
Orient left the field at the final whistle to jeers from their fans whilst City lifted themselves out of the bottom two as the Londoners suffered their eighth successive home league defeat.
