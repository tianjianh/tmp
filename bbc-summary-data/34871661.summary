Kiddisave nursery store in Walsall stops trading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Walsall store selling nursery and childcare products has stopped trading and plans to go into liquidation, an insolvency firm said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Customers of Kiddisave said they had paid hundreds of pounds for prams and buggies which had not been delivered.
Kay Possard, of WP Mayfield insolvency practitioners, said she expected to be formally appointed as liquidator at a directors meeting on 3 December.
The firm has been unavailable for comment.
Chloe Khan, 27, from Dudley, said she had put down a deposit of Â£878 for goods totalling Â£1,756, including a double buggy for twins she is expecting in the next two weeks, but had received nothing and was "devastated".
Miss Khan, who has an 18-month-old son, said when she had paid the deposit in late October, the firm had agreed to give her a month to pay the rest, but called her after two weeks.
She said: "They said they wanted me to fetch it because it's in the way of new stock (and said) it's going to get damaged by all the stock in the way.
"[When I said I didn't have the money] the phone went quiet, they just went 'OK' and put the phone down."
Miss Khan said the firm had now stopped trading, leaving her with "no money and no pram".
She said: "I think so many have been affected, it's disgusting."
