Bosses have decided to keep Northfield Leisure Centre's pools in Birmingham shut ahead of a planned Â£8m redevelopment.
It is the second pool in the city to test positive for the parasite Cryptosporidium.
The gym will remain open to the public until 22 July, when the centre will close for refurbishment.
Cocks Moors Woods Leisure Centre's pool in Kings Heath reopened to the public on 25 June after a deep clean to remove the parasite.
The pools at Northfield Leisure Centre closed on 14 June following a separate incident and testing initially suggested the pool could be re-opened.
Brian Taylor, chairman for Birmingham Community Leisure Trust, said: "This was not an easy decision to make but, having estimated it would take at least five weeks, and potentially in excess of one hundred thousand pounds, to restore the water quality, it just doesn't make sense to invest this time and money."
The re-development will see a new leisure centre built on the same site, including two pools, an 80-station gym, exercise studio and community room.
