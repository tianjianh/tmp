The International Circus Club service celebrates "father of modern clowning" Joseph Grimaldi, who died in 1837.
This year marked the 70th outing of the colourful congregation, which started the tradition in the 1940s.
It began when a circus proprietor arranged for clowns to lay a wreath at Grimaldi's grave in Pentonville Road.
Remembrance services have been held ever since in various London churches.
This year's celebration was held at the Holy Trinity church in Dalston, east London, where clowns mingled with church goers and clergy members.
Clowns International says it is "the oldest organisation to support the Art Of Clowning".
