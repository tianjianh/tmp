The council has warned of "significant traffic delays" during the September 4-5 event and has told head teachers closing their school is an option in what is the first week of term.
Newport has 48 primary schools and nine secondary schools.
Up to 60 world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, are expected at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort.
In a statement, Newport council said: "The decision for a school to close lies with the individual school, however, the council has outlined to schools the different options they could choose to take such as having no adjustment to their school day, utilising inset days or closings as well as adjusting the school hours and finishing earlier."
The last time Britain hosted the Nato summit was 24 years ago in London. The event in Wales will also mark the 65th anniversary of Nato.
