The discovery was made at Robert Gordon University (RGU), in the Garthdee area, on Monday afternoon.
Police Scotland said it appeared to have been stolen from a property in Aberdeenshire four years ago, and officers were trying to establish how it got there.
The Garthdee area where it was found has been taped off.
Det Insp Allen Shaw, who is leading the investigation, said: "Early inquiries would indicate that this weapon appears to have been stolen from a property in the Aberdeenshire area in 2012.
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that at no point has there been any threat to the public."
A spokesman for RGU said: "A member of RGU's estates team found a weapon in the undergrowth."
The spokesman said it was immediately reported to police, and added: "There is absolutely no risk to our students or staff, whose safety is always our priority."
