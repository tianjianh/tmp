More than 300 children aged 13 and under have legal access to guns in England and Wales, figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In total, 3,602 children under 18 were in possession of firearms certificates, of which 327 were 13 or younger.
The Home Office figures for 2016/17 are for those who have certificates for firearms and/or shotguns.
The police force with the largest number of children having access to guns was Devon and Cornwall, which issued 206 certificates.
Overall, 580,658 children and adults were authorised to use guns last year - a reduction of 7,023 compared with 2015/16.
Previous Freedom of Information answers from the Home Office have shown children as young as seven to be in possession of a certificate.
There is no minimum age for applying for a shotgun certificate, but the law prohibits children from using them without the supervision of an adult aged at least 21, until they are 15.
In addition, children aged under 18 are banned from purchasing or hiring any firearm or ammunition.
Across all ages, Devon and Cornwall has the highest number of firearms certificates with 11,144, followed by Sussex (6,934) and North Yorkshire (6,734).
City of London Police issued only three licences, while Merseyside and Cleveland were the forces with the next lowest number of certificates - 1,029 and 1,125 respectively.
Applications for certificates are examined and then granted or refused by local police forces after a number of checks including interviews, visits and references.
Certificates can be revoked if a chief officer of the local force is satisfied the holder can no longer be entrusted with firearms or shotguns.
The figures showed that 358 firearms certificates and 1,216 shotgun certificates were revoked in 2016/17, with both numbers falling by 10% on the previous year.
The UK is seen as having some of the toughest gun control laws in the world.
A Home Office spokesman said there are "very strict controls on young certificate-holders, including around their tight supervision".
He added the Policing and Crime Act 2017 had strengthened firearms legislation by closing legal loopholes that had been exploited by criminals.
Peter Glenser, chairman of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said teaching children to use firearms safely and responsibly "removes the myths that surround firearms, and teaches both self-control and responsibility towards others".
He added: "Shooting has many aspects - from pest control through to Olympic and Commonwealth Games clay shooting - and it is vital that anyone wanting to compete at these top levels gets an early start in life," he added.
