Centre Owen Watkin says he is "disappointed," but understands why he was left out of Wales Under-20's squad for the Junior World Championship.

Watkin, who played a leading role as Wales earned their first ever Six Nations Grand Slam, will take a break ahead of the 2016-17 season.
"I'm quite disappointed because we've got a good team and we've got a good chance of winning it, but in the long run it's best if I don't go," he said.
"I took it on the chin."
The 19-year old Osprey continued: "It's important that I develop myself here (Ospreys) because hopefully this is where I'm going to be for most of my career.
"Steve Tandy (Ospreys coach) was pretty clear from the start that he didn't want me to go.
"They've been pretty open and honest about why they didn't want me to go... and I agreed with them pretty much most of the time."
Watkin was in the Ospreys side that beat Cardiff Blues 40-27 at the weekend, and played a key role in one of their six tries.
It was his 12th appearances for the Welsh region this season, but he will take time off after Ospreys' final game of the season against Ulster on Saturday.
