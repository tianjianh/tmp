The two roundhouses are based on an archaeological site found near Llansadwrn, Anglesey, in the 1980s.
The buildings feature six-foot thick clay walls and conical thatched roofs.
They were constructed with the help of hundreds of volunteers and school children from Ely and Caerau.
The farmstead, which originally dates from the time of the Roman conquest, is the first building to be completed as part of a multi-million pound scheme to redevelop St Fagans.
David Anderson, director general of National Museum Wales, said: "The reconstruction of this exceptional lost building from Anglesey, using archaeological evidence, is a significant part of the redevelopment of St Fagans.
"With the opening of Bryn Eryr, our visitors now have a place to hear ancient stories, learn traditional skills and share experiences with their friends and families."
