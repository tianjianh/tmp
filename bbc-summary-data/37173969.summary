GCSE results same in Wales for third year running

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The GCSE A* to C pass rate has stayed at 66.6% in Wales for the third year running.

But Welsh results are now the same as England as a whole and better than most of its regions.
Top A* and A passes were up slightly (0.2%) to 19.4% and better than northern and midland English regions.
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said it was "another strong performance".
Teaching unions have warned comparing Welsh and English results is increasingly difficult due to significant changes to exams.
There are wide-ranging reforms to qualifications in Wales and other parts of the UK under way.

Entries in French were down again this year while the number taking maths in the summer was affected by the start of a new course last September, with the first pupils due to take exams in November.
Ms Williams, on a visit to Cefn Hengoed school in Swansea, said: "Teachers and pupils can be proud that Wales has maintained our record pass rate.  I will continue to focus on raising standards and ambitions for excellence across all our schools."
David Reynolds, professor of education at Swansea University, said results have varied only slightly over the past few years.
"There have been similar results and you could say the system is maxed out if you like," he said.
"But that's not true. If you look at the range of variations in schools, there are huge differences still between the top and bottom performing schools, suggesting there is still room for improvement."
New Welsh-specific GCSEs started being taught in schools and colleges last September but they will not be awarded until next summer.
More new qualifications will be rolled out over the next two years.
At the same time there are major changes being introduced in England, and next summer GCSEs there will be graded 9 to 1 rather than A* to G.
Teachers said care needed to be taken when looking at the drop in science results with around 4,000 15-year-olds and under - who would have done BTEC qualifications in the past - now included.
National Association of Head Teachers policy director in Wales Rob Williams said the results came with the biggest policy changes in education in a generation already under way.
"It's really difficult to compare," he said. "You have very diverging policies between England and Wales and there are changes in GCSE in both the countries and there are more coming in.
"Reflecting over the years is going to be much, much harder. For us in Wales it's going to be more important looking at the next three, four or five years and look back at how we're improving ourselves."
The NUT's Owen Hathway said: "That we have seen the record high pass rate sustained yet again, especially against the backdrop of major education reforms, is a fantastic achievement.  It is also pleasing to see the pass rate for the very top grades is up".
Qualifications Wales chief executive Philip Blaker added: "The overall GCSE results for Wales this summer are stable, with some small shifts which can be considered normal variation.
"In some subjects, performance has improved, such as French, geography and history whereas, in others it has fallen, for example ICT, religious studies and Spanish.
"This is to be expected since cohorts vary from one year to the next, in both size and ability."
Rebecca Williams, from teaching union Ucac, said: "Comparisons, both with previous years within Wales, and with other nations in the UK, are going to become increasingly difficult - indeed futile, as the changes work their way through the system."
She said the Pisa international test results - due again by the end of this year - could become an increasingly important benchmark.
"It's possible that - for better or for worse - external measures such as Pisa will take on greater importance in measuring educational performance in a comparative context," she added.
The Conservatives said they were worried about a stagnation in A* to C passes, with the results offering  "a mishmash of reasons to be both optimistic and downbeat".
