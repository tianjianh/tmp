[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bath have released New Zealand-born utility back Dan Bowden from his contract by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bowden, 30, who plays at inside centre or fly-half, has played only six league games for Bath since joining them in January 2016.
He joined Bath from Super Rugby side Blues in his native Auckland, following spells at fellow Premiership clubs Leicester and London Irish.
Meanwhile, winger Jack Wilson, 27, has extended his contract until 2019.
The former Saracens man joined from Otago in October, on a deal until the end of the season, and has scored three tries in eight appearances.
On Bowden, director of rugby Todd Blackadder said: "He's a great professional.
"We'd like to thank Dan for the commitment he has shown during his time at the club."
