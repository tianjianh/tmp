The 24-year-old maintained the sparkling form which has seen him set new Scottish records at 5,000m and 3,000m in the past five weeks.
He broke away with four laps to go and enjoyed a celebratory final lap as he finished in 13 minutes, 44.00 seconds.
Tom Farrell pipped fellow Englishman Andy Vernon for second place.
"I am absolutely buzzing," said Butchart, a member of the Central Athletics Club based in Stirling.
"I was really nervous for today, it was my first chance of winning a British title and I am really happy to be going to Rio, I'm over the moon.
"This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.  I am so excited to represent my country and so looking forward to the Games.
"I have been working so hard to get it done."
