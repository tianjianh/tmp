[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour suspends candidate Sumon Hoque over drink-driving charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Labour general election candidate has been suspended after appearing in court charged with drink-driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sumon Hoque, 32, who is standing in the Banff and Buchan constituency, is also accused of driving a car with no MOT and without a licence.
Mr Hoque, of Aberdeen, denied the charges at the city's sheriff court.
The offences are alleged to have happened in Aberdeen's Bridge Street in May last year. The case is due to go to trial next month.
A Scottish Labour statement said: "Sumon Hoque has been suspended from representing the Labour Party and we have, therefore, withdrawn support from him as the general election candidate."
