Thousands of refugees should be allowed to into Northern Ireland, the deputy first minister has said.

Pressure has grown on the UK to take more of the people fleeing to Europe from Syria after the bodies of Greece-bound migrants, including a three-year-old boy, washed up on a Turkish beach.
Martin McGuinness spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday and told him that "more needs to be done".
He said Northern Ireland "could take a couple of thousand refugees" at first.
He described the situation as "absolutely horrendous".
But he said the prime minister firstly had to permit entry to the UK for more migrants before they could be accepted by Northern Ireland.
"David Cameron is the person who can free up the devolved administrations who I think are willing to do more," Mr McGuinness said.
"I have no doubt the people of the north would gladly welcome any moves to allow more refugees to come here."
Thousands of migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe by sea.
Images of a Syrian toddler, reportedly named Aylan Kurdi, who was found dead on a beach after the migrant boat he was travelling in sank have sparked an international outcry over the human cost of the crisis.
The Alliance Party has tabled an assembly motion calling for the UK to accept a significant number of migrants.
Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the UK had a "moral obligation" to help alleviate the crisis.
"Here in Northern Ireland we can ensure provisions are in place to take in as many people as we can," he said.
Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt said that while Northern Ireland had "limited resources and can play a very small part in any solution" the humane thing to do was to "play that part".
Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party said the government could not turn its back on the crisis.
"As individuals, we are not powerless to help through donations to the many agencies helping refugees directly and providing vital humanitarian aid," he added.
SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said the government needed to "commit to offering sanctuary to those so desperately in need of our help".
