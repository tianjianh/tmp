Derry City Football Club has held what it describes as "a public act of defiance" to show disapproval at attacks on visiting fans this season.

Dublin side Bohemians visit Brandywell Stadium on Friday night in the first home game since Dundalk supporters were attacked earlier this month.
Fans, residents and club officials marched from Lecky Road to Brandywell.
Club director Denis Bradley said it was a symbolic gesture to prevent further trouble and 500 people took part.
"This is a battle we will win, this is a battle we have to win, maybe not immediately but we are very resolved," he said.
Derry City's FAI Cup semi-final defeat by Dundalk FC was marred by trouble outside the ground.
A teenager suffered head injuries and a Dundalk supporters' bus was vandalised.
Police said they have been liaising closely with the local community and the club in preparation for Friday night's match.
Ch Insp Alan Hutton said: "There will be an appropriate policing operation to ensure the safety of all supporters attending, as well as minimising any impact on local communities.
"I would encourage all supporters to come and enjoy the game and respect the local community.
"I would also like to acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the local community and Derry City football club in preparation for tonight's match."
Derry City added that the trouble by a "group of youths" was not typical.
"There is a group of youngsters, we don't know where they are from or who they are, who appear to be using these occasions to misbehave," Mr Bradley said.
"Derry City are saying tonight: "Not in our name" and the local residents are joining us to say: "Not in our area" are you doing these things."
