The hosts, who are yet to win in the Premiership this season, went ahead through Max Crumpton's converted try.
But Reynold Lee-Lo and Josh Turnbull crossed to give Cardiff a 21-13 half-time advantage at Ashton Gate.
Cuthbert, who injured his groin in September, and Tom James both scored after the break for a bonus point.
Joe Joyce touched down for a last-minute consolation try for Bristol, who have not won since beating Rotherham in the Championship play-off final in May.
Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson:
"It's pleasing to win. It's a fantastic venue to play against a physical side and it rocked us in the first 10 minutes.
"What I'm pleased about is the reaction from last week. We spoke about it and we were desperately disappointed in how we rocked up and how we were dominated and we wanted to make sure we had a physical display tonight.
"We scored some good tries, we spent a lot of time defending against a very passionate Bristol side so it's pleasing to get the bonus point and away win."
