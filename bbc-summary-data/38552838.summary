They said that walking like the birds involves leaning forward so that the centre of gravity is on the front leg.
When humans walk normally, body weight is split almost evenly over both legs, which the doctors say increases the risk of losing your balance and falling on slippery surfaces.
So we went to test the theory, will walking like a penguin help Jenny's balance?
