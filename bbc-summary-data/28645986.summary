Body parts of Matthew Symonds, 34, of no fixed address in Swindon were found at a Biffa depot in Avonmouth.
Avon and Somerset Police said a preliminary post-mortem examination had been completed and more tests were needed to determine the cause of death.
A spokesman said there was "no indication" he had been assaulted.
Officers said the investigation remained focused in Swindon as it has been established the body was transported with commercial recycling waste from a site in the area.
Det Ch Insp Gareth Bevan said: "The team have carried out a large amount of inquiries over the weekend and so far there is no indication that Mr Symonds was assaulted.
"The investigation is ongoing and we continue to keep an open mind about the circumstances of his death."
