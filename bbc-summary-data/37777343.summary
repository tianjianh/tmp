'No Brexit agreement' on travel between Ireland and the UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Republic of Ireland does not have an agreement with the government on how to control travel to the UK from Irish ports and airports, the taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Enda Kenny was responding to a question in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) from the Sinn FÃ©in leader, Gerry Adams.
Mr Adams has raised the issue a number of times in the House.
The taoiseach said: "We don't have an agreement because we don't know what the British are looking for."
He was speaking as Jeremy Corbyn accused Theresa May of presiding over a "shambolic Tory Brexit", saying the government had no plan for the UK's EU departure.
Speaking at PMQs on Wednesday, the Labour leader called for clarity and warned of the effect of Brexit on the Irish border.
The PM pledged no return to the "borders of the past" saying a Common Travel Area had existed since 1923.
Next Wednesday will see an all-island forum on the implications of Brexit.
Mr Kenny said he had written to 300 people inviting them and that it was the intention that next week's meeting would be the first of several with separate meetings for different sectors and industries.
He said he would publish the names of those invited shortly.
Mr Adams said it was vital the Irish government did not resile from its responsibilities for the whole of the island because of Brexit.
"What happens in the north is our business," he said.
Mr Kenny replied that he had raised Northern Ireland in all his meetings with EU leaders since the UK vote to leave the EU.
He said he noted the comments made by the first Minister and Deputy First Minister in Down Street earlier this week after meeting Theresa May.
He again said he knew Brexit was politically different for them because of their different positions on the vote but he hoped there would be an agreed position by the time of the North-South Ministerial Council on 18 November.
He said he had asked his ministers to contact their Northern Ireland counterparts in advance of that gathering.
