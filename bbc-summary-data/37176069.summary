Mckayla Bruynius died at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children on Tuesday night, police said.

Lisinda Bruynius, Mckayla's mother and Rudy's wife, said: "I am in disbelief at what has happened."
More on the incident, and other stories in Devon and Cornwall
The family of five, from Morden in south-west London, were on holiday in Cornwall when the accident happened.
They were on rocks at South Fistral Beach when Mr and Mrs Bruynius and Mckayla were washed into the sea by a large wave. Mckayla's two brothers managed to stay on the rocks and were rescued by coastguards.
After being rescued by the RNLI, the toddler was flown to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and later transferred to Bristol.
In a statement, paying tribute to her husband and daughter, Mrs Bruynius said: "Rudy was a loving, caring and supportive husband, father and friend. He had a great sense of humour and was an active person. He always put other people first.
"Mckayla was a busy bee and always happy.
"I am in disbelief at what has happened.  I am so shocked at how quickly the sea condition changed on that day whilst we were enjoying a family time together in Cornwall."
Mrs Bruynius thanked the RNLI, emergency services and hospital staff and added: "I would especially like to thank the people of Cornwall for their messages of love and offers of help. I will never forget the close community spirit displayed towards us."
The inquest into Mr Bruynius's death was opened and adjourned by the Cornwall Coroner earlier, while an appeal to help the Bruynius family has raised more than Â£32,000.
Seven people have now died as a direct result of stormy conditions around the coast of the UK and Channel islands at the weekend.
