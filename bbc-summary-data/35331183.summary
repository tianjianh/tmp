John Rooney had an early opportunity for the home side, but failed to test Southport goalkeeper Max Crocombe, instead hitting the side netting.
Southport's Luke Foster then fired straight at home keeper Jon Worsnop after Chester failed to clear a corner.
The hosts had the best chance of all, but top scorer Ross Hannah fired over from six yards after Crocombe fumbled.
Chester, in 17th, are just eight points clear of trouble, having now failed to win in four National League games. Southport are two places, and three points, above them in 15th,
Chester manager Steve Burr told BBC Radio Merseyside:
"That's probably as good a 0-0 draw as you'll see. I was a lot more pleased with the way we played, following our win in the FA Trophy against Hungerford last week.
"But you can tell Southport have lots of confidence. You can see that from the results they've been having.
"The chances we did create we just didn't finish them. But, at the end, there was also a concern that they might go and pinch it."
