The landslip has blocked the railway line between Fort William and Mallaig and the nearby A830 since about 18:00 on Thursday.
Roads maintenance company Bear Scotland said about 100 tonnes of material was washed on to the railway and road.
ScotRail said there was disruption to services between Glasgow Queen Street and Mallaig terminating at or starting from Fort William.
The A830 is shut between the Lochailort and Drumsallie junction.
The landslide happened during a period of heavy downpours that affected Skye, Mull, the west Highlands and Argyll.
The Met Office issued a yellow "be aware" warning of heavy rain earlier this week and remains in place until 18:00 on Friday.
Bear Scotland said teams cleared away material from the road on Thursday evening, but further debris was washed onto the carriageway due to the heavy rains.
The conditions hampered the clear-up operations, resulting in the road remaining closed overnight.
A spokesperson said: "Following a geotechnical inspection, teams resumed the clear-up this morning at first light and are working to open the road as soon as possible.
"The road will remain closed until it is deemed safe to reopen.  Network Rail teams are also on site addressing the railway line.
"A diversion via the A861 is currently in place, motorists travelling from the south may wish to use the Corran Ferry to the A861 to reduce the length of the diversion."
Disruption to the ScotRail services is expected to last through to Friday evening.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: "We are grateful to customers for their patience during the disruption which is being caused by a landslip blocking the line.
"Buses are running in place of trains between Fort William and Mallaig to help keep people on the move.
"However, roads are also affected by the landslip and divisionary routes may be used, meaning extended journey times. We apologise to customers who are affected by this disruption."
Police Scotland said: "Police are assisting Bear Scotland and it is currently unknown when the road will reopen."
