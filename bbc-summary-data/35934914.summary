Northampton Town forward Marc Richards is anticipating a memorable weekend for the Cobblers as they face Notts County.

Chris Wilder's team could potentially win promotion from League Two on Saturday, on the same day they open Sixfields' new East Stand.
"I was here 10 years ago," Richards told BBC Radio Northampton. "To see a packed out Sixfields was amazing.
"Fingers crossed, if all the safety regulations go through, it'll be almost like a party atmosphere."
Work on the East Stand resumed in February, three months after Kelvin Thomas completed his takeover of the club, who hope to open it to supporters on Saturday.
"It's exciting times for the club, for the players and the fans, to sit in there and finally fill that bottom tier of the stadium," Richards continued.
A win against Notts County, plus favourable results in the games involving Accrington and Bristol Rovers, would see Northampton promoted.
Richards, 33, has scored 18 goals this season and having recently recovered from an injury that kept him out for six weeks, he is focused on helping the Cobblers finish the season in style.
"Stuck in four walls inside the physio room, it's tedious, it's hard, it's mentally tough," said the former Port Vale striker. "I want to help the lads now to get over the line.
"It's going to be a tough game, they're no mugs Notts County. They're not totally on form but you could say that about ourselves. We're not playing like we have been all season.
"We're so close you almost don't want to talk about it, but it (promotion) is going to come and when it does it will be amazing."
