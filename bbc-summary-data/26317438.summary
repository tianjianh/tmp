Landslip closes A83 road in Argyll

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The A83 road in Argyll will be closed overnight due to a landslip, with motorists in the area facing an almost 60-mile detour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Contractor Bear Scotland said the slip happened at about midday on Sunday at Butterbridge, close to the Rest and Be Thankful.
Bear said an emergency diversion using the Old Military Road was not possible because of where the slip happened.
Diversions in both directions have been put in place via the A82.
Bear Scotland said specialist engineers examined the site and found that the slope remained unstable and a large boulder needed to be removed.
It is the eighth time in five years that the road has been closed by a landslip.
The Old Military Road, which runs parallel to the main carriageway through Glen Croe, was reopened last year as an emergency diversion route to be used if the A83 was blocked.
