Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to wean it off dependence on oil has been greeted with a mixture  of hope and scepticism by social media users.

Some internet comment  is optimistic about the plan but others express doubts about its feasibility.
Some propose their own vision for a better future,  accompanied by warnings  that corruption  could impede growth.
The hashtag "National Transformation 2030" topped  the Saudi trending list on 25 April, with almost 250,000 tweets.
Many leading public figures have welcomed the plan, urging the people to support it.
TV cleric Ahmed al-Shugairi hoped the proposal would bring "safety, justice and national unity".
Comedian Hatoon Kadi,  who has 116,000  Twitter followers,  tweeted: "We are optimistic. May God help our leaders."
Obstetrician  and women's health campaigner Samia al-Amoudi,  who has 97,000 followers, tweeted  "Vision 2030 is the beginning of a new era."
Social media users also praised the deputy crown prince for spearheading the programme. Leading journalist  Mohammed Alehaidib, who has 164,000 followers, tweeted: "Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has a  profound and transparent vision; he cares about Saudi citizens."
Journalist  Khaled al-Jarallah urged Saudis to "accept transformation and be flexible".
On the other hand, some  users express  scepticism about the plan, pointing to corruption in state institutions,  the country's  poor human rights record  and the lack of representative institutions.
Journalist  Turki Shalhoub,  who has 9,587 followers, said "#National Transformation 2030 cannot be achieved with corrupt tools. In order to achieve this transformation, we need an elected parliament."
The Hureyaksa (Towards Freedom) account,  which has 467,000 followers, spoke  of  "pro-forma change accompanied by hypocrisy, that  will  drown citizens in rosy dreams" , adding "there will be no change  in favour of citizens' interests at the expense of the ruling Al-Saud family".
User Fahd al-Gherire  said change should start with the release of "all peaceful political prisoners".
Alternative visions
Some Saudi Tweeters  put forward their own visions and recommendations,  often featuring better health care  and  public services.
Women in particular call for more  civil  rights.  User 'RaeFaH' said that the  plan  should "address men and women issues equally", and "Mariam Nadia Ahmed" called for an end to the male  chaperoning  of  adult women.
