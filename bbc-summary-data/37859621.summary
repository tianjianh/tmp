A new Mural Trail has been devised aimed at showcasing artwork which has been appearing on walls around Glasgow.
Art Pistol, which creates public art, street art, murals and artistic window graphics, are behind many of the installations.
A spokesman said the group was "delighted with how the city and visitors have embraced the murals".
