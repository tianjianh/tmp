The UK Music report, called Wish You Were Here, calculated that 928,000 people made visits associated with festivals, concerts and other music-related events.
It suggested the business helped sustain 3,230 full-time jobs.
UK Music chief executive Jo Dipple said the appetite for live music was continuing to grow.
Perth and Perthshire MP Pete Wishart, a professional musician, said: "Scotland attracts almost a million music tourists each year.
"People come to our nation to enjoy our festivals and gigs, generating £105m in spend in the process."
He added: "Scotland is rich in creativity. We must continue to champion our creative industries and the vital role that they provide to our communities and economy."
The report said music festivals and concerts had been "adding to Scottish happiness and wellbeing for decades".
Jo Dipple added: "The appetite for live music has continued to grow.
"Last year overseas music tourism increased by 16%, whilst British music events were attended by a staggering 27.7 million people in 2015.
"What this report shows, unequivocally, is the economic value of live music to communities, cities and regions."
