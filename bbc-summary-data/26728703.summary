[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A previously unseen short story by US writer Tennessee Williams, inspired in part by an old college girlfriend, has been published for the first time.

Crazy Night refers to a student named Anna Jean - a reference to Anna Jean O'Donnell, whom Williams briefly dated while at the University of Missouri.
Williams wrote poetry about O'Donnell but only made passing mention to her in his notebooks and memoirs.
The short story features in the spring edition of literary journal The Strand.
According to its managing editor Andrew Gulli, the story, believed to have been written in the 1930s, could be "the missing piece of the puzzle" surrounding Williams' formative romantic liaison.
The writer would go on to use his mother Edwina as the model for Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire and based the character of Laura Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie on his sister Rose.
In Crazy Night, the narrator, a college freshman on an unnamed campus, has an intimate encounter with Anna Jean only to lose her to another student.
The title of the story refers to a college ritual during which students are expected to binge on alcohol and sex.
