An image has been issued of the rider who was at an "unauthorised motorbike meet" at which a crash in Corringham left a woman needing her leg amputated.
Det Insp Scott Egerton, of Essex Police, said the crashed bike was seen being loaded into a van with "Essex Vehicle Hire" on the side.
"This was a really serious crash at an unauthorised motorbike meet," he said.
"We need to identify those people pictured, locate them and speak to them. I also want to locate the bike and the van.
"A number of people at this event were wearing black hooded tops with a white logo on the back. I am keen to identify what that logo is, what it refers to, and if it identifies a group they belong to."
