Inverness CT: Richie Foran ready to drop 'bottling' players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richie Foran plans to drop players he believes are "bottling it" as his Inverness Caledonian Thistle side sit bottom of the Premiership table.

Hamilton Academical went three points clear after Tuesday's 3-0 home win over Caley Thistle.
"I think the majority of them fight," manager Foran said of his players.
"But there's a few can't handle the occasion, can't handle where we are in the league, but they are the ones that have to have a rest now."
Foran ran the dressing-room as captain until taking over as manager in the summer, but now he has turned the spotlight on his former team-mates after a run of 13 games without a win other than in the Scottish Cup against League Two outfit Elgin City.
"That's the worst defeat of the season," he told BBC Scotland.
"Forget about top-six now. That's done. We're in a relegation battle.
"Some of our players are obviously not up to that challenge.
"Some of our players haven't got the bottle.
"I need to bring in the ones that are ready to battle, ready to fight for everything."
Foran thought his players' heads went down after Greg Tansey failed to equalise when his penalty was saved by Gary Woods at a time when he thought his side were on top.
"A few of the boys started hiding, which is disappointing, and then there's individual mistakes," he said.
"I just told them straight. I can see who's bottling it. I can see who doesn't want to take the ball.
"I'm not stupid. I can tell by body language. I can see players taking a step to the left so they don't need to take the ball to the right.
"It's not them all. I thought Billy Mckay was excellent for us actually without any help around him."
Asked if he can save Caley Thistle from relegation, Foran said: "Definitely, but I need the help of the players.
"You can set up shapes, tactics, but they've got to perform when they go out there and walk across that white line.
"I am not going to take the full blame for this. I'll take my fair share, but the players have got to stand up and be counted and they didn't some of them.
"Am I too harsh? I don't know. We score the penalty and maybe go on to win the game.
"It is incidents like that that haven't gone for us this season, but you can't keep making excuses either."
