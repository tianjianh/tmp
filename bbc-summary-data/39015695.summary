The 20-year-old, from County Down, dominated the race and is now leading the World Cup ranking in the event.
He has secured back-to-back gold medals after winning the points race in the second World Cup round in Apeldoorn.
"This one means a lot more to me than Apeldoorn because of the fashion in which I won," said Downey.
"It was my first time racing at altitude so I needed to be careful.
"My pre-race tactic was to chill for 30 to 40 laps and then to come to the front and turn the gas on. I made three key moves in the race."
Ireland's Lydia Boylan was sixth in the Women's Omnium, having made a blistering start by winning the first event, the scratch race.
