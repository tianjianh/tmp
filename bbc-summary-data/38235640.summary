Former commander welcomes jailed marine Blackman's appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former commanding officer of jailed Royal Marine Sgt Alexander Blackman has backed the decision to grant him a fresh appeal.

Col Oliver Lee said he is "extremely pleased" that the case will be heard by the Courts Martial Appeal Court for a second time.
He resigned in protest after Blackman was convicted of murdering a Taliban insurgent at a court martial in 2013.
Blackman, 42, from Taunton, was known during his trial as Marine A.
Col Lee said the circumstances surrounding the killing needed to be reconsidered.
"A much more balanced and full picture of the situation in which he found himself needed to be presented," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Blackman applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) after his earlier appeal was dismissed in 2014, which referred the conviction to the court after an 11-month investigation.
The court will look at new expert evidence relating to Blackman's mental state at the time of the killing.
It will also consider that the alternative verdict of "unlawful act manslaughter" was not available at his original trial.
Col Lee said the court martial should have taken greater account of the acute stress Blackman was under at the time.
"I don't seek to condone his behaviour or exonerate him from his responsibilities," he said.
"I took a view that the proceedings against Sgt Blackman hadn't been balanced."
David James Smith, lead CCRC commissioner on the case, said there was a "real possibility" that Blackman's second appeal would be successful.
"There are new issues - principally relating to Mr Blackman's state of mind at the time of the shooting," he said.
The killing on 15 September 2011 took place after a patrol base in Helmand province came under fire from two insurgents.
One of the attackers was seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field.
Footage from the helmet-mounted camera of another marine in his unit, 42 Commando, showed Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol.
Blackman was convicted of murder in November 2013 and jailed for life. He lost an appeal in May of the following year, but his 10-year minimum term was reduced to eight years.
Col Lee asked that "his case is considered in the round, in the broadest sense, such that he is dealt with in a fair manner."
