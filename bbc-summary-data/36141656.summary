In their first season since reforming, Peter Beadle's reborn Bulls secured the Midland League title with a game to spare, winning 4-0 at Coventry Sphinx.
Having begun their new life in English football's ninth tier, they now step up next season to the Southern League.
"We did it in the manner we've played all season," Beadle told BBC Sport.
"I really could not heap enough praise on the players at what they've done. The expectation at this club is massive, playing in front of such big crowds all season and we could have let it get to us. But we didn't.
"We've done everything with class. A lot of players have played their part in taking the club to the next level. We have scored some fantastic goals and I could not be prouder."
He added: "It was always going to be hard. But I've always loved a challenge and the players have stood up to the challenge. When you demand high standards, you tend to find the cream comes to the top."
It is 40 years since Hereford last won a title - lifting the Division Three trophy when the old Hereford United beat Shrewsbury Town 3-1 at Edgar Street.
More recently, it is exactly two years since the last-day win at Aldershot on 26 April 2014, which completed a remarkable escape from relegation for the already financially-challenged Bulls in the Conference, sending Chester down instead.
Hereford were then thrown out of the Conference six weeks later for non-payment of bills, with Chester reinstated, and were then relegated to the Southern League before being wound up in the High Court on 19 December 2014.
Peter Beadle's Hereford FC are on course to win four pieces of silverware this season. As well as the Midland League title, they are also in the Midland League Cup final and are through to the Herefordshire Senior Cup final.
On top of that, Bulls fans will head to Wembley for the first time on Sunday 22 May, when they meet north-east side Morpeth in the FA Vase final.
Hereford have been told they will play next season in the 22-club Southern League Division One South and West.
Their local derby - in the eighth tier of English football - will be against Evesham United, 48 miles away.
