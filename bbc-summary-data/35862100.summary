Turnbull, who spent 15 years with the early morning show, will take the radio station's mid-morning slot at 10:00 on Saturdays and Sundays.
He said it would be "a real joy to turn from news to music, especially at a more civilised hour".
The 60-year-old, who is also the host of new BBC quiz show Think Tank, will begin broadcasting on 9 April.
The station's managing editor Sam Jackson said Turnbull was "one of those rare presenters who everyone feels like they know".
"His warmth and wit have endeared him to millions of television viewers and now we're thrilled that he's joining Classic FM's weekend team."
Turnbull, who worked as a foreign news correspondent before joining Breakfast in 2001, left the BBC's flagship morning broadcast in February.
He said he wanted to dispel the idea that leaving Breakfast meant he was retiring completely, adding he would be "cluttering up the airwaves in one respect or another for a while yet".
Fellow BBC game show host Alexander Armstrong, who fronts Pointless, will join Turnbull in the station's new weekend schedule, taking over from him at 13:00 on both days.
The changes will also see existing presenters Alan Titchmarsh and Aled Jones move to the breakfast slots on Saturday and Sunday respectively.
