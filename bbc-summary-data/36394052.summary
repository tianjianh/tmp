The Scottish Championship club have also retained defender Frazer Wright and midfielders Garry Fleming and Grant Gallagher, also on one-year contracts.
Pettigrew had previously played under Sons manager Stevie Aitken with the Blues, who signed the 29-year-old from Auchinleck Talbot in 2014.
Midfielder Andy Stirling had already agreed to move from Stranraer and striker Robert Thomson from Brechin.
Pettigrew made 45 appearances for Stranraer last season as they finished fourth in League One.
Having missed out on promotion after losing to Ayr United in the play-off final, Pettigrew himself takes a step up a division next season.
The 37-year-old Wright made 31 appearances for Dumbarton after leaving St Johnstone in August.
Fleming, the 29-year-old who arrived from Irvine Meadow in 2012, contributed 11 goals in 42 appearances.
Gallacher made 37 appearances in the 25-year-old's first season for Dumbarton since arriving from Stranraer.
