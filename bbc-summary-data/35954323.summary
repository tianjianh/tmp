Grant Broster, 56, from Guildford, was on his family's kayak last Monday when it capsized in front of his son Max.
The volunteer search crews have worked from "sun up to sun down" to find him, the family said on a fundraising page.
Surrey Search & Rescue said it was "grateful and humbled" by the family's words and actions.
The family has raised more than Â£2,000 so far.
Alongside the donations are tributes which refer to Mr Broster as an "inspiration" and "a lovely, kind man who will be missed."
On the Just Giving page, set up by Emma Leach, the family reveal how Grant's son Max and the family dog Joey jumped into the fast-flowing river in an attempt to help him.
"They were unable to reach him and were both pulled to safety by the kindest people who live at the scene," it adds.
Search crews mobilised helicopters, drones, sonar, dogs and divers, leaving "no stone unturned", the family said.
Despite extensive searches, Mr Broster has not been found.
The family said the "professional dedication" of the voluntary emergency services was "humbling and extraordinary".
"We, Grant's family, are eternally grateful to them and we would like to give something back," they add.
Surrey Search & Rescue said it was "grateful and humbled by this act of kindness" from the family "especially at such a difficult time for them".
It added: "This makes such a vast difference to us and helps us do all we can to look after our local community when in need."
