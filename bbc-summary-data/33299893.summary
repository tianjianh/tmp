Glastonbury: Kanye West delivers headline set

US rapper Kanye West has delivered his highly anticipated Glastonbury festival set, telling fans he is "the greatest living rock star on the planet".

West's headline booking had caused some controversy and his performance divided opinion among the crowd on site.
He opened with number one hit Stronger and performed on a largely bare stage with a bank of white lights above.
But his set was briefly interrupted by a stage invasion by British comedian and prankster Lee Nelson.
The prankster, real name Simon Brodkin, wrote on Twitter: "Some people were saying Kanye shouldn't headline Glastonbury so I thought I'd give him a hand."
But he was swiftly bundled off stage by a security guard and West resumed his song Black Skinhead.
At one point, he left the stage to travel above the heads of the crowd in the cradle of a cherry picker for the songs Touch the Sky and All of the Lights.
His performance came after more than 134,000 people signed a petition objecting to his booking, and Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis had death threats on Twitter from a disgruntled fan.
Kanye West's appearance was one of the weekend's biggest talking points.
He is one of the biggest names in popular music, with 21 Grammy Awards under his belt and 11 million albums sold in the US alone.
However he is notoriously erratic and uncompromising, comparing himself to figures including Jesus and Leonardo Da Vinci, and occasionally launching into long mid-set rants.
But he kept his mid-song chat relatively short at Glastonbury.
He did not directly address the pre-show debate, simply telling fans: "Thank you for coming out tonight."
The online petition had called for him to be dropped from the Glastonbury bill and be replaced by a rock band. But the rapper has labelled the petition "an insult to music fans all over the world".
At one stage West was joined on stage by Bon Iver's Justin Vernon to perform their song Lost In The World.
And afterwards, the rap star revealed that the song had been inspired by his wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who was watching the show.
He said:  "This song was extra special for me. I was trying to explain to a girl I loved so much how much I loved her. She brought this poetry out in me that became the lyrics and she ended up becoming my wife and she's here tonight."
But he put the focus firmly back on himself when, before introducing one of his biggest hits, Gold Digger, he said:  "I'm going to say this tonight because 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, I might not be able to say it, but I can say it tonight... You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet."
Kanye West followed hitmaker Pharrell Williams, who played crowd-pleasing tunes including Happy, Blurred Lines and Get Lucky on the Pyramid Stage.
He was joined by a group of children on stage to dance to Happy.
Other acts performing on Saturday included Burt Bacharach, George Ezra and Paloma Faith.
Celebrities spotted at the festival included Adele, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, Lewis Hamilton, Stella McCartney and James Corden.
The weather on the Somerset site brightened up on Saturday following Friday's rain, but showers scattered the site on Sunday morning.
Rock veterans The Who will close the festival on Sunday, Lionel Richie will perform in the festival's now-established Sunday afternoon legends slot and Tibetan spiritual leader The Dalai Lama will visit the festival's Green Fields.
