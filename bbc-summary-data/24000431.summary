Stephen Lee: Match-fixing verdict reserved to later date

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world number five Stephen Lee's match-fixing tribunal has concluded in Bristol, with Adam Lewis QC reserving judgement in the case to a later date.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee has been suspended since October 2012 and denies allegations which relate to tournaments in 2008 and 2009.
The 38-year-old is defending himself at the independent tribunal against match-fixing claims centred on seven games.
Sport Resolutions UK is hearing the case, which could lead to a lengthy ban for Lee if he is found guilty.
One of the games in which Lee, who was ranked eighth in the world at the time of his suspension, is accused of breaching rules took place at the 2009 World Championship in Sheffield.
Lee, 38, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, faces further claims involving three matches at the 2008 Malta Cup, two games at the UK Championship that year and one match at the 2009 China Open.
The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association has brought the case against him.
Lee is accused of providing information "that is not publicly available" and deliberately influenced "the outcome or conduct of a game or frame".
Fellow professional Joe Jogia was given a two-year ban in July 2012 for "lower-end" offences after an investigation into suspicious betting patterns on a match in which he played.
Australian Quinten Hann was banned for eight years in 2006 for match-fixing offences after a newspaper sting in which he accepted a proposal to lose a China Open match.
While Hann remains suspended, South African Peter Francisco has returned to the game at a low level after serving a five-year match-fixing ban handed down in 1995, following his 10-2 loss to Jimmy White at the World Championship.
