[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dounreay to be subject of PhD research project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The impact of the Dounreay nuclear complex on the north of Scotland will be examined in a new academic research project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A PhD studentship has been set up to look at what effects the experimental nuclear power site has had on nearby Thurso and surrounding areas.
Established in the 1950s, Dounreay's buildings - including its landmark sphere - are being demolished.
The site is to be cleared and cleaned up by 2029.
The new PhD has been set up by the University of the Highlands and Islands and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.
Work to demolish the landmark Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR) sphere could start in seven years' time.
The structure, also known as the dome and the golf ball, has been a feature of the north Caithness coast for almost 60 years.
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has recommended that the DFR be decontaminated by 2022 so it can then be demolished.
There were previous plans to retain the dome.
Historic Scotland had considered listing the building so that it would be conserved.
