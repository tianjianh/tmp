Operation Pallial: alleged sex abuse victim left 'in limbo'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who claims he was sexually abused in a children's home two decades ago has said he no longer wants to pursue his allegation because of the length of time it is taking to come to court.

Despite making his complaint in November 2012, he said he has been left "in limbo" with limited progress.
He was first interviewed by the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial team in February 2013.
A Pallial spokesman said it will discuss the concerns he has raised.
His complaint related to his time at the home two decades ago, during which he claims he was groomed into a sexual relationship by a female carer when he was 16.
After contacting the police, he was interviewed by the Pallial team- which was set up to investigate allegations of historic child abuse in north Wales.
Evidence was collected and in August 2015, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
He is still waiting to learn if the case will go to court.
He said: "I think perhaps it's taken this long to understand the implications of someone's behaviour on someone so vulnerable."
He added: "It really feels as if I'm in limbo at the moment in terms of work and relationships and things. I just need that closure."
While he no longer wants to be part of any ongoing investigation or trial, he will not be withdrawing his complaint.
An Operation Pallial spokesman said they were "aware of the concerns expressed by this victim and will discuss them with partners."

Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales Ed Beltrami pointed to the complexity of some Pallial cases and the volume of related information.
"We recognise that victims are central to everything we do and clearly it is a concern to us if a victim feels that the system is not delivering justice for them in a timely fashion," he said.
The complainant no longer lives in north Wales and said he has not been able to get the counselling he was promised.
Support for Operation Pallial victims is co-ordinated through Conwy Council.
The authority's director of social care, Jenny Williams conceded that outside north Wales there have been some difficulties.
"We have been able to access support but what is beyond our control are things like travelling distance, waiting times," she said.
