It follows a recommendation to close the Pantycelyn hall of residence indefinitely to make it "fit for purpose" in the future.
Some 50 Welsh-speaking staff met to discuss the move.

The move to close Pantycelyn was made by the college's finance committee in May after what officials described as "lengthy, rigorous" discussions.
The committee said the building would still be used for Welsh-language services.
It suggested alternative Welsh-medium accommodation could be made available on its Penglais campus from September.
In an online statement released following the committee meeting reiterated its stance on Welsh-medium student accommodation.
College officials said they appreciate "the need for a community where the Welsh language is spoken every day".
"Discussion have already taken place with representatives of the UMCA and Aberystwyth University Students Union on the provision of accommodation and communal spaces for the Welsh speaking community of students, should Pantycelyn not be available for the next academic year," they added.
Pantycelyn has been the designated Welsh-speaking hall of residence since 1974, and prior to that was home to Prince Charles for a term in 1969.
A decision on whether the hall will close will be considered by the university's council on 22 June.
