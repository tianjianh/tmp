Zack Davies, from Mold, was arrested at the store and will appear at Wrexham Magistrates' Court later.
North Wales Police said the attack in Mold had left a 24-year-old man from Yorkshire with life-changing injuries.
Det Ch Insp Alun Oldfield said the victim and his family were being supported by specialist family liaison officers.
He said: "We are encouraged by the large number of witnesses who have so far come forward to help us build a complete picture of what took place. However, if others can also assist I'd ask they contact police."
The incident happened on Wednesday. The supermarket and its petrol station reopened the following morning.
Police say they are treating the incident as racially motivated.
