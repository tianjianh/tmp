Dunfermline Athletic have secured the signing of midfielder Nat Wedderburn from Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

The 24-year-old Englishman made only 11 starts, and seven substitute appearances, for Caley Thistle.
He had joined the Scottish Premiership club from Dunfermline's Fife neighbours, Cowdenbeath, last summer.
"You go from playing every game to playing a couple then sitting out a few so it was very frustrating," Wedderburn told the Pars' You Tube channel.
The midfielder, who began his career with Stoke City and had spells with Notts County, Hereford United, Northampton Town and Corby Town, becomes Pars manager Allan Johnston's first signing since his side won the League One title and promotion.
Wedderburn helped deny Dunfermline promotion to the second tier two seasons ago with a play-off victory while with Cowdenbeath.
Johnston said: "I was keen on him last year when he was at Cowdenbeath.
"He can play a couple of different positions, which is going to be handy because we're going to have a small squad.
"He can play in the centre of the park as a holding midfield player or he can play centre-half."
Meanwhile, Dunfermline have handed new one-year contracts to goalkeeper David Hutton and striker Lewis Spence despite the pair playing periphery roles this season.
The 30-year-old Hutton has only played twice since signing from Ayr United last summer, while 20-year-old midfielder Spence spent the second half of the season on loan to League One rivals Brechin City.
However, 25-year-old striker Ryan Wallace, who scored 10 goals in 41 appearances this season, and 22-year-old midfielder Shaun Byrne, who played 27 times, have not been offered new contracts.
