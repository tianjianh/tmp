David Benioff and Daniel B.Weiss will receive Doctorate of Fine Art (DFA) degrees for distinguished services to the arts in a ceremony in the autumn.
The HBO fantasy adventure series is partly filmed in Northern Ireland.
Series six of the multi-award winning drama is due to begin on 24 April.
Ulster University will award 11 other honorary degrees as part of their summer graduation ceremonies.
Among those who will receive the honours are civil rights leader Ivan Cooper, the commissioner for older people Claire Keatinge and Sandra Peake from WAVE trauma centre.
Other recipients include supreme court judge Lady Brenda Hale and the auxiliary bishop of Down and Connor, Dr Anthony Farquar.
UU Vice-Chancellor Prof Paddy Nixon said that the honorary graduates could inspire students.
"It is vital that they have real life, relevant examples of people who have excelled, who inspire, and who truly make a difference to the world around them," he said.
"Our honorary degree recipients not only represent the diversity of the sectors in which our graduates are employed, they represent the determination, confidence, talent and creativity which we know our students can and will emulate as they progress in their chosen careers."
UU's summer graduation ceremonies take place from 27 June - 5 July 2016.
