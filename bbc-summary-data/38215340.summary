Pisa tests: Reaction to Wales results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reaction has been coming in to the latest set of Pisa test results,  which sees Wales' 15-year-old pupils scoring below the international average in maths, reading and science for a third time.

Wales is also last in the UK again, behind England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in all three subject areas.
POLITICAL RESPONSE
The Welsh Conservatives said the results marked a "decade of underachievement" and represented a "scandal of monumental proportions".
Education spokesman Darren Millar AM said: "In spite of all the tough talking and promises to do better from the first minister, today's figures place us, yet again, in the bottom half of the global education league table and re-confirm Wales' status as the worst performing school system in the UK."
Plaid Cymru said the results showed Labour had "failed, failed and failed again when it comes to our children's futures".
Education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd AM urged new Education Secretary Kirsty Williams to show "clarity of vision and an unstinting focus on delivery".
He added: "I urge her to stay on course in order to push through the proposed reforms and rebuild an education system fit for the next generation."
Mark Williams MP, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, called the results  "extremely disappointing" but "sadly it is not a surprise".
"We are playing catch up and cannot afford to waste a single moment in raising standards for all pupils and schools," he said.
"It is no easy task, but Kirsty Williams and the Welsh Lib Dems have already proved ourselves up to the job."
Nathan Gill of UKIP said: "This Welsh Labour Government are guilty of many things - but their failure to equip our children for an ever more competitive 21st Century must count as one of their greatest crimes".
EDUCATION EXPERTS
Andreas Schleicher, director of education at the OECD, said: "It's true there is a big performance gap but there are signs of improvement, if you look at the latest mathematics results - they're going in the right direction.
"But Wales could have been where England is today - there's no reason why Wales is so far behind but I see many things in place now that are putting it on a more promising track."
He said the country was building a new curriculum and moving from "reform fatigue" to people taking ownership of change, which was an important ingredient for success in the long run.
Dylan William, of the UCL Institute of Education, urged caution on the results for Wales - saying changes took a long time to filter through and it could be another decade before rankings would reflect what was happening in today's classrooms.
Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the Institute of Education, University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said the Pisa results were not as good as hoped for but not unexpected and reforms would take time to take effect.
"Pisa is important but it must be taken in the round," he said.
"Other performance indicators suggest Wales' education system is on the right path and we must hold our nerve.
"The Welsh Government has embarked on an ambitious transformation agenda that has the potential to make a real difference - but we must not be blown off course
TEACHING PROFESSION
David Evans from the National Union of Teachers (NUT) counselled against a new raft of reforms in response to the results.
"We must ensure that we learn one of the major lessons from the highest performing nations in Pisa, and ensure the education system of our small nation has clarity of vision and consistency of approach.
"Too often in Wales, frequently in reaction to Pisa, we have seen knee jerk reactions which have actually hindered educational progress.
"Indeed the OECD itself has criticised the Welsh Government in the past for establishing and creating 'reform fatigue' in Wales.
"With the proposals around the new curriculum, new qualifications and potential changes to the way we train teachers and utilise the supply sector, there are already big reforms on the horizon which will have positive impacts."
Rex Philips, national officer for the NASUWT Wales accused the former education minister Leighton Andrews of turning the Pisa results of 2010 into a "disaster zone" for the Welsh Government.
"Huw Lewis attempted to repair the damage caused by his predecessor by acknowledging that moving to a curriculum fit for Pisa was going to take some time," he said.
He added Kirsty Williams "would do well to just note the Pisa outcomes and decide whether to continue in the quest for a curriculum fit for Pisa or stand up for a curriculum that is fit for purpose for Wales."
Rob Williams, director of policy for the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said: "We would urge the Welsh Government to now stick to the current policy path for curriculum reform and investment in the profession.
"With the right level of committed resource, accountability that values progress and no additional initiatives on top of what school leaders are already contending with, children and young people of Wales will have the best opportunities to succeed."
Ywain Myfyr, policy officer with Welsh teaching union UCAC said although Pisa was an international measure it was still "a very narrow indicator" and the results needed to be put into context.
"We certainly shouldn't let them distract us from the crucial reforms that are already in progress," he said.
Rachel Curley acting director of ATL Cymru, said: "This is not the time for hand wringing or panic in response to the Pisa results. It would have been naive to expect major improvements since the last set of results four years ago".
Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said it was "far from the doomsday scenario expected".
"While Wales may not have gone rocketing up the rankings, it has also not slipped far behind. A rise in the maths scores has offset a slight fall in science and reading. Some other nations have fared far worse."
BUSINESS
Neil Carberry, CBI director for people and skills policy said the drop in performance in Wales was a concern.
"The most effective response to today's findings is focusing on what works across reading, mathematics and science - high-quality school leadership and great teachers delivering an engaging curriculum which includes strong basic skills, attitudes and behaviours that can equip young people to succeed," he said.
"In recent years, the Welsh Government has made big efforts to turn this around - business supports these efforts, and today's results show that the government must continue its focus on delivery."
