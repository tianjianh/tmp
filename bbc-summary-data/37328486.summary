Griffiths, 26, suffered a hamstring tear against Aberdeen two weeks ago, which forced him out of Saturday's Old Firm match against Rangers.
Manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed it will also keep him out at the Nou Camp.
"Leigh is a brilliant young player but we have to look after him for the season. He won't be involved against Barcelona," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"We got the scan results back and he has a grade one [hamstring tear]. He has had it before and been out for up to seven days.
"He thought he could get through it but it will probably be next weekend [Celtic play Inverness in the Premiership on Sunday] or just after that we will have him back."
Griffiths was Scotland's leading scorer with 40 goals last season and has already notched seven in nine games in the current campaign.
The injury also forced him to withdraw from the Scotland squad for last Sunday's 5-1 win in Malta.
