The 51-year-old was discovered in a house in the Toberhewney Hall area of Lurgan at about 02:50 GMT on Friday.
A man of the same age has been arrested.
A post mortem examination is expected to take place later.
DUP MLA Carla Lockhart said it was "very alarming news in what is a very quiet residential area".
"My sympathies are with the family of the deceased," she said.
"The police are treating this as a murder investigation and therefore I would encourage anyone who has any information to come forward to the PSNI."
