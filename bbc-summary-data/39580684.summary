Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hopes to see Sean Lamont end his career with a flourish.

The 36-year-old winger announced last month that he would be retiring at the end of the season.
Third on Scotland's all-time list with 105 caps, Lamont has made 111 Warriors appearances over two stints, scoring 31 tries.
"It would be great to see Sean run in one or two more tries before he finally hangs up his boots," said Townsend.
"Sean has shown a real consistency and resilience to get over a couple of major injuries and to continue to play at a really high level.
"He'll be one of a very small number of players to have played in every position in the back five. Obviously he played most of his rugby on the wing, but he also performed very well at inside centre when I was an assistant coach with the national team back in 2011.
"It was really good to see Sean score that try against Connacht a few weeks ago [in Glasgow's 35-24 win]. You could tell from the players' reaction how much Sean means to them and our supporters loved it.
"It was the bonus-point try and a really good finish."
With Glasgow 11 points off fourth place with just three games remaining, hopes of reaching the play-offs were virtually extinguished by last weekend's 10-7 loss away to Munster.
Lamont, who returned to Glasgow in 2012, has also featured for Rotherham, Northampton Saints and Scarlets over a 17-year period.
He made his Scotland debut in 2004 and scored 70 points for his country.
"I took a real interest in Sean's game when he was playing at Northampton and started to become a regular in the Scotland team," explained Townsend on the Warriors' website.
"Probably as a supporter seeing Sean score two tries against France [in 2006] was a real breakthrough moment, it was a brilliant win for Scotland that day and Sean - with his gloves and blonde hair - was a key part in the victory."
