A riverside pub damaged by a fire which left it structurally unsafe, will be rebuilt, its owners have said.

The Tivoli pub on Chesterton Road, Cambridge, caught fire in the middle of the night on 14 March. Owners Wetherspoon said they would reopen it.
Firefighters had to tackle the flames "from above as part of the building collapsed", the fire service said.
The company said the pub would remain closed for some time and staff had been located to other branches.
Eddie Gershon, from Wetherspoon, said at the time of the fire: "It appears to have been a gas fire, starting in the kitchen but no-one was inside the pub."
But a company spokesman has now said: "The site is still being investigated, we has structural engineers on site looking at the premises and it is likely to be closed for a good period of time.
"Wetherspoon aims to rebuild the pub but cannot do anything until the structural engineers have completed their work."
