Dublin airport: Plea to trace owner of 1946 picture

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is an old black and white photograph of a boy and a girl having fun on their old fashioned trikes.

They are both very young - under seven years old.
The boy's slicked-back hair and the girl's smocked dress whisper post-war chic.
On the back, it reads: "David and Sandra, Neville Road, Birmingham, 1946." But the snap got separated from its owner at Terminal 1 in Dublin airport.
Now, big-hearted airport staff have put out a plea in the hope of reuniting photograph and owner.
They tweeted: "A passenger left this photo at the security area in T1 today. Dated 1946.
"Please RT so we can find the owner."
Paul O'Kane, chief communications officer for the airport said this was one lost item that they just could not ignore.
"We have more than 20 million passengers going through the airport every year," he said.
"One of our staff found the photograph under a plastic security tray and we felt we couldn't ignore it.
"The caption suggests it belongs to someone of Irish origin who is perhaps living in Birmingham. It is clearly of tremendous sentimental value.
"We shall also send a message to Birmingham airport to see if they can help us reunite the photograph with its owner."
