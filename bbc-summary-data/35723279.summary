Denny Johnstone gave the visitors a surprise lead midway through the first-half after an error from Rangers keeper Wes Foderingham.
Miller headed them level a minute before the break before grabbing another two minutes after the restart.
Lee Wallace added a third as Rangers extended their unbeaten run to 15 matches.
With Hibernian absent from Championship action this weekend due to Sunday's League Cup final with Ross County, the Light Blues' nearest challengers remain second-placed Falkirk.
Four more wins from their eight remaining matches will seal Rangers' promotion back to the Premiership.
After the teams observed a minute's silence in tribute to former Ibrox keeper Billy Ritchie, who died aged 79 following a short illness, the home side quickly created chances for Harry Forrester, Jason Holt and Miller but failed to capitalise.
That allowed the visitors to claim a shock lead 22 minutes in when Foderingham failed to hold Bobby Barr's strike from the edge of the box, spilling it straight at Johnstone.
The striker almost tripped over the ball as it fell at his feet and looked relieved as it dribbled into the empty net.
It was the first goal the league leaders had conceded in seven hours and 45 minutes of action but they eventually snapped into life and levelled just before the interval, with Miller darting across the front post to nod powerfully past Derek Gaston from James Tavernier's outswinging corner.
And the former Scotland striker was on point again just moments into the second-half as he put Rangers ahead.
Stefan McCluskey got a foot to the ball as Barrie McKay drove into the Morton box but could only divert it to Holt, who teed up Miller to lash into the top corner.
There was another warning sign for Rangers though as Johnstone had Foderingham at full stretch with an 18-yard strike.
But skipper Wallace put daylight between the teams when he swept home the third after 56 minutes following another positive surge from McKay.
Miller thought he had his hat-trick when he pounced on the rebound after Dean Shiels thundered the ball off the crossbar but he was disappointed to be flagged for offside.
