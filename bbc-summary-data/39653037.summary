A new book celebrates one of Britain's best-loved and at risk animals.
The Red Squirrel: A future in the forest features imagery by award-winning wildlife photographer Neil McIntyre.
He has spent the last 20 years documenting the lives of the red squirrels near his home in the Cairngorms National Park.
The Cairngorms and wider Highlands area provide reds with some of their best habitats.
Elsewhere, populations of the squirrels have suffered due to habitat loss and competition for food from non-native grey squirrels. Greys also carry a disease deadly to reds.
The book was written by Polly Pullar and the cost of making it has been paid for through a crowdfunding campaign.
Its publisher, conservation photographer Peter Cairns, said he hoped the book would raise fresh awareness to the plight of reds.
He said "Neil's beautiful images shine a unique light on one of Scotland's best-loved mammals, but squirrels need forests just as much as forests need squirrels.
"I hope this book will ignite fresh conversations about that crucial link."
