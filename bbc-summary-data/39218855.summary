Mr Mckeague, 23, from Dunfermline, went missing during a night out in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk on 24 September.
He was last seen going into a loading bay, known as the "Horseshoe", which contains waste bins.
Initial records suggested a bin collected within an hour of his last sighting weighed 11kg (1st 10lb), meaning it could not have contained a person.
But on Tuesday it emerged the true weight was 100kg (15st 10lb).
The Find Corrie Facebook page set up by Mrs Urquhart has gathered 120,000 followers.
Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Urquhart said: "I'm so upset that I've brought over 120,000 people into this with us.
"I'm making other people upset because I needed their support when maybe this didn't have to happen."
Andy King, the chairman of Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue, which has been helping to try to find Mr Mckeague, said Mrs Urquhart had "nothing to apologise to anyone for".
"I think I can say on behalf of 120,000 people and certainly on behalf of the team that she doesn't need to apologise to anybody for anything that she's done.
"She's been quite amazing."
On the BBC Look East Facebook page, users told Mrs Urquhart her comments were "heartbreaking".
Melanie Turner commented: "Never feel you have upset anyone Nicola Urquhart, you have done what any mother would do!"
A response from Chloe Clark read: "We are corries army and we decided to be!! SO PLEASE don't feel bad!! My heart breaks for you."
Police said finding out about the bin weight mistake "a few weeks ago" was "sobering" and "frustrating".
It had been known that Mr Mckeague's mobile phone tracked the same route, and at the same pace, as a bin lorry since early on in the investigation.
Det Supt Katie Elliott said the line of inquiry was not pursued at the time because of the weight given and details of the waste disposal process.
"We understood it would've been such that it would've been likely that Corrie would have been identified through the processing before he could've got here.
"We've done further lines of inquiry in to that processing and we understand there is the possibility that Corrie could've got to this landfill site without having been identified through that processing."
She said the new information has come to light because of detectives "checking and re-checking".
Plans to search the landfill site started early in the new year and has taken weeks to organise, she added.
Mr Mckeague, a gunner in No 2 Sqn, RAF Regiment, was based at Honington in Suffolk.
In January it was announced that Mr Mckeague's girlfriend, April Oliver, is pregnant with their child.
