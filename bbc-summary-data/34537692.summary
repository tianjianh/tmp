Former Tetley's brewery site in Leeds sold to developers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former Tetley's Brewery site in Leeds has been sold by Carlsberg for an undisclosed sum to be developed for "mixed use".

Vastint, a real estate company part of the Inter IKEA group, plans to "respect the site's history", said Carlsberg.
The 21 acre (8.5 hectare) site is close to retail and financial areas, Leeds station and the River Aire waterfront.
The closure of the brewery in 2011, which had been on the same site since 1822, resulted in the loss of 170 jobs.
Parent company Carlsberg announced the brewery closure in 2008.
The Tetley, an art deco building now used as an art gallery, is to stay open on the site.
Carlsberg UK is to also retain an office building on the site.
Vastint said the redevelopment would be in line with Leeds City Council's plans for the city's south bank.
