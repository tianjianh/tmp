Scenes for The Gael King have already been shot in Airth, near Falkirk, and other locations in Scotland.
It is being made by Fellowship Film, which involves brothers Philip and Matthew Todd and their cousins John Walkinshaw and Tom Walkinshaw.
The feature's plot centres on a fictional king, Alpin Mac Eachdach.
Matthew Todd said: "Alpin, King of Dalriata, must overcome the impossible to save his brother, unite his kingdom and defeat the great evil that has arisen in Dorcha Forest.
"The film is set and being produced entirely in Scotland.
"We have one production office in Edinburgh and one in Glasgow. The primary location base is in Airth, but the film will include some of Scotland's finest countryside."
Family-run Fellowship Film are among independent film-makers who have been invited to pitch their productions to industry professionals at EIFF's Works in Progress event on Sunday.
Mr Todd said: "We are at a very interesting moment in the project where the director and producer have recently returned from the Cannes Film Market where we received a very positive response to the film.
"Even more exciting is that we were accepted into the Edinburgh International Film Festival Works in Progress event.
"We are holding out for an international distribution deal and have big plans for The Gael King."
The film-maker added: "Meanwhile, we have a film to finish.
"The last block of filming will be pick-ups and an epic prologue where we will digitally recreate the real and ancient fortress of Dunadd."
Dunadd was constructed 2,000 years ago on Moine Mhor, a large bog at the southern end of Kilmartin Glen in Argyll.
The fort was a power base for Gaelic kings in the 500s to 800s AD.
