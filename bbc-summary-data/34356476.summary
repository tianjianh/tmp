Ratan Tata, of the Tata Motor Group, and Prof Lord Bhattacharyya, founder of Warwick Manufacturing Group, took their oaths in Coventry Cathedral.
Both have been made Honorary Freemen of the city.
The men were honoured for helping "the regeneration of the city", the city council said.
Coventry City Council leader Ann Lucas OBE, said: "The vision, leadership and commitment of Mr Tata and Professor Lord Bhattacharyya has been instrumental in placing Coventry on the world stage."
"I'm very proud that Coventry today honoured me," Lord Bhattacharyya said.
In 1980, he founded the manufacturing, education and research group at Warwick University, and remains its chairman. The department works with motor manufacturers across the UK, including Jaguar.
Tata Motors announced plans to double the size of JLR's manufacturing plant in Whitley, in March.
