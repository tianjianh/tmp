Joanne Dennehy: Triple killer was under probation service supervision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Triple killer Joanne Dennehy was under the supervision of probation workers when she murdered three men, the BBC can reveal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennehy, 33, from Peterborough, is serving life for the murders of three men in 2013.
A report highlights "deficiencies" by the probation service, but says there is "no evidence that these contributed directly" to the deaths.
Christina Lee, widow of victim Kevin Lee, criticised the failings.
"We have been left numb by the failings identified... and it has left us wondering whether my husband would still be alive today had they done their job properly," she said.
Joanne Dennehy: The woman with a 'sadistic lust for blood'
Dennehy had been given a community order of 12 months for assault and being in control of a dangerous dog.
She was supervised by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Probation service, but she missed appointments with probation officers after going to Lincolnshire.
The restricted report, seen by the BBC, says a "more experienced offender manager" should have been appointed to deal with the "complexities" of the case.
It says there was no contact with Dennehy when she was in prison which was a "missed opportunity".
The probation service risk appraisal of Dennehy was that she had the "potential to cause serious harm" but was unlikely to do so "unless there was a significant change in circumstances".
The report said the probation service should have looked into this further.
It recommends the probation services undertake greater "risk of harm" analysis of cases and that there is additional training for probation officers.
Dennehy murdered Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, Kevin Lee, 48, and John Chapman, 56, in March 2013 before dumping their bodies.
She went on the run and subsequently stabbed dog walkers Robin Bereza, 64, and 56-year-old John Rogers in Hereford.
The Probation Service has yet to comment.
