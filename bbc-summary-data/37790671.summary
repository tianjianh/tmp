The aerospace company said in February it was axing the posts - about 20% of its Northern Ireland workforce - over two years as part of its global restructuring plan.
But it now aims to shed all 1,080 posts "within the next few months", it said in a statement.
Initially the company planned 580 job losses this year.
This is the third time the firm has adjusted cuts originally planned for next year.
The company said: "It is crucial to our long-term future that we continue to significantly reduce our costs and improve our competitiveness."
The cuts follow financial problems caused largely by the development of the firm's C Series aircraft.
Even further job losses are possible going forward.
Earlier this month, the plane and train maker announced another 7,500 posts would go at its operations worldwide.
The impact of the announcement in Northern Ireland is not clear.
Bombardier has plants in east Belfast, Dunmurry, Newtownabbey and Newtownards.
It is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers.
Davy Thompson of Unite said: "This decision has been made against a backdrop where the company's corporate management are seeking an additional 7,500 job-losses globally.
"Unite will continue working with management locally with the aim of securing jobs and defending terms and conditions."
