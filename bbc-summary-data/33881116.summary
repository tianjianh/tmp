Security firm G4S has reported a £4m rise in profits to £185m for the first half of 2015 due to new contracts and growth in emerging markets.

G4S provides healthcare for the UK's Yarl's Wood immigration detention centre, deemed a "place of national concern" after it was found to be failing vulnerable women.
Emerging markets' revenue rose 5.7% to £1.18bn but UK revenue fell by 3.2%.
G4S's operations span 110 countries and it employs 611,000 staff.
Its operations include providing services for airports and restocking cash machines.
It also has outsourcing contracts from companies and governments to place, for example, police and prison officers where there are shortages, and "supports justice and security strategies" for governments of countries in conflict, says G4S.
Revenues were £3.2bn, up 2.8% compared with the same period last year. However, the company said that during the period, it took a charge of £16m for restructuring.
New contract sales were £1.4bn.
Chief executive Ashley Almanza said: "Demand for our services was robust, particularly in North America, Latin America and Asia Middle East. As anticipated, revenues were lower in UK & Ireland."
