[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Irish politician has resigned from the main opposition party, citing the weakness of its campaign in support of same-sex marriage as the "final straw".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Averil Power said the Fianna Fáil party had underestimated the strength of public support for equality, ahead of a 62% 'yes' vote in Friday's referendum.
She said Fianna Fáil was not fit for government and criticised its leader Micheál Martin as ineffective.
Mr Martin said he disputed some of her allegations about his party.
Ms Power's resignation has emerged on the same day as the Irish Justice Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, announced that she expected the Marriage Bill 2015 to be enacted by the end of July, following the result of the referendum.
"The Marriage Bill, which is currently being drafted, will enable same-sex couples to get married in the same way as opposite-sex couples," Ms Fitzgerald said.
"My intention is to seek government approval for the Marriage Bill 2015 in June with the aim of introducing the bill into the Oireachtas (parliament) immediately thereafter so that the legislation can be enacted before the summer recess."
Ms Power was elected to Seanad Éireann (Irish senate) in 2011.
Speaking to Irish state broadcaster, RTÉ, she has alleged that despite Fianna Fáil taking an official position in favour of a yes vote in last week's referendum, several members of the parliamentary party remain opposed to same-sex marriage.
The senator said she was "laughed at" when she suggested that other members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party canvass for a yes vote.
She claimed others who were in favour of marriage equality were afraid to canvass in case it would cost them votes in the next parliamentary election.
Ms Power said she had tried to change the party from within but it said it remained out of touch with the public and lacked the "courage" and "vision" needed to return to government.
However, the Fianna Fáil leader said her assessment was "not a fair or true picture" of his party.
Ms Power is quitting the party but intends to remain as an independent senator.
