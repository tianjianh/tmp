[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The maker of Isle of Wight's troubled new floating bridge has insisted it will be a "success", despite its continued suspension.

Cars scraped their bumpers while disembarking and stranded passengers waded through water when it broke down on its first weekend in operation.
It remains suspended on the orders of the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA).
Mainstay Marine said it was working on an "enhanced" training programme for the crew.

Stewart Graves, managing director of Pembroke-based Mainstay Marine, said there had been concerns crew were struggling to operate ferry systems but a new training scheme includes a test at the end to ensure they "absorb" what was learnt.
The service was suspended on 14 May.  At a meeting of East Cowes Town Council on Thursday, local businesses claimed it had been a "unmitigated disaster".
Shop owner Angela Booth, said: "We got a wonky banger that is slower, more dangerous and completely unfit for purpose".
Mr Graves said: "I'm comfortable the slipway is at the right angle and the ramps are suitable for safe off-loading. It's all due to positioning - being placed on the slipway and lowering to the right angle.
"I feel comfortable the vessel is fit for purpose and will be a success with the enhanced crew training."
Isle of Wight Council said it was working with the manufacturer to "resolve the issues identified during the live testing".
"It was anticipated that during the first couple of weeks, that there would be some issues to be ironed out that could not be identified until the vessel was back in service and in full use," the authority said.
An MCA spokeswoman said it was "waiting on remedial action" before surveyors would reassess the service.
A launch is being used to ferry foot passengers while drivers face a 10-mile road diversion.
