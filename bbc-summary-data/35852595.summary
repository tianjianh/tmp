Corporation tax: Cut in Great Britain's rate 'disadvantages' NI

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cut in the corporation tax rate in Great Britain could put Northern Ireland at an economic disadvantage, a leading tax expert has said.

Northern Ireland has been given the power to set its own rate and is set to cut the tax businesses pay on their profits to 12.5% by 2018.
However, last week the chancellor said the GB rate will fall to 17% by 2020.
Caroline Keenan of ASM accountants told the BBC's Inside Business programme it "dilutes" Northern Ireland's advantage.

She said the cut in the GB rate - announced by Chancellor George Osborne as part of last week's budget - had come as a surprise.
"I don't think it's a good move, from the point of view that it dilutes the potential that we have," Ms Keenan said.
"We're going to be competing with England, Scotland and Wales and, that differential, I don't think it's even going to cut it."
She said Northern Ireland needed "a cocktail of measures" in order to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), on top of having the lowest corporation tax rate in the UK.
"I've worked with many FDI companies over the last number of years and it's the whole range of the skills, the infrastructure, it's property."
Caroline Keenan's interview will be broadcast as part of Inside Business at 13:30 GMT on Sunday 20 March.
