Borthwick-Jackson, 19, started his career as a trainee at United and has made 14 senior appearances.
Netherlands international John, 24, has been with the Portuguese side since leaving Dutch club FC Twente in 2012 and was on loan at Reading last season.
He previously played for German Bundesliga side Hamburg in 2014.
Former England Under-19 international Borthwick-Jackson made his Premier League debut last season.
"My aim is to play as many games as I can, gain experience and go back and challenge for a place in the team because Jose Mourinho has told me I've got a future there," Borthwick-Jackson told BBC WM.
"I had interest from Premier League clubs and other Championship clubs but I wanted to come here and help the club get back to where they belong, which is the Premier League."
Both players could make their Wolves debuts in Tuesday's EFL Cup second-round tie against Cambridge United.
