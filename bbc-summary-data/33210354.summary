The Scotland United Against Austerity event in George Square took place as a demonstration was staged in London.
Organisers of the London event said the protests would be the biggest for years.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) joined forces with the Peoples' Assembly, which organised the protests.
Speaking at the rally, STUC general secretary Grahame Smith told BBC Scotland: "We know austerity does not work.
"It is not a sensible economic policy.
"It is entirely about ideology and it is about protecting the position of the already privileged in society."
The trade union leader added: "We have seen over the past few years the impact of austerity: growing queues at food banks; people being thrown out of their house because of the bedroom tax; and the unprecedented decline in real wages.
"But at the same time we have seen the rich getting richer. That's the impact of austerity and that's why we oppose it."
Mr Smith said the vast majority of the people in Scotland and across the UK did not vote for the Tory government and he questioned the legitimacy of its cuts.
Other speakers at the rally included Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, and Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of Unite.
