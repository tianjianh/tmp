Medical workers among refugees given shelter in Scotland could be offered vacant health care jobs, the leader of Highland Council has suggested.

The local authority is to meet the charity Blythswood to look at what help could be offered to people fleeing conflict in Syria.
Council leader Margaret Davidson said that, at the same time, professionals could be sought among the refugees.
The Highlands has been struggling to recruit GPs and consultants.
Caithness General Hospital in Wick needs eight consultants, an annual review of NHS Highland's performance heard on Monday.
NHS Highland has also been running adverts in Holland to find doctors to fill vacancies at GP practices.
Ms Davidson told BBC Alba: "There are professionals on those trains trying to get to Germany from Hungary, and professionals stuck in refugee camps around the world.
"There are all sorts of barriers to bringing in some of these professionals.
"There is no reason why we cannot be doing what we can to help the refugees out there and also, at the same time, matching them to some of our skills vacancies."
The UK will accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years, David Cameron  told MPs on Monday.
The prime minister said the UK had a "moral responsibility" to those living in camps bordering Syria while doing all it can to end the conflict there.
Vulnerable children and orphans would be prioritised in what would be a "national effort", Mr Cameron said.
Last week, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland "stands ready to offer sanctuary" to refugees.
Ms Sturgeon said Scotland should accept 1,000 refugees "as a starting point for a meaningful discussion".
She was speaking at a summit aimed at examining what Scotland can do to help ease the international refugee crisis.
