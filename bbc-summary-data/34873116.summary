Stuart Broad: Alex Hales deserves England Test chance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stuart Broad says Nottinghamshire team-mate Alex Hales has earned the right to become an England Test opener.

Hales, 26, has been considered a one-day specialist at international level.
But after scoring his first one-day international century against Pakistan, selector James Whitaker said that Hales will get his chance to partner Alastair Cook on the tour to South Africa.
Broad told BBC Nottingham Sport: "Alex averaged over 50 in the Championship last season and deserves his chance."

Moeen Ali opened during the three-match Test series in the United Arab Emirates, but managed just 84 runs in six innings.
Pace bowler Broad added: "Alex didn't open in the UAE because we went down a different tactical route but it is there for him now. James Whitaker has said they are looking for Alex to open and hopefully it goes well for him in the first few warm-up games.
"He got his first (one-day) hundred for England the other day and I think everyone in Nottingham jumped up."
Fellow Notts players Samit Patel and James Taylor have also been included in the squad and Broad said the duo had impressed and were worthy of their place, despite England's 2-0 Test series loss to Pakistan.
"James Taylor has been such a consistent performer for both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire and really deserves a good run," Broad said.
"And in Dubai and Sharjah, Samit Patel worked so hard. He played the last Test match and it was great to see him switch his mind on to working hard on his fitness and his skills and he really deserves his call-up."
