Southend Airshow revival plans cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Organisers hoping to revive one of the country's major air shows have said their efforts have failed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southend Airshow, scrapped in 2013 by the council, was set to return in September after volunteers raised Â£220,000.
An alternative location was being sought after the organisers said holding it in Southend was too costly.
However, Tom Curtis from the Southend Airshow Community Interest Company (SACIC) said those efforts had failed.
The event - that ran for 28 years until 2012 - once attracted up to 400,000 people.
Mr Curtis said: "We now have to face the reality that although there may be other air shows in Essex in the coming years, we will not have an air show in Southend."
All the money raised is going to be donated to the group's nominated charities instead, Mr Curtis added.
