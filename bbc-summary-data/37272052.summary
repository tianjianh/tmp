Burton had four fences down and still won, but collected 16 faults and almost lost the Â£63,000 top prize.
He finished on a score of 49.4 penalties with Wiltshire-based New Zealander Andrew Nicholson second on Nereo with 53.2 penalties.
Oliver Townend was the highest-placed British finisher in seventh on Samuel Thomas II.
The 2009 Burghley winner had 63 penalties after the three-day dressage, cross-country and showjumping event.
Olympic bronze medallist Burton, who led by 11.5 penalties going into the final day, became Australia's first Burghley champion since Lucinda Fredericks 10 years ago.
The 34-year-old joked: "I thought I'd keep it interesting for everyone by making it as close as possible.
"He's basically a careful showjumper and he warmed up well, but in the end he got a bit tired and had a few down."
New Zealander Jonelle Price and her husband Tim were third and fourth respectively.
Tina Cook - travelling reserve for the British team in Rio - was 10th aboard Star Witness.
