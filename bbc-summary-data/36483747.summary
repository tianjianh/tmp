Symons, 24, had previously agreed a two-year deal at London Irish but a statement on their website said: "He will not be joining as he has decided to pursue his career elsewhere."
A knee injury saw Symons - who joined Worcester in 2013 - miss much of 2015.
"It's quite a strange situation for me to be in, but the opportunity to go to Kingsholm and play for the Cherry and Whites is awesome," he said.
"It's an amazing place to play, a big club with lots of history and I'm really excited."
Symons spent time in New Zealand playing for Tasman Makos before joining Worcester, but also had a spell with Leicester Tigers in 2012, playing for them in the Sevens Series.
"He caused us problems when he played against us last season and will bring a real physical presence in the midfield," director of rugby David Humphreys told Gloucester's website.
