Lisa and Billy Graham, from Perth, were among 38 people killed by an Islamist gunman at the five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba holiday resort in June 2015.
The inquest into their deaths was told how they rushed into the hotel after hearing gunfire from the beach.
Staff led them to an office area where they were shot by Seifeddine Rezgui.
He was later killed by security forces.
Mr and Mrs Graham's family and friends watched the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice in London via video link from Stirling Sheriff Court.
The hearing was told Mrs Graham - nicknamed "sun goddess" - was a very caring and thoughtful woman who loved to laugh.
Mr Graham, who volunteered for St Johnstone football club in his spare time, was described as happy-go-lucky and a big joker who loved to make people laugh.
The couple had been celebrating their 31st wedding anniversary while on holiday at the resort, near Sousse in central Tunisia, when Rezgui struck.
Thirty of the 38 people killed in the attack were British.
The inquest had earlier heard another Scottish man injured in the attack died on his way to hospital after a 20-minute wait in an ambulance.
James McQuire, 66, and his wife Ann, 63, from Cumbernauld, were shot near a hotel swimming pool as they tried to flee the gunman.
The hearing was also told a teenager from the West Midlands tried to shield his grandfather during the attack in which his brother and uncle were also killed.
Owen Richards, who was 16 at the time, was helping Charles Patrick Evans, 78, try to escape as Rezgui hunted for victims at the beach hotel.
Mr Evans, his son Adrian Evans, 49, and grandson Joel Richards, 19, were all shot dead.
The inquest continues.
