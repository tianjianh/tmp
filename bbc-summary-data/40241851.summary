[SN]TITLE[SN]
UK Supreme Court to sit in Edinburgh for the first time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's highest court will temporarily move from its London home to Edinburgh this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Supreme Court will sit in the City Chambers - normally home to the City of Edinburgh Council - until Thursday.
It is the first time it has sat outside London in its eight-year history.
Lord Neuberger, the president of the Supreme Court, said the move provided an opportunity for members of the public and lawyers to observe the workings of the court first-hand.
A panel of five judges, including Lord Neuberger, are expected to hear three cases over the four days they are in the Scottish capital.
They include a case about sham marriages and another relating to national planning policy.
The third concerns the rehabilitation of certain types of prisoners. Lord Carloway, the Lord President of the Court of Session, will sit on the panel to hear this appeal.
Lord Neuberger said: "We make every effort to ensure our proceedings are accessible throughout the UK via our free live streaming service.
"However, nothing beats being able to observe courts at first hand.
"We look forward to welcoming members of the public, as well as lawyers, during what is intended to be the first of a number of visits to the capital cities of the devolved nations."
Lord Carloway said he was "delighted" the court was sitting in Edinburgh.
He added: "I welcome the opportunity it provides for the public and the legal community in Scotland to see the court in action."
The public will be able to watch the proceedings in the chamber or to view a live-stream on the court's website. The court will also share photos on Instagram.
And its chief executive Mark Ormerod, will be giving a free public talk during the Edinburgh sittings, offering those who come to observe proceedings an overview of the Supreme Court building and how the Court uses its accommodation in central London.
The presentation will begin in the council chamber at 16:15 on Wednesday.
