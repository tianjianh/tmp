Bath director of rugby Mike Ford says he trusts his players to turn around their form after an inconsistent start to the season.

Last season's Premiership finalists were beaten in the European Champions Cup by Wasps on Saturday and have also lost four league games this term.
"I trust the players 100%, it hurts them more than anybody," said Ford.
"They want to play as best as they can, they care, the leaders have led and the players have followed."
Bath host Worcester on 27 December and Ford admits Warriors will fancy their chances at the Rec.
"They will smell blood and think it's a good time to play Bath, they will come firing, we have to meet their physicality," he told BBC Radio Bristol. "It's all about attitude and we need to play with edge."
Ford also admits his side have let down supporters this season and says the players are working hard to find ways to turn things around. He also says he is putting himself under pressure to help improve results.
"We had a few home truths after that performance (against Wasps) and sometimes that's what it needs," he said. "The lads have got back on the horse and trained really well so they've taken the first steps.
"Pressure comes from the way you prepare. I felt pressure today, I felt pressure yesterday because you have to get the tactics right, get the message right to the team, prepare your training and meetings. That's where the pressure comes, on match day I can't do much, it's over to the players.
"If you do the job during the week then match day normally takes care of itself. You can't worry about the results otherwise it'll drive you crazy, I've been in the game too long to worry about things like that."
