[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to reports of a man being attacked in a flat in Houston Street, Renfrew, at 19:20 on Wednesday.
Emergency services attended and the man was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.
Police said the man may have been targeted by two men who were known to him. They have appealed for witnesses.
The suspects are described as white, with one being over 6ft tall and thin.
The other man is described as being of average height and build.
The men may have been in the company of a woman, also white and aged between 25 and 30 years old.
Det Insp Alexander Nelson said: "We are gathering CCTV images to review in the hope that it provides us with further details on the suspects.
"I am appealing to people in the local area to think about whether they saw or heard something - did you see the two men, did you see the woman?
"Any small piece of information could prove vital in helping us locate the people responsible for this attack. Whilst we don't know the motive for the attack we do not believe it to be random."
