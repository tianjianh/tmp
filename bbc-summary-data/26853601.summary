Inverness West Link: Full planning permission sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council has sought full planning permission for its Inverness West Link and permission in principle for associated projects.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Planning officials have recommended that the south planning applications committee approves both applications.
The West Link has been proposed as a way of easing travel across Inverness. The new road is opposed by a local campaign.
Campaigners say the West Link will lead to the loss of green space.
The other project involves relocating Torvean Golf Course, creating a new sports hub and parkland at Torvean and extend Kilvean Cemetery.
The committee will meet on 8 April.
