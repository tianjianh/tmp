Taylor's stylish innings came at a run a ball, while Jonny Bairstow smashed 58 off 30, including six sixes, as the tourists posted 368-7 in Kimberley.
Reece Topley, Adil Rashid and Chris Jordan took three wickets each to help dismiss South Africa A for 205.

England's five-match one-day series against South Africa begins on Wednesday in Bloemfontein.
The form of opener Alex Hales - dismissed on Saturday for 23 following a lean run in the 2-1 Test series victory - is perhaps the biggest concern for England.
They must also decide whether to include the impressive Bairstow, who enjoyed a fine Test series with the bat but has not featured in England's last four one-day internationals.
