Netherlands scored twice in the first 16 minutes to ease to a 2-0 friendly victory over Spain in Amsterdam.

The two sides met in the group stages in the 2014 World Cup, when Netherlands thrashed their opponents 5-1.
They also faced one another in the 2010 World Cup final, when Andres Iniesta scored Spain's winner.
But Guus Hiddink's men were on top on Tuesday, going ahead through Stefan de Vrij's header and Davy Klaassen struck a second past goalkeeper David De Gea.
The game at the World Cup in Brazil last year brought to an end Spain's dominant run in major tournaments, during which they won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships, and the 2010 World Cup.
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque fielded an experimental side on Tuesday, with Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo making their international debuts.
But despite experienced players such as Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla in the midfield, they were unable to prevent the hosts from running away with the match in the opening stages, condemning Spain to a third consecutive friendly loss for the first time since 2001.
Netherlands defender Bruno Martins Indi should have made it 3-0 but missed a free header in the second half, with Vitolo fluffing an effort for the visitors as they tried in vain to get back into the contest.
With the top two sides from each European group qualifying for Euro 2016, Oranje are currently third in Group A, while La Roja are second in Group C.
