BHS: About 200 jobs at risk in NI after firm files for administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 200 jobs are at risk in Northern Ireland after the department store chain British Home Stores (BHS) went into administration.

The company has four local stores in Belfast, Holywood, Newtownabbey and Lisburn.
They will continue to trade for now as the administrator tries to find a buyer.
The high street retailer has 164 shops across the UK putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk.
Administrators Duff & Phelps will now try to find a buyer for all or part of the 88-year old business and said BHS had "no alternative but to put the group into administration".
If a buyer is not found, it would be the biggest High Street collapse since Woolworths in 2008.

BHS is "very unlikely to meet all contractual payments" as a result of its lower than expected cash balance, the administrators said.
The company, which has debts of more than £1.3bn, decided to bring in administrators after talks to sell some of its 164 UK stores to Sports Direct collapsed over the weekend.
It is understood any buyer would only be interested if it did not have to take on BHS's £571m pension deficit.
Last year, Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of financiers, bought BHS from the retail entrepreneur Sir Philip Green for £1.
At the time, Retail Acquisitions said they would deliver £160m of funding to help turn around the fortunes of the chain, but have not been able to raise the sum.
Last month, the brand was rescued from the brink after creditors voted to accept a cut in the rent bill for about half of its stores.
Despite the rent deal, BHS warned that it needed extra funding to continue trading.
It had been due to announce a new £60m loan last week, but failed to do so.
