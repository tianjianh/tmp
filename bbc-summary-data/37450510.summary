The university was awarded the honour after being ranked 28th in the UK overall.
Dundee is ahead of Glasgow and Edinburgh for the first time in the 2017 guide.
St Andrews, which was rated third overall in the UK, won the University of the Year for Teaching Quality.
The guide's editor, Alastair McCall, said "It is highly unusual for a university to retain any University of the Year award such is the competition now in the higher education sector to be the best.
"The University of Dundee achieved this feat in some style, however."
Mr McCall said Dundee proved it was possible to be "both an outstanding university and one at the cutting edge of research work."
He said: "The ratings it receives in the annual National Student Survey speak volumes about the quality of the teaching students receive and the wider university experience they benefit from.
"To now stand second in Scotland in our rankings ahead of big city rivals in Glasgow and Edinburgh is testimony to the outstanding quality of education on offer here, something of which the university should be rightly proud as it celebrates its 50th birthday in 2017."
The university's principal, Prof Sir Pete Downes, said: "Our ambition is to become Scotland's leading university in all the fields in which we work.
"Being named Scottish University of the Year for a second consecutive year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide is something all staff and students can take pride in."
In the past week, Dundee University has been named in the top 200 world universities by Times Higher Education and top in the UK among the world's universities under 50 years old in the QS World University Rankings.
It also ranked of seventh in the UK for both student satisfaction with teaching quality, and the wider student experience, in the annual National Student Survey.
Glasgow University was ranked 29th in the UK in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide with Edinburgh and Heriot Watt in joint 37th place.
