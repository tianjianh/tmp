[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City are not yet safe from Premier League relegation, says manager Craig Shakespeare.

The reigning champions are currently 15th, six points clear of the bottom three, with 10 games remaining.
Since Shakespeare took over following Claudio Ranieri's sacking last month, the Foxes have won three consecutive Premier League games.
"There are a lot of twists and turns to come and we're proof of that," said Shakespeare.
"Three games ago in the Premier League we were down there and people were writing us off."
Leicester play two consecutive home games at the King Power stadium, hosting Stoke City at 15:00 BST on Saturday before facing Sunderland at 19:45 BST on Tuesday.
"The sooner we can secure our safety the better - it's our main focus," added Shakespeare.
"We've got two home games and it could go a long way in making sure we're safe, but also it could go the other way if we don't get the results we want."
Away from their relegation worries, Leicester will play Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter final first leg on 12 April at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium.
