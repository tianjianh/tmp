Jersey's top tennis player Scott Clayton says he is unsure when he will next compete at an Island Games, as he prioritises his professional ranking.

The 23-year-old has opted to miss this year's Games and last week made his bow at Challenger Tour level in doubles.
"Things like the Island Games will have to take a back seat," Clayton said.
"That's not me undermining the Island Games at all. I think it's a great event, it's fantastic to be part of a big team and have the camaraderie."
He told BBC Radio Jersey: "I'm sure I'll play it in years to come, but when my next one will be I don't know."
Clayton is ranked 253 in the world in doubles and narrowly suffered defeat alongside partner Jonny O'Mara in the first round of the second-tier Aegon Open event in Nottingham on Tuesday.
In November he said he would aim to reach the doubles main draw at Wimbledon this summer.
"I think it's a great opportunity for me to be around these kind of players and to play at this level," Clayton added.
"Ultimately right now I need to focus on my individual career, and what it can do for me."
