[SN]TITLE[SN]
Theft from elderly Annan woman 'despicable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A thief targeted an elderly woman in her Annan home, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said it was a "despicable" crime and appealed for the public's help in catching the man responsible.
The victim was sitting in her home in North Street on Tuesday afternoon when a man entered the property at about 15:40.
He claimed to have seen someone running from the house and said he believed the pensioner may have been robbed.
The suspect then asked the householder to check her property and accompanied her into another room where she examined her purse which contained what has been described as a substantial amount of money.
Nothing appeared to have been taken at that time but a number of cupboards had been opened and items strewn about.
The man then distracted the woman before leaving the property having now stolen her purse.
The suspect is said to be in his 30s, about 5ft 6in tall, clean shaven with blond hair and spoke with what was thought to be an English accent.
He was wearing a pale denim jacket and a light coloured flat cap. Anyone with information about the man is being urged to contact police.
