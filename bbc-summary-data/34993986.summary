Death rate and A&E; probes at Wrexham Maelor Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A higher than average death rate and patients leaving A&E without being seen are the subjects of a probe at a Wrexham hospital.

In October, 15% of people left Maelor Hospital without being seen- its target is 5% by next March.
It also has a higher risk-adjusted mortality rate than regional neighbours Ysbyty Gwynedd and Glan Clwyd.
The two issues are in a report that will be discussed by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board on 8 December.
It was written by chief operating officer Morag Olsen, who said: "We need to understand why Wrexham Maelor Hospital is such an outlier in terms of north Wales performance."
In the report, she added that comparisons with similar-sized English trusts showed "there is something unique to Wexham Maelor, its practices and how its population uses the emergency department service".
Its north Wales neighbours have already hit the A&E target, with 4.36% of patients leaving Ysbyty Gwynedd and 4.54% leaving Glan Clwyd without being seen.
In the same report Ms Olsen says the reason for the risk-adjusted mortality rate - a figure that takes into account risk of death - is also being reviewed as it is higher than that at the other two general hospitals.
The report said findings "will be discussed and advise the focus for future improvement efforts".
Betsi Cadwaladr was put into special measures - the highest possible level of Welsh government intervention - in June over concerns about its leadership.
