It features interactive displays, including projections, drone footage and a computer generated reconstruction which shows how the castle would have looked hundreds of years ago.
The 13th Century fortress was built by Welsh princes Llywelyn the Great and Llywelyn the Last.
It was captured by Owain Glyndwr in the last major Welsh rebellion against the English.
The Â£450,000 visitor centre is part of a wider Â£2.6m project to improve heritage sites across Wales.
Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Infrastructure, Ken Skates, said it was an example of "combining the latest technology with the country's rich history to enhance the visitor experience".
