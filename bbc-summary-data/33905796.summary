Lancashire eateries rated 'zero' for food hygiene

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 370 eateries in Lancashire were given poor food hygiene ratings in their most recent inspections, new figures have revealed.

A total of 374 food outlets received either the lowest possible score of zero, or the next lowest rating of one.
The statistics were revealed following a Freedom of Information request submitted to the region's 14 local authorities by BBC Radio Lancashire.
Blackpool Council had the largest number of low-scoring premises.
A score of zero means "urgent improvement" must take place and in the most serious cases can result in kitchens being ordered to close until the shortfalls are addressed.
Among the concerns raised by inspectors across the region, a corner shop in West Lancashire was found to be using a toilet as a store room.
Other premises were found to have maggots, beetles or flies in their kitchens.
Some chefs were found to be working despite not taking a food hygiene course in 20 years.
Fifty-five of Blackpool's 1,626 premises scored zero, or the second-lowest rating of one.
However, Hyndburn Borough Council had the highest percentage of low ratings, with 44 out of the area's 656 outlets given the lowest scores.
Pendle Borough Council had the fewest poor results, with five premises from 776 handed the poorest ratings.
Carolyn Bland, a food hygiene inspector at Blackpool Council, said: "Low hygiene ratings are usually very dirty premises, [in] poor condition, poor repair.
"And also there's an element of what we call 'confidence in management', where if there's not been any improvement - or you keep going back and it's always bad - that will result in a poor hygiene rating."
A spokesman for Blackpool Council defended its record and said its public protection unit takes incidents of food hygiene safety "extremely seriously".
He added that the large number of low ratings can be largely attributed to the high number of premises inspected.
