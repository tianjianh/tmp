Every year pods of orcas make a journey from Iceland to Orkney and John O'Groats in Scotland.
The underwater mammals migrate every year for food and it gives people the chance to spot them up close.
Scientists want people to look out for the orcas, as they want to learn more about their migration patterns.
Kathy James from the Sea Watch Foundation explains: "It's relatively easy to see land animals and the habitats they're using, but it's more difficult to see animals that live under the sea. The only way we can see where they are and what they're doing is if people report that to us."
Ayshah went to meet some young whale watchers at a special event called Orca Watch to see what she could spot.
