Contenders for The Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) annual award include a monastery, two university libraries, an art gallery and a recycling facility. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Leeds, on 21 April.
The steel-framed circular glass building was designed by Bond Bryan Architects for the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), which is a joint venture with aircraft-maker Boeing.
Brynmor Jones Library was redesigned by Sheppard Robson to modernise and connect two contrasting buildings - one from the 1950s, which had an Art Deco influence, while the other was a 1960s design in the brutalist style.
Doma Architects redeveloped a Victorian house, opening up new living areas for a family with young children.
The highlight of the home is a "quirky and contemporary version" of the lean-to, which holds the staircase.
Twelve architects and master-planners developed a honeycomb-style exterior made of aluminium and glass, which was inspired by the surrounding historic buildings, for the University of Sheffield's Faculty of Engineering.
Make Architects, asked by insurance company Hiscox to create a "beautiful but functional building", created a  design influenced by the city's ancient walls and the former hay and wool market that existed on the site until the 1920s.
Humberston Park Special School, which serves pupils aged two to 19, was designed by Hodson Architects and is divided into "a pair of pavilions" with intricate folded roofs and glazed lanterns.
The design of the library by architects ADP aimed to complement the fact it sits between two Grade II listed churches and the University of Leeds' Grade I listed Parkinson Building.
Fuse Studios's brief by the college was to design a sustainable building providing plenty of natural light. Solar panels have been installed on the south-facing saw-tooth shaped roof.
TSP Architects said they used sustainably sourced wood to create a 123m-long and 42m-high building, which is believed to be the largest timber frame structure of its type in Europe.
Another commission by architects Hodson Architects. This time the firm designed a private detached white house on a large plot, which features a hall with two glazed walls and a raised seat/pergola outside.
Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios intended to create a tranquil space for the nuns at the Abbey who had asked for the monastery to be remodelled for the 21st century, which was economic to run while being environmentally-friendly.
Two architect firms, Simpson and Brown and Ushida Findlay Architects, together won a design competition in 2010 to remodel the entire gallery.
They created a new "secret gallery" in the ceramic-clad roof-top space, as well as a new garden entrance and balcony to the west.
