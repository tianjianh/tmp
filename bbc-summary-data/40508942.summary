Haseeb Hameed will come back stronger after struggling for runs in 2017 and losing his England Test spot, says Lancashire coach Glen Chapple.

The 20-year-old was not included in the England squad for the first Test against South Africa at Lord's.
"He's a determined young man and he will use that as motivation," Chapple told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"He'll be disappointed with the first half of the season but he'll put that to one side and work on his game."
Chapple added: "Knowing Hass, he'll be in the nets doing just that and counting down the days for his next chance."
Hameed made his England debut against India in November 2016 as a 19-year-old and impressed during his three Tests on that tour, but is averaging below 20 in the Championship in 2017 and is yet to make a half-century in the four-day competition.
"There is nothing wrong with his game," said Chapple. "It's more about his tactics.
"He looked to expand his game at the start of the season and it wasn't the wrong thing to do. It just didn't pay off and he hasn't made the scores. That can happen to any batter."
Lancashire travel to Durham in Friday's opening round of T20 Blast fixtures and Chapple confirmed that England's Jos Buttler will keep wicket instead of Alex Davies, who has filled the role in Championship cricket.
"We're very excited to have Jos in our team," said Chapple.
"We weren't sure of his contention for a Test place, that may still be the case, but it's a massive bonus to have him at the start of this format.
"Alex is an excellent keeper and he's playing really well, but to start a competition with England's keeper is great for us."
