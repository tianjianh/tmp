[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old arrives at the Racecourse having been released by Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Boden joined the Scottish club a year ago from Newport County, where he had been the Exiles's leading scorer in the 2015-16 season.
He made 13 league appearances for the Highlanders last term and grabbed one league goal as Inverness were relegated from the Scottish Premiership.
Born in Sheffield, Boden began his career at Sheffield United and has had spells at a number of clubs, including Chesterfield, Macclesfield and Halifax, as well as a season in Wales with Newport.
Boden becomes Wrexham's 11th signing of the summer, following the re-signing of striker Ntumba Massanka on loan from Burnley.
