The 41-year-old from County Durham was in charge of the 2012 League Cup final at Wembley when Liverpool won against Cardiff City on penalties.
Clattenburg also took charge of the 2012 Olympic men's final when Mexico beat favourites Brazil at Wembley.
"It's an honour and a massive achievement," said Clattenburg, who will take charge of games at Euro 2016.
"These days you get told what games you're doing by text, but when you see a call coming in from the FA referees' department you know it's important."
United, winners 11 times, have not won the FA Cup since 2004 while Palace are seeking a first triumph.
Clattenburg refereed Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg between Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich, which the Spanish hosts won 1-0.
