Justin McCabe jailed for theft after being tracked by phone app

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver chased a bus through County Londonderry after an app showed him his stolen phone was on it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Justin McCabe, 43, of Antrim Road, Belfast, but currently a serving prisoner, stole the phone when the bus he was on broke down in Castledawson.
When McCabe tried to use the phone on the replacement bus it made quacking and mooing noises.
The lorry driver used the app to track the phone and gave chase until he was able to pull over in front of the bus.
He retrieved the phone but was ordered off the bus by its driver.
The lorry driver then followed the bus to Londonderry, where McCabe was arrested.
McCabe, who has 163 criminal convictions, was jailed to two months for theft and resisting police.
