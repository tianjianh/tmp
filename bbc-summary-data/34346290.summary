Taking on Goliath: On Your Behalf celebrates 20 years of fighting for people's rights

It's been 20 years fighting the good fight for people's rights.

Consumer journalism is never easy. It can be David taking on Goliath.  It can mean battling through mountains of red tape.
Some times you need a shovel and a strong stomach for digging.
Radio Ulster's On Your Behalf is a small team that prides itself on getting big results.
Presenter Linda McAuley, producer Camilla Carroll and content assistant Louisa McCartney are celebrating 20 years with a special live broadcast on Saturday.
For Camilla - who has produced On Your Behalf for 10 years - some battles stand out.
There was the man without electricity on the north coast who had been told he would have to fork out Â£67,000 to have it installed.
The County Londonderry home that he had lived in since 1983, had been heated by two open coal fires, with candles providing his only light.
It sounded impossible. Northern Ireland Electricity said it would cost too much to get cables going underground to Downhill, close to Coleraine, where his home nestled under the cliffs looking out on the sea.
"We asked the questions that led Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) to change its policy and not charge the pensioner tens of thousands of pounds to bring electricity to his home," said Camilla.
"We asked why, over a three-year period, the power company kept telling the pensioner he would have to pay tens of thousands of pounds to gain access to the grid?
"We discovered that, over that same time period, the company had made over a quarter of a billion pounds in profit," she said.
"So we simply asked why NIE was asking the pensioner to pay for its infrastructure during a time that it made over Â£250m in profit.
"In the end, the company covered the cost of bringing electricity to the area and residents were then allowed to connect paying the normal connection charges that others would pay for new builds, etc."
Such battles are grist to the mill of On Your Behalf. Finding solutions and righting wrongs it what makes their jobs worthwhile.
Another call from a listener about faulty gas installations in Belfast spurred the team into action. Claims that the complaints were linked to election tactics did not deter them. In the end, they won that battle too.
"We investigated, and nine out of 10 gas installations in Housing Executive properties in north and west Belfast were found to be faulty and in the end the Housing Executive made the necessary changes," said Camilla.
"It's never about the politics for us - it's about the listener and, where possible, getting the answers they need."
The team has won a name for being dogged and determined in pursuit of what is fair and just. Camilla has enjoyed every minute of her decade with the programme.
"It is not often that you get to work on something that has one goal and that is to answer: 'Who have we helped?'" she said.
"I enjoy not only the individual listener query, but the lessons learned for everyone who listens, including the team. I've been a journalist for more than 30 years and I can honestly say that On Your Behalf is at the heart of why I became a journalist.
"It is an opportunity to challenge authority, ask the relevant questions, investigate issues raised and, occasionally, produce great radio in the process.   It's a privilege."
She said that what many listeners did not know is that only a few of the queries received make it to air. However, the team does not let the others simple slide.
"We do our best to help everyone who phones, texts, tweets or emails, whether it's pointing them in the direction of an organisation that may best help answer their question or getting the answer for them.
"Of course, we don't always get the answers people hope for, but we do our best to sort through the muck that so many consumers face."
Helping them celebrate in a live anniversary programme on Saturday, will be programme regulars from down the years - Professor Eileen Evason; Financial Ombudsman David Cresswell; ABTA's Doreen McKenzie; Joan Whiteside; Hazel Scott and Jimmy Hughes.
Presenter Linda McAuley will also hear from some of the thousands people who tuned in and turned to Radio Ulster for help.
"I'm delighted that On Your Behalf has been getting results for listeners for 20 years," she said. "Over those two decades we've been trusted by listeners, who remain at the heart of what we do."
The On Your Behalf team of three also includes content assistant Louisa McCartney.
"Linda is magnificent, a class act through and through and Louisa is a huge gift," said Camilla. "Editor Michael Tumelty has also been a rock."
Last year, Linda McAuley was awarded the Trading Standards Institute Media Hero Award 2014 for tireless work in consumer protection.
The UK-wide award is given to a member of the media - across television, radio, print and online - who has dedicated themselves to publicising issues surrounding consumer protection.
The programme's website offers a chance to listen again to important moments over the past 20 years.
The On Your Behalf 20th anniversary special is live on Radio Ulster on Saturday 26 September at 09.45 BST.
