Cereal harvest yields forecast to hit 20-year high

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland could see its best cereal harvest yields in 20 years despite poor growing conditions this year, according to government statisticians.

They estimate Scottish farms will produce 3.3 million tonnes of cereals - including two million tonnes of barley and one million tonnes of wheat.
The rise in production was attributed to an expected 5% improvement in overall yields.
This is despite a 4% decrease in the total area of land sown.
The figures released are provisional estimates.
Oats have seen the largest estimated rise in production, increasing by about 17% to 180,000 tonnes.
Just over a million tonnes of wheat are expected, up from 990,000 tonnes last year, while winter barley production is expected to rise from 410,000 to 430,000 tonnes.
Oilseed rape crops have seen a small production rise from 148,000 to 151,000 tonnes.
Spring barley is the only major cereal crop to see reduced production this year, with wheat replacing barley in some areas.
Production is expected to fall by about 100,000 tonnes to 1.57 million tonnes.
Despite high production volumes overall, industry exports raised concerns over grain quality at the Scottish government's annual crop report meeting.
It heard that the 2015 harvest was late to start and, once underway, was halted several times by poor weather conditions.
This was found to have restricted crop development, which contributed to reduced grain quality in some cases.
Rural Affair Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "This year's cereal harvest estimates are testament to the professionalism and hard work of Scotland's farmers.
"They are a great achievement, especially considering the poor growing conditions we have had in Scotland, with some parts of the country experiencing the wettest summer in a century.
"I am pleased to see such high yields being reported this year, undoubtedly helped by the recent spell of more settled weather conditions.
"However, I am aware that producers in some areas, such as Shetland, have yet to harvest their crops, and the Scottish government, NFUS and other stakeholders continue to closely monitor the situation through our wet weather working group."
Final harvest estimates will be announced by Scotland's chief statistician in December.
