A Scunthorpe woman has donated one of her kidneys after an online appeal to save the life of a 26-year-old woman who needed a transplant.

Mother-of-two Louise Drewery responded following the Facebook message by the father of Stacey Hewitt, who lives in Redcar.
The transplant was carried out at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle in February.
Ms Drewery said that both herself and Ms Hewitt were doing well.
The pair's story will feature in a television documentary on Wednesday.
Ms Drewery said she was motivated to help after hearing how the illness was affecting Ms Hewitt's young son, Alfie.
"I just thought I can help somebody else make their life easier, which it has done for Stacey. She's not tired all the time, she's got so much more energy," she said.
"She can do things with her little boy that she couldn't do before.
"It makes me happy that she is doing so well."
Ms Drewery's husband Nigel initially offered to donate the kidney, but the couple found out his blood group was incompatible.
The whole process of tests took 13 months before she was accepted as a donor.
"It was almost like it was supposed to be," said Ms Drewery.
"Every single test was spot on."
Ms Drewery said that since the surgery the pair have developed a friendship and talk to each other nearly every day.
Ms Hewitt said she did not think her father's Facebook post would attract any donors. She said she was "very thankful" for her new kidney.
"I can't thank her enough," she said.
"She's made my life a lot better."
