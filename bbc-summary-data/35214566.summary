Thames Valley Police said a man was seen approaching a woman on the Iron Bridge, Aylesbury, and after talking to her, sexually assaulted her.
The victim, a woman described as white, in her early 20s, and wearing a patterned dress and jacket, broke away from the offender and ran off.
A man, 21, from Aylesbury was later held on suspicion of sexual assault.
He was released on police bail until 13 February.
Pc Cat Cameron said: "Although we are investigating the incident as a sexual assault we are keeping an open mind until we have spoken to the victim.
"The offence was witnessed and the police were called to the scene however the victim had already left the area."
Anyone with information is asked to contact Thames Valley Police.
