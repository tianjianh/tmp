Gaping hole left in Devon house after cob wall collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gaping hole has been left in a house built of cob after an outside wall collapsed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The side of the cottage built from a combination of mud and straw crumbled in Sampford Courtenay, near Okehampton in Devon.
It is not yet known what caused the collapse but heavy rain has been blamed for similar incidents in the past.
No-one was injured and the road has been cordoned off while building inspections take place.
More on the cottage collapse, plus more Devon and Cornwall news
Thousands of cob houses and farm buildings dating from the 14th Century have survived in the south-west of England.
A number of other cob buildings have collapsed after heavy rain including  a section of wall of the King's Head pub in Cullompton High Street in 2014.
A nearby derelict laundrette also fell on to the High Street the same year.
