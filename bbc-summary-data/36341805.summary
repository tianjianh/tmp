Cornish Pirates have signed fly-half Bar Bartlett from National One side Loughborough Students.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old was part of Worcester's academy and has played for the Premiership side's A League team.
Bartlett played for the Pirates in a friendly match last October.
"Bar came down for a time during our last pre-season and impressed with not only his skill set but his attitude to improve and work hard," said outgoing Pirates boss Ian Davies.
"We have a strong link up with Dave Morris and Loughborough University and I'm sure Bar will follow previous alumni by becoming a very good player for the Pirates."
