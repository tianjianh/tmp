[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The English Football League will take no action against Huddersfield Town over their team selection for their defeat at Birmingham City on 29 April.

Town, already guaranteed a Championship play-off spot, lost 2-0 after making 10 changes against struggling Blues.
Tony Mowbray, whose Blackburn side were also battling against relegation, later questioned Huddersfield's line-up.
But after the Terriers gave their observations, it was decided that no disciplinary action would be taken.
The defeat left Mowbray's Rovers in the Championship's bottom three and their relegation - by virtue of goal difference - was confirmed on the final day of the campaign as Blues stayed up.
Meanwhile, Huddersfield won their play-off semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday on penalties to set up a play-off final against Reading on 29 May.
An EFL statement read: "The EFL board accepts that clubs' primary obligation will always be to themselves, however, there is a significant concern that by adopting this approach it could have a detrimental effect on the competiveness and reputation of the league competition.
"Having considered all matters, there is no doubt in the board's mind that Huddersfield Town could have fielded a 'stronger' team, but in the absence of a full and detailed definition of what constitutes 'full strength', there was sufficient scope for the club to make a significant number of changes to its starting line-up."
Huddersfield's challenge to the 'full strength' definition has prompted the EFL to review this prior to its annual general meeting in June.
The statement read: "The board has requested the EFL executive to consider amendments to ensure that the actions of any individual club cannot be seen to negatively impact the credibility and public perception of the competition.
"Proposed revisions will be discussed with all 72 member clubs at the EFL AGM in June."
