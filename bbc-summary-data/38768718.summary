[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old was previously on loan with Championship rivals Wolves, making 20 appearances this term.
He scored twice in a league win over Brentford in September, but has only played four games since Paul Lambert was named Wolves boss on 5 November.
Teixeira's last appearance for Wolves came as a second-half substitute in the 2-1 loss to Cardiff on 13 December.
The Molineux club signed forward Andreas Weimann on loan from Derby County last week.
