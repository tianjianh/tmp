But Scottish side Partick Thistle's new mascot, Kingsley, has been labelled too scary by some fans.
He was designed by famous artist, David Shrigley but loads of fans have complained that he might frighten younger supporters.
Kingsley told the BBC that people just need time to warm to him though.
"I'm just new to this game but hopefully all the other mascots will realise that it isn't what's on the outside that counts and we can all be friends."
But Kingsley isn't the first mascot to make the news.
Cooly the cow was a mascot at the 2014 European Athletics Championships in Zurich.
The mascot delighted the crowds by having a go at sports like pole vaulting and hurdling during the championships.
Southampton FC's Sammy Saint made the headlines for all the right reasons!
The south coast's top dog showed off his dance moves before a premier league match with Norwich in 2012.
Imitating South Korean rapper Psy's trademark moves, he wowed the crowd and even got people following the dance with him.
And luckily for us, Sammy's Gangnam style moves were caught on camera!
Speaking of dancing mascots, how about Manchas from Mexico.
Manchas, a mascot for a dairy company went viral after the cows crazy dance moves were caught on camera and posted on social media.
The mascot is well known in Mexico for its dancing, and often challenges other mascots to a dance off.
Meet Clyde, the official mascot for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
But Clyde wouldn't exist if it wasn't for 12-year-old Beth from Cumbernauld.
She won a competition to design a mascot for the games.
Clyde went on to represent Glasgow and the whole of Scotland when the games were held last year and became a bit of a media star.
And where do mascots go to learn the tricks of the trade? Mascot school of course! Well, those in Japan do.
That's right, fluffy cats or giant pigs can all be found at a very special school in Tokyo, the capital of Japan.
The school is used to teach the people behind the costumes how to entertain crowds.
Don't believe us, watch the clip to see for yourself.
