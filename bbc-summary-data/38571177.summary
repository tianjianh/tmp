[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to redevelop part of central Southampton alongside the medieval town walls have been given the go-ahead by city councillors.

More than 150 flats, as well as student accommodation and shops, would be built in the Queensway and East Street area.
Existing businesses, which face having to relocate, have criticised the proposals.
Developer Tellon Capital said the scheme would "enhance the city and bring the walls back to life".
The plans, approved by the council's planning committee, involve an open boulevard, making a feature of the medieval walls which are currently tucked away among the side of buildings.
The Bargate was the first part of the town walls to be built, dating to about 1180, with alterations in about 1290. Southampton did not become a city until 1964.
The existing 1980s Bargate shopping centre and multi-storey car park are among the buildings earmarked for demolition to make way for 152 flats, 185 student residential units, shops and restaurants.
About 10 businesses face having to relocate under the proposals.
Dale Milner of Titanic Tattoo and Piercing said the plans were "selfish".
"They've not thought of the people who work in the area - we bring in a lot of money, paying the rates. It's people's livelihoods."

James Burchell of Tellon Capital said discussions were continuing with business owners.
"We'll have a vibrant, dynamic, exciting area which will rehabilitate the walls and the Bargate area.
"We're conscious of disruption to smaller local businesses, but we're also very conscious of the improvement we're going to be making to the city centre."
Council leader Simon Letts said the project represented a "new era" for the city centre.
"The regeneration plans will not only create job opportunities for locals, but the apartments will help to create a vibrant community in the city centre," he added.
Work could start in the autumn with the plans due to take two years to complete.
