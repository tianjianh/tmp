Final Clair Ridge parts leave South Korea for Shetland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final parts for new offshore installations in the Clair Ridge oilfield, west of Shetland, have left a construction yard in South Korea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The drilling modules have been built by Hyundai Heavy Industries for the oil company BP.
The parts, along with others already being transported by sea to the field, are due to arrive off Shetland in May.
A floating crane will be used to lift the modules onto two new platforms already at the field.
It will then take a workforce of about 750 people to install and commission them.
Once that work has been completed, the two platforms are expected to begin drilling operations.
The oil will be piped ashore at Sullom Voe in Shetland for treatment and distribution by tanker. The first oil is expected to start flowing by the end of next year.
The Clair Ridge development is expected to produce about 640 million barrels of crude over the following 40 years.
