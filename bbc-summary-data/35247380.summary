Newport County are confident Saturday's FA Cup third round match at home to Blackburn Rovers will go ahead.

The League Two club and Newport RFC had games postponed last weekend due to a waterlogged pitch at Rodney Parade.
Further heavy rain is expected in south east Wales on Wednesday night but a dry period is then expected from Thursday morning until noon on Saturday.
"I think we'll be fine, at this moment we aren't concerned," said Rodney Parade head of operations Mark Jones.
"We haven't even discussed the possibility of the game being off and don't anticipate having that conversation.
"We also expect the Newport RFC v Carmarthen Quins game on Sunday to go ahead as planned."
Saturday's match will be Newport's first in the third round of the FA Cup in 30 years and the first competitive match between the two clubs.
Championship side Blackburn are expected to select Wales international Tom Lawrence to face John Sheridan's men. Lawrence's loan from Leicester City has been extended until 5 February.
