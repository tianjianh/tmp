Wendie Renard glanced in a header from a corner deep into injury time to consign Mark Sampson's side to a cruel defeat in Pennsylvania.
Marie-Laure Delie had headed France level with 10 minutes to go after Jordan Nobbs' 25-yard opening goal.
England's second game in the four-team tournament is against hosts the United States in New Jersey on Saturday.
They then finish with a game against Germany in Washington on 7 March.
Wednesday's result means England are still waiting for their first victory in the SheBelieves Cup, having drawn one and lost two in last year's event, and are without a win over the French since 1974.
Sampson's team are the lowest-ranked side in the event, with World Cup holders USA first, European and Olympic champions Germany second and France third.
The USA later beat Germany 1-0, with Lynn Williams scoring for the hosts.
