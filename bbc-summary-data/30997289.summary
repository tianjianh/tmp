People have been warned not to dine out on fish salvaged from the street after a lorry shed 600 mackerel in Belfast at the weekend.

The fish spilled off the lorry at the Ravenhill Road on Saturday night.
Some people were photographed filling bags with the mackerel, relishing the thought of  free take-away fish suppers.
But Belfast City Council experts said this was unsafe.
"We would strong advise against the consumption of food where you are not clear as to its source or if it is safe to eat," a council spokesperson said.
"In any event, there is a possibility of the fish being contaminated through direct contact with the road, rendering it unfit for human consumption."
The spokesperson said the council's environmental health team had removed up to 600 fish from the area around the Ravenhill and My Lady's Road.
