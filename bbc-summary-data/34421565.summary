It follows a crash involving two riders and a spectator at this year's event.
Spectator Violet McAfee, 44, had to be airlifted to hospital after the crash.
The changes include fewer riders and bikes starting in each wave on the grid, as well as more announcements to improve communication to riders.
Mervyn Whyte, event director of the North West 200, said: "We have taken on board the views of everyone involved in the race and have been engaged in intensive consultation with fans, team principals and riders over the past four months.
"Our aim is to improve the race organisation, making its operation both faster and more efficient. As a result we intend to introduce these significant changes for 2016."
The changes to be brought in are:
Ms McAfee was in the garden of a friend's house when three bikes crashed during the opening race last week.
She suffered serious head and leg injuries but has been making a good recovery.
