The free two-day VegFest, in the Hove Centre, included 100 stalls, cookery classes, music and theatre.
The festival's organiser, Tim Barford, estimated 5,000 people attended the festival, which he hoped would encourage people to eat less meat.
"Quite a lot of people are gravitating to a whole food diet that isn't quite so reliant on processed food," he said.
