The broadcaster tweeted that she was "absolutely thrilled" to have been chosen to be the show's lead presenter from 17 October.
Jonathan Samuels said he was "hugely excited" to be appointed Mee's co-host.
Mee, who began her career at Sky as a runner for Sky Sports, added: "Taking over from Eamonn is a real honour. Live news is always such a thrill."
The 38-year-old has also worked for ITV as a sports reporter and presenter in the Midlands.
She returned to Sky in 2008, and viewers have seen her hosting Saturday Night Football and Cricket AM on the Sky Sports channel.
Stephen Dixon will continue to host Sunrise from Friday to Sunday alongside co-host Isabel Webster.
Holmes announced he was leaving Sunrise earlier this month after 11 years presenting the breakfast show.
The 56-year-old said he wanted to "step away" in order to "produce and present a number of documentary projects".
