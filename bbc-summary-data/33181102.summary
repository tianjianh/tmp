A man, described by police as a "vile paedophile", has been jailed for the prolonged sexual abuse of a young girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Dale Iveson, 48, of Anchorage Hill, Richmond, began abusing the girl in 2005 when she was under 10. The abuse continued until 2013.
Iveson had denied nine child sex offences, 11 counts of rape and five other sexual offences.
He was jailed for 20 years and put on the sex offenders register for life at Teesside Crown Court.
Speaking after sentencing Det Insp Shaun Page, of North Yorkshire Police, said it had been the "most horrific" abuse he had dealt with in 19 years as a police officer.
"The ordeal he put his victim through when she should have been enjoying her childhood was downright evil and I can only describe him as a monster.
"I would like to acknowledge the bravery of the victim for coming forward and telling the police what happened to her.
"Her courage has ensured that a vile and dangerous paedophile has been jailed for a long period of time."
