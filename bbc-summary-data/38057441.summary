Six people have contacted police after a former professional footballer spoke about the sexual abuse he suffered from a club coach when he was a child.

Former Bury and Sheffield United player Andy Woodward was abused by Barry Bennell while at Crewe Alexandra from the age of 11 to 15.
Bennell was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys.
Cheshire Police said officers were contacting the six people.
It is not known whether those contacting police are potential victims or witnesses.
Mr Woodward has previously spoken of his decision to waive his anonymity to raise awareness, because he believed there were more victims of Bennell and other abusers.
He said he was "speechless" from the support he had received from fans and former players since going public - and encouraged other victims to come forward.
A spokesman for Cheshire Police said the force took all reports of sexual abuse "extremely seriously".
Acting Det Sgt Ben Hilton, of the force's Public Protection Unit, said: "As of Monday 21 November we have been made aware of six other people who have come forward wishing to speak to the police.
"We are currently in the process of making contact with the six people, and at this stage no one else is under investigation."
