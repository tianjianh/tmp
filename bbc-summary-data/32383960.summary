[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shanay Walker murder: Dozens of injuries on body

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seven-year-old girl who was found dead in her bed had dozens of injuries on her body, a murder trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shanay Walker was living with her aunt and guardian Kay-Ann Morris when she was found dead in July 2014.
Ms Morris, 24, of Beckhampton Road, Nottingham, has denied murder and cruelty charges.
Shanay's grandmother Juanila Smikle, 53, of Easegill Court in Top Valley, also denied cruelty charges relating to Shanay and four other children.
Ms Morris, is also charged with cruelty against two other children in 2011.
The court heard Ms Morris told police officers Shanay had accidently fallen down the stairs.
The prosecution said the aunt was "covering up the truth" that she had subjected her niece to a "sustained, vicious and brutal beating".
A paramedic who arrived at the scene said the child's leg were "covered in bruises and scab wounds".
A post-mortem examination found more than 50 injuries to Shanay's body, face, arms, legs and buttocks and the cause of death was a brain injury.
Teachers at Shanay's school told police her personality changed from "bubbly and happy" to "introverted and anxious" when she was around her aunt.
The prosecution said two neighbours had told police they had seen Shanay "upset, crying and even hysterical" at times.
The trial continues.
