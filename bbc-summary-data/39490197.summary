The Archbishop said he was "delighted" to welcome Bishop Thornton to Lambeth Palace.
"His work on Feeding Britain demonstrates his range of ability and skill in bringing people together," he said.
The Bishop of St Germans, the Rt Rev Dr Chris Goldsmith, said Bishop Thornton would be missed in Cornwall.
"Not only has he been tireless in inspiring people to look for new ways to meet the challenges of ensuring the church remains relevant, engaged and engaging in the 21st Century, he has also been a keen advocate for the county, and particularly some of its least privileged members," he said.
