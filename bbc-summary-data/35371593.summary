Vaas took 755 wickets for his country, playing in 111 Tests and 322 one-day matches.
Since retiring in 2012, the 41-year-old has worked as a bowling consultant for Sri Lanka and New Zealand.
Vaas' short-term contract will begin next month and will continue until the end of Ireland's World T20 campaign, which starts in March.
"It's great to have Chaminda with us through the build-up as well as during the World T20," Ireland coach John Bracewell said.
"His ability to get wickets in all forms of the game especially on the sub-continent was extraordinary. This experience will be invaluable to our bowling group."
Vaas said he was relishing the prospect of sharing the knowledge and experience he had picked up.
"I've played with and against some of the guys during my time in county cricket with Middlesex and Northants," Vaas added.
"There's a lot of talent and experience in the squad which I'm confident I can add to."
Vaas holds the record for the best bowling figures in one-day internationals with his 8-19 off eight overs against Zimbabwe in 2001.
The Irish will open their World T20 campaign in India against Oman on 8 March before going on to face Bangladesh (11 March) and the Netherlands (14 March) in the qualifying group, with only the winners going on to the Super 10 stage.
Prior to the World T20, the Irish will have a busy programme of games in Australia and Abu Dhabi which includes the four-day Intercontinental Cup game against Papua New Guinea, which begins in Townsville in Queensland on 31 January.
