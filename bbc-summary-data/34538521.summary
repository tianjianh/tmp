The incident happened between 16:30 and 16:45 on Wednesday as the woman was walking home on a path in Silverknowes.
The man approached her from behind on the path linking Silverknowes Hill with Silverknowes Road.
He was carrying a knife and demanded she hand over her purse, but she refused and then "deterred the attacker" by waving her mobility stick.
The man walked away empty handed - heading back towards Silverknowes Hill before being lost from sight.
An extensive inquiry is now under way and witnesses are being urged to come forward.
The man was described as white, about 6ft tall, with a thin face. He was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up.
Det Insp John Kavanagh, of Police Scotland, said: "Thankfully, the woman was unhurt but it goes without saying that we take a zero tolerance approach towards such despicable crimes.
"The incident was carried out during daylight hours and I would hope that someone may have seen the suspect in the area and can provide us with important information."
