Jorge Sampaoli: Sevilla boss says Argentina want him

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli says Argentina want to make him their new manager and Saturday's home match with Osasuna could be his last in charge.

Sampaoli, 57, has steered Sevilla to a fourth-placed finish in La Liga after taking charge last summer.
"My contract with the club contains clauses which allow me to leave," said Argentine Sampaoli.
"There's a clear desire from my country to have me as coach and I've had a dream of taking that chance."
Former Chile boss Sampaoli steered Sevilla to the last 16 of the Champions League before losing 3-2 on aggregate to Leicester City.
Argentina sacked Edgardo Bauza last month after eight matches as coach.
Sampaoli said he rejected the chance to take charge of Argentina last year.
"I feel I would only leave for the benefit of my career and despite not being able to keep on managing in one of the best leagues, taking over my national team is something I could not refuse now.
"But the decision will be made by the president, there is a contract to respect and nothing has been resolved yet."
