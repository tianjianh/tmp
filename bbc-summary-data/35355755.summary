Dozens of pupils are absent from a primary school in Cumbria due to an outbreak of norovirus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 70 of the 284 pupils at Dearham Primary School in Maryport are off sick after contracting the winter vomiting bug over the weekend.
A spokesman said they were following protocol and those affected have been asked to stay away from school for 48 hours until they are symptom-free.
Public Health England said it was investigating an outbreak among pupils.
Norovirus is one of the most common stomach bugs in the UK and causes diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
