Kilmallie came back from 3-0 down on a game held in the shadow of three recent deaths connected with their club, including leading player Duncan Rodger.
The runners-up were also consigned to the bottom of the Marine Harvest Premiership when local rivals Lochaber defeated Glasgow Mid Argyll 2-1 to leapfrog them.
Newtonmore built up a 3-0 lead in their quest for a 41st title since 1902 when Steven MacDonald and Drew MacDonald both scored in the first half and Fraser MacKintosh followed up early in the second.
But just when the game looked over, Michael Rodger and Callum McDougall put Kilmallie right back into it. However, the challengers just could not force extra time.
Kinlochshiel lost their 100% league record when Glenurquhart bounced back from their Camanachd Cup exit for a 2-0 victory in Drumnadrochit.
For the second home game in a row, former top-flight football goalkeeper Michael Fraser gave Glenurquhart the lead after a goalless first half. Daniel MacKintosh then confirmed Glen's upward move into sixth place with their second on 78 minutes.
Regular Lochaber scorers Shaun Nicholson and Stuart Callison got one each and Seb MacMillan replied fpr Mid Argyll as the Spean Bridge side came off the bottom.
Fraser Watt got two including a penalty as Inveraray progressed 3-1 at the expense of Argyllshire rivals Oban Celtic in the Balliemore Cup.
