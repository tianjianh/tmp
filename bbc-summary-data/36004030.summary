Home striker John Rooney was denied from the spot by Welling keeper Marek Rodak but soon redeemed himself with a curling shot from 12 yards.
The 25-year-old doubled Chester's lead as he fired in James Alabi's cross before turning provider for Kane Richards to net the third.
Tom Shaw wrapped up the win as Welling managed just one shot on target.
