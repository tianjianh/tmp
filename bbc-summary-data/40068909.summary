Father-of-three Eifion Gwynne, 41, an electrician who played rugby for Aberystwyth and Llandovery, died in October after a crash in Malaga.
About 4,000 spectators watched the game at Aberystwyth RFC, which featured the likes of Colin Charvis, Dafydd Jones and Garan Evans.
All the proceeds went to the Eifion Gwynne Memorial Fund.
The game saw a Wales XV -made up of ex-internationals, Wales sevens and regional players take on an Eifion Gwynne XV - made up of Aberystwyth and Llandovery players.
Speaking after the game, Mr Gwynne's wife Nia said it was a day of mixed emotions.
"There's a huge void in our life without Eifion, he was a huge family man," she said.
"Today is a day to remember him.
"To have a rugby match in his memory and all these ex-Welsh internationals and Lions players, it really is fantastic."
Dafydd Jones played with Mr Gwynne at county level and described him as a "special guy".
"Everyone thought the world of him," he said.
"A great player and a great bloke, on and off the pitch."
Singer Meic Stevens performed after the game, followed by an auction, and then a performance from #band6.
