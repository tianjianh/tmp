It comes after unconfirmed reports they found a baby's remains in a bag at a building at the Stobhill site.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it could not comment on the alleged discovery at the secure facility which is used to store medical "artefacts".
The teenagers, who are aged 13 and 14 years old, have been reported to the Children's Reporter.
A video appearing to show the discovery has been posted online.
A statement from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: "A locked building within the Stobhill Hospital site was broken into at the weekend. The secured facility is used to store artefacts, all of which comply with relevant legislation.
"The matter is subject to an ongoing criminal investigation."
The building involved is a storage facility and is part of the old Stobhill Hospital which sits on the same site as the newer facility.
Police Scotland confirmed six teenagers had been arrested for alleged theft by housebreaking.
Three 13-year-olds and three 14-year-olds were detained on 17 and 18 August.
