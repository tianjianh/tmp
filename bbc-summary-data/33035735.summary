It happened on the river between Magheramason in County Tyrone and Carrigans in County Donegal.
The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, the PSNI and the Irish coastguard were among those involved in the rescue.
Six people were airlifted to Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital and were treated for mild hypothermia.
Another 12 were taken by ambulance and the rest were treated at the scene.
Two canoes were taking part in a "married versus singles" race when one of them capsized at about 14:00 BST on Saturday during a fundraising event for the YMCA.
It is understood there was a heavy swell in windy conditions and both canoes had begun to take in water.
William Lamrock from the YMCA said all 26 people ended up, some for about 20 minutes. All were wearing life jackets.
He said one of the boats was able to help the other after it overturned and everyone had reached the shore by the time emergency services arrived.
The second boat capsized close to the shore.
"We're very, very thankful that this didn't end up in a horrific incident," he said.
"Thankfully everyone knew what they were doing and thankfully the people with the canoes gave good leadership and we got ashore."
The rescue operation, which was declared a major incident, also involved the Coleraine Coastguard Rescue Team, Foyle Search and Rescue and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service.
John McPoland, from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, said: "All services sprung into action very quickly and thankfully everybody was taken from the water.
"What we've found today is that our capacity to respond to such an incident was severely tested for all emergency services and it's a tribute to all the services involved that they were able to pull together so quickly and ensure there was no tragedies involved in today's incident."
SDLP Foyle assembly member Mark H Durkan tweeted: "Just been at scene of major incident response at River Foyle, think everyone out of water ok. Well done emergency teams!"
In a further statement he said: "It has been a cold day and the water in the river would have been freezing.
"Coupled with the strong current and high tide it is extremely fortunate that we did not witness a tragedy here today.
"I must commend the swift and brave actions of Foyle Search and Rescue, the Irish Coastguard and all the emergency services whose efficiency and professionalism certainly saved lives."
