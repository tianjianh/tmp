Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes Swansea City are good enough to avoid relegation despite watching his side thrash them 4-0 at the Liberty Stadium.

The Swans are bottom of the Premier League after Saturday's heavy defeat.
New head coach Paul Clement admits it will be "very hard" to keep them up, but Wenger has hope for Swansea.
"When you lack confidence you need a win and when you lose again, it seems difficult. I feel they have enough quality to get out of it," he said.
"When you're down there it's a vicious circle because you lack confidence.
Swansea showed signs of improvement in the first half against Arsenal, pressing the Gunners high up the pitch and limiting their scoring opportunities.
Wenger praised the Swans for their "unbelievable" workrate but, once Olivier Giroud had given Arsenal the lead, Clement's side simply unravelled.
Swansea's defence was already the leakiest in the Premier League before the Gunners' visit, and the hosts' second-half capitulation underlined the daunting challenge Clement faces in trying to preserve his team's top-flight status.
"Everyone knows the task at hand is a very hard one but we're all up for it," said the former Bayern Munich assistant manager.
"There are games we are not necessarily expected to win. That's maybe one today, though we would have wanted the scoreline to be much closer.
"This is a team over recent weeks which has had some crushing defeats, goals have gone in and the players are all human beings. They go through good periods, bad periods and confidence can be affected.
"My job is to try and get them as organised as possible and well prepared as possible.
"When you're a player and you know you're well prepared, you've got a better chance of being confident and a better chance of getting results."
Ex-England midfielder Danny Murphy: "Arsenal have missed Mesut Ozil for a few games but he made a big difference against Swansea. Ozil was exceptional in crucial areas of the pitch.
"He makes the right decisions nine times out of 10. Ozil gives that extra quality and class in final third. Arsenal are a better team when he is in it. Alexis Sanchez and Ozil together make Arsenal an exceptional and dangerous team.
"Paul Clement will be on training pitch as long as he can. He is a workaholic. He will be quite savvy in the transfer market. He will improve Swansea but whether it will be enough, we'll have to wait and see."
Ex-Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Swansea's penalty appeal: "Swans boss Paul Clement said he thought it was a penalty. I didn't think it was. Ki Sung-yueng was searching for the (Laurent Koscielny's) foot and I think he kicks the foot. Those have been given."
On Sanchez's reaction to being taken off: "He is disappointed. He doesn't want to be taken off. He's so integral to Arsenal. If Sanchez is not there, there is massive problem."
