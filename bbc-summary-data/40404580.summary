The 59-year-old played more than 100 games for the Reds during a three-year spell from 1984.
Metgod, who joined Forest from Real Madrid, moved into coaching in 1994 and worked under Nigel Clough as Derby County first-team coach from 2009-13.
"I have good memories of Nottingham. It feels like coming home," Metgod told the club website.
"In football, you get to know people and sometimes those contacts work out. I met with Mr Marinakis [new Forest owner] and spoke to him about what he wanted to do at the club and the project here and it was something that excited me.
"There are great football people at the club and I am really optimistic that we will be able to achieve something here.
"Being on the board is a first for me. It is a good challenge and I like the project here and that it is going to be step by step and not something that is done quickly."
Chairman Nicholas Randall added: "From the outset we wanted a former player with experience of both English and continental football to sit with us on the board to enhance our football knowledge."
