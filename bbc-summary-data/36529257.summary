League One side Northampton Town have signed striker Alex Revell and Swansea left-back Raheem Hanley two-year deals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Brighton, Rotherham and Cardiff forward Revell, 32, finished last season with MK Dons, where he netted four times in 17 Championship games.
He has scored 94 goals in 494 appearances during his career and won promotion with Rotherham twice.
Hanley, 22, joined the Swans from Blackburn in 2014, but did not make a first-team appearance.
His contract with the Premier League club expires at the end of the month.
Manager Rob Page said of Revell: "Alex is a fantastic signing for us and I am delighted to welcome him to the club.
"This is a big signing for the club, a statement from us and we have had to be patient but we have beaten off a lot of competition to secure Alex's signature."
Both deals will be completed on 1 July when their contracts with their previous clubs expire.
