Artist Spencer Tunick photographed 3,200 people at sites around the city on 9 July for the Sea of Hull project.
The images will go on show at the Ferens Art Gallery, in Hull, as part of a new exhibition called SKIN.
The Sea of Hull was commissioned by the gallery to mark Hull's 2017 UK City of Culture status.

Participants in the project will be invited to a special preview event attended by Tunick at 18:15 BST before the exhibition opens to the public on Saturday.
Speaking in 2016, Tunick said: "The Sea of Hull installation was one of the most fantastic projects I've ever done, and it was inspiring to be able to intertwine the city's maritime heritage against an urban backdrop throughout the whole piece."
The exhibition will include three of Tunick's photographs that have been bought by the gallery, while the Friends of Ferens Gallery are set to launch a crowd funding bid to buy a fourth.
Hull City Councillor Terry Geraghty said: "This bold and ambitious exhibition is one of the gallery's major highlights for 2017, in addition to the esteemed Turner Prize later this year."
Other artworks going on show at the gallery include works by Lucian Freud and sculptor Ron Mueck.
A preparatory study for Edouard Manet's controversial Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe will also feature in the exhibition, which runs from 22 April to 13 August.
