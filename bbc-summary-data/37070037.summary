[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bowlers dominated on a tricky day one pitch at Worcester as Glamorgan struggled to 118-5 in reply to Worcestershire's 163.

The hosts collapsed to 37-5 against Glamorgan's seamers before Ross Whiteley (40) and Joe Leach (43) brought some respectability to the home score in a seventh-wicket stand of 66.
Michael Hogan (4-44) led the assault with his usual accuracy.
But only Will Bragg (75*) then made any impact as the home attack got on top.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph had little hesitation about asking the home side to bat, given the cloudy conditions and a mottled wicket.
Hogan, Lukas Carey, Graham Wagg and the economical Craig Meschede gave Worcestershire little respite, although some poor choices of shot contributed to their own downfall.
But then Glamorgan could find no-one with the patience to match Bragg, who hit 13 fours as he waited for the odd loose ball, and gave his team a marginal advantage on day one.
Vice-captain Leach took two wickets, while Jack Shantry, younger brother of former Glamorgan fast bowler Adam Shantry, conceded just 14 runs from his 10 overs.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Radio Hereford & Worcester:
"We fought back really well because, at 37-5, we were in all sorts of trouble. We played some shots we would like to rewind, but the way we fought back got us back in the game.
"The wicket did a bit, not a lot but sometimes these days, with the different forms of cricket, batsman panic a bit and don't trust their defence as much as they should in the longer format.
"Will Bragg's innings has been crucial. He's played really well. It would be nice to get him early."
Glamorgan seam bowler Michael Hogan told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's a bit of a strange one because the wicket didn't really seem to offer a great deal. 15 wickets on that pitch was a bit surprising. Both teams will be a bit disappointed with a few shots they played.
"There was a little bit of swing out there but not a great deal went off the seam.  Will Bragg's the difference so far. He's the only batter who's played the pitch like we read it. He's hit the ball really well.
"We said before that we could be in for a bit of a scrap and we need to come out on top. It's even now but any lead could be crucial."
