Sotiris Papagiannopoulos: Swedish defender joins Swansea City for trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swedish centre-back Sotiris Papagiannopoulos is joining Premier League side Swansea City for a trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old is contracted to Swedish club Ostersunds FK, so could only sign for the Swans when the transfer window reopens in January.
Swansea say Stockholm-born Papagiannopoulos will train with them for "a few days".
The club have a working relationship with Ostersunds, having signed forward Modou Barrow from them in 2014.
Swansea have signed two central defenders this summer - Alfie Mawson from Barnsley and Mike van der Hoorn from Ajax - while former captain Ashley Williams has joined Everton.
