Place des Anges, in Queens Gardens Hull on Saturday, involved performers dressed as flying angels and fireworks.
Acrobats glided on wires high above the city's buildings and released 1.5 tonnes of feathers on spectators.
A total of 10,000 free tickets had been distributed for the event.
Rosie Millard, who chairs the company running the city of culture activities, said: "This is a wonderful trial run, the curtain-raiser if you like for 2017."
The people in Hull had "a real appetite, they know they have a great year ahead", she added.
Initial demand for the free tickets when they were released had caused the event's website to crash.
The show was created and performed by French theatre producers Gratte Ciel.
Place des Anges was presented by Hull UK City of Culture 2017 and Yorkshire Festival in association with Amy Johnson Festival.
