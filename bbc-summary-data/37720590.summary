Conor Tiley, 18, and Connor Williams, 17, both of Aberbargoed, died when their car hit another on a tight bend in Hengoed on 3 January.
An inquest into their deaths in Newport heard Mr Tiley, who was driving, lost control of his Ford Fiesta.
Assistant Coroner Wendy James concluded both died as a result of a road traffic collision.
The inquest heard the pair were racing another car driven by friend Adam Jones - nicknamed Sheep - at the time of the fatal accident.
Mr Tiley spoke to his friend Louisa Jones just minutes before he died, telling her: "Hang on, we're racing Sheep to McDonald's."
Ms Jones told him "not to do anything silly".
"I heard Connor Williams say 'floor it, go faster' then the line went dead," she told the inquest.
"He was influenced by the other boys. He always wanted to please everyone all the time."
A third friend, Cameron Nicholls, 18, survived but needed treatment for serious injuries.
Mr Tiley lost control of his car before smashing into a Vauxhall Astra driven by Elaine Parsons, who was coming the other way.
Mrs Parsons told the hearing there was nothing she could have done to avoid the crash.
"The oncoming vehicle was completely over the wrong side, because it appeared out of nowhere, and I didn't have time to react," she said.
The inquest heard Mr Jones arrived at the McDonald's in Blackwood, before realising his friends were not there.
He believed they had gone to another McDonald's in nearby Caerphilly instead.
Ms James said: "This has led to a dramatic loss of two young men who had their whole lives in front of them.
"They were two young men who made their respective families proud."
