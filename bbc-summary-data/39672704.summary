The 29-year-old midfielder suffered the injury in the first half of Monday's 3-1 defeat by Portsmouth.
The former Scunthorpe and Rotherham man made 34 appearances this season.
"We are all devastated for Michael, who is a huge influence for us on and off the field," Magpies boss Kevin Nolan told the club website.
