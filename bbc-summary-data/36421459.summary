[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inter Milan chief Michael Bolingbroke to join Goals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals Soccer Centres has continued to beef up its board by appointing Italian club Inter Milan's chief executive as a senior independent non-executive director.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Bolingbroke, 50, will join the East Kilbride-based five-a-side football venue specialist on 13 June.
The move follows the appointment last week of a veteran leisure industry figure to lead Goals.
Mark Jones is leaving the Rank Group to become chief executive on 1 July.
Mr Bolinbroke, who joined Inter Milan in 2014, was chief operating officer of Premier League football club Manchester United from 2007.
He was previously a senior vice-president at Cirque du Soleil and a senior vice-president at The Jim Henson Company. He is also a qualified chartered accountant.
Mr Bolingbroke said: "I am delighted to be joining Goals at this important time in its development.
"I am passionate about all forms of the game and pleased to now be involved in this fast-developing area of the sport.
"I look forward to helping the company realise its significant potential."
The appointments follow a major review by Goals of its operations and the firm's performance in recent years.
It was set up after the company reported its first annual loss in 12 years.
Goals currently operates 46 centres in the UK and one in California.
