A cemetery which saw children "charging about" playing Pokemon Go has been removed from the augmented reality game.

Concerns had been raised about the "inappropriate" use of Redcar cemetery, on Teesside, as a PokeStop.
Local Labour MP Anna Turley wrote to Nintendo about the issue and said she was "pleased" it had now been removed.
The move will allow people to "pay respects to their loved ones in peace", she added.
Ms Turley said: "It is clearly a very popular game that has encouraged people to explore their surroundings, which is great, but there need to be boundaries so that users can enjoy the game without upsetting others.
"The developer has been quick to solve the problem to make sure that is the case."
She asked Nintendo to consider avoiding places of worship and cemeteries after a constituent contacted her about the "impact on the people paying their respects to loved ones", she said.
Game guidelines set out by Nintendo and its co-developer Niantic remind players to be respectful and conduct themselves "in an appropriate manner".
Pokemon Go players have been involved in hundreds of police incidents since the gaming app phenomenon launched.
Developer Niantic has been approached for comment. It has previously stated it takes the issue of "player safety" seriously.
In County Down a man jumped out into a busy dual carriageway while trying to catch a Pokemon, while children got lost in caves in Wiltshire and, in America, a man crashed into a police car while playing behind the wheel.
