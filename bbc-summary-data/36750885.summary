Eileen Brennan, 82, died when the vehicle hit a Halifax branch in Darlington on Thursday.
The driver of the bus, a 52-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and later bailed.
The Great North Air Ambulance said medics also treated a woman in her 50s, for a serious leg injury.
Durham Police said the bus had veered off the road, hitting a pillar near the bank's entrance.
Eyewitnesses described the accident, which happened just before 11:00 BST, as "horrendous".
A spokesman for the Durham force said the cause of the crash was still being investigated.
