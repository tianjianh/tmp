Paul Konchesky: Gillingham left-back joins seventh-tier Billericay Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seventh-tier side Billericay Town have signed left-back Paul Konchesky from Gillingham, BBC Essex reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old defender, capped twice by England, has made 627 professional appearances since his debut for Charlton Athletic in 1997.
Konchesky's clubs also included West Ham, Fulham and Liverpool among others, before he left Leicester City for League One Gillingham in the summer.
He has only featured twice since Ady Pennock became Gills boss in January.
Isthmian League Premier Division Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was "comfortable" investing Â£10,000 a week.
