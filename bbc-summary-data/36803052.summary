Cavan were in front for most of the match, but had half-back Feargal Flanagan dismissed for striking just before half-time.
Emmett McGuckin got an early goal, but Derry trailed 0-11 to 1-4 at half-time.
In a key spell late in the game Derry scored seven points to Cavan's one and went on to clinch the victory.
The draw for round 4A, which takes place on Monday morning, will pair Damian Barton's Oak Leafers with Tipperary or the losers of Sunday's Connacht replay between Galway and Roscommon.
Cavan had the best of the first half, slotting over 10 points, four of them from the boot of Swanlinbar clubman Gearoid McKiernan.
But Derry trailed by just four points at the interval because of McGuckin's fisted goal after Ciaran McFaul's high ball to the edge of the square.
That saw Derry edge into a 1-1 to 0-3 lead, but Cavan then reeled off a string of points to take command.
The Oak Leafers were 0-8 to 1-2 in arrears when they had James Kielt black carded for bringing down Conor Moynagh.
Derry disputed referee Eddie Kinsella's decision but Kielt had to go, with Enda Lynn coming on as his replacement.
Christopher Bradley and Mark Lynch added scores for Derry whose prospects were further boosted when Cavan's Flanagan was shown a straight red card for striking opponent Lynch just before half-time.
Conor McAtamney and Lynch landed the first two scores of the first half to leave Derry just two behind, at 0-11 to 1-6.
Cavan, beaten twice by Derry in the league and McKenna Cup earlier this year, kept their noses in front with keeper Raymond Galligan converting three frees.
But then came Derry's storming finish with sub Niall Toner landing three points and Lynch keeping the scoreboard ticking over to end as the game's top scorer with seven.
Derry manager Damian Barton: "We expected to win the match and we have confounded our critics again.
"We didn't play particularly well in the first half but then we decided to go for it, made a couple of changes and I thought ran out deserved winners. We infiltrated them in the final third with our pace."
Cavan manager Terry Hyland: "When you are a man down for a substantial period of time, it's hard to see a game out.
"We lost our way a bit in the later stages and Derry punished us. That's what good team do."
