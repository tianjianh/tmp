But what happened after the Denver Broncos beat the Carolina Panthers to the title on Sunday?
You've just won the biggest prize in the NFL. What do you do to celebrate?
First of all, you get a selfie with the trophy, like Broncos' Tyler Polumbus...
Then you have a roll around in the tons of gold confetti that was sprayed on the pitch at full-time - and maybe even take some home as memorabilia.
If you're Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, you make sure you thank all your corporate sponsors immediately, and share a kiss with pizza mogul Papa John.
Then the off-field parties begin. Players and celebrities flocked to lavish after-shows in San Francisco - hosted by Rolling Stone, ESPN and Playboy, among others. Some punters even paid $20,000 to attend a party with four-time Grammy winner Lil Wayne.
That, though, may be less than the hefty price rapper Jay-Z paid for 10,000 red roses, which he sent to his wife Beyonce in celebration of her half-time performance alongside Coldplay and Bruno Mars.

No-one likes a sore loser, Cam Newton.
The usually upbeat Carolina Panthers quarterback was not in the mood for post-match chats after his side were swept aside 24-10.
After being harassed by the Panthers' defence, the recently crowned 2015 Most Valued Player gave short, sharp answers to questions from journalists before walking out of his news conference.
While Newton endured the emotional wounds of defeat, his team-mate Thomas Davis' were physical.
The linebacker broke his arm two weeks ago but was stitched back up and sent out to play in a cast for the final, during which he made seven tackles for the Panthers. Now his battered arm looks a little like a deflated ball....
Meanwhile, not everyone in the Broncos camp appeared overjoyed to see Manning lift his second Super Bowl trophy. His brother Eli, also a two-time champion quarterback, was caught on camera looking far from excited about his older brother's achievements.
The party's over, you've celebrated/commiserated, it's home time.
Needless to say, the rich and famous travelled in style. More than 450 private jets flew into San Francisco International airport during Super Bowl weekend.
But the general public had a more arduous trip home.
With 75,000 fans exiting the arena at the same time, the roads in San Francisco were blocked for miles, while some people had to wait on crowded platforms for trains for more than an hour.
Monday mornings are bad enough without a Super Bowl-sized hangover to match.
If you're one of the Americans who contributed to the 325 million gallons of beer consumed on game day, you may be one of the estimated 16.5 million US citizens who phoned in sick on Monday - or perhaps you just turned up late for work, like 7.5 million others.
UK fans may be feeling the effects of fatigue after staying up until the small hours to watch it live, and according to figures from the Social Issues Research Centre, 7% of people aged between 18 and 29 would call in sick to watch a major sporting event.
Speculation was rife in the build-up to the final as to whether it would be a swansong for Broncos veteran Manning.
The 39-year-old became the first starting quarterback to win the title with two different teams, although the five-time MVP was not in his best form on Sunday.
Manning threw for a mere 141 yards as Denver complied only 194 offensive yards - the fewest by a winning team in Super Bowl history.
Is it time to bow out with trophy in hand?
"I'll take some time to reflect," said Manning. "It's been an emotional week, emotional night. I think I'll make a good decision and I think I'll be at peace with it whichever way it goes."
But it looks like Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch may have beaten him to the punch.
The 29-year-old, a losing finalist in last year's Super Bowl, tweeted a picture during Sunday's showpiece of a pair of boots hanging up.
