Luke Varney: Ipswich Town forward joins Burton Albion after contract cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion have signed forward Luke Varney from Championship rivals Ipswich Town on an 18-month deal, after Mick McCarthy's side agreed to cancel the remainder of his contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Varney signed for the Tractor Boys on a short-term contract in August, with his deal due to expire on 12 January.
The 34-year-old could play in Burton's FA Cup tie at Watford on Saturday.
"He's a good, experienced Championship player," Brewers boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby.
"He's had a couple of knocks and injuries and things, but I don't think he's got anything to prove in the Championship."
Burton are 21st in the Championship table, one point above the relegation zone.
