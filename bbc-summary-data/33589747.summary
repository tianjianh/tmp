Ashes 2015: England backsides smacked by Australia - Bayliss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coach Trevor Bayliss said his England team had their "backsides smacked" as Australia levelled the Ashes with a crushing 405-run win at Lord's.

After winning the first Test by 169 runs, England were bowled out for 103 on Sunday to lose within four days.
"It was pants down and backsides smacked," Australian Bayliss said. "We were outplayed in this game.
"It's never a great start when they're 300-1 and we were always chasing the game from there."
England lost a critical toss at Lord's on Thursday morning and Australia amassed 566-8 declared in their first innings before dismissing England for 312.
On day four the tourists extended their second innings to 254-2 before declaring again to set England 509, and then routed the home side in just 37 overs as fast bowler Mitchell Johnson returned to form with 3-27.
"I think results around the world, not just in England and Australia Test matches, there aren't too many close ones any more - one team wins pretty well," said Bayliss, who replaced the sacked Peter Moores in May to become England's first Australian coach.
"I was very happy in our first batting innings - 4-30 is not a great start, but I thought we played well to finish up with over 300. I don't think we used the new ball terribly well on the first morning and we just let them get away.
"We knew the Australians would come back hard in this match, and they will be full of confidence now they've got their A-game back. What we've got to do is go into the third game and worry about what we're doing, not what they're doing.
"If you look at the two matches, our bowling down in Cardiff was very consistent. I don't think in this game we were quite as consistent with our lines and lengths, and that just allowed the Australian batters to get on top."
The next Test in the five-match series starts at Edgbaston on 29 July and Bayliss would not be drawn on possible changes, despite his number three and four batsmen - Gary Ballance and Ian Bell - averaging 16 and 14 respectively in Tests this summer.
"We've got a meeting on Tuesday, and I'm sure there's some things to be spoken about. I'm not going to say anything just yet. I'll wait until I get together with the other selectors on Tuesday to discuss that."
Bayliss defended all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was run out by a direct hit in farcical fashion when evading a throw from the outfield and failing to ground any part of his equipment.
"Ben Stokes is a good player now, and as time goes by I think he's going to have a great career for England. He's a guy that's got plenty of energy and he brings a lot to this team, not just with bat and ball but in the field as well."
