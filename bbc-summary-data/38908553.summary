Bruce Cordwell, then 19, contacted the Leicestershire 15-year-old through Facebook and WhatsApp in November 2015.
The messages were discovered by police investigating Kayleigh's murder by Stephen Beadman later that month.
Cordwell, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence.
Sentencing Cordwell, now 20, to three years and seven months, Judge Robert Brown said: "You groomed her.
"Your intention was that you would meet her and your intention thereafter was that you would have sexual intercourse with her.
"You never actually met her and you had not agreed or even proposed a date, time or place of rendezvous, but this type of offence is child abuse and it calls for a custodial sentence."

Leicester Crown Court heard Kayleigh, from Measham, Leicestershire, chatted online with Cordwell between 9 and 13 November.
At the same time she was chatting to another man, Luke Harlow, and went to his flat in Ibstock on 13 November.
Beadman, a neighbour of Harlow, raped and murdered Kayleigh in the early hours of Sunday, 15 November.
Cordwell sent Kayleigh a message on 16 November when he heard she had gone missing, saying: "You need to get home now, your parents are worried sick about you. You are only 15."
It was among other explicit messages discovered by police.
In July, Beadman was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 35 years, while Harlow was jailed for 12 years.
