Richard Barklie, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, and Joshua Parsons and William Simpson, both from Surrey, were banned for five years at Stratford Magistrates' Court.
Jordan Munday from Sidcup in Kent was banned for three years.
They were told they could not attend games at home or abroad.
District Judge Gareth Branston said: "Racist hatred was displayed by Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro that evening."
He told the court the incident had "tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe".
Violence flared when Chelsea fans were in the French capital to watch the west London club's Champions League match against Paris St Germain on 17 February.
Afterwards video surfaced showing Frenchman Souleymane Sylla pushed off the train amid chants of "we're racist and that's the way we like it".
The French commuter previously said the whole episode was "humiliating".
Barklie, 50, of Victoria Street in Carrickfergus, a director with the World Human Rights Forum, had admitted twice pushing Mr Sylla, but blamed the Parisian for using "aggression" and shouting.
The judge, however, said Barklie, a former policeman, "proved to be a menace" and had "demonstrated aggressive, disorderly conduct".
He said Parsons played a leading role too and displayed "aggressive and disorderly conduct as part of a pack of Chelsea fans".
It was heard Parsons later lost his job at a Mayfair financial company as a result of his involvement.
Another Chelsea supporter, Dean Callis, 32, of Liverpool Road, Islington, received a five-year banning order ahead of the court hearing for a number of incidents, including the one in Paris, Scotland Yard confirmed.
