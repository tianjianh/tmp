[SN]TITLE[SN]
Joseph Kony campaign under fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is always hard to criticise good intentions. And yet...

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The extraordinarily sudden success, if that is the right word, of the social media campaign by three American advocacy groups aimed at shining a big spotlight on the notorious Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony has prompted some scathing reactions from plenty of well-informed quarters.
I will link to some of them below, but here is an outline, each introduced with a relevant tweet, of what strike me as the main arguments being made against the film and the campaign.
There are plenty of forthright arguments against all these points - and the relative success of a social-media driven campaign like Stop Malaria shows that the established aid industry can often benefit from a good shake-up.
The organisation leading the StopKony campaign issued a response on its website to these points, and it must be stressed that the group has been pushing the White House on this issue for some time.
There are many blogs that elaborate on the wider issues at play, like Michael Deibert's on the Huffington Post that tackles the Ugandan government's errors, and the Unmuted blog that focuses on the disempowerment of Ugandans.
And there are other critiques of Invisible Children itself, like Michael Wilkerson's piece on the Foreign Policy website.
And a UN forum has even chipped in with an opinion piece.
As for my own view, let me not dwell on the merits of the film itself.
It's slickly made and has clearly struck a chord with its intended audience - people who knew nothing about the LRA or, consequently, Uganda.
The more immediate question is: will all the fuss it has generated make a positive difference? The campaigners behind it have written a detailed and well-reasoned letter to President Obama outlining various demands.
If, as a result of the campaign, the US takes further steps to ensure Joseph Kony is brought to justice, then I would consider it a success.
At the same time, there are broader issues at stake here, and I do share the concerns articulated in some of the blogs and tweets above, particularly when it comes to the importance of African governments, leaders, institutions and individuals taking control and responsibility.
The outside world has a role to play, but it is patronising and above all cripplingly counter-productive to believe we have all the answers.
