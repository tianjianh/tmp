The picture, titled Misty Minster, beat more than 250 other entries to the international contest.
The competition for photographers with Down's syndrome was launched in partnership with the Shifting Perspectives project led by photographer Richard Bailey, one of this year's judges.
Alongside him were actress and writer Sally Phillips and GlaxoSmithKline's director of UK corporate contributions, Katie Pinnock.
When asked about his winning photo, Kenward said, "This is York Minster taken on a foggy, snowy morning.  It is a mysterious, moody picture."
Joint second place was awarded to Emily Buck, with her photo The Old Tree, and Edward Phippen, with Sunrise, Gorges du Verdon.
Emily Buck said: "Me and my dad went walking one day and thought it would make a good picture with the blue sky in the background."
The winner took home a Canon EOS1200D and a canvas print of his winning image.
Here are some other entries that made the shortlist.
