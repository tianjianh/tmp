The pair were found on a small island between Ashaig and Broadford on Saturday after the alarm was raised at about 18:25.
A Kyle of Lochalsh RNLI spokesman said they were said to be cold but uninjured when they were picked up.
The Kyle team, which is made up of volunteers, has rescued 13 people in the area over the past six days.
Speaking about the latest incident, a Kyle RNLI spokesman said: "They were very happy to see us as they were both beginning to get very cold.
"They had been walking along the coast and were caught by the speed of the incoming tide which is very quick in that area."
The spokesman added: "This has been a remarkable week with an unprecedented six shouts in the past six days. Happily, all of them had a successful outcome and we have rescued 13 people and one dog.
"We are all volunteers and have full-time jobs, however, thanks to some understanding bosses we are able to drop everything and respond when the pager goes off."
