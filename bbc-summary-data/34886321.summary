Jeremy Corbyn warning over terror response after Paris attacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People "must not keep making the same mistakes" when responding to acts of terror, Jeremy Corbyn has warned.

In a speech made after a UN resolution calling for action against so-called Islamic State was approved, he said Labour would support "every necessary measure" to protect people in the UK.
But it was "vital" in a time of tragedy "not to be drawn into responses that feed a cycle of violence", he said.
Meanwhile, David Cameron wants to build support for air strikes on IS in Syria.
The militant group - also referred to as Isil and Isis - has said it carried out the attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead.
There is no timetable for a Parliamentary vote on UK military action in Syria, although the UK does carry out air strikes against IS in Iraq.

"The dreadful Paris attacks make the case for a far more urgent effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the civil war in Syria and the end to the threat from Isis," Mr Corbyn said.
"It is the conflict in Syria and the consequences of the Iraq war which have created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule.
"Everyone, including Muslims in Britain, wants to see the defeat of the murderous and reactionary cult of Isil."
Mr Corbyn opposes UK forces joining allied air strikes against IS strongholds in Syria, but is under pressure to allow his MPs a free vote on the issue.
He said action against IS "that sticks on the ground, destroys the virus and reclaims the hearts and minds" will have to come from the "Arab and Muslim world" and could not be seen to be an external intervention.
Mr Corbyn said: "That is why we should use the UN Security Council resolution passed last night to accelerate moves towards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict."
The UN resolution, co-sponsored by the UK, calls on nations to "redouble and co-ordinate their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks" using all necessary measures. It received universal approval on Friday night.
The prime minister said the vote "shows beyond doubt the breadth of international support" to "eradicate" IS.
Mr Corbyn told the BBC the UN had backed "general action" against IS, including political and diplomatic responses, which he welcomed.
It does not specifically say military action, he said.
But he said: "Labour will always stand up to any threat to this country and the people of this country.
"We're not going to leave British people or this country unprotected, but we do need a different approach to foreign policy."
This new approach was one of Mr Corbyn's "three pillars" that he set out in his wide-ranging speech.
He also said he wanted a new form of politics that gave people a say in decision-making and he said he wanted Labour to be an anti-austerity party that provided prosperity for all.
He went on to warn that ministers would be "gambling with the safety of the British people" if they made cuts to police budgets.
The Spending Review could include a police budget cut of more than 20%.
Chancellor George Osborne is set to announce the government's spending plans in Parliament on Wednesday.
