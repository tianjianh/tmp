The 25-year-old Netherlands international helped the Black Cats avoid relegation last season.
"Patrick was an outstanding performer last season, contributing not only solid defensive performances, but also assists and vital goals," said Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce.
The left-back arrived at the Stadium of Light from Chelsea in 2014.
He has scored five goals in 69 appearances, including four in the Premier League last season.
"It is fantastic to be able to secure the long-term services of such a talented footballer and athlete, who will hopefully continue to improve here for many years to come," added Allardyce.
