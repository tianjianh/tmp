The crash happened on Friday when her silver VW Polo hit the lorry on the B2146 between Funtington and Ashling Park.
Her 20-year-old brother, who was also in the car, suffered serious back injuries and another passenger, a 24-year-old man, was treated for cuts.
Ms Mannings was pronounced dead at the scene.
Her parents, Richard and Caroline, said: "We are devastated with the loss of our beautiful daughter, Georgie.
"Our son, who has suffered life-changing injuries, remains seriously unwell and faces a long and difficult journey ahead.
"We have been humbled with the overwhelming amount of love, support and prayers, which continue to provide us with great comfort."
