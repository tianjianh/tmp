The 27-year-old, who has played at Real Madrid, Celta Vigo and Hoffenheim, joined Stoke for £5.75m from German side Hannover 96 in June 2015.
Spaniard Joselu spent last season on loan at Deportivo La Coruna, scoring six goals in 24 games.
This is Magpies boss Rafael Benitez's sixth summer signing since the club were promoted to the Premier League.
"I feel very happy, because I have signed for a very big club," said Joselu.
Newcastle, who lost 2-0 to Tottenham on Sunday in their opening game of the season, have also signed defenders Florian Lejeune and Javier Manquillo and midfielders Mikel Merino, Christian Atsu and Jacob Murphy.
Former Spain Under-21 player Joselu, who made two appearances for Real Madrid, scored four goals in 27 appearances in his only season in the Premier League for Stoke.
Benitez added: "Obviously he has experience of English football and the Premier League. We think if we can exploit his full potential he will be a good signing for us.
"He knows and accepts the challenge we've given him at Newcastle and he's keen to come and fight for a position in the team."
