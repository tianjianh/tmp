[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of four members of a Bradford family found dead in their home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jitendra Lad, 49, his wife Daksha, 44, and daughters Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, were found at a house on Blackberry Way, Clayton, on 27 October.
A post-mortem examination revealed the women were stabbed while Mr Lad died from compression of the neck caused by hanging.
Their funeral was held at Scholemoor Crematorium, Necropolis Road, earlier.
Two horse-drawn hearses carried the coffins to the crematorium, where about 300 mourners were estimated to have attended the private Hindu ceremony.
The bodies of the Lad family were found by a neighbour on the evening of 27 October.
The neighbour, who had accompanied a concerned relative into the house, saw Jitendra Lad's body before rushing to call the police.
Officers said Mrs Lad and her daughters were stabbed in their beds at "an earlier point during the weekend", while Mr Lad died on the Monday.
Both the husband and wife worked for Bradford Council.
Trisha Lad was in the second year of a biochemistry degree course at the University of Leeds, while her sister Nisha was a pupil at Thornton Grammar School.
