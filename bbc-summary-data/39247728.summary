[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic 1-1 Rangers - Pat Bonner and Derek Ferguson rate the players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers ended a run of three successive defeats against Celtic this season as Clint Hill's late equaliser earned them a Premiership point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong had given the home side a first-half lead with a blistering left-foot drive, but the visitors showed up far better than they have done against their rivals all season as they battled to a 1-1 draw.
Here, former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner gives his marks out of 10 for Brendan Rodgers' league leaders while former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson does the same for the Ibrox men.
He made two fantastic saves from Martyn Waghorn and was unlucky with the goal. One of Celtic's top performers on the day.
Seemed to be caught out of position a couple of times but the Swede didn't do much wrong.
I felt he was the better of the two centre-backs, although his poor clearance did create a chance for Waghorn.
He got caught out a couple of times and could have done better trying to marshal the back line.
He had a few good moments going forward in the first half but this was not his most influential game.
He was quieter than usual and that was in part down to the job Kenny Miller did for Rangers as he dropped into midfield.
Another fine display as he drove his side forward throughout. He was more effective than Bitton and was up with Gordon as Celtic's top performer.
Very good showing and scored a really excellent goal. When he came off it seemed to change the game.
He found it difficult coming back from injury and didn't do enough to hurt Rangers.
A tough day for the winger as he was closed down very well by the Rangers defence. Not up to his usual standards.
He will be disappointed with his touch and control. It just wasn't his day and we haven't said that too often.
Had a positive impact and was probably the best of the Celtic substitutes.
Failed to make any impact on the match.
The striker got himself into a great position late on and could have earned a penalty or even scored what would have been the winner.
Pulled off a couple of excellent saves and didn't have much chance with Armstrong's strike for the Celtic goal.
Came in at right-back and despite the intensity and pressure of the match, he played well and made some good decisions.
For a guy approaching 39 he did so well against the quality of Dembele. Maybe got away with a couple of challenges but led by example and scored crucial equaliser.
He's not the quickest but his reading of the game was good and he linked well with Hill.
We're used to seeing more of him as an attacking threat but he was more conservative and kept things solid.
He was moved forward into midfield and put in a good shift, but his set-pieces were poor throughout.
Took a bad touch that led to Celtic's goal but worked very hard against quality players in the Celtic midfield.
Playing in an area where he had to roll his sleeves up and work hard. Did that side of the game very well and also had the shot that led to the equaliser.
He missed two big chances and there's no excuse for the first. In his position you're judged on goals and he should be taking those chances.
He was excellent, driving and motivating the rest of the team. The fact Scott Brown was asked to cover him after the break showed just how effective he was.
A disappointing day for the winger. Rangers got the ball to him in the first half but he didn't do anything with it. We expect more from him but he'll come again.
Didn't have much of an impact but it's so difficult to get up to speed in these game coming on from the bench.
Rangers were starting to come into the game when he was brought on but he didn't have much of an impact.
Ran the channels well without causing Celtic any problems.
