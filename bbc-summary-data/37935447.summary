Spain student bus crash: Italian anger as case dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of Italian students killed in a March bus crash in Spain have expressed anger after the criminal investigation into the driver was dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spanish magistrate ruled that there was not enough evidence to prosecute the 62-year-old man for homicide through negligence.
Of the 13 people killed in the crash in Catalonia, seven were Italian.
One of the victims' parents, Alessandro Saracino, said he was "in shock again".
Speaking to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Mr Saracino said the families may launch an appeal.
Catalan police had previously said a black box on board indicated several changes of speed before the crash.
But the court, in the southern city of Amposta, ruled that there was no proof of speeding and there was no mechanical fault. It also said the driver was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The accident happened on 20 March, near Freginals, 150km (93 miles) south of Barcelona.
Most of the passengers were exchange students, returning to Barcelona from a fireworks festival in Valencia.
All of the victims were aged between 19 and 25 - seven were from Italy, two from Germany, and one each from Romania, Austria, France and Uzbekistan.
The court decision can be appealed.
