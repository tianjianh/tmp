A chain of hotels run by businesswoman Stephanie Booth has gone into administration.

The development with Llangollen Hotels has led to the immediate closure of the Wynnstay Arms in Wrexham and the Fantastic Fun Houses in Mold and Wrexham.
Staff at the hotel and children's play centres were sent home on Thursday.
Ms Booth's other hotels and the Mclaren's Leisure Complex in Oswestry will continue trading as normal.
A spokesman for Ms Booth said she is using her own money to ensure all staff have been paid.
"Following a winding-up petition issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Llangollen Hotels expects to be placed in administration later today or tomorrow," said the spokesman.
"This has necessitated the immediate closure of leased premises as a default on rent is unavoidable."
He added that all deposits and bookings were safeguarded whilst the company works with auditors KPMG to find a long-term solution.
In 2009, Ms Booth appeared in BBC Wales fly-on-the-wall documentary series Hotel Stephanie showing her cope with the day-to-day problems of managing six hotels in north east Wales during the recession.
In recent months she has been linked with a takeover of Wrexham football club, before withdrawing from the process in May.
She took over the Wynnstay Arms, which is a well-known Wrexham landmark, in April 2010. The new proprietor "guaranteed" the workforce their jobs would be safe.
Promising to spend at least Â£1m in the first year, Ms Booth said she wanted to restore the historic Grade II listed hotel to its "past glories".
The Georgian building, formerly known as the Eagles Inn, was where the Jacobite society, the Circle of the White Rose met in the 18th Century, including members of the prominent Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay.
The Football Association of Wales was founded at a meeting at the hotel in 1876, and there is a plaque to mark the occasion.
The facade of the hotel is protected, after a campaign to save it from demolition in the 1960s.
