The child was attacked as she walked through Teddington Cemetery in south-west London at about 15:30 BST on 20 October.
The boys ended the assault and walked off after a man on a bicycle shouted at them to stop.
Detectives said the boys were at a funeral attended by the travelling community.
The victim was walking through the cemetery with a friend when they were approached by the boys. Afterwards they made their way home and told their parents what had happened.
PC Jamie Oprey said: "The victim has been left extremely distressed by this attack which took place in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon.
"I am keen to speak to anyone who was in the cemetery at the time of the incident and could help us identify the boys responsible.
"I am also keen to speak to the man on the bicycle who intervened and stopped the attack - his information could prove invaluable in helping to find these boys."
