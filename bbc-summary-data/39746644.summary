Robinson, 42, will start in June after holding a similar post with Australia.
He succeeds Stephen Park, now performance director with British Cycling and will lead the bid for medals at the 2020 Tokyo Games.
"I feel immensely privileged to be given the opportunity to lead such a successful team into Tokyo 2020 and beyond," Robinson said.
Robinson, who has more than 30 years experience in the sport as a competitor and coach, led Australia's Paralympic sailors to the top of the medal table at Rio 2016.
He will work alongside recently-appointed director of racing Ian Walker.
