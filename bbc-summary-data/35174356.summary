Thousands support 'revenge porn' victim anonymity call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A petition calling for revenge porn victims to be given the same anonymity as other victims of sexual offences has gained more than 5,500 supporters.

Sharing revenge-porn images and videos became a crime in England and Wales in February, but the law currently gives victims no right to hide identities.
The move was jointly started by Keeley Richards-Shaw, whose ex-boyfriend was the first sentenced under the new law.
The Ministry of Justice said judges had discretionary powers to withhold names.
Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme earlier in December, Ms Richards-Shaw said media coverage had increased her distress and a change in the law was crucial to help victims "keep their personal life personal".
North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Julia Mulligan, who is also behind the petition, has written to the government with Ms Richards-Shaw about the issue.
A loophole existed, the PCC said, because revenge porn was classed as a domestic abuse offence rather than a sexual offence.
She said: "It's wrong that victims of this very personal and distressing crime are being violated all over again by their stories being played out online and in the media.
"Any victim of revenge porn should have full confidence that their identity will be protected by law and this matter deserves to be far higher up the political agenda."
