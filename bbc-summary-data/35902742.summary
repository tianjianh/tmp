Ben Tomlinson almost sparked the game into life for the visitors with a 12-yard drive against Phil Smith's post.
But the Cumbrian side went ahead Andy Cook headed in a pinpoint Andy Haworth cross soon after the hour.
It proved the only shot on target in a low-key affair that emphasised Barrow's new-found defensive resilience and took their unbeaten run to seven games.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"We dropped below the standards that we set over the Easter weekend with the two good performances, and the players have to question themselves why they can perform the way they did against Forest Green and Braintree and then fall to the standards that we got today.
"We knew how they would set up and we knew how they would play and the disappointing thing it was a sore goal to lose because we had chances to clear it and again we don't clear our box.
"It's frustrating because we've had good runs previously but then we drop our standards - but we do know what the boys are capable and if they want to push on as a group or individually, they have to show more consistency."
