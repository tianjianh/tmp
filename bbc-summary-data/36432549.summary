Eddie Jones: England should expect difficult time in Australia

England's Australian head coach Eddie Jones expects life to be made as difficult as possible during their three-Test tour of Australia.

Jones said he was "shunted" into the baggage check area by customs officials on arrival in Brisbane on Thursday.
Bag checks are common in Australia, but Jones is well known in his home nation.
"Everything that's done around the game is going to be co-ordinated, all co-ordinated to help Australia win," said the 56-year-old.
"I just went through immigration and I got shunted through the area where everything got checked. That's what I'm expecting.
"We've got to be good enough to control what we can control."
England won one Test in Sydney during the last tour in 2010, one of only three wins they have ever managed against the hosts in Australia.
Jones, who coached Australia to the 2003 World Cup final where they lost to England, faces a Wallabies side that has former Randwick team-mate Michael Cheika at the helm.
"Australia are ranked second in the world, they've got the best coach in the world and they're playing in their own backyard so they are going to be strong," said the Australian.
"In Australia, we've won three Tests since Captain Cook arrived, so it's not a great record is it?"
Jones added: "He's been very quiet, it's a new Cheika we're facing at the moment but I'm sure the old one will come out."
