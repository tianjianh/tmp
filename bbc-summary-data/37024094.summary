He tweeted he was "so excited" after the news was revealed on the Strictly Twitter account.
"As a fan of Strictly for years, I have always imagined myself on the show, but the timing has not been right... until now!" he said in a statement.
Yesterday former shadow chancellor Ed Balls was the first contestant confirmed for the next series.
Young performed on last year's series of Strictly - performing his track Joy.
The Brit-award-winning singer has released six albums and has an EP coming out this autumn.
The singer won the first series of Pop Idol in 2002 and his debut single Anything is Possible/Evergreen is still one of the 20 biggest selling singles of all time in the UK.
He appeared in the film Mrs Henderson presents alongside Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins in 2005.
He has taken ballet lessons in the past and was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award in 2013 for best actor for his role in Cabaret the musical.
Earlier this year he appeared in the Great Sport Relief Bake Off.
Young had put out a series of cryptic tweets on Tuesday teasing the announcement.
Six hours before the announcement he tweeted: "Today is going to be exciting..." and then three hours later he  tweeted: "Big news coming at 3pm - Can you guess?!" Fans were soon quick to guess his news and welcomed it on Twitter.
Strictly hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman recently revealed that they already know who all the contestants are for the new series.
Winkleman said: "There's something for everyone... there's young, there's old, there's small, there's tall, there's cuddly, there's abrasive.
"Actually there's no abrasive ones, I miss the abrasive ones."
Ed Balls told Chris Evans on the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show that it was a "dream come true" to take part in the show but he was "scared to death".
