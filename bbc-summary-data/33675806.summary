[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Marsh, 55, of St Michael and All Angels Church of England church in Bramhall, Stockport, was the subject of an investigation lasting 15 months.
Allegations were made between 2011 to 2013 when the woman was aged 16 to 19.
Mr Marsh had been on bail and was suspended from his parish duties while the investigation took place.
A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: "Following receipt of a file from Greater Manchester Police, the CPS have conducted a thorough review of the evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
"We have reached a decision that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore consider that no further action should be taken in this case."
A spokesman for the Church of England Diocese of Chester said: "The Revd Simon Marsh has agreed not to conduct services or be actively engaged in parish ministry in Bramhall for the time being.
"Now that we've been informed that the criminal investigation has finished, with no charges being brought, an internal investigation by the Diocese of Chester is under way.
"In the meantime, alternative pastoral care will continue to be provided for the people of Bramhall."
