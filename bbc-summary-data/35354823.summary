[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Born Norma Jeane Mortenson in Los Angeles on 1 June 1926, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox in 1946 and changed her name to Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe died in 1962, but her image continues to captivate the public imagination.
One of her last photo shoots, naked under a silk sheet, was with Kirkland.
The 1961 series, An Evening with Marilyn Monroe, consists of photographs of her posing sensually in bed. Kirkland says it was as though he and Monroe "were in a beautiful dance".
Milton H Greene died in 1985 after a career working for magazines such as Vogue, Harpers Bazaar and Life.
He photographed many of the world's biggest stars, including Audrey Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich and Cary Grant.
Monroe and Greene first met in 1953 on assignment for Look Magazine.
In 1956, they formed Marilyn Monroe Productions, which produced the films Bus Stop and The Prince and the Showgirl.
By the end of their four-year relationship, Greene had photographed Monroe in 52 different sittings, producing more than 5,000 images.
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes starring Marilyn Monroe by Milton H Greene and Douglas Kirkland is at The Little Black Gallery, London, until 27 February.
