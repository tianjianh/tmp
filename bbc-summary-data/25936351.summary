Derby parents want special transport for disabled twins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of twins who have spinal problems say it is "disgraceful" that Derby City Council has not agreed to provide special transport.

The two 10-year-olds, Zara and Haajra Hamaeoun, suffer from congenital deformities and use wheelchairs.
Their father Mohammed Hamaeoun said the family moved to the city six months ago but had not been given enough support.
The council said the family had been "encouraged to apply for help with transport".
A Derby City Council statement said that "a good schoolâ€¦ with good provision for the girls' needs" had been found.
The council added: "Transport options initially begin with fuel or bus fare reimbursement."
But Mr Hamaeoun said the school was located about one mile from their home and the children's wheelchairs would not fit into a car.
He said the twins would not be able to start school until April and the council had not agreed to provide transport to get them there.
He said the girls were "prone to infection" and he was concerned about getting them to school in wheelchairs in "the cold and rain and the wet".
The twins' mother  Nosheen Hamaeon said: "I am really worried in terms of safety for my daughters - and I am really frustrated as to why they have been out of school for so long."
The family moved from Birmingham, where the twins attended a special needs school, to Derby last June.
Mr Hamaeon said: "They are highly dependent and we have been struggling... to get any schooling or any home education - it's just been uphill."
Council spokesman Lynda Poole said: "As with all cases and any other children we put the needs of children first to ensure they receive schooling with an appropriate provision for their needs."
She said transport to school for the girls would be "looked at on its individual circumstances and requirements".
