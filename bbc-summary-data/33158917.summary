Dobson & Crowther in Llangollen goes into administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A printing firm in Denbighshire has gone into administration, putting 79 jobs at risk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dobson & Crowther Limited in Llangollen, a manufacturer of bespoke envelopes, had to restructure in 2014 after the loss of its biggest customer.
Christopher Ratten of Baker Tilly, a joint administrator, said it had "experienced a challenging 18 months".
Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru AM for North Wales, said: "This is terrible news for the 79 workers."
Administrators are now considering the possibility of continuing the business for a short period in order to fulfil outstanding orders.
