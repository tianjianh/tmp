Julien Faubert wants to help Kilmarnock secure their Premiership status for next season because he knows the hardship that comes with relegation.

The former France player was relegated with West Ham United does not want to repeat the experience at Rugby Park.
"I know this situation," said 32-year-old midfielder Faubert.
"It's tough but it's good for the experience if you stay up and you need to have a strong team all together and fight for the club."
Killie currently occupy the relegation play-off place in the Scottish Premiership and are eight points above bottom side Dundee United, who have a game in hand. Hamilton are two points in front of Kilmarnock.
"I've twice battled relegation," explained the Frenchman.
"One was with Bordeaux when I was in France and one was with West Ham when we went down to the Championship.
"I realise it's not only about football or your future, it's about the future of many normal people at the club, because if you go down they may not have a job.
"Even if you don't give everything for yourself you have to give everything for people who work at the club because if you go down it's a big decision.
"I saw that with West Ham, so if you have heart you need to work and fight to stay up."
Faubert has already made many friends at Killie and feels he has seen enough from the players to suggest there will be a positive end to the season for the club.
"I believe we are going to stay up if everybody realises the importance of the situation," he said.
"After the last game [the 2-0 loss to Ross County] I didn't sleep because I feel I hate losing and always when I lose some games I think of what could I do better.
"That's why young players have to realise it's not like we play, we lose and that is it.
"You have to be hungry to do well for yourself and your team-mates."
Killie's next two matches are against the top two in the Premiership, away to Aberdeen on Saturday followed by a home fixture with reigning champions Celtic.
"They are tough games but it's good because the young players don't need any motivation," added Faubert.
"These are big games and it's a good opportunity to show what we can do as a team like fighting because it's going to be hard against Aberdeen and against Celtic.
"But if we show our commitment and how much we want to stay up and fight for our lives, it will be good."
