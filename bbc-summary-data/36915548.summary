The 32-year-old New Zealander recently left Connacht, having made 102 appearances and scored nine tries over two spells with the Irish club.
Quins boss John Kingston said: "He has the ability to break the first tackle and is an excellent offloader and will provide further power to our pack.
"I have already been impressed by the hunger he has shown to make a big impact for Harlequins."
Naoupu played for Canterbury, Tasman Makos and Hawkes Bay in New Zealand before moving to Ireland in 2009.
He left at the end of his first season at Connacht to play for Japanese side Kobelco Steelers.
He returned the following year and Naoupu made his European debut against Harlequins at The Stoop in November 2011.
Naoupu said: "I am very excited to be joining Harlequins in its 150th anniversary year.
"It is a club I know well having played against them in Europe a number of times and I like the fact that they play a really attractive style of rugby."
