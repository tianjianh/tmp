Women's Super League One: Liverpool Ladies 1-0 Doncaster Rovers Belles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool Ladies extended their unbeaten league run to seven matches as they beat a Doncaster side who are yet to claim a point this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natasha Harding scored the only goal of the game when she struck from 25 yards just after the break.
Belles keeper Nicola Hobbs denied Shanice van de Sanden and Reds captain Gemma Bonner in the first half.
Katrin Omarsdottir was denied at the other end by Siobhan Chamberlain's diving save before Harding's winner.
Liverpool striker Natasha Harding:
"We created about six or seven chances but we weren't clinical enough and credit to their defence, they put their bodies on the line.
"We always felt the goal was coming and the goal I scored was just like one I scored in training yesterday so my confidence was high.
"We had to be patient and sometimes teams come here and just block but you have to hit them when you can.
"We dug out the three points and that was the most important thing. We are all confident and proud of our performances."
Doncaster defender Rhiannon Roberts:
"Sometimes it just felt like wave after wave of attacks but I thought we dealt with it well, so in that respect we were pretty pleased to go in at half-time 0-0, and we were still in the game until the end.
"Every game we go into we believe we can get points and we are not bothered about who it is we are playing. We showed today that we can go out and put in a performance.
"We want to compete and stay in this league and I think we are showing week by week that we are getting better. Eventually it will come."
