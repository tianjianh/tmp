[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Cumbria chief constable Stuart Hyde in coma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-chief constable has been put into a medically-induced coma after contracting meningitis while working in Abu Dhabi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Hyde, former head of Cumbria Police, is being treated for the viral infection, according to a colleague.
Mike Pannett, himself a former officer with the London and North Yorkshire forces, is co-director of the 4 Policing consultancy with Mr Hyde.
He said he had received many messages of support.
Mr Hyde retired in 2013 after being suspended twice from the force, investigated and cleared.
He was on secondment as chief constable when he was suspended in September 2012 over complaints about his management style.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission cleared him a month later.
A second investigation by South Wales Police found no evidence of misconduct but made some recommendations regarding use of force credit cards, overseas trips, social media and recording gifts and hospitality.
Mr Hyde was then suspended again from his job by Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Richard Rhodes, who was unhappy with the report's findings.
He returned to work, with the PCC's approval, as deputy chief constable for a few months in 2013 and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal - given to officers for gallant or distinguished service - shortly before his departure in December 2013.
