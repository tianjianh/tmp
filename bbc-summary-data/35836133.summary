Claudio Ranieri has said he wants to retire at Leicester City and would turn down any approach to manage Italy.

The 64-year-old Italian has guided Leicester to the top of the Premier League in his first season in charge.
He has been linked with the Italy job after Antonio Conte announced that he will leave his post after Euro 2016.
"I want to stay here," said Ranieri. "There isn't another team, nothing will change my mind. I am so happy here."
Former Chelsea boss Ranieri joined Leicester in July on a three-year contract.
He added: "I am just starting to build, if the owner is happy with me, I am happy with him."
Leicester are five points clear of second placed Tottenham in the title race, with eight games of the season remaining.
They face Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday.
BBC Radio Leicester: "Have you heard about the 'Ranieri' sausage, Claudio?"
Leicester's Danny Drinkwater has received his first call-up to the England squad for the friendlies against Germany and Holland, while fellow midfielder N'Golo Kante's form has been rewarded with his first call-up for France.
Ranieri thinks Drinkwater, 26, could force his way into Roy Hogson's Euro 2016 squad.
"Roy follows us for so many matches and maybe he wants to feel and to know him better," he said. "Maybe he can bring him for the European Championship.
"He is always available for his team-mates to ask for the ball, to have a personality. There is a very good partnership with Kante, they understand together and it's solid. I like him because when he goes into the tackle, he wins the tackle.
"Drinky is a very solid man, a focused man. He is a fantastic character but you have to know him because he observes and doesn't speak. When he speaks it is in the right way. I love him because he wants the best, when he makes mistakes he is very angry."
