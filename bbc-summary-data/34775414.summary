[SN]TITLE[SN]
Croft house loans to be considered by Scottish government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crofting Minister Aileen McLeod has said the government is willing to look at the potential of reintroducing loans for building croft houses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Crofting Federation (SCF) and NFU Scotland have been calling for increased incentives in a grant scheme available to crofters.
Ms McLeod said the Scottish government was prepared to look at offering loans.
Fiona Mandeville, of SCF, said such assistance could help young crofters to get on to the housing ladder.
She said: "We do see the loan element as key to the success of this scheme.
"This scheme really needs to be aimed at young crofters who maybe find it hard to get a mortgage, or to get a start on the housing ladder.
"I think it is important to look at the croft house grant scheme as another element of social housing."
Ms McLeod said the government would hold further consultation on the Crofter Housing Grant Scheme while on a visit to Inverness.
Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - has welcomed the move.
Donald Crichton, vice chairman of the comhairle's sustainable development committee, said: "Over the last year we have made a strong case to the minister and civil servants for increasing and strengthening the grant as one of the best mechanisms for sustaining our crofting communities.
"This further consultation demonstrates that the minster has been listening and taking on board our views and we are encouraged by the proposals that are emerging."
