JJ McMenamin, 30, had failed to attend court for alleged driving offences.
Officers searched Leyburn, North Yorkshire, for the suspect over the weekend, calling in the force helicopter and sniffer dogs.
Earlier Mr McMenamin filmed himself walking up to Harrogate police station dressed as the character.
Mr McMenamin shared his arrival at the police station on Facebook Live, saying at one stage: "I'm right outside the cop shop now, let's see how it goes."
He had previously taunted police in a series of posts and videos on his Facebook page, including sharing a photo of his head superimposed on an image of children's book character Where's Wally with the caption, "Dude... I'm right here."
In another video, Mr McMenamin sang along to Kenny Rogers' The Gambler on the car stereo and laughed as he played Lionel Richie's Hello, which contains the line "is it me you're looking for?", and the Spencer Davis Group's Keep On Running.
In another Facebook post the 30-year-old, originally from Middlesbrough, shared a picture of Where's Wally in a police mugshot, with the caption "Hide Seek Champion 2016-2017".
A North Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: "A 30-year-old man from Middleham has been arrested after he handed himself in to officers at Harrogate police station.
"The arrest comes after extensive police searches for the man over the weekend."
A warrant was issued for Mr McMenamin's arrest after he failed to appear at Northallerton Magistrates Court on 19 December to face charges of driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.
He was due to attend a hearing at the same court on Monday.
