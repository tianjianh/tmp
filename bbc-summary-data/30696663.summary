A woman who started a petition against convicted rapist Ched Evans's proposed move to Oldham Athletic says the player "doesn't know what rape is".

The blogger, who uses the pseudonym Jean Hatchet, said: "He was convicted of rape and he still doesn't acknowledge it was rape. And that's the incredibly dangerous message."
Her petition to push the club to refuse to sign Evans has gained more than 45,000 supporters since Sunday.
Oldham are still mulling over a deal.
Former Wales international striker Evans, who was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman at a Rhyl, Denbighshire hotel in 2011, was freed from prison in October.
The now 26-year-old served half of his five-year sentence and is currently on licence under the supervision of the probation service.
Speaking to BBC News, the blogger said: "Crucially he hasn't served his time, he's served half of his time, he's still on licence.
"He's also not, as far as I can see, reformed or rehabilitated - he doesn't acknowledge his crime. And that's the key thing here - he doesn't know what rape is."
She added: "It's time that the Football Association [and] the Professional Footballers' Association realised that accepting players back into a high-profile role that have committed such an atrocious crime is wrong. They've got to take a stand on this."
After his release from prison, Jean Hatchet also started a petition - which gained about 169,000 supporters - designed to dissuade Evans's former club Sheffield United from reinstating him.
He was offered the use of their training facilities before the League One side backtracked amid heavy criticism from supporters and club patrons including Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill.
Evans maintains his innocence, and an investigation into his conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission is under way.
