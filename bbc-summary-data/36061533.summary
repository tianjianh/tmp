Eastleigh 0-1 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere kept their National League play-off hopes alive as James Norwood's late winner saw them beat Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eastleigh, unbeaten in 10 league games beforehand, saw Andy Drury and Josh Payne both shoot wide.
Lee Cook tested Rovers goalkeeper Scott Davies with a shot before Eastleigh goalkeeper Ross Flitney saved attempts from Adam Mekki and Norwood.
But Norwood headed in his 21st goal of the season to move Tranmere three points outside the top five.
Eastleigh are also three points adrift of the National League play-off places with one game left.
