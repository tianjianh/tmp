[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray says he wants Tennis Scotland to deliver on plans to build 10 new indoor facilities in the next five years.

The governing body aims to develop a lasting legacy from the success of Andy and brother Jamie.
Chairman Blane Dodds is to submit proposals to funding partners in a bid to realise the project.
"It's important to capitalise on the momentum we have just now in British tennis," Murray told BBC Scotland.
"There's a lot of positive stuff going on.
"We haven't been in this position for a very long time, so it's a good opportunity to try to inspire some kids and get more of them into the sport."
Andy, 29, ranked second in the world, won his third Grand Slam title this year at Wimbledon and made it back-to-back Olympic golds, while Jamie, 30, is fourth in the doubles rankings, also with three majors to his name.
On the plans for more indoor facilities, Murray added: "While we are still playing and still visible, it's probably a good time.
"Me and Jamie won't be playing forever. I've maybe got three or four more years at the top level. Maybe Jamie, at doubles, can go on a bit longer.
"The more facilities the better. The weather in Scotland isn't great and it can be expensive to play indoors. Hopefully, they follow through on that promise."

The Murray brothers led Great Britain to Davis Cup glory in 2015, ending a 79-year wait for a 10th title.
The defence ended with a 3-2 semi-final defeat to Argentina in Glasgow at the weekend, with the siblings continuing their unbeaten record in doubles.
"It's an unbelievably hard competition to win," said Murray, who was troubled by a thigh strain in Sunday's singles win over Guido Pella.
"Argentina, who are in the final now, are trying to win for the first time and they've had great players for a very long time.
"I think it has brought more fans into tennis. When we are playing as a team and playing for your country, the players and fans are passionate.
"The atmosphere at the ties is incredible and people enjoy that. It's something different from week-to-week tour life."

Murray, who played on each day against Argentina, including a marathon singles loss to Juan Martin Del Potro, will go ahead with a charity exhibition match in Glasgow on Wednesday but stressed that he is in need of a break after a punishing schedule.
Prior to his surprise quarter-final defeat against Kei Nishikori at the US Open, he had a run of reaching seven consecutive finals, winning the Rome Masters, Queen's, Wimbledon and the Olympic singles.
Murray is due to play in Beijing, Shanghai and Vienna before ending the season with the Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals in London but may now alter those plans.
