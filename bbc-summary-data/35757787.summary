Scotland's economy: GERS figures shows deficit up as oil revenue falls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's public spending was almost £15bn more than its tax revenue in the last financial year, new figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The amount spent per head was £1,400 per person higher than the UK figure, according to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) bulletin for 2014-15.
The deficit ran to almost 10% of Scotland's output - nearly double the level for the UK as a whole.
Ministers insisted the foundations of the Scottish economy remained strong.
The figures reflect a sharp drop in the calculation of oil and gas tax revenues that might have been credited to Scottish government income.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "Taken in the context of the wider economic environment, which has been impacted by muted global demand, falling oil prices and more difficult conditions for manufacturers, the economy has remained resilient with record levels of employment, positive economic growth and growing exports.
"This shows the foundations of Scotland's economy are strong and that we have a strong base to build our future progress upon."
The Scotland Office Minister Andrew Dunlop said: "These figures show that Scotland is facing challenging economic times, in particular because of the drop in oil price, and demonstrate the value of the broad shoulders of the United Kingdom.
"The UK and Scottish governments both have a responsibility to work hard and support the Scottish economy in difficult global conditions, and that is exactly what we will continue to do."

The annual GERS figures, which are produced by Scottish government economists, independently of ministers, also showed;
The GERS figures are widely used to inform the debate about Scotland's potential for independence or for the full range of tax-raising powers.
They looked much more positive when oil and gas tax revenue was in the billions. But with the fall in the price of oil and gas, as well as high levels of investment, producer profits have plummeted, and taxes with them.
Excluding North Sea revenue, the deficit ran to £16.7bn, or 11.9% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the key measure of total economic output.
Including a geographic share of offshore tax revenue, the 2014-15 deficit was £14.9bn, or 9.7% of GDP.
For the UK, the equivalent measure was a deficit of £89bn. That was 4.9% of GDP.

In actual money spent, Scottish revenue including a share of oil and gas tax was £53.4bn, while expenditure on all aspects of government activity in Scotland, both devolved and reserved, ran to £68.4bn.
The scale of the deficit looks less daunting when capital expenditure is removed. That is sometimes done to measure spending without the investment element that provides longer-term returns.
On that measure, the current spending deficit for 2014-15 was £11.9bn, according to GERS - or 7.8% of GDP, compared with a UK figure of 3.3%.
As a benchmark of a sustainable level of deficit, the rules for eurozone membership require deficits to be no more than 3% of GDP.
On Wednesday afternoon the Scottish government admitted it got a key figure wrong in its GERS report.
It explained that the online document was updated to rectify an overstatement of oil revenues in one calculation which had been designed for international comparison.
This change does not affect the over totals.
