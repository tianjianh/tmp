The Etixx cyclist was fifth going into the race, almost half-a-minute behind the overall leader Rohan Dennis.
However, the Australian BMC rider dropped out of contention following a crash 48km into the stage.
"The plan was to attack to put BMC and Rohan Dennis in difficulty, and it worked perfectly," Terpstra, 32, said.
Boasson Hagen beat Terpstra and Belgium's Oliver Naesen in a sprint finish to win the 197.8km stage between Bornem and Grammont.
Dutch rider Tom Dumoulin was fourth on the day, followed by Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet, of Belgium, and world title holder Peter Sagan, of Slovakia.
