Westley Odger, 27, was attacked in Colchester, Essex, on 12 September 2005, during a row at a cash point.
Brothers Andrew and Mark Fredericks were jailed over the fatal stabbing.
Ann Oakes-Odger, who was made an MBE for knife crime prevention work, said she felt the issue had been permanently put on the map since her son's death.
"When this happened to Westley, I know that there had been problems with people using knives, and violence, and so on, but it had never really had any proper focus.
"So the campaign I started following the trial of the two people responsible was to get it on the map, get it on the agenda, get it to government.
"And we managed to, with the support of [former Colchester MP] Bob Russell, achieve two select committee inquires.
"We've now got on the map education and tougher sentencing for knife murder."
Ms Oakes-Odger, whose son was stabbed after telling a man not to push in the queue at a cash machine, was part of a successful campaign to amend the Criminal Justice Act to create a new starting sentence, normally of 25 years, for courts considering the minimum term for murderers who used a knife.
"I know Westley would be very proud and pleased that in his memory I've tried to do something positive, because he was a very positive person in life and I feel the work I'm doing in his memory is a continuation of his life in spirit," she said.
"For me, he carries on the journey with me and everything I do is in the spirit of his personality."
