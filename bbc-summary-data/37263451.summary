Bradford remain undefeated in League One after taking a share of the points in a spirited draw with 10-man Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Marshall missed an early sight on goal for the Bantams as the game took 10 minutes to come to life.
Rory Donnelly's hold-up play and pass allowed young midfielder Emmanuel Osadebe to roll the ball into Cody McDonald's path, giving the Gills striker room for a powerful finish past Colin Doyle.
After a series of blocked shots, Bradford got a deserved equaliser on the half-hour mark in an increasingly open game as Jordy Hiwula flicked in a header from a corner with no man watching the far post.
A deciding goal never came in the second half despite Bradford midfielder Josh Cullen's fierce drive, and a Max Ehmer effort for the Gills from six yards out that was heroically blocked by the Bantams defence.
A second yellow card for Gills defender Ryan Jackson came too late to affect what was, on balance, a fair result.
