Rolf Harris: The charges against him

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris has been found guilty on 12 counts of indecent assault against four girls and young women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Details of the charges and key points from the trial are listed below.
THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTER
COUNT ONE - VERDICT: GUILTY
One woman said she was aged seven or eight when she queued to get an autograph from Harris at a community centre in Hampshire in 1968 or 1969.
When she reached the front of the queue, Harris had touched her inappropriately with his "big hairy hands", she told the jury.
She said she had initially thought it might have been an accident but then he touched her again.
She said: "It felt very aggressive, and I knew that it wasn't an accident." She went on to describe how "he scared me because he was looking at me all the time".
The disgraced star, however, said he had been filming a TV series in the Australian outback at the time and the court heard that no evidence could be found that Mr Harris had been at the community centre.
When the allegation was put to the star, he told police: "I would simply never touch a child inappropriately."
He also showed his hands to the jury and denied they were hairy.
THE TEENAGE WAITRESS
COUNT TWO - VERDICT: GUILTY
Another woman said she had been working as a waitress, at the age of 13 or 14, at a charity event in Cambridge in 1975 when Harris had put his arm around her shoulder.
"To start, it was a very nervous but a good feeling," she said. "However his hand then moved and his hand went up and down my back and his hand went over my bottom and it was very firm."
She continued: "I was too young to understand, but it was basically like groping. I was completely frozen... I knew it was wrong... I couldn't move... I was extremely embarrassed."
Harris initially denied having visited Cambridge until four years ago, but the court was shown footage of him appearing on an ITV game show in the city in 1978.
The fallen TV personality, musician and artist admitted a "lapse of memory" but denied deliberately lying.
Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said the complainant had got the year of the assault wrong but that the video supported "pretty much everything" else she had said.
THE DAUGHTER'S FRIEND
COUNTS THREE TO NINE - VERDICTS: GUILTY
Seven of the 12 charges related to a childhood friend of Harris's daughter Bindi.
Six charges related to alleged abuse when she was aged between 13 and 15, and the seventh to when she was 19.
The court heard that the abuse began when she had been on holiday with the Harris family at the age of 13.
Later, the woman said Harris had performed a sex act on her at the Harris family home, with Bindi asleep in the same room.
Further assaults took place at the Harris home and in her bedroom at her own home while her parents were downstairs, she said.
The convicted celebrity admitted having a sexual relationship with the woman - but stressed that it had been consensual and had begun after she had turned 18.
However, the relationship had "ended in a very acrimonious way," he said.
The court was shown a letter Harris sent to the woman's father in 1997, after the end of the relationship.
The letter said: "I fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape, no physical forcing, brutality or beating that took place."
Asked about the claim that he had assaulted the girl while his daughter had been asleep in the same room, Harris denied it and told the court: "She's said all sorts of things that if it wasn't so serious would have been laughable."
THE BUDDING ACTRESS
COUNTS 10 TO 12 - VERDICTS: GUILTY
Tonya Lee was a 15-year-old on a theatre trip from Australia to the UK when, she said, the entertainer fondled her.
Ms Lee has waived the right to anonymity granted to alleged victims of sexual offences. The three charges relate to one day in May 1986.
She said he asked her to sit on his lap before moving his hand up her leg and assaulting her.
"He was moving back and forth rubbing against me," she said. "It was very subtle, it wasn't big movements."
The jury heard that Harris had then patted her on the thigh and moved his hand upwards. She said she had "started to panic" and rushed to the toilet.
When she came out, she said, Harris was waiting for her and gave her "a big bear hug" before putting his hand down her top and then down her skirt.
Harris denied ever meeting Ms Lee.
It was also revealed that she had sold her story for Â£33,000 to an Australian TV station and a magazine. She said accepting the money had been a "huge mistake".
