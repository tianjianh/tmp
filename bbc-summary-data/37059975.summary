School with no pupils 'could be mothballed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Perthshire primary school could be mothballed for the new school year after being left with no pupils.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The school roll at Trossachs Primary in Brig o'Turk fell from five to zero at the end of last term.
The future of the Victorian school now lies in the hands of the local authority, Stirling Council.
Its education committee will discuss a proposal to close the school temporarily pending a final decision on its long-term future.
The school, which opened in 1875, has one classroom and shares its headmistress with the 10-classroom primary school in Callander, less than seven miles away.
A Stirling Council spokesman said: "As there are no children enrolled to attend Trossachs Primary School after the summer holidays, and following discussions with local parents, a report will be taken to next week's education committee to propose that it be mothballed for school session 2016/2017."
Last term, the remaining pupils were offered some lessons at Callander.
Local councillor Martin Earl said: "No one wants to see any schools close but when pupil numbers get as low as they have at Trossachs Primary School, the parents must make decisions that are in their children's best interests and if that is addressed by moving to another, larger, school then no other criteria is relevant."
