Doyle, 28, has signed a three-year deal, having scored four goals in 29 games for the Lillywhites in a season-long stint at Deepdale last term.
He joined the Bluebirds from Chesterfield in February 2015 for a fee reported to be around Â£1m, but made only 18 appearances for the Welsh club.
"I'm grateful to be back here," Doyle told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"For it to be done so early so I can get the full pre-season with the lads is a boost.
"Once I knew there was a possibility of returning I just jumped in the car and hotfooted it here to get it over the line.
"It was one of the best changing rooms I've been in, the lads really helped me and I didn't feel like a loan player so it was an easy decision to make.
"It helps massively with team spirit and we've got that in abundance at the moment."
With goalkeeper Chris Maxwell, striker Simon Makienok and defender Tommy Spurr also confirmed, Preston have now made four new additions to the squad for the forthcoming Championship season.
