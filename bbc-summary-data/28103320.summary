David Black: Charges dropped against murder accused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charges have been dropped against a man charged with the murder of County Tyrone prison officer David Black.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Black, 52, a father of two from Cookstown, was shot dead on the M1 motorway as he travelled to work at Maghaberry Prison in November 2012.
Sean McVeigh, of Victoria Street, Lurgan, County Armagh, had been charged with his murder.
That charge and another of possessing an assault rifle with the intent to endanger life were dropped on Tuesday.
A lawyer from the Public Prosecution Service told Craigavon Magistrates' Court: "The charges in this matter are to be withdrawn.
"No prosecution has been directed."
District judge Mervyn Bates told Mr McVeigh that he was free to go.
"As far as this matter is concerned you may be released from custody," he said. "This case is now at an end."
Mr McVeigh is to sue the PPS and Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) for the time he has spent in custody.
When he was first arrested and charged in February, Mr McVeigh's lawyers had requested that the PPS review the case as they said there was no evidence against their client.
Two other people have been charged in connection with the murder of David Black.
