Ryan Winnals, 19, needed surgery after he was repeatedly punched and knocked unconscious by a gang of youths.
Nottinghamshire Police is the 11th police force to treat attacks on members of subcultures as hate crime.
It follows campaigning by the mother of murdered goth Sophie Lancaster.
The force has appealed for information about the attack on Ryan, which happened outside Tesco in Huthwaite at about 16:00 BST on 21 May.
"It all happened so fast. I was just leaning against the wall, sat on my phone, looking at something," said Mr Winnals, from Selston.
"I put my phone away, looked up, the next thing I know is I'm getting hit."

His stepmother, Kelly Wilcockson, said: "In this day and age I think it's disgraceful that you can be discriminated against because of what you wear or what colour your hair is, it's just disgusting.
"These thugs need catching. They can't go around doing that to other people and getting away with it.
"He's a young innocent lad, he's done nothing wrong, all because he was dressed as a gothic person."
