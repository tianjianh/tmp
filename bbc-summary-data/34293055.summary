The mother of a two-year-old girl found dead months ago and only now identified has been arrested over her death, police in Massachusetts say.

Her boyfriend is to be charged with the girl's murder.
Called "Baby Doe" by Boston police, the girl was found by a woman walking her dog on 25 June. She was finally named on Friday as Bella Bond.
Police commissioned a computer-generated image to help identify her which was shared millions of times.
At a news conference late on Friday, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said police had received a tip-off which had allowed them to solve the mystery.
He said he had authorised the arrest of the girl's mother, Rachelle Bond, 40, as an accessory to murder, and her partner, Michael McCarthy, 35, for murder.
Ms Bond is in custody, while Mr McCarthy is in hospital being treated for an unrelated medical condition, Mr Conley added.
"At just shy of three years old, Bella Bond was a true innocent," he said. "This child, whose very name means beauty, was murdered."
Mr Conley did not comment on how the girl died or on any possible motive. No signs of trauma have been found on her body.
The case received a massive response on social media and drew thousands of new visitors to government websites.
Police received hundreds of tips from the public, but they were unable to find anyone who knew the girl until now.
