Two Indian students have been arrested and released on bail for throwing a dog off a rooftop in the southern city of Chennai (Madras).

There was massive social media outrage after a video they made of the incident went viral in India.
The dog was found alive, injured and unable to walk but still wagging her tail, animal rights activist Shravan Krishnan told the BBC.
The fact that the students have already been released has also caused anger.
"Those criminals have come out on BAIL. This is how 'strong' the animal welfare laws are. With video evidence and so much of public outrage we couldn't remand them even for one day . We are extremely disappointed and it's a 'Black Day' for Animal Welfare in India," Mr Krishnan posted on his Facebook page.
However, the laws they have been charged under carry a maximum jail term of two years for "maiming or injuring" an animal.
The men were identified as students of the Madha medical college by other students after social media users had shared the video across networks in an attempt to find them.
The Humane Society of India also offered 100,000 rupees ($1,480; Â£1,146) as reward for anyone able to identify them.
Animal activists also filed a complaint with the Chennai police, who went to the college to look for them.
The two had left the city and returned to their hometown, 600km (372 miles) from Chennai, as outrage intensified, but Mr Krishnan said that their parents had agreed to hand them over to the police.
He said they had decided to name the dog "Bhadra" which translates from the Hindi as "blessed".
"She was terrified, cowering under a stairwell and urinated when I picked her up. But what broke my heart was that she was still wagging her tail," he said.
Those found in breach of animal cruelty laws in India only face a maximum fine of about 100 rupees ($1.48; Â£1.14).
Activists are petitioning for stricter penalties.
