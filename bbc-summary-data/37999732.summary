The current commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, announced in September he would retire seven months before the end of his current contract.
He has overseen the policing of riots and the Olympic Games.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the new commissioner will have served in the police in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada or USA.
Whoever holds the post is considered to be the most senior officer in Britain because of the national responsibilities of the Met, which includes counter-terrorism.
At a policing conference in London, the home secretary said: "I look forward to some very talented applications coming through for that very important role."
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: "The Met do an incredible service with enormous dedication every single day to keep us safe.
"It is therefore absolutely essential that we find the best possible person to take the Met forward other the coming years."
According to the Met, crime has fallen by around 18% since Sir Bernard took the job in September 2011.
He led the police response after the riots in 2011 and the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.
However, he has also faced controversy including questions about the Met's handling of Operation Midland.
The 16-month investigation was launched after claims boys were abused more than 30 years ago, but it closed in March without a single arrest.
Sir Bernard took charge of the UK's biggest police force when his predecessor Sir Paul Stephenson quit amid criticism of the Met's role in the phone-hacking scandal.
