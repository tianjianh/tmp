The men forced their way into Guest and Philips in Beverley, shortly after it opened at 09:30 BST.
They threatened staff with a sawn-off shotgun, but no shots were fired and nobody was injured, police said.
Officers are looking for four men, two of whom were drivers of two silver coloured getaway cars.
The two men, who raided the shop, were wearing white overalls and black balaclavas, police said.
Co-owner Phillip Guest was in the shop at the time of the robbery. He said he was threatened by one of the gunmen.
"I ran out from behind the window display and the guy pointed the gun at me and told me to move into the other room.
"Naturally everybody did as they were told and laid on the floor, it's the only sensible thing to do.
"He then wanted me to go in to the other room where the watches are."
Mr Guest said the men used an axe to smash the window displays, which housed Cartier and Gucci watches.
He said the watches were worth "tens of thousands of pounds, but we're yet to do an evaluation based on what's left".
Humberside Police said one of the getaway cars, a Vauxhall Omega with the registration number KH03UJA, was found abandoned with the engine running near a farm by the Beverley Westwood on York Road shortly after the robbery.
The car was parked outside the jewellers for only a few minutes during the robbery and was then used as the getaway car, police said.
Officers believe a second car was parked in Saturday Market at the time of the incident and driven towards the Westwood from the town centre.
Det Ch Insp Alistair McFarlane said: "Clearly there has been some pre-planning in this robbery and I would like to ask if anyone has seen any suspicious activity in the recent past in the area of the jewellers to please call us.
"Although no violence was used, these men are considered as dangerous and no attempt should be made to approach them."
Police believe passers-by may have filmed or taken photos of the robbery. They appealed for witnesses to come forward and send any recorded material to the force.
