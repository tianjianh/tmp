Father quizzed by mother over bleeding baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of a baby who suffered life threatening injuries says she questioned the father after she saw blood coming from the child's mouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy was taken to hospital in September 2013 with four "extreme" injuries including bleeding to the brain, Truro Crown Court heard.
He had been on the child protection register from birth, the jury was told.
His parents deny causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and causing or allowing injury to a child.
The father told the court the baby had been crying lots over the weekend before the couple took him to hospital.
He said they had gone shopping and the injury might have happened when he was being taken out of his car seat.
He also told the court the injuries might have been caused by his older brother jumping on him.
The mother said the baby had been "crying and crying" and "I wish I had taken him to hospital earlier, he must have been in so much pain".
However, medical experts say the injuries could not have been accidental and that they would have been caused by a major trauma.
Previously the court heard his father was not allowed to have unsupervised contact with the baby's brother, after the boy sustained suspicious injuries a year earlier.
The boy's mother told the court she had no reason to believe their baby was in any danger from his father.
However, on an earlier occasion she had seen blood coming from his mouth and when she had questioned his father, he told her he had accidentally banged the baby's head whilst picking him up.
The family was being monitored by social services after unexplained injuries were found on her older son.
Neither the man, woman nor the baby can be named for legal reasons.
The trial continues.
