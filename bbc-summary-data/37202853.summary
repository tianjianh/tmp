[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 0-0 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom-of-the-table Guiseley claimed their first point of the National League season by holding Braintree to a goalless draw at Nethermoor Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The West Yorkshire club prop up the fledgling table having lost all seven of their opening games but they showed signs of progress on a rain-sodden pitch.
In the 36th minute, striker Jordan Preston hit the post after good work from Adam Boyes and Oli Johnson, while Luke Porritt smashed the ball just over the visitors' crossbar midway through the second half.
Chez Isaac threatened to grab a late winner for Braintree, who reached the play-offs last season, but his swerving shot missed the target nine minutes from the end.
