Police said that while nights would be getting brighter there could be a risk of poorer visibility in the mornings.
Insp Neil Hewitson, of Dumfries and Galloway's roads policing unit, urged motorists to take extra care.
He also asked drivers to be aware of an increase in the number of motorbikes on the roads as the days lengthened.
He said: "A common cause of motorcycle crashes is the so-called T-boning of the motorcycle by drivers who either pull out of a junction in front of, or across the path of an oncoming bike to turn right.
"These collisions could be avoided by drivers taking more care.
"Drivers should remember that motorcyclists are much more vulnerable than drivers, especially in wet conditions.
"A driver may walk away from a crash that a motorcyclist would not."
