Gun crime spike 'of great concern'
A further gang injunction and a civil injunction were granted against two other offenders who cannot be named because of their ages.
All of the injunctions, which were granted by Birmingham County Court, will remain in place until 4 January 2018.
The Bishton brothers and Watson have convictions for violent offences.
West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: "The Bishton family have been linked to numerous firearms incidents and are happy to be involved in the carrying of guns.
"My message to those who carry weapons is that this stops now. We will find you and we will deal with you robustly."
Shafique Shah from Birmingham City Council said he was "delighted" with the injunctions.
He added: "These gang members brought misery to the communities in which they were operating... we will act where necessary to take appropriate action against any individual who is found to be involved."
