Macclesfield Town v Wrexham - match off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tuesday's match between Macclesfield and Wrexham was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A torrential downpour just over an hour before the scheduled 19:45 BST kick-off time left large sections of the Moss Road pitch under water.
Referee Steve Rushton waited until 18:45 BST before deciding there was no chance of any play.
Macclesfield were looking for a fourth win in a row in the National League and to close the gap on leaders Lincoln.
