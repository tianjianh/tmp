Rio Andrew, 15, fell ill at the event at a disused building in East Croydon, south London, on 15 June 2014.
The teenager, who attended Holland Park School in Kensington, west London, was taken to hospital and died the following day.
A post-mortem examination found he died from multiple organ failure and acute intoxication.
Following an inquest at Croydon Coroner's Court on Wednesday, Met Police said it had suspended the investigation as there was "no criminal case to answer".
It said it would reopen the investigation only if new information came to light.
Commander Simon Letchford said: "Our thoughts are with Rio's family during this very difficult time.
"More than a year has passed since Rio's death and, with the culmination of the inquest, it has highlighted some of the dangers associated with unlicensed music events.
"I want to make it absolutely clear that where possible we will do all we can to prevent unlicensed events and illegal raves like these from taking place in London."
Police made 34 arrests on the night of the rave, leading to nine charges and seven convictions for offences including violent disorder and assault on police.
