Panel to conduct review of Scotland's planning system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has set up an independent panel to conduct what it described as a "game-changing" review of Scotland's planning system.

Its role is to bring together ideas for "a quicker, more accessible and efficient" planning process.
The panel includes representatives of Planning Aid Scotland and the Scottish Property Federation.
It will examine issues such as development planning, housing delivery and community engagement.
It will be led by Crawford Beveridge, who chairs the Scottish government's Council of Economic Advisers.
The move was welcomed by local authority body Cosla but the Royal Town Planning Institute Scotland expressed disappointment that there was no chartered planner on the panel.
The current planning process has come in for criticism from Scottish housebuilders and developers over the amount of time taken by councils to reach planning decisions.
Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil said the panel members would be able to provide "an objective and strategic perspective".
He said: "There has already been significant planning performance improvement as a result of previous modernisation, but I believe that more can be done by all stakeholders so planning plays a more positive and effective role in creating high quality places for current and future generations, while respecting local democracy.
"As set out in the Programme for Government, published earlier this month, this review will look at wide-ranging issues affecting the planning system, including how planning is resourced and how we can streamline and improve our system in Scotland.
"It will aim to increase delivery of high quality housing developments, by delivering a quicker, more accessible and efficient process, and it will reinforce our commitment to a fair and open planning system that works for everyone, especially local communities."
The panel is due to report its findings in the spring.
Stephen Hagan, planning spokesman for local authority body Cosla, said: "Last month I had a lively and highly constructive debate on planning modernisation with council leaders.
"The issues covered included the need to strengthen local democracy through the planning system, the need to integrate and not centralise the local planning process and the cost of resourcing the planning system locally.
"Leaders agreed there is a lot that needs to change in policy, practice and perception terms with planning locally."
He added: "Cosla therefore welcome the proposal by the cabinet secretary for a further consultation on the modernisation of planning legislation and regulation by an independent panel and will play a full and constructive part in the review."
Pam Ewen, Scotland Convener for the Royal Town Planning Institute said: "While the members of the panel bring a lot of expertise, I am astonished and very disappointed that there is not a planner on the panel with recent practical experience of the planning system.
"The success of the review will depend upon knowledge and expertise of how the planning system works from the inside as well as the outside."
