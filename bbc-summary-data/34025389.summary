[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth 1-1 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Vardy's late penalty earned Leicester a draw away to Bournemouth and preserved his side's unbeaten start to the Premier League season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Callum Wilson's bicycle kick opened the scoring for Bournemouth after Max Gradel's deflected header fell kindly.
The Cherries were forced to make three substitutions through injuries as goalkeeper Artur Boruc was a spectator for much of the game.
But Vardy levelled after being fouled in the box with four minutes to play.
The 28-year-old's hard running was the brightest feature Leicester's display and he tricked Bournemouth defender Steve Cook into scything him down with some neat footwork.
The result means Claudio Ranieri remains unbeaten in his first four matches in charge of the Foxes, while Eddie Howe's Bournemouth go into the international break with four points from their first four games in the top flight.
Reaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action
Relive Bournemouth's draw with Leicester
Riyad Mahrez had been Leicester's stand-out performer of the season so far, scoring four goals in the first three games.
But against Bournemouth he was taken off at half-time after a poor display. The 24-year-old was clattered into by Max Gradel almost immediately from kick-off and Ranieri said after the game the Algerian winger had struggled to recover.
Instead it was Bournemouth who looked by far the more dangerous side in the opening 45, but in the second half they struggled to cope with the changes enforced on them by injury.
Boruc had a quiet first half but remained alert to save from Jeff Schlupp and Danny Drinkwater before Vardy levelled from the penalty spot - despite the Polish goalkeeper getting a hand on it.
With England playing San Marino and Switzerland in two European Championship qualifiers next Saturday and Tuesday, it will not have escaped manager Roy Hodgson's attention that it is an Englishman who jointly leads the Premier League scoring charts.
Wilson scored a brilliant hat-trick in last weekend's 4-3 win at West Ham and got his fourth goal of the campaign to level with Mahrez after showing brilliant predatory technique to turn home Bournemouth's first-ever top flight goal at home.
Charlie Daniels' cross from the left was met by Gradel, his header hit a Leicester back and Wilson swivelled sharply before smashing home beautifully with his back to goal.
The 23-year-old is not in contention for a place in Hodgson's squad but had his link-up play with summer signing Lee Tomlin been slightly more polished, he could have scored a few more.
Tomlin showed good promise in the playmaker role but Leicester's defence was solid. At times you might argue it was too solid, as first Bournemouth left-back Daniels, then his £8m replacement Tyrone Mings, who came on for his Premier League debut, and lastly winger Gradel were all forced off through injury.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: "We were still dominant for long periods but I think the injuries were key in the game, particularly in our ability to change tactically, and it's not nice when you see your team-mates going of injured.

"They all look nasty and at the moment they are in the treatment room being assessed, although we won't know how serious they are until they get scanned.
"I think we've had a decent enough start in terms of performances. I'm a bit disappointed not to have got more points. I thought we could have got three today, but sometimes you have to be a grateful for a point."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri, speaking to BBC Sport: "We conceded the goal and until then we were playing well. After the goal we slowed down the tempo and had no great personality.

"There were 10 minutes when Bournemouth played very well. In the second half we put them under pressure and made some good chances. I think at the end we deserved to draw.
"It's important to take one point from a difficult match. We have a week now where the players go to their national team and when they come back we must re-start with the same mentality."
Bournemouth will be hopeful of picking up more points from their next three games against Norwich, Sunderland and Stoke after the international break.
Leicester will look to keep their good run going through matches against Aston Villa and Stoke before welcoming Arsenal.
