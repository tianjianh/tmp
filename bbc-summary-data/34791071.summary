The left-hander hit an unbeaten 244 off 272 balls, with 22 fours and two sixes.
Usman Khawaja also scored a century (121) in a second-wicket stand of 302, as the hosts dominated in Perth.
Warner also hit centuries in both innings of the first Test of the series, which Australia lead 1-0, and averages 261.5 in the series to date.
"He was outstanding," Khawaja told ABC Radio. "I was shocked when he got his third hundred in a row. That's pretty impressive - not many people can do that.
"I just kept telling him he's a genius and he is, he's on fire. The way he's batting at the moment, he's making it look so easy.
"Test cricket isn't easy, no matter who you play against. It's just really nice to watch. I hope it continues for a long time - you don't want to waste good form."
