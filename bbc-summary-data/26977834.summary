Victorian cells at Hull Prison which were closed last year are to reopen, according to the Ministry of Justice.

The jail's C and D wings were mothballed with the reduction of 282 beds and the loss of 70 jobs.
The ministry (MoJ) said the cells will be brought back because the "prison population is currently above published projections".
The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said it had concerns over the staffing of the reopened wings.
In a statement, the MoJ said the number of prisoners in England and Wales in March was 1,500 higher than predicted and said the reopening was "a proportionate and sensible response to ensure that we continue to have enough prison places for those sentenced by the courts".
Rob Nicholson, from the Hull branch of the POA, said his members welcomed the wings' reopening, but the union was still in discussions with the prison's governor about how the cells would be staffed.
"The way they they are going by staffed is by detached duty," he said.
"So, that's other members of staff across the prison estate and an overtime system called payment plus.
"My concern, along with my committee, is that staff may burn out far too quickly."
