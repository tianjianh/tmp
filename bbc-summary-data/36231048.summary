[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dawn Sheard, 46, had sex with the inmate while on duty at HMP Doncaster, a prison investigation found.
It found she had contacted the prisoner by phone, cards and letters and  "compromised the safety of her colleagues".
Sheard, of Barnsley, was jailed for 10 months at Sheffield Crown Court on Wednesday.
South Yorkshire Police said the relationship came to light during a routine check of outgoing prisoner calls.
Sheard had used a sim card and phone that had not been disclosed to the prison and the pair had been talking in code.
The prisoner had made more than 580 calls to Sheard in just two months, while she had sent cards and letters.
Sheard, who worked at the prison from December 2014 to August 2015, admitted misconduct in public office.
