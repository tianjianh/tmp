An artist known for producing sick bags to commemorate high profile events has created one for the US presidential election.

Lydia Leith, from Carlisle, said the artwork featuring Republican nomination candidate Donald Trump would make a "good talking point".
"He has a face that is interesting to illustrate, he was an obvious one for a sick bag," she said.
He is the only candidate Ms Leith plans to draw because of his links to the UK.
"Lots of people here in the UK can't believe he is serious," she said.
Communications agency director Mark Pack, who ran two Liberal Democrat general election internet campaigns, said political memorabilia becomes headline-worthy when it "captures the spirit of the election."
"The Trump sick bags certainly seem to do that," he said.
"They are a good example of how humour can capture the strength of emotion people have over a political issue, in ways that are hard to match with straight words without sounding [like] ranting."
Ms Leith said she takes inspiration from "something in the news that I get sick of hearing about".
Her previous successes include the "Throne Up" bags made for the royal wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
The first edition of the Trump bags has already sold out to buyers in the UK, USA, Germany and other European countries.
