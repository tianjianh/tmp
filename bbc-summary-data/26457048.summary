The council, facing a Â£1.1bn bill for equal pay settlements, says it wants to ensure the existing uses are preserved.
The National Exhibition Centre (NEC) itself was opened by the Queen in 1976.
As well as the NEC, the group incorporates the International Convention Centre, the LG Arena and the National Indoor Arena.
