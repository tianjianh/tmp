Met Police investigate expenses of two MPs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Metropolitan Police are investigating two MPs over alleged misuse of Parliamentary expenses.

The cases were referred to the police earlier this year by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority watchdog, which oversees expenses.
The identities of those involved have not been disclosed.
In a statement, the Met also said a 33-year old woman, an employee of an MP, had separately been given a caution for fraud by false representation.
The Met said IPSA had referred three cases to it in March, the first time this had happened since the watchdog took over responsibility for expenses following the 2009 scandal over parliamentary allowances led to conviction of half a dozen MPs and peers.
IPSA has an agreement with the police to inform them if there is reason to believe a criminal offence has been committed by an MP or a member of their staff.
In a statement, the Met said. "Two (cases) are being investigated. An assessment of the third referral resulted in a 33-year-old woman, an employee of an MP, receiving a caution in April for fraud by false representation."
In his annual report, IPSA's compliance officer Peter Davis revealed that he had brought the cases to the attention of the police.
"During the course of the reporting period I have felt it necessary for the first time during my term of office to refer requests for investigation received from IPSA to the police," he wrote.
"Three cases have been forwarded to the Metropolitan Police for assessment; one has been finalised and two remain with the police."
The Evening Standard said both cases now being looked into were assessed by specialist officers before they decided there was sufficient concern to mount a full investigation. It also said another referral, also concerning an MP, had been dismissed as there was no case to answer.
