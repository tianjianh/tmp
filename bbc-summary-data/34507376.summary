Nurse admits causing patient Matthew Simmonds' ventilator death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who continued doing agency work while signed-off sick from her job at Dorset's Poole Hospital has admitted causing the death of a patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kadiatu Harris was caring for Matthew Simmonds, 39, at his Hampshire home where he died on 6 July 2011.
His ventilator, which should have been switched over on a shift change with another nurse, was turned off.
Ms Harris originally denied causing his death but changed her case at the Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing.
Ms Harris previously admitted contributing to Mr Simmond's death and reducing his chances of survival.
However, Rory Mulchrone, who presented the case to the conduct and competence committee on behalf of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said Ms Harris changed her case on the basis that "but for her actions in contributing to the death of Patient B [he] would not have died when and how he did".
Mr Simmonds, from Chandlers Ford, was suffering from von Hippel-Lindau disease - a genetic form of cancer.
An inquest found the lack of ventilation had caused his death, the hearing at Stratford in London was told.
However, a police investigation had not led to the CPS prosecuting either Ms Harris or the nurse she had taken over from, Ms Harris' lawyer told the hearing.
