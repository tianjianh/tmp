A canal bridge in Blackburn has received a wallpaper makeover as part of a project to celebrate the town's industrial heritage.

Wallpaper maker Graham & Brown created the artwork after adopting a stretch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.
The attraction, on Sour Milk Hall Bridge, is a replica of an illustration by London designer Lizzie Mary Cullen, displayed in the company's foyer.
The project was supervised by the Canal and River Trust.
Ian Brown, a director at Graham & Brown, said the company wanted to celebrate Blackburn's "proud past".
"As a business we are inspired by creative design and the bridge supplied us with a large blank canvas to work on," he said.
"Blackburn is a town with a proud past, and the canal is a legacy of the times of the industrial revolution."
