Claudio Ranieri's squad will travel on an open-top bus through the city before taking the stage at Victoria Park.
Leicester will be presented with the trophy following Saturday's final home game of the season against Everton.
Opera star Andrea Bocelli will also perform at the King Power Stadium before Saturday's game.
Leicester secured a first top-flight league title in their 132-year history on Monday, as Tottenham drew 2-2 with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
The open-top bus tour will start from Jubilee Square at 6pm, and finish at Victoria Park an hour later, where the players will show the Premier League trophy to the fans.
In 2014, the Foxes held an open-top bus parade to celebrate promotion to the top flight after a 10-year absence.
Thousands of people lined the route from the High Street, past the Clock Tower before some 6,000 fans greeted the buses in Town Hall Square.
