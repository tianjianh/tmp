Kane will be making his first appearance for his country since 4 September 2016 because of injury.
England's last permanent captain was Wayne Rooney, who has been left out of the squad.
"I wanted to give him that boost," said England boss Gareth Southgate. "He was pretty chuffed. It's a great honour."
Kane will be making his 18th appearance for the Three Lions, having made his debut for the senior side against Lithuania under Roy Hodgson on 27 March 2015.
He came off the bench to score in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win at Wembley after replacing Rooney.
"We have several players who have excellent leadership qualities," added Southgate.
"Harry is a player who we have worked with in the Under-21s before. He's got a terrific mentality and I know he is delighted to be leading the team."
Kane, England's 119th captain, scored 35 goals in 38 league and cup appearances for Premier League runners-up Spurs in 2016-17.
England team-mate Adam Lallana said Kane deserved to lead his country.
"I'm absolutely delighted for Harry, I've been so impressed by him. He's demonstrated why he's one of the world's best players," added the Liverpool midfielder.
Group F leaders England are six points clear of fourth-placed Scotland with five games remaining.
Analysis: Radio 5 live's football correspondent John Murray
This is not a permanent appointment as England captain. Gareth Southgate was very keen to stress that they are developing a group of five or six leaders who can play that role for England.
It is interesting that he has been chosen as captain for this game - which is the hardest game in the group.
