A Singapore court has ordered the release of a man alleged by Interpol to be the mastermind behind a global football match-fixing ring.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dan Tan, also known as Tan Seet Eng, has been held under indefinite detention since October 2013.
But a judge ruled that detention was unlawful as he posed no public threat.
Mr Tan, who has said he is innocent, is wanted by several countries including Italy, but Singapore does not have extradition treaties with them.
He has been implicated by Interpol in fixing hundreds of sports events, mostly football matches, and is suspected of having fixed matches in Italy's Serie A and Serie B in 2011.
It has previously called the 51-year-old "the mastermind and leader of the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate".

Singapore has a law that allows indefinite detention of suspected criminals without trial. Such detentions are reviewed every year.
The Singapore judge, Sundaresh Menon, said that while Mr Tan's alleged acts were "reprehensible and should not be condoned", there was "nothing to suggest" they harmed public safety and peace.
"The matches fixed, whether or not successfully, all took place beyond our shores," he said, adding that there was nothing to indicate he worked with overseas crime syndicates or that such activities would be based in Singapore.
