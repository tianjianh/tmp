Wimbledon 2016: Andy Murray aims to keep impressing in this year's tournament

Great Britain's Andy Murray will be hoping to maintain his good form at this year's Wimbledon when he takes on Australia's John Millman on Saturday.

Murray is the last British player left in singles' competition after defeats for Dan Evans and Tara Moore on Friday.
In the opening two rounds, Murray, the 2013 Wimbledon champion, has not lost a set and only dropped 15 games.
"If you can win matches easily it does help because you can rest. It has been a good start," he said.
Millman, 27, is ranked 67th in the world and nearly quit tennis after suffering a serious shoulder injury three years ago.
"I worked in the City for a little bit at one of my mate's companies - I was dressed up in a suit each day going in," said Millman, who admitted he had "never been inside Centre Court or Court One".
"I really have an appreciation of these moments right now, because there was a big time there where I wasn't too confident.
"You dream of playing on the biggest courts against the biggest players. I feel as if I deserve to be there and I'm going to give it everything."
That third-round match is scheduled to be second on Centre Court on Saturday and will be the first time Murray and Millman have met in a Grand Slam.

Murray has only played Millman once, winning two sets to one in the second round of the Brisbane International on a hard court in January 2013.
"I didn't know him before we played in Brisbane," said the world number two. "He played extremely well that day. He was ranked about 200 at the time.
"I came off the court and I said to Dani Vallverdu, who I was working with, 'He's top 50 for sure if he keeps going'.
"He moves well and has a great attitude. But obviously it's a different surface, different place. The match-up will be a bit different on a grass court."
World number one Novak Djokovic has won 30 Grand Slam matches in a row, with his last loss coming against Stan Wawrinka in the final of the French Open in June 2015.
But he has a fight on his hands when he resumes on Court One on Saturday two sets to love behind against America's 28th seed Sam Querrey.
Querrey took the first set on a tie-break before cruising through the second 6-1 only for the rain to arrive, meaning they have to conclude their third-round match on Saturday.
"Querrey maintained his level and Djokovic looked as though he was uninterested," four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman told BBC Sport.
"He obviously isn't but since he is down two sets to love he will be happy to have a break and talk to his team.
"He has got to draw on last year's experience. He is certainly hoping that history repeats itself."
Last year, Djokovic trailed South African Kevin Anderson by the same margin in their last-16 tie when bad light stopped play and the Serb came back to win a day later.
Australia's Nick Kyrgios, who beat German Dustin Brown in a five-set thriller on Friday, is also in action on Court One on Saturday.
He takes on Spain's Feliciano Lopez with the winner playing the victor of the Murray-Millman match in the last 16.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is going to have a busy schedule if she is going to have more success at the tournament, as she is yet to finish her second-round singles match.
She returns on Saturday with work to do to stay in the competition after losing the first set 7-5 to Russia's Ekaterina Makarova.
Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, a Wimbledon runner-up two years ago, defeated British number one Johanna Konta on Thursday and is in action against 19th seed Dominika Cibulkova.
Wimbledon organisers have already announced that there will be play on the middle Sunday of the tournament for the first time since 2004.
The opening week's schedule has been disrupted by rain delays and there could be more frustration for tennis fans on outside courts on Saturday.
Steve Cleaton of BBC Weather said: "It will be bright, breezy and dry for lengthy periods, but there will be the risk of occasional showers through the course of the day.
"Any showers should move through fairly quickly, but they could be heavy."
