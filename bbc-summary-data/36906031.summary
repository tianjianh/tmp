Police investigating the attempted abduction of an RAF serviceman have released e-fits of the men they suspect were involved.

The victim was threatened with a knife near RAF Marham in Norfolk on 20 July.
Attempts were also made to pull him into a car but he managed to fight the men off, headbutting one of them.
Norfolk Police has released the images a week on from the attack. The force says it is possible the suspects were part of a "larger team".

The first suspect is described as of "Middle Eastern appearance", between 20 and 30 years old, approximately 6ft (1.8m) tall, with a well-groomed beard.
The second man, who is of similar appearance, is slightly younger, about 5ft 10in (1.78m) tall and was clean-shaven with short, dark hair.
Officers were called after the victim was approached by two men while he was out jogging near the RAF base.
Police said he was on a route used regularly by personnel at the base, but was wearing headphones at the time so did not hear what the first attacker said to him.
He managed to wrestle the man to the ground - possibly leaving the suspect with a black eye - before a second man, armed with the knife, tried to attack him.
The suspects then fled in a dark-coloured people carrier, which police are still trying to trace.
"We know that our victim is a member of RAF personnel and we are still investigating how much relevance this was to his attempted abduction," Det Supt Paul Durham said.
"It is probable that there would have been a degree of planning involved and in order to achieve this, it is quite possible that there was at least one other person involved."
He added there had been "no change" on how likely terrorism was seen as being a motive.
"There's still no credible evidence that supports that but equally I can't discount it," he said.
