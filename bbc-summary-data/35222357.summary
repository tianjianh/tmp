[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A carer has been awarded more than £50,000 in compensation after plunging down a lift shaft at a nursing home in a fall where her patient died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carol Conway, 52, fell 20ft (6m) at Pontcanna House Care Home, Cardiff, in 2012 as she reversed May Lewis, 96, in her wheelchair.
Owner Dr Nasik Al-Mufti was fined £100,000 in August for breaching health and safety regulations.
Care Council for Wales said her actions were not deliberate or reckless.
Mrs Lewis, who had been at the home for just five days, broke 52 bones and died.
Mrs Conway, who had been a carer for 29 years, broke her back, ribs, left foot and punctured her lung and was left unconscious.
"I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I can't do anything like I used to," she said.
"The money doesn't mean a thing to me. The most precious thing we have is our health.
"I know I am very lucky to be alive but life has changed so much because of that terrible accident. I take 32 tablets a day and I am never free from pain.
"I still have terrible nightmares thinking of May and her family. I am constantly plagued by that terrible day.
"Poor May Lewis should have died peacefully in her sleep surrounded by her loved ones; not with 52 broken bones at the bottom of a dark, damp lift shaft."
Mrs Conway had worked at Pontcanna House for three years.
Dr Al-Mufti was the joint owner of the care home with her husband when in early 2012 there were problems with the home's platform lift.
A Care Council for Wales hearing in Cardiff last month was told an engineer had advised the doors on the second floor could not be used, but staff routinely used an emergency key to override it when they did not open.
The hearing was told Dr Al-Mufti "acquiesced but did not encourage" the use of the emergency key override.
