American golfer Jordan Spieth says he would prefer to win the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine than the $10m (£7.7m) prize money on offer in the FedEx Cup.

Spieth, 23, will defend his FedEx Cup title in the last of the four play-off tournaments, the Tour Championship in Atlanta, starting on Thursday.
The 2016 Ryder Cup begins on 27 September, with Europe looking for a fourth successive victory.
"If you're saying 2016, right now, I've got a choice - Ryder Cup," Spieth said.
The Texan, who was part of the 2014 US team that lost to Europe at Gleneagles, added: "I don't have a Ryder Cup. I think I will have a Ryder Cup at some point."
"You want something that you don't have. That's a trophy that I've watched the other side of now and it hurt."
Spieth is seventh in the FedEx Cup, the PGA Tour's season-long points contest, with compatriot Dustin Johnson leading.
England's Paul Casey, in fifth, is the highest-placed Briton going in to the Tour Championship, in which the top 30 players from the recent BMW Championship compete.
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Scotland's Russell Knox are also in the top 10, alongside Australians Adam Scott and world number one Jason Day.
