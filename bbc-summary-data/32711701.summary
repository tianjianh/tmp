[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A verdict of misadventure was recorded over the death of 23-year-old Charlotte Christodoulou in Shrewsbury in January.
The inquest heard she and her boyfriend went into Harlescott Junior School as a short cut on their way home.
She was unable to climb out over a 10ft (3m) fence but her boyfriend, who was able to, left her, the court heard.
Ms Christodoulou died of hypothermia, Shropshire Coroner John Ellery ruled.
It was not clear if her boyfriend, Lloyd Butler, went back for her, the court was told.
Det Con Andrea Ross, from West Mercia Police, said Mr Butler was seen on CCTV leaving the school fields alone at about 20:00 GMT on Sunday 4 January.
Because Ms Christodoulou, who who was living in Radbrook but was originally from Walsall, was disoriented, she was unable to find her way out in the cold and dark, the inquest heard.
She was wearing only thin clothing in freezing weather conditions.
Pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar told the hearing she most likely died in the early hours of the morning but, because she was intoxicated, she was able to withstand the sub-zero temperatures slightly longer than usual.
Three people originally arrested on suspicion of her murder and obstructing a coroner were later released without charge.
Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with her death.
