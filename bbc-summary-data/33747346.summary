Outburst mars Bobbi Kristina Brown memorial in Georgia

The memorial for Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown has been marred by an outburst that reflects the continuing tensions in the family.

Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah, left the service after venting anger at the role of another relative, Pat Houston.
Bobbi Kristina, 22, died at a hospice last Sunday, six months after she was found face down and unresponsive in a bathtub.
She is expected to be buried beside her mother at a cemetery in New Jersey.
An initial autopsy found no obvious underlying cause for Brown's death. She was discovered in the bathtub at the Atlanta home she shared with her partner Nick Gordon in January.
Houston drowned in a bathtub at a Los Angeles hotel in 2012 on the eve of the Grammy Awards ceremony.
Speaking to media outside the church, Leolah Brown, the sister of Bobbi Kristina's father, R&B singer Bobby Brown, said the funeral was going "wonderfully" well until Pat Houston started speaking.
"I didn't like that, so I left... I just told her that Whitney is going to haunt her from the grave."
Pat Houston is Whitney Houston's sister-in-law and former manager.
Leolah Brown suggested that the feud between the Houstons and the Browns was far from over.
"It's just getting started,'' she said.
The funeral service at St James United Methodist Church in Alpharetta, which was closed to the public, lasted about two hours.
Those attending included Bobby Brown; grandmother Cissy Houston; cousin Jerod Brown; Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed and R&B singer Monica.
Brown began performing with her mother in 1999, singing duets of My Love is Your Love and recording Little Drummer Boy for a holiday album in 2003.
She was the only daughter of Houston and Bobby Brown.
In a statement after her death, Bobby Brown said the family must find a way to honour his daughter's memory.
"Krissy was and is an angel," he said. "I am completely numb at this time."
