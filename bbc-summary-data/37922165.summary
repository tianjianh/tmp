Proposed A9 route 'no threat' to Enchanted Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual Enchanted Forest event's location will not be affected by a proposed dualling section of the A9, Transport Scotland has said.

The preferred route for the section between Pitlochry and Killiecrankie is on public display until Thursday in Pitlochry Town Hall.
Two other proposed sections covering more than 16 miles of the dualling programme will be displayed this month.
The 80-mile Â£3bn programme is expected to be completed in 2025.
The Enchanted Forest event is held every September in Faskally Wood, Perthshire. This year's light and music show attracted more than 70,000 visitors.
Transport Scotland said the preferred route, which is about four miles long, would avoid the need for a new structure over Loch Faskally and was the least-expensive option.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: "One of the challenges of dualling the route is trying to fit the road through some of the country's most striking landscapes, including the Cairngorms National Park.
"On this stretch of the road, our design consultants have worked hard to identify a route that avoids any impact on the area of ancient woodland in Faskally Wood well known as the home of the popular Enchanted Forest event that attracted over 70,000 visitors this year.
"The preferred route also avoids the need for a new structure over Loch Faskally and will lead to less disruption for road users during construction."
Proposed dualling routes for the Tomatin to Moy and Glen Garry to Dalwhinnie sections will be displayed in Tomatin and Dalwhinnie later in November.
Mr Brown said the new consultations, along with three others carried out earlier this year, meant that preferred routes for more than 36 miles of the programme had now been identified.
He said: "At the same time, the construction work on the section between Kincraig and Dalraddy,  the first to be dualled, is well under way and is expected to be complete in summer 2017."
