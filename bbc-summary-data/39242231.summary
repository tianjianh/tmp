Hurling League Division Two A: Antrim beat Armagh to maintain promotion push

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim hurlers maintained their promotion push as they moved to the top of Division Two A with a 2-18 to 2-11 away win over Armagh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four David Carvill points helped Armagh lead 0-7 to 0-5 but a Ciaran Clarke goal contributed to Antrim's 1-8 to 0-7 half-time advantage.
Armagh moved 1-10 to 1-9 up thanks to a Cahal Carvill goal but a run of eight straight points put Antrim in control.
Carvill's second goal cut the margin before Conor McCann netted for Antrim.
Antrim's run of eight unanswered points in the second half included five scores from Deaglan Murphy.
With overnight table-toppers Carlow being held to a 1-20 to 2-17 draw by Kildare, Antrim now lead the division by a point and they will secure a place in the Division Two A final if they avoid defeat in their final round-robin game against Westmeath at Ballycastle in two weeks.
The winners of the Division Two A final will then face the bottom team in Division One B in a promotion-relegation play-off.
The defeat keeps Armagh in relegation trouble ahead of their final game against Carlow in two weeks.
London and Armagh both remain on one point, although the Exiles are in the automatic relegation spot on scoring difference, having drawn with the Orchard County in the second round of fixtures.
