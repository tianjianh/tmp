Petrov, 37, retired in 2013 after being diagnosed with leukaemia, but trained with Villa in the summer.
He was not offered a playing deal, but Nuneaton boss Kevin Wilson says he could join them in a player-coach role.
"We're trying to give him the opportunity to get the coaching hours in and get the experience," he said.
The former Bulgaria captain, who made 218 appearances for Villa, played Sunday league football for Wychall Wanderers during his retirement, helping them win the Central Warwickshire Over-35s Premier Division One Cup.
Nuneaton are currently 13th in English football's sixth tier having won just three times in their first 12 league games.
"People say he's been in the professional game, but everybody has to learn and take the process that comes," Wilson told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire.
"We'll wait and see how it goes, but it's exciting for a football club like ours."
