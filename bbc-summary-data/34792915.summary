The 70-year-old received multiple wounds when he was attacked in Hythe Hill, Colchester, Essex, at 17:40 GMT on Tuesday.
Officers are searching for a tall white man who was wearing camouflage trousers and a green top.
The victim is undergoing surgery for his injuries, which are described as life changing.
He was taken to Colchester Hospital and was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he is in a critical condition.
Detective Inspector Jim White, of Essex Police, said the motive behind the attack is not known.
"We believe the weapon may have been discarded.
"We are asking residents in the Hythe, New Town or Military Road areas to be vigilant and would ask them to check their bins and gardens.
"If they find a knife, blade, or blood stained clothing, they are asked to contact us immediately," he said.
