[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain kept up the pressure on Ligue 1 leaders Nice with victory over Bordeaux thanks to two goals from Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani.

Cavani scored twice on Wednesday in the Champions League against Ludogorets and got another double with a clever backheeled flick on the half-hour mark.
