[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge 3-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge made light work of their first game back in the National League in nine years, cruising to a 3-0 win over Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fejiri Okenabirhie played a starring role for Daggers, opening the scoring on the rebound after 15 minutes, before his determination to win the ball back in the corner allowed him to tee up Luke Guttridge to make it 2-0 after 23 minutes.
Brighton loanee Jordan Maguire-Drew had a chance to make it 3-0 from the spot just before half-time, but his penalty was at a good height for Southport goalkeeper Tyrell Belford, who got both hands to it down to his left.
Dagenham announced the signings of strikers Paul Benson and Corey Whitely at half-time and Maguire-Drew added to the feel-good factor by wrapping up the scoring after 67 minutes.
