Former world number one and 2005 champion Vijay Singh made a strong start for a share of the lead after the opening round of the Sony Open in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The 52-year-old Fijian, who is aiming to become the oldest winner in PGA Tour history, shot a seven-under 63.
He is in a five-way tie with Americans Ricky Barnes, Morgan Hoffmann, Kevin Kisner and Brandt Snedeker.
Singh's last tournament win came at the 2008 Deutsche Bank Championship.
Since then, the 34-time PGA Tour winner, who turns 53 next month, has struggled with various health problems which have had an impact on his swing.
But seven birdies and no bogeys at Waialae Country Club gave him hope of reclaiming past glories.
Victory on Sunday would see him beat the record held by Sam Snead, who won the 1965 Greater Greensboro Open at the age of 52 years, 10 months and eight days.
"I feel like I can come out and win any tournament if I play well," he said. "It's been the same way for the past five, six years.
"I just haven't produced the scores I want to produce, but I'm always optimistic about my next day, my next round, my next tournament. Same this year."
