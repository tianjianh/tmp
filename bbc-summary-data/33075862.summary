One of the victims of a rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers has thanked medics and said the support he has received "has been a great comfort".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton in Derbyshire, remains in hospital where he is receiving treatment for a collapsed lung and lower-leg injuries.
University Hospital Coventry said he was "recovering well".
Five people were seriously hurt in the crash last week, including a teenager who later had her leg amputated.
Two carriages collided on the Smiler ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire.
"I would like to thank everyone for their support which has been a great comfort to me at this time," said Mr Thorpe.
"In particular the emergency services, doctors, nurses and the rest of the team who have been looking after me and my family during this time have been fantastic.
"I'm now looking forward to getting better, getting home and getting back to normal."
Mr Thorpe, 18-year-old Joe Pugh from Barnsley, Vicky Balch, 20, from Leyland in Lancashire and 17-year-old Leah Washington were on the front row of a carriage which smashed into an empty car ahead of them.
All four sustained serious leg injuries with Miss Washington having to have an above-the-knee amputation.
A fifth person, Chanda Chauhan, 49, from Wednesbury in the Black Country, who was sitting in the second row of the Smiler, was treated at Walsall Manor Hospital for internal injuries.
A Health and Safety Executive investigation into the crash is continuing.
Alton Towers has reopened although the Smiler ride itself remains closed.
Merlin Entertainments Group, which owns the theme park, said it was the first accident in the company's history and said anyone injured would be compensated.
