Swansea cat breaks leg after boys kick it into air

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat was kicked so hard by two boys it flew into the air and broke its leg, RSPCA Cymru has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boys, aged nine or 10, were seen kicking the pet in Penllergaer, Swansea, on 12 April at about 12:00 BST.
The black and white cat was found screaming in pain by a driver who saw the incident near the green.
It was taken to a vet and will need an operation on its leg but was not micro-chipped so the owners are untraceable.
Neither boy has been caught but one of them had brown hair and was wearing a red hoodie.
Anyone with information is asked to call the RSPCA 0300 123 8018.
