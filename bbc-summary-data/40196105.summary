Trump v Comey: Who said what

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Who said what during a series of one-on-one conversations between President Donald Trump and then-FBI head James Comey, before he was fired, is one of Washington's most hotly debated topics.

Up until now we've only had media leaks to go on, plus rebuttals from the White House.
But on Thursday Mr Comey goes on the record before the Senate Intelligence Committee with his version of events.
His opening statement puts a sharper focus on discrepancies between his and the White House's accounts of their meetings.
What Comey statement says: "The President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."
What Trump says: He was asked in a Fox News interview on 12 May if he asked Mr Comey for loyalty, and responded: "No, I didn't, but I don't think it would be a bad question to ask. I think loyalty to the country, loyalty to the US, is important. You know, it depends on how you define loyalty, number one. Number two, I don't know how it got out there because I didn't ask that question."
What Comey's statement says: He alleges Mr Trump asked him to drop investigation into then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. "[Trump] said, 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"
What the White House says: Denies Mr Trump asked for the inquiry to be dropped, but the House committee asked the FBI for relevant memos.
What the Trump administration said: Mr Trump said he was told by the director "on three separate occasions" that he was not being investigated by the FBI.
What Comey's statement says: He backs the president's account: "I discussed with the FBI's leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him." Mr Comey says he repeated that assurance in two subsequent meetings.
What media leaks said: Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president.
What Comey's statement said: "I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me."
