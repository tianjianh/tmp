The mother-of-two, from Cardiff, joined tens of thousands of demonstrators in a protest against government cuts on Saturday.
Ms Church said she attended in "a show of solidarity" with other protesters.
A Treasury spokeswoman said it was continuing to cut the deficit, which was the best way to deliver economic security.
Ms Church, 29, has been a vocal critic of the Tories.
Families, students and campaigners from across the country took part in the march, which made its way from the financial district to parliament.
Among them were comedian Russell Brand and Ms Church, who carried an End Austerity Now placard.
Her mother Maria Cooper also joined the march wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the words 'Prosecco socialist' in retort to her daughter's critics.
Speaking at the march, Ms Church said: "I'm here today in a show of solidarity with everyone here, it is a massive turnout - everybody who thinks that austerity isn't the only way and thinks it is essentially unethical, unfair and unnecessary."
Asked if she was inspired by the surge of the Scottish National Party she said "absolutely".
"We are in one of the richest nations in the world and social inequality is unacceptable," Ms Church added.
"I'm immensely proud to be here. I think this is a brilliant movement and it is for the common good. We are here to make a stand."
It follows Ms Church's appearance at an anti-austerity rally in Cardiff in May.
The Treasury said: "Income inequality in the UK is lower than 2010 because the government's long term plan is helping working people, with two million more in work, unemployment falling and wages rising well above inflation.  The Government has taken millions out of income tax, and ensured that the richest 10% contribute the most to paying down the deficit.
"But the best way to help people across the UK is to deliver lasting economic security, which is why we're continuing to work through the plan to cut our deficit - still one of the highest in the developed world - to ensure a recovery for working people, especially in these times of international economic uncertainty."
