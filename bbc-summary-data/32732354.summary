Japanese carmakers Honda and Daihatsu are recalling some five million cars globally to replace potentially deadly airbag inflators made by Takata.

The latest recalls come just a day after rivals Toyota and Nissan said they would be recalling 6.5 million vehicles over the same issue.
So far, the six deaths linked to Takata airbags have all been in Honda cars.
In April, Honda cut its profit growth forecast after missing the mark last year on recalls and other issues.
Honda said that the models affected included the Fit subcompact and would not affect its cars sold in the US, where most of the deaths occurred.
It plans to use replacement parts supplied by Sweden's Autolive, Japan's Daicel and Takata in the recalled cars.
Daihatsu, meanwhile, said it would recall the Mira minicar.
Other than Honda, all other carmakers said the recalls were precautionary and no accidents or injuries had been reported.
But investigations did show that Takata airbag inflators were not properly sealed and could be damaged by moisture. It is alleged that the airbags can burst under pressure, spraying shrapnel inside the car.
The latest announcements bring the total number of cars recalled because of Takata's airbags to about 36 million since 2008.
The car equipment maker faces multiple class action lawsuits and criminal and regulatory investigations in North America.
Following the latest recall, Takata's shares were down 5.6% in Tokyo.
