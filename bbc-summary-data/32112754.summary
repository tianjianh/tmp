[SN]TITLE[SN]
University of Aberdeen to cut 150 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The University of Aberdeen is to cut about 150 jobs as part of efforts to save millions of pounds in the coming months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff will be offered voluntary redundancy and early retirement packages under the proposals.
The university currently employs about 3,000 people, with staff wages making up 60% of its costs.
It said the cutbacks would provide financial stability in a very challenging funding environment.
The move is aimed at saving Â£10.5m.
The university said it needed to tackle staff costs in order to maintain and grow its position in an increasingly competitive international market.
University and College Union (UCU) Scotland official Mary Senior said: "The news that the University of Aberdeen are looking to cut 150 jobs is deeply disappointing and this is a very worrying time.
"Cutting the very staff who make the university the world class institution it is can't be done without impacting on both the student experience and the university's reputation.
"UCU opposes these cuts and will be meeting with the university."
