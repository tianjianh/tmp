An academic who advised on films like The Mummy is among speakers to attend.
The aim is for scholars to share their research findings into "demons" featured in ancient Egyptian artefacts.
The Demon Things Conference 2016, which is open to the public, is hosted by the Egypt Centre and the Department of History and Classics.
Among the speakers is Wael Sherbiny, who rediscovered a 4,000-year-old artefact containing spells and depictions of gods in a leather manuscript from ancient Egypt, and Stuart Tyson Smith, a consultant for the Stargate, The Mummy and The Mummy Returns films.
A university spokesman said: "Scholars are being encouraged to present their findings in the hopes that the conference will provide a creative venue for spotting links and patterns.
"By converging different areas of research a fuller picture of these multi-faceted entities may emerge."
