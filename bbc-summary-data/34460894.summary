Call for watchdog to investigate MP Michelle Thomson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MP Michelle Thomson has been referred to the Commons standards watchdog over allegations regarding property deals being investigated by the police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC understands that the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen made a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the SNP member for Edinburgh West.
Ms Thomson has denied any wrongdoing or illegal activity.
She has resigned from the SNP whip in the House of Commons.
A police inquiry is being carried out into a solicitor who was struck off by the Law Society of Scotland over property deals carried out on Ms Thomson's behalf.
Mr Bridgen, who represents North West Leicestershire, has written to Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards at Westminster, asking for her to look into the matter.
He said the case raises "serious questions regarding the professional integrity required from a prominent public servant".
