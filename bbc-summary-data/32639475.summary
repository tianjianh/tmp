[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservatives have held on to Cardiff North which was Labour's top Welsh target seat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But Labour has gained Cardiff Central from the Liberal Democrats as Jo Stevens took 15,462 votes, almost 5,000 more than Jenny Willott.
Tory David Davies held Monmouth increasing his majority to almost 11,000 and Alun Cairns remains in the Vale of Glamorgan.
Elsewhere, UKIP came second in Merthyr to Labour who held.
Labour also held Bridgend, Rhondda, Blaenau Gwent, Cardiff West, Cardiff South & Penarth, Cynon Valley, Torfaen, Newport West, Newport East, Pontypridd, Ogmore and Merthyr Tydfil.
Going into the election, Cardiff North was the most marginal seat in Wales with 194.
New Cardiff North MP Craig Williams said: "[Cardiff North] was Labour's target number four and we've not just held it but we've got over a 1,500 majority," Mr Williams said.
"This is Wales, this is meant to be Labour's pasture but the Welsh Conservatives are really here and here to stay.
"This is a game-changer for the Conservative Party in Wales... let's see what we can do."
