[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joel Harrison, 22, and Gary Beddoes, 29, set fire to the tent while it was pitched on grass land near College Road, Doncaster, in August 2015.
Both men pleaded guilty to arson charges at Sheffield Crown Court.
Harrison, of York Road, Dunscroft, was jailed for three years and seven months and Beddoes of Kenneth Avenue, Stainforth, was jailed for six years.
'Horrific attack'
Two men previously charged in connection with the attack, Jason Vicarage and Ricky Andrewatha, were cleared after the prosecution offered no evidence.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Con Dello O'Horo said the two victims had been subjected to an "absolutely horrific attack".
"They were both left with extensive burns after being deliberately set on fire in what can only be described as a despicable act, which they are still coming to terms with over a year later.
"This was a complex investigation over a number of months and I am pleased that both Harrison and Beddoes are now behind bars for their crime."
