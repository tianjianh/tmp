Teachers frustrated by new jobs scheme aimed only at newly qualified staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 30 teachers have met Stormont MLAs to express their dissatisfaction with a scheme to replace 500 older staff with newly-qualified teachers.

The 'Investing in the Teaching Workforce' programme aims to replace teachers over 55 with those who have graduated within the past three years.
A number of experienced teachers in temporary posts are concerned they will not be eligible to apply for the jobs.
The education minister said he is still finalising details of the scheme.
A number of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly's education committee listened to the teachers' concerns.
Carmel McCauley has been teaching in temporary posts for 10 years, and said that has had an affect on many areas of her life.
"Things have been put on hold, whether it's having your children, where you're going to live," she said.
"All of those things are affected by day and day subbing, and the uncertainty of what your future holds."
"In the next two years, there are going to be huge decisions for my family on whether to actually move to somewhere like Australia. That's how big this is for me."
Teacher Fiona Page graduated 10 years ago, and brought her family with her to Stormont for the meeting.
"Not having a permanent job when you have four children is hard," she said.
"If you are a substitute teacher, you are more out of work than you are in work, and you're only getting days here and there."
"It's my dream to be a teacher, and I'm not asking for anyone to give me a job, but I just want the chance to go for the jobs."
Christopher Kerrigan and Catriona Concannon from the Equal Rights for All Teachers group also gave a presentation to MLAs during the meeting.
The final decision on how the scheme will operate rests with the Education Minister John O'Dowd, who said he was still considering a number of options.
"What I'm doing is creating new jobs and new employment opportunities," he said.
"When we look at the employment statistics, those teachers who have qualified most recently - within the last three to four years - find it most difficult to obtain permanent employment."
"All options are on the table, and I'm looking through them all to see if they fit the 'refreshing the teaching workforce' principle behind the scheme."
"I'm working within the parameters of a financial envelope given to me by the executive and the assembly, and I have to achieve the financial savings within that envelope."
The scheme is due to operate during the 2016/17 financial year.
