The details are contained in a planning application for what the firm describes as a 'flagship' store on Donegall Square in Belfast city centre.
The company plans to take a unit which is currently occupied by a home furnishing store.
The application states the firm has a "vision" to roll out up to 50 stores.
It currently has one branch in Northern Ireland in a service station on the M2.
The Belfast Telegraph first reported the firm's intention to open up to 50 stores last year.
