[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist who killed a Royal Navy veteran by pushing him to the ground during a dispute has been jailed for manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roy Galvin, 69, from Alverstoke, died from a fractured skull three days after he was attacked in Bury Road, Gosport.
Duncan Snellgrove, 28, flew into a rage when Mr Galvin's wife questioned his friend for cycling on the pavement, Portsmouth Crown Court heard.
Snellgrove was jailed for three years and four months.
Mr Galvin had been walking home from a local pub with wife Deborah, who was in a motorised wheelchair, on 25 September.
Snellgrove and his friend Lee Walker, who had a young boy on the handlebars, were cycling in the opposite direction and Mrs Galvin asked Mr Walker to go on to the road.
Mr Galvin then made a comment about the child being "too young" to be riding on the handlebars and the court heard Snellgrove "took exception" to this and began "fronting up to him".
Snellgrove, of Mandarin Way, Gosport, then pushed Mr Galvin to the ground.
Mr Galvin hit his head, suffering a "medically untreatable" brain injury.
Snellgrove then fled the scene and Mr Galvin died at Queen Alexandra Hospital three days later.
Sentencing, Judge Sarah Munro QC told Snellgrove: "Your actions have deprived a delightful couple of many happy years together."
The court heard Snellgrove has 17 previous convictions for 29 offences, several for violent attacks, dating back to when he was 14.
Mr Galvin served in the Royal Navy for 24 years as an aircraft engineer before retiring in 1987.
He gained medals for long service, conduct, and for serving in the Falklands War and South Arabia.
Mrs Galvin, his wife of 12 years, said she had been left traumatised by "the terror of the incident".
"I just can't seem to get it out of my head," she said.
"Roy was my total companion and we had a lot of fun sharing our lives together. He was incredibly intelligent and very, very, funny. He just loved life and was my best friend in the world."
