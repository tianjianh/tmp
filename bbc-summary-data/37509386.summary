A new chief constable for Dyfed-Powys Police is to be recommended by the force's Police and Crime Commissioner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dafydd Llywelyn will put forward Mark Collins, who is to meet the Police and Crime Panel on Friday before his potential appointment is confirmed.
Mr Collins is the current deputy chief constable of Bedfordshire Police.
The force said he was selected as the preferred candidate after a "rigorous" two-day assessment at the force's Carmarthen headquarters.
If confirmed, he will take over from Simon Prince, who announced his retirement after three years in the post.
The appointment panel was made up of Prof Alan Clarke, professor of criminology at Aberystwyth University, Rhian Jardine head of sustainable communities at Natural Resources Wales, Pembrokeshire council's chief executive Ian Westley and independent member Carolyn Dhanraj.
