Michael Martin, 25, of Blackley, Manchester, has not been seen for more than two weeks.
Greater Manchester Police are treating the investigation as a "non-body murder" and have offered a Â£10,000 reward for information.
The force has released CCTV showing Mr Martin at a petrol station on Bolton Road, Kearsley, on 7 August.
In an earlier appeal, officers said they believed Mr Martin may have been assaulted shortly before he was reported missing.
They have searched several properties across the city including a room at the Premier Inn in Higher Blackley, while his car was discovered in Vermere Avenue.
Det Supt Jon Chadwick said: "We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen Michael's car in the two days before it was recovered.
"We are investigating a number of possibilities and are not ruling out that he is still alive, but it is now over two weeks since he was last seen.
"Michael is vulnerable due to some mental health concerns and his family are understandably desperate to find out what has happened to him."
