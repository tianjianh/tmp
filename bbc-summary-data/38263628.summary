North Wales Police described it as a "cowardly attack" at the Costcutter shop in Station Road, Queensferry on Thursday night.
The 58-year-old store keeper suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries.
Police said two people are being questioned on suspicion of robbery and assault.
The force has also appealed for a witness thought to be in the shop at the time of the attack to come forward as he may be able to "provide key evidence".
Emergency services were called to the store at about 18:30 GMT.
"This was a serious and violent attack on a lone shop keeper resulting in him receiving serious injuries," said Det Ch Insp Neil Harrison.
