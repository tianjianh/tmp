Goals from Kyle Bennett, Michael Doyle and a Matt Pearson own goal gave Pompey a 3-1 win in the League two match - their third victory in four games.
Portsmouth have lost only one of their last seven matches and are six points behind third-placed Plymouth.
"The first half was probably the best performance we have had in relation to the magnitude of the game," said Cook.
"We absolutely dominated a team that have been excellent at home," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"We took a lot of criticism at Barnet away and we have taken that criticism properly - we have stood up like men."
Portsmouth, who are now fourth in the division, host Newport at Fratton Park on Saturday.
