Drivers are facing long delays as a Berkshire council races to finish roadworks ahead of Reading Festival.

Road resurfacing work in Gosbrook Road, Caversham, has been causing severe traffic problems.
The work, by Reading Borough Council, has led to residents complaining over the lack of information they received.
However, the council said it had done everything it could to update people and that some delays had been inevitable.
The work is due to be suspended later, ahead of Reading Festival-goers starting to arrive on Wednesday, before resuming on 27 August.
Sanjay Parbhoo, who lives just off Gosbrook Road, said he would have liked more warning about the delays.
He said: "It is strange that we didn't get a letter through the mail saying 'This is the time that the roads will be closed and these are the roads that are affected'."
But Councillor Tony Page, who is responsible for transport in the town, said people in the streets concerned had been informed and the work had been advertised on the council's website.
He said: "We must get rid of those dangerous sections of road surface and potholes.
"Everybody wants us to do that, and I am afraid there will always be some level of inconvenience. So we just have to ask people to recognise that it is all in a good cause."
