The bittern, a member of the heron family, was seen resting in the reeds at at Llandrindod Wells Lake.
Reeds were planted at the lake as part of a major regeneration scheme by Powys council.
"The presence of the bittern proves once again that the efforts made to restore the ecological balance of the lake are working," said Powys council cabinet member, Graham Brown.
"With such a rich ecology now developed, it is no wonder bird watchers are coming from across Britain to see what is on offer, which is also boosting local tourism."
The RSPB estimates there are only about 80 breeding pairs of bitterns in the UK, with 600 of the birds spending the winter in Britain.
The bird was spotted by members of the Radnor Bird Blog, with one exclaiming: "Couldn't believe it - had to pinch myself!"
