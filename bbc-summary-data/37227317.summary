Around three hectares of scrubland were alight on Tottenham Marshes in Lee Valley Park on Tuesday evening.
More than 60 firefighters brought the flames under control in two hours using grass beaters and water backpacks.
London Fire Brigade said grass fires could travel quickly and change direction. It warned people against attempting to put them out.
Station manager Gary Thompson, who was at the scene, said: "Grass fires cause a great deal of damage to open spaces, property and wildlife but the public can help us stop them from starting by making sure that their cigarettes and barbecues are extinguished properly and that glass bottles, which can concentrate the sun's rays onto dry grass, are disposed of carefully."
