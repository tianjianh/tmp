Dorset knob throwing contest gets new home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An annual knob throwing contest that attracts thousands of competitors is moving for its 10th anniversary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dorset event, which has been held in Cattistock since 2008, involves participants lobbing a locally made spherical biscuit as far as they can.
This year the contest, which also incorporates a food festival, will be held at Kingston Maurward College, Dorchester, on 30 April.
Organisers said the move was due to it having "outgrown the village".
The existing record holder, Dave Phillips, tossed his winning knob an astounding 29.4m (96ft) in 2012.
Other games at the festival, which was attended by about 7,500 people last year, include guess the weight of the big knob, knob archery, knob and spoon racing, pin the knob on the Cerne giant, and the knob eating cup.
Money raised by the event helps to support local groups including Maiden Newton Football Club and Cattistock Cricket Club.
