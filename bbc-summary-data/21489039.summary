Although formal identification has not yet taken place, the Met Police said it was confident the 19-year-old who died was Joseph Burke-Monerville.
The teenager from Islington was shot in Hindrey Road, Clapton, east London, at 20:20 GMT on Saturday. He died several hours later in hospital.
Police have made no arrests and have yet to establish a motive.
They said the two men were shot while sitting in a parked car. A third man, aged 19, was also in the vehicle however he was not injured.
Mr Burke-Monerville, who according to his Facebook page was studying forensic science at London Metropolitan University, had no links to gangs, Scotland Yard believe.
Officers are appealing for two suspects seen running from the area.
One is a black man while the other is light-skinned, possibly of Asian or Turkish appearance, said the force.
The men were seen making off on foot from Hindrey Road where they headed towards the Pembury Estate.
A spokesman said: "At this very early stage we must retain an open mind regarding the circumstances of the incident and any motive."
A resident, who did not wish to be named, said she heard three gunshots.
The woman, aged 70, said: "I heard the shots - one, two, three.
"I was on the phone to my son and he told me to not to dare look out the house.
"It's been a lot better around here recently. There hasn't been anything like this for many years."
Another resident, who has lived in the area for more than 20 years, said: "With this happening now, I don't think people will feel safe.
"There have been shootings here before but this is the first murder."
Mr Burke-Monerville had spoken on Facebook of his excitement about a planned holiday to Magaluf on the Spanish island of Majorca next week, which he said would be "a week 'off' stress".
He wrote that he had previously attended Aloysius' Roman Catholic College in Highgate, north London, and Wesley High School in Otukpo, Nassarawa, Nigeria.
Tributes poured into social networking sites as friends expressed their shock at the shooting.
Friend Timothy Timi-Kehinde Gbadeyan wrote on Facebook: "I always hear about gun crimes, never thought my brother will ever be a victim. RIP Joseph Burke-Monerville."
Michaela Georgiou Francis described the killing as "disgusting", adding that people like Joseph didn't "live that life".
"Such a wonderful loving young man," she added.
"He was gonna do amazing things. His smile will charm the angels. Neva forgotten.x"
Meanwhile, Antoinette Williams wrote on Twitter: "RIP Joseph Burke-Monerville, you will truly be missed, may your soul rest in perfect peace."
Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
