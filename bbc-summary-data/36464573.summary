The 28-year old scored 16 goals last season and captained Dover to the National League play-off semi-finals.
"He's the best player in the National League in a lot of people's eyes," Hartlepool boss Craig Hignett said.
"There were a few clubs in for him but we managed to convince him that this is the place for him."
Newcastle-born Deverdics began his career as a trainee at Newcastle United before moving on to play for Gateshead, Bedlington Terriers and Gretna amongst others, including spells in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.
Deverdics made 94 appearances for Dover after joining in May 2013.
"Every time we've seen him play, he's been excellent and so have all the reports we have had on him," continued ex-Middlesbrough assistant Hignett.
"He's got a great left foot, is very creative and he can make goals as well as score them."
