[SN]TITLE[SN]
Roma 1-1 Inter Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radja Nainggolan scored a late equaliser as Roma drew with Inter Milan at the Stadio Olimpico.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivan Perisic's left-footed shot had given Inter a 53rd-minute lead before Nainggolan poked home Edin Dzeko's miskick six minutes from time.
The result ended Roma's run of eight consecutive Serie A wins.
They are third in the table, though, which is Italy's final Champions League qualifying place, and five points clear of Inter in fourth.
