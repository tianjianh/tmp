The game, between BBC 5 live and Match of the Day, is being played in the snow and rain outside BBC MediaCityUK in Salford and ends on Saturday at 18:15.
Savage netted the first of 500 goals scored in the opening 24 hours.

Shearer is putting in a 09:15-21:15 stint on Friday after Savage played for 12 hours on Thursday.
After a gruelling 720 minutes of football, Savage said he "went all out early on" because he was "trying impress everyone."
"Well for the first three or four hours I was running around like I did when I was in the youth team, but then I remembered I'm over 40 and my legs started to hurt."
Shearer said "It was like rolling back the years with the old celebration, it was good to be back scoring goals again."
McFly's Danny Jones said he was "knackered" after enduring 11 hours on the snowy overnight stint in Salford, but added "the energy is amazing, everyone is playing football so well."
The game has seen current and former professionals like Joe Hart, Adnan Januzaj and Kevin Kilbane getting involved as well as celebs like hip-hop legend Fatman Scoop.
Man United's winger Januzaj was not impressed with persistent foul play by Scoop and sent him off.
"Did you see what the guy did to me?" Scoop protested, adding: "The guy puts a red card on me. I don't know what a red card is. Then everyone tells me to get off!"
About 1,000 people will play 30 minutes alongside the pundits.
The 57-hour duration of the epic encounter has been chosen since it is the equivalent of a Premier League club's entire season.
Since 2002, Sport Relief has raised more than Â£262m for disadvantaged people in the UK and overseas.
