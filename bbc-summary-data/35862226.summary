Details have been announced by Health Minister Simon Hamilton.
He said the helicopter and its crew of paramedics will land at the trauma department at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
The helicopter will bear the call sign Delta 7 in memory of the late Dr John Hinds, who campaigned for the service.
Dr Hinds's partner Dr Janet Acheson continued his campaigning work and was present at Monday's announcement.
A second base will be located at St Angelo Airport in County Fermanagh.
Chancellor George Osborne committed Â£4m to the service in his budget speech last week.
Mr Hamilton said that, in future, part of the cost of the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) could be met by charitable contributions.
