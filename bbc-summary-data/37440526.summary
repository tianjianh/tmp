The popular baking contest is moving to Channel 4 after the current series finishes.
Mary said: "What a privilege and honour it has been to be part of seven years of magic in a tent."
Her co-star Paul Hollywood has signed a deal to do three series of the show on Channel 4.
The presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins are also quitting the programme.
Mary added: "My decision to stay with the BBC is out of loyalty to them, as they have nurtured me, and the show."
