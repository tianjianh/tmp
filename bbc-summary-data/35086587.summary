Libya crisis: Rome talks hope to produce unity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks are under way in Italy in the hope of getting Libya's rival factions to establish a unity government and bring a halt to months of chaos.

The country has two rival governments - one in Tripoli, another in the east.
But there is growing concern that the Islamic State group (IS), with a stronghold in the city of Sirte, is profiting from the instability.
US Secretary of State John Kerry is among those at the talks pushing the rival groups to implement a UN plan.
Delegates from the two opposing administrations, which are backed by militia groups, agreed after months of talks at a meeting in Tunis on Friday on a date - 16 December - to sign an accord on the unity government.
However, it is unclear how much support in Libya they will have for doing so.
Neither of the opposing parliaments in Tripoli and the east has voted to adopt the plan, but it is believed it could be signed in Rome without a formal vote in Libya.
Tough task of leading Libya peace talks
Who wants what in Libya?
Libya is home to a wide range of rival militia groups, many of them Islamist, who have not taken part in negotiations.
The UN proposal envisages the establishment of a nine-member presidential council within 30 days alongside a parliament.
Mr Kerry is co-chairing the Rome talks with Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
They are joined by other Western representatives and officials from North Africa and the Middle East as well as the UN Libya envoy, Martin Kobler.
The threat from IS has galvanised support outside Libya for a solution.
"Mobilising international support to assist Libyan authorities to take decisive measures to combat, contain and eliminate this imminent danger is a must," Mr Kobler said on Friday.
Libya has been unstable since long-time ruler Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in 2011.
An Islamist militia took over much of Tripoli last year and the internationally recognised government was forced to flee to the east.
