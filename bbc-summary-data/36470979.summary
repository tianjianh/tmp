The Advertising Standards Authority is "urgently looking into" a complaint made over claims by TV presenter Noel Edmonds that an electromagnetic pulse machine "tackles cancer".

EMPpad was "a simple box that slows ageing, reduces pain... and tackles cancer," the entertainer tweeted.
In response to one cancer patient's comments, he suggested the disease was caused by "negative attitude".
EMPpad said it did not agree with his comments "in any way, shape or form".
The Deal Or No Deal presenter is a long-time fan of the EMPpad, a machine which aims to stimulate "cellular resonance" in the body with "low intensity and frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields".
Praising the machine, which he has previously called a "miracle pad", he tweeted: "A simple box that slows ageing, reduces pain, lifts depression and stress and tackles cancer. Yep tackles cancer!"
Other Twitter users responded to his tweet, including from @VaunEarl, whose Twitter biography states he has kidney cancer, lymph node metastases and psoriatic arthritis.
@VaunEarl tweeted: "I think Noel Edmonds should stick to what he's good at. Presenting quiz shows and beard trimming, rather than curing cancer."
Mr Edmonds responded by tweeting: "Scientific fact-disease is caused by negative energy. Is it possible your ill health is caused by your negative attitude? #explore".
The Advertising Standards Authority said it was aware of concerns about Edmonds' claims, and was "urgently looking into" a formal complaint.
EMPpad Limited said it does not pay Noel Edmonds to advertise the product.
Its directors published a statement which said: "The opinions of Mr Noel Edmonds are his alone and do not reflect in any way with the opinions of us at EMPpad.
"We had no discussion, input or prior knowledge of the content of Mr Edmonds' statement and we do not agree with it in any way, shape or form."
