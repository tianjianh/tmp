[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 1-1 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield striker Ched Evans marked his return to professional football with the equaliser in their League One opening day draw at Oxford United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old was sent to prison in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman, but had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April.
Welshman Evans is set for a retrial in October, having pleaded not guilty.
He had not played since April 2012, when he netted for Sheffield United against Leyton Orient.
Evans, who has always denied the charges against him, was released from prison in October 2014 after serving half of his five-year term.
The former Manchester City trainee came close to joining Oldham in January 2015, but the Latics withdrew their contract offer after threats were made to club staff.
The ex-Wales international agreed a one-year contract with the Spireites in June and scored in his first pre-season appearances against Ilkeston.
Evans' every touch at the Kassam Stadium was jeered by Oxford supporters, and the U's took the lead through a tap-in from Wes Thomas just after the half hour mark.
Evans missed two chances after the break but fired in from a 25-yard free-kick with 14 minutes remaining to clinch a point.
