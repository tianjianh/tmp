The 24-year-old former Arsenal player has been playing in Russia since September 2014 for FC Ufa.
He made eight appearances last season and was sent off twice.
One of his red cards came for he made an offensive gesture towards Spartak Moscow supporters after he believed he had been the victim of racist abuse.
Spartak did not receive any disciplinary action, while the player was given a two-game suspension.
In April 2016, his contract was ended by mutual consent.
Arsenal Tula won promotion back to the Russian Premier League and have three points from two matches.
