[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hilden Mill complex sold to St Francis Group developers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Hilden Mill complex near Lisburn, in County Antrim, has been sold to an English development company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mill has been unused for more than a decade and various regeneration plans have failed to get off the drawing board.
The 24-acre site has been bought by a company which is associated with the Warwickshire-based St Francis Group.
Earlier this year, the St Francis Group was part of a consortium which bought the Sirocco site in Belfast.
Hilden Mill was formerly home to the Barbour Thread factory which had occupied the site since 1823.
The previous owner was granted planning approval for a redevelopment scheme that involved up to 600 homes though that planning permission has since lapsed.
