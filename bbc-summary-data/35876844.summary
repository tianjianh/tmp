A centuries-old causeway that was smashed by storms in 2014 has been restored using the original granite setts.

The passage, which is submerged underwater at high tide, is the only land route between the Cornish island St Michael's Mount and the mainland.
Twelve families who live on the mount have relied on ferries to leave the island since the damage.
Builders have worked at low tide to salvage original stones from the sea.
Garry Earley, of Cornish Heritage Builders, said he remembered watching "the sea tearing up the causeway" in February 2014 and the following day he and his team started to collect the setts.
Island resident Mary St Levan said: "Obviously, we have the boats when the tide is in but without the causeway we would be really remote, whereas with the causeway, we have a life".
Thousands of visitors cross the path every day, a route originally used by pilgrims in the 12th Century who travelled to the Benedictine priory and church.
