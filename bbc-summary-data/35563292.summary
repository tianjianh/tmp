McGuinness, son of former United manager Wilf, has held the post since 2005, winning the FA Youth Cup in 2011.
The news comes after a 'root and branch' review of the club's academy, which is set to leave former player Nicky Butt in a prominent position.
On Thursday, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: "The academy continues to be at the heart of the club. Giving youth a chance is part of our DNA."
McGuiness, 48, has spent over a quarter of a century at United in a succession of youth coaching roles.
His 2011 group contained Paul Pogba and Ravel Morrison, while Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley are recent England internationals to have emerged under his guidance.
"It has been an honour and a privilege to follow in my father Wilf's footsteps and to serve Manchester United for a total of 28 years," he said.
"To have seen 86 Academy players develop to make their debut for the first team and 23 to become full internationals has been thoroughly rewarding."
