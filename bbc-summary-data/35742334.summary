An inquiry panel into the 2013 Hindu-Muslim riots in north India's Uttar Pradesh state has blamed intelligence and police failure for the violence.

The 700-page report also blames the press for "exaggerated reports that fuelled violence" in Muzaffarnagar.
However, it absolves the state government and other politicians for the riots which left 62 people dead.
The clashes began when three men were killed for protesting against the alleged harassment of a local woman.
Later, the circulation of a fake video showing two men being lynched led to more violence, which spread to neighbouring villages in the district.
Indian army soldiers were deployed to contain violence and curfew was imposed in several villages.
Thousands of people fled their homes and took shelter in relief camps after riots that were described as the worst in India in a decade.
The one-man inquiry panel - Justice Vishnu Sahai Commission - tabled the inquiry report in the Uttar Pradesh state assembly on Sunday.
The report also absolved some politicians who were accused of making provocative speeches during the clashes.
