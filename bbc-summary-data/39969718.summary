The 29-year-old scored six goals in 46 appearances in 2016-17 for Paul Cook's side, mostly playing at right-back.
Evans joined Pompey from Fleetwood in the summer of 2015, having previously played for Rotherham.
"I've told the manager that if he wants me to continue at right-back then I'm happy," Evans told the club website.
"As long as I'm in a Pompey shirt, I'm not bothered what position I play."
