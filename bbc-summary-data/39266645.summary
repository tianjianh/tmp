Officers were called to the tunnels underneath the bridges at the mouth of the River Ouseburn, early on Sunday, after a number of people at the event contacted them with safety concerns.
About 200 revellers had waded through water to access the area, where sound and lighting systems had been set up.
No arrests were made, and Northumbria Police said inquiries were ongoing.
It is believed the event was advertised on Facebook, and those who attended met at a local pub before being led into the underground venue.
On New Year's Eve police had to use cutting equipment to gain entry to an illegal rave inside a tower of the Tyne Bridge, after organisers barricaded themselves inside.
Speaking of the event at the weekend, Ch Insp Dave Pickett said: "This is a dangerous site for members of the public, never mind an appropriate party venue.
"It is not an area that is easy to access so if anyone needed the assistance of the emergency services then they would have been in severe trouble.
"We are very lucky that we are not talking about a more serious incident, particularly when you consider that many of those involved were under the influence of alcohol."
