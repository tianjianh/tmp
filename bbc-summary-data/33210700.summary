[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rector of Bemerton 'confident' church can be saved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Wiltshire vicar has said he remains "confident" that a church in his parish can be saved, despite needing to raise a further £40,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bemerton St John near Salisbury closed five years ago when the heating broke and there was no money to fix it.
Now the aim is to reopen it as a church and community building.
Rector of Bemerton, Simon Woodley, said £50,000 had been raised in the past fortnight but another £40,000-£50,000 was needed before the end of the month.
Rector Woodley said if the money cannot be found by the end of the month, it was likely the building would be "boarded up".
"Last week we had some really positive public meetings and people had some really good ideas," he continued.
"One of which was to launch a campaign to look for 40 individuals who might donate £1,000 each and really that would get us over this hurdle.
"I know times are tough and for lots of people don't have that kind of money.
"But in Wiltshire, generally there are also people who would love to see this church and community flourish, and there are loads of really generous people who would love to be able to help us."
Rector Woodley said that the proposed new facility - to be called St John's Place - had already received planning permission.
Some £280,000 has already been raised, which will cover more than 50% of the first phase of the project.
