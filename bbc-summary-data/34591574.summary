Art dealers beat Ai Weiwei to top of power list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth have beaten artist Ai Weiwei to be named the most powerful figures in the art world.

The Wirths topped ArtReview magazine's Power 100 list for "what they have done to change the model of selling and promoting art".
They are only the second art dealers to top the annual list in its 14-year history.
The first, Larry Gagosian, was number one in 2004 and 2010.  He appears this year at number six.
The list was topped last year by Tate boss Sir Nicholas Serota, who has dropped to number five.
The 16-member international jury placed Ai Weiwei at number two on the list.
The Chinese dissident artist, who was in London last month for the launch of a retrospective of his work at the Royal Academy, had topped the list in 2011.
Other artists on the list include Hito Steyerl (at number 18), Theaster Gates (38) and Rick Lowe (89).
The Wirths, the co-presidents of Hauser & Wirth, have galleries in Zurich, London and New York and, last year, opened Hauser & Wirth Somerset, near the town of Bruton, which describes itself as a "multi-purpose arts centre".
Next March, the Wirths are to open a new gallery space, led by museum curator Paul Schimmel, in Los Angeles.
"The Wirths' increased influence stems in part from what they have done to change the model of selling and promoting art," ArtReview said.
"As big art dealers are becoming ever better at selling art for high prices, and as collectors want to see themselves as more than just anonymous purchasers, the husband-and-wife-team understand that selling art objects isn't the whole story - the well-off want to be sold a lifestyle."
The ArtReview top 10 is:
ArtReview says this year's list reflects "the continuing internationalisation of contemporary art".
The top 100 features Cameroonian curator Koyo Kouoh at number 73 and Lebanese curator Christine Tohme re-entering the list at 74.
Hyun-Sook Lee, the founder of South Korean gallery Kukje, enters the list for the first time at 82.
The full list can be found on the ArtReview website.
