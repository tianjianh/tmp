£6m funding boost for National Botanic Garden of Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Botanic Garden of Wales is marking St David's Day with a £6m funding boost.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Investment from the National Lottery will help restore the Grade II listed Regency landscape in Llanarthney, Carmarthenshire back to its former glory.
Work will include the reinstatement of the interconnecting 18th century lakes, cascades, bridges and dams.
The project will see the recruitment of 300 new volunteers.
They will join the garden's existing team, while accredited training as part of the restoration work will create four new apprenticeships.
The investment is made up of £3.5m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £2.7m from other partners.
Huw Francis, director of The National Botanic Garden of Wales, said: "This funding will mean we no longer have to imagine what the estate might have looked like, because we can now recreate it for our modern day visitors to experience first-hand."
