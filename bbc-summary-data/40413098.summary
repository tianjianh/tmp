Essex v Middlesex: Rain prevents any play at Chelmsford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was frustration for Essex and Middlesex as rain prevented any action on day two, with play at Chelmsford abandoned at 18:55 BST.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Players came out onto the pitch before a proposed 16:25 BST start time, but further rain forced them straight off.
Division One leaders Essex are on top on 106-0, with Alastair Cook unbeaten on 64 as they look to surpass Middlesex's first-innings total of 246.
Wednesday will feature 104 overs to make up for time lost in the match.
