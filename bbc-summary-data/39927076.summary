Luke Cowan-Dickie cleared of speeding after postal mix-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An England rugby player who was miles away from his car when it was filmed speeding has been cleared.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Cowan-Dickie was training with his club Exeter Chiefs when his Mercedes was caught by a speed camera in August.
Cowan-Dickie, from Exminster, Devon, denied the speeding offence and a second count of failing to identify the driver of the car
He told Exeter Magistrates' Court a letter identifying his agent as the driver went missing in the post.

The court heard the front row forward's car was filmed doing 55mph in a 30mph zone at West Clyst, Devon.
Cowan-Dickie said his agent had borrowed the car for a few days and it was him behind the wheel when the offence took place.
He said he did reply to a letter from the Safety Camera Partnership and informed them his agent was driving his car.
But, the court heard, the organisation did not receive his reply and Cowan-Dickie said he then did not receive a reminder in November.
He said neighbours on his new-build estate had previously brought round post addressed to him but sent to the wrong number house, explaining "the name was right, the number was wrong".
His lawyer Richard Saynor said his client "is not hiding anything at all and [had] no reason to lie".
"Things go missing in the post," he said.
Magistrates cleared the player saying: "There are circumstances when the postal system falls down."
