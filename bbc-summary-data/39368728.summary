Collins, 19, scored three goals in 22 games in a loan spell with Notts County during the first half of the campaign.
Rovers have used part of the Â£30,000 raised through February's crowdfunding scheme to sign the young striker.
"We're really pleased to get another player in," Tranmere boss Micky Mellon told the club's official website.
Promotion-chasing Tranmere, who are third in the National League and five points off leaders Forest Green Rovers, last month asked fans to contribute to the 'Micky Mellon Budget Boost' to generate funds for new signings to boost their hopes of a return to the English Football League.
"We've worked really hard at a difficult time to recruit and we're pleased Wolves have trusted us with one of their talented young players," Mellon said.
Collins, a Wales Under-19 international, began his career with Newport County before joining Wolves in January 2016 where he has featured for the club's Under-23 team.
He is the second signing made by Tranmere in the last 24 hours following the arrival of Portuguese winger Erico Sousa.
