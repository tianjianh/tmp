[SN]TITLE[SN]
University of Reading plans to restore London Road properties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three early 19th Century buildings in Reading are to be converted into private homes, under plans published by the University of Reading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The listed properties on London Road were last used by the Witan International College 10 years ago.
The university, which owns the buildings, and a private developer plan to convert them into 53 apartments.
Christopher Reeve of the university said the buildings "create a sense of heritage" in the town.
If planning permission is granted by Reading Borough Council, restoration work will start in early 2016 and is expected to take approximately nine months.
