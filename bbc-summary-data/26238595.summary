Sochi 2014: Elise Christie makes quarter-finals of short track 1,000m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Elise Christie safely reached the quarter-finals of the short track women's 1,000m with an assured skate after a week of turmoil at Sochi.

Christie, 23, has suffered online abuse and twice been disqualified so far at the Winter Olympics, but the 1,000m is her favourite - and final - event.
The Scot stayed well clear of the pack then accelerated around the outside for the easiest of victories in her heat.
She will next race on Friday, when the 1,000m concludes.

Christie won 2013 world bronze over this distance and led the world rankings for much of the past two years.
She earned a surprise berth in the 500m final on Thursday only to be disqualified for causing a collision, then found herself penalised once more in her opening 1500m heat on Saturday, contriving to miss the black finish line by skating narrowly outside it while vying for position.
Britain's Jon Eley reached Friday's quarter-finals of the men's 500m with a strong skate to qualify in second place behind Russian favourite Viktor Ahn, punching the air and high-fiving his coach in delight on what is expected to be his Olympic swansong.
Team-mate Jack Whelbourne, who twisted his ankle in a freak incident with a rubber course marker last week, failed to progress from his heat.
