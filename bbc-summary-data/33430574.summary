The title was handed out by ACES Europe, a not-for-profit group based in Brussels. The initiative is supported by the European Commission.
ACES Europe said no additional money would be given for the honour, but the city council was able to apply for EU funding.
The aim of the title was to get more people playing sport, and ultimately tackling obesity, the council said.
ACES Europe vice president John Swanson said it was a "great award" and up to the city to decide what to do with it.
The title was won with the support of Stoke's two major football clubs - Stoke City and Port Vale - as well as other sporting bodies and its university, the council said.
The authority said it hoped the title would attract more visitors to Stoke.
A series of events is being planned for next year to celebrate the city being awarded the accolade.
Stoke is one of several European cities to be awarded the title, which is announced annually, alongside a Capital of Sport accolade, which has gone to Turin in Italy.
There is a maximum of one city in the UK awarded the title each year if it meets the required criteria.
Applicant cities are judged on their sporting facilities, residents' level of participation, the success of local teams and sporting events. It is the first time a British city has been awarded the title in three years.
Sport England said the title was "well-deserved". Mr Swanson said the decision to award the title to Stoke was "unanimous".
"We witnessed a great deal of passion and commitment to regenerate the city," he said.
The European Commission said it welcomed the ACES Europe award initiative and supported it with EU grants.
