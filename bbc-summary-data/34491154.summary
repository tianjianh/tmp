[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 1,700 lost their jobs when owner SSI went into liquidation on 2 October.
Some staff were kept on to maintain the site, including the coke ovens, which would allow production to restart if it was taken over.
It was feared fuel would run out, but it has been confirmed that additional supplies have now been purchased.
The official receiver also said it was continuing to talk with interested parties about the future use of the site.
