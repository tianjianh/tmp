Fisherman's Friends deaths: David Naylor acquitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been acquitted of two charges of manslaughter following the deaths of a shanty group singer and the band's promoter when a door fell on them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fisherman's Friends vocalist Trevor Grills, 54, and Paul McMullen, 44, died when the steel door collapsed at G Live in Guildford on 9 February 2013.
David Naylor, 57, director of Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd, was acquitted of manslaughter by gross negligence.
But the company was found guilty of a breach of health and safety laws.
Sentencing is due to take place on Friday at Guildford Crown Court.
Mr Grills, from Port Isaac, Cornwall, and Mr McMullen, from Disley in Cheshire, were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group.
They were unloading music equipment from their van when the door, designed and manufactured by Telford-based Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd, fell on them.
Mr McMullen, originally from Heanor in Derbyshire, died at the scene and Mr Grills in hospital a few days later.
On the opening day of the trial, the jury was told doors manufactured by Mr Naylor's company had failed before.
