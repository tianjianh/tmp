The former John Brown's shipyard in Clydebank closed 30 years ago and the majority of the site - known as Queens Quay - has been derelict for decades.
Councillors in West Dunbartonshire have now backed a revamp plan by site owners, Clydeside Regeneration Limited.
It is expected to take more than 10 years to develop the 23 hectare site.
West Dunbartonshire Provost Douglas McAllister said: "John Brown's shipyard built some of the world's most famous ships and now we are set to breathe new life into this key site.
"Bankies [people from Clydebank] have a strong affinity with the yard and I'm delighted that we will now be opening it up for the whole community to enjoy."
The development proposals submitted by Clydeside Regeneration Limited include plans for about 1,000 new homes, retail and leisure outlets, a care home and a health centre.
The centrepiece of the development will be the refurbished fitting-out basin of the old yard and the Titan Crane visitor attraction.
It also hoped that a district heating scheme will be created that would be powered by extracting energy from the river basin.
Councillors on West Dunbartonshire's planning committee unanimously agreed to grant planning permission in principle for the Queens Quay master plan.
Councillor Lawrence O'Neill, convener of planning, said: "This will be the most significant development in Clydebank for a generation and I'm delighted to see it moving to the next stage.
"We have an opportunity to make this an extremely unique place, which will bring benefits to the whole of Clydebank and attract more people to visit our great town."
The first phase of the development to get under way will see essential infrastructure works carried out, including repairs to quay walls and the creation of a new road layout.
Once this work is completed, the development of the care home and health centre will begin, with the housing, retail and leisure elements of the plan to follow.
The former John Brown Shipyard was bought by private firm Clydeside Regeneration in 2004.
The yard was founded in 1861 and built many world-famous ships including the Lusitania, HMS Hood, HMS Repulse, the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2.
