The ticket plus coach packages went on sale at 18:00 BST on Thursday and were all gone by 18:23.
That was the time organisers posted a tweet saying they had all been snapped up.
General tickets to the 2017 event - which runs from 21 to 25 June at Worthy Farm in Somerset - will be released at 09:00 on Sunday.
No acts have yet been announced, though Daft Punk and Kraftwerk have been tipped as potential headliners.
Thursday's ticket issue saw buyers purchase tickets priced Â£238 per person in conjunction with coach tickets from various UK locations.
Online traffic was reportedly so heavy that many would-be purchasers were unable to access the official festival website.
Last year, the 118,200 standard tickets were snapped up in half an hour.
