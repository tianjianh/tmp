The cause of his death remains unclear, but Ms Collins said she understood he had gone to sleep with a pain in his arm and had not woken up.
She said: "I'm very privileged to have called him a friend. There were a gang of the young ones who grew up on the set of Brookside, we called ourselves the Brooki Brat Pack and have an incredible bond.
"We were together nearly every day on set and we socialised out of work together, we became family."
She added: "It has shocked us all to the core. Kris was full of life, full of smiles and so full of music."
Former Hollyoaks actor Gemma Atkinson tweeted: "Just awful. What a lovely, lovely man! Had many laughs with him at work back in the day. RIP."
A spokesman for Lime Pictures said: "Many crew worked with Kristian on both Brookside and Hollyoaks and enjoyed following his musical success after leaving the show.
"The news has been met with shock and sadness on set and our thoughts are with his family at this time."
