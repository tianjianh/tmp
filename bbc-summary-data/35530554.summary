Tony Jules, 63, of Sundon Park, Luton, died on Sunday from prostate cancer at Keech Hospice Care in Luton.
His wife Denise, 60, said her husband was "overwhelmed by how total strangers took his story to their hearts" in his bid to raise funds.
The hospice paid tribute to Mr Jules' "courage" and "strength".
Mrs Jules said it was a sad time for the family, including his sons Taj, 40, and Jonathan, 18, and his mother, Veronica, 84.
"My heartfelt thanks go to all the nurses and staff at Keech for their fantastic care and support throughout Tony's final journey."
Liz Searle, chief executive at Keech, said: "Tony chose to use his final weeks to raise awareness of Keech Hospice Care and to help us to raise much needed funds. Tony and his work will always be remembered by us here at Keech."
Mr Jules started his fundraising mission in August 2015 and it has raised more than £44,500.
