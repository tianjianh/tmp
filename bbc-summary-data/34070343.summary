Everton manager Roberto Martinez says the club will turn down defender John Stones's transfer request.

The England international, 21, asked to leave on Tuesday after the Toffees refused offers of £20m, £26m and £30m from Premier League champions Chelsea.
However, the Blues will reportedly return with a £40m bid before the transfer window closes on Monday.
"Sometimes money can't buy everything and that is going to be a very strong statement at Everton," said Martinez.
"This is not a moment when we can use any money to get us stronger."
Stones played the full 120 minutes of Everton's 5-3 extra-time victory over Barnsley in the League Cup second round on Wednesday.
"John, for a young man under massive pressure, was terrific," added Martinez.

The Spaniard has been angered by Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho's public pursuit of Stones and says he trusts Everton chairman Bill Kenwright to stand firm and retain the centre-back.
"We have a chairman who will do the right thing for the club and for the team and, as a true Evertonian, we are clear he will not be easily influenced in taking the money and accepting things which will clearly make our team weaker," he said.
"The situation with John is very clear. We care about him, we will protect him and make sure we give him everything we can to allow him to enjoy his football."
Stones, who arrived from Barnsley for £3m in February 2013, has four years left on his contract after signing an extension in August 2014.
