No individual GB female athlete has won gold in three successive Games but Jones, Laura Trott and Charlotte Dujardin might achieve that in 2020.
Reigning boxing champion Nicola Adams could join the list if she wins her flyweight final in Rio on Saturday.
"I will definitely go for it again," said double Olympic champion Jones.
Her coach Paul Green says the world number one could become Britain's greatest taekwondo athlete ever as the 23-year-old from the north Wales town of Flint looks for a third Olympic crown at the 2020 Games in Tokyo.
Cyclist Trott and dressage rider Dujardin could also look to make British Olympic history in Japan but Jones has already spelt out her desire to add to her London 2012 and Rio 2016 wins.
"I am only 23-years old and I love taekwondo, I love to fight," she said.
Jones retained her Olympic taekwondo title - winning GB's 22nd gold of the 2016 Games by winning a thrilling final 16-7 to defeat Spain's Eva Calvo Gomez in the -57kg category.
Two head kicks in the third round sealed victory for Jones - who has now won both GB's taekwondo golds since its introduction as a medal sport in 2000.

Her success means Welsh athletes have now contributed 10 medals, including four golds, at the Rio Games.
Sailor Hannah Mills and cyclists Owain Doull and Elinor Barker have also won gold in what has been a record medal haul for Wales.
"Yeah, it feels different this time, but I still can't believe I won in London to be honest," admitted Jones.
"I knew I was good enough to come here and win and I would have been disappointed with anything less, but in taekwondo anything can happen and until you have that medal around your neck nothing is certain.
"I know I am better and have the talent to beat all these girls, but mentally you have to be right on it, every move is crucial, you cannot make a mistake.
"Winning again was another amazing moment, I've trained so hard and there was so much pressure. But all the training and hard work was worthwhile.
