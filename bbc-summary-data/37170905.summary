[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second-placed Yorkshire boosted their hopes of a third successive title by skittling Notts for 94 at Scarborough.

Ryan Sidebottom, Tim Bresnan and Jack Brooks took three wickets each to earn their side a 188-run lead.
Acting captain Gary Ballance declined to enforce the follow-on and openers Adam Lyth (41) and Alex Lees (30) extended the lead with a 72-run stand.
Ballance then helped himself to an unbeaten 75 as Yorkshire reached the close on 200-4, 388 runs ahead.
Bottom-of-the-table Nottinghamshire's batting performance earlier in the day did not augur well for their chances of avoiding relegation.
Resuming on 38-2, they were rocked by an inspired opening spell from Sidebottom, who had Michael Lumb caught behind, trapped Steven Mullaney (25) lbw and Samit Patel taken at first slip.
Brendan Taylor hung on for an hour and a quarter for 14 - making him the third and last Notts batsman to reach double figures - but was then bowled by Steven Patterson.
Lees gave Yorkshire's second innings an early flourish with four successive boundaries off Mullaney and although the home side got rid of both openers and Jake Lehmann (35), England batsman Ballance ensured they will face a tough final two days with 12 boundaries so far.
