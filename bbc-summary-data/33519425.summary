North Belfast violence: Reaction from politicians and key figures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trouble flared in north Belfast on Monday night where the Orange Order was not allowed to complete its return from an annual Twelfth of July parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The march was barred from proceeding along a stretch of road that separates unionist and nationalist communities.
Within minutes of the parade reaching police lines, empty bottles, bricks and metal bolts were thrown at police.
Politicians and other key figures gave their reaction in the aftermath of the violence.
"[The] violence and attacks in north Belfast on PSNI officers as they go about their duty trying to keep the peace is wrong and cannot be justified regardless of the frustrations or the cause.
"It is vital that those involved in such riotous activity cease and are held accountable. They do a massive disservice to the wider cause they claim to support.
"Orangemen and supporters were attacked whilst returning from Twelfth demonstrations this evening, and such attacks again demonstrate the intolerance of those who are not prepared to respect and build understanding of cultural diversity."
"The loyalists responsible for [the] riot in [north] Belfast must be condemned. Leadership required from unionist political leaders.
"I unreservedly condemn those responsible for the attack on the bus in Greysteel and the Verbal Arts Centre, and other incidents in Derry."
"I condemn these disgraceful attacks on the police. Those responsible do nothing to further the cause they claim to promote.
"They damage Northern Ireland and wreck a day which should be about respectful celebration of cultural tradition."
"Attacks on police officers are totally wrong, however outrageous the Parades Commission continues to behave.
"Over the years, the Parades Commission has caved in to republican violence and threats of violence. This has created a severe problem in relation to community relations and respect for law and order.
"The way forward is to recognise the failures of the past cannot be repeated and a new way forward for parading and protesting is badly needed. Secretary of State take note."
"What the residents have said on an ongoing basis is that they are up for dialogue. We've worked out many, many problems, but it all began with dialogue.
"In terms of the Parades Commission, there needs to be an independent body. While I have often disagreed with their decisions, I think it's the only way to deal with this issue until it can be dealt with between those who decide to march through these areas and the people who live there."
"We cannot continue to open wounds every summer and hope that the body politic and society in general in Northern Ireland and north Belfast will just continue on as usual.
"We need to reflect very carefully and we need to resolve this situation in Ardoyne and we need to do that urgently."
"There is disappointment in north Belfast once again that the three Ligoniel lodges and the band were not able to return home to their starting point.
"Ten or more years of republican violence at Ardoyne on the Crumlin Road was rewarded by the Parades Commission. I would have to say if it's wrong to engage in violence, it's wrong to reward violence."
"Those involved in violence should desist. It is not only counterproductive but also plain wrong.
"Such actions are only strengthening the hand of those who wish to further curtail our parades."
"Once again, officers demonstrated their patience and professionalism even though their lines were under attack.
"The scenes we witnessed were deplorable and shameful.
"The behaviour of those who viciously targeted police lines was mindless and unacceptable."
"We had hoped that the scenes of violence witnessed were a thing of the past, but clearly there is a minority who do not want Northern Ireland to move on.
"They have disregarded all those in the community who have worked hard to ease tensions, and must be brought to justice."
"The scenes in north Belfast are a serious step backwards for stability in Northern Ireland.
"The small minority determined to return to the bad old days must not be allowed to prosper.
"[The] events underline the importance of marginalising the extremists and pressing ahead with implementation of the [Stormont House Agreement]."
