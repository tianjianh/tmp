Britain's men kept alive their hopes of winning a first-ever Champions Trophy title by salvaging a 1-1 draw against Germany at London's Olympic Park.

GB trailed through a Tobias Hauke rebound effort in the second quarter and were indebted to keeper George Pinner for keeping the score close.
Ashley Jackson fired home a penalty corner in the final quarter.
"It's a bit frustrating as we had enough chances to win the game," Jackson told BBC Sport.
"That said, George [Pinner] pulled off four top saves and Barry [Middleton] stopped two on the line, so it could have been 4-1 to them, or 4-1 to us."
Britain need to beat Belgium in the final pool match on Thursday and hope leaders Australia do not lose to India if they are to finish in the top two and reach Friday's gold medal final.
Any other combination of results would see Britain finish outside the top two, but a top-four ranking would still give them a chance of claiming a bronze medal in Friday's third-place play-off.
Following a draw against world number one side Australia on Friday and a disappointing loss to India the following day, GB reignited their Champions Trophy challenge with an impressive 4-1 defeat of South Korea on Monday.

They began brightly against Olympic champions Germany, whose defender Martin Haner denied GB an opener with a last-gasp clearance in the opening quarter.
However, the Germans dominated much of the attacking play from then on, with man-of-the-match Pinner producing a series of stunning saves to keep GB in contention.
"It was a pleasing performance personally, it's just a bit frustrating that the one [goal] bounced back to them and they scored," Pinner told BBC Sport.
"We need Australia to do us a bit of a favour against India tomorrow, but it's also down to us with a big game against Belgium and that's something we're looking forward to."
In the day's other fixtures Australia claimed their third win in a row with a 2-0 defeat of Belgium, while India beat South Korea 2-1.
