The singer's 'Wonderful Crazy Night' show will be the first music concert at the city's Meadowbank Stadium since 2007.
At least 18,500 tickets will go on sale on Friday for the show on Saturday 25 June. The Foo Fighters, Kaiser Chiefs and Prince have played at Meadowbank.
He is also playing in Exeter, Henley, Leicester, Lincoln, Liverpool and Oxford next summer.
Sir Elton said: "The simple truth is I want to spend more time with my family, and I am only too aware of just how precious the time ahead is.
"My sons are growing up so quickly; their early years are just flying by and I want to be there with them.
"So these concerts will give me the chance to thank the Scottish audiences who have been so faithful to me over these many decades.
"We cannot get to everyone, but I am going to try. Edinburgh has always been a very special place for me to play.
"I did my first ever truly solo show at the Playhouse back in 1976, and it also just happens to be where my guitarist and Music Director Davey Johnstone is from, so it's a very special city for me and the band."
David Milne, chairman of Edinburgh Leisure said: "Meadowbank Stadium has a rich history hosting a myriad of sporting events over the years including the 1970s and '86 Commonwealth Games and the 2012 Paralympic Torch Relay and also various music greats including the Foo Fighters, Kaiser Chiefs and Prince.
"It's an honour that Sir Elton John has chosen Meadowbank as the Scottish location for his 2016 tour and a rare opportunity for his Scottish fans to catch this legendary musician in such an iconic venue."
Richard Lewis, Edinburgh city council's convener of culture and sport, said: "We are absolutely delighted that Sir Elton John has chosen Meadowbank Stadium to host this concert.
"It's a real coup for both Meadowbank and Edinburgh to have one of the world's greatest music stars come to Scotland's capital city.
"I'm sure his legion of fans and the Edinburgh public will all agree this concert is the perfect way to kick start the festival scene and will really get the summer party in the Capital started."
