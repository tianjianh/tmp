Labour's Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint says she is confident the party can "move forward" plans for a £1bn tidal lagoon in Swansea.

Visiting the site of the scheme, while election campaigning in the area, she pledged "cleaner energy" businesses "have a friend in Labour".
Last month, UK ministers announced the start of talks on the level of subsidy the £1bn scheme would receive.
The project is promising to generate power for 120,000 homes over 120 years.
Ms Flint said she was "really, really" confident "we can move forward on this project", describing the scheme as exciting.
The lagoon has received backing, in principle, from across the political spectrum.
In other election news, Plaid Cymru is campaigning in Carmarthenshire on better rural broadband and mobile phone coverage.
The Conservatives have called for a freeze on council tax, while the Liberal Democrats announced plans to boost rural Wales by improving broadband, transport, housing, agriculture and tourism.
Later, former miners' leader Arthur Scargill will call for an end to capitalism, when he launches the Socialist Labour Party's manifesto in Port Talbot.
