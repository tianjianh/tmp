Ibrox is the third station to be upgraded as part of a £288m programme to modernise the city's ageing subway system.
Hillhead and Partick have already been modernised by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT).
The newly-refurbished Ibrox station was launched by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Ibrox, which is the first station south of the city to be modernised, has been fitted with "smart" gates and ticket machines and an improved CCTV system.
Its ticket office has also been rebuilt and located.
SPT chairman Jim Coleman said: "The subway is part of the fabric of Glasgow life.
"We are committed to ensuring we deliver the best service possible for the way people live their lives now and in the future.
"Ibrox station not only looks great, it also shows we are well on track to deliver a fully revamped and technologically advanced network.
"Through introducing smart technology we are at the forefront of developments in fully-flexible ticketing solutions in Scotland - almost 20,000 smart customers are already benefiting from more convenience, faster journeys and increased security."
The modernisation work was carried out by Graham Construction.
SPT expects to complete the majority of work on the subway system by 2020.
Work on St Enoch station is due to start next month and detailed designs for Govan and Buchanan Street stations are also under way.
About 13 million passenger journeys a year are made on the Glasgow subway system.
