Royal Ascot: Racegoers remove jackets due to 'very hot' weather

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Royal Ascot has not enforced its dress code, letting racegoers remove jackets for the first time in the event's history, due to 'very hot conditions'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Normally men attending the horse racing event in the Royal Enclosure must wear black or grey morning dress with a waistcoat, tie and a top hat.
Women in the Royal Enclosure must not expose their shoulders.
Nick Smith of Ascot Racecourse said the jackets rule had not been enforced after entry due to the hot weather.
He said: "We took the decision early in the day, in the light of the hot weather, not to enforce the jackets rule after entry - common sense was applied."
The dress code at Ascot Racecourse's Royal Enclosure involves a number of restrictions for men and women.
Dresses must not be strapless, off the shoulder, halter-neck, spaghetti straps and or have straps narrower than 1in (2.5cm) in the exclusive area.
This year women were permitted to wear jumpsuits for the first time, as long as they reached to the ankle.
