Monmouthshire town hopes for clean boots trade boost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traders concerned that walkers were reluctant to visit a town's pubs and shops in muddy gear hope a boot cleaning machine will help boost business.

They feared Monmouth was missing out on trade from the hundreds of walkers who travel to the area to explore the Wye Valley.
The Monmouth Walkers Are Welcome group was set up to address the problem.
It raised money for a boot cleaner for a pub and and is aiming to buy more.
Chairman Brian Ramsey said he hoped walkers would now be "more confident" about spending time locally.
The Offa's Dyke Path, which runs from Chepstow to Prestatyn, Wye Valley Walk and Monnow Valley Walk all pass through Monmouth.
