Police Scotland said they were Leia McCorrisken, aged three, and her two-year-old brother Seth.
The bodies of the children were recovered from Loch nan Druimnean, north of the village of Kilmelford, after the crash.
A 36-year-old woman was taken to hospital following the accident.
She was taken to hospital in Oban as a precaution and later released.
The three occupants of the car were said by police to have been from Argyll.
A coastguard helicopter and police dive teams had scoured the loch after the alarm was raised at about 16:00 on Wednesday.
The car was recovered from the loch at about 05:00 on Thursday and removed from the scene. The stretch of road involved has also been reopened.
The crash happened on the A816 Oban to Lochgilphead road, about 17 miles from Oban.
Conditions were said to have been very wet at the time, with surface water in many places on the road.
Argyll and Bute MSP Mike Russell said communities in the local area, and across Scotland, will have been "numbed" by the news of the incident.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "You cannot imagine anything worse to happen to a family."
Mr Russell added: "The road is not a good road and the reaction of people I have spoken has been that it is a difficult road to drive at the best of times.
"There was very bad weather yesterday. There was a lot of rain and low cloud.
"I think it is understandable in terms of the location and weather it would have been a dangerous situation."
