It didn't take long for him to dive into his celebrations, popping into an ice bath with the Wimbledon trophy.
Andy's mum Judy was also close by to join in with the triumph.
Not all Murray's family were able to witness his big day first hand - his grandfather Roy missed the Wimbledon final to look after his dog.
The morning after, twice Wimbledon champ Murray revealed on a Facebook Live that there had been some good celebrations and he now can't wait to go to Rio for the Olympics.
Meanwhile, all the jubilation brought to mind some of Andy Murray's other high times on social media.
