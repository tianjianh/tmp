The 83-year-old Nobel peace laureate has been in and out of hospital in recent months.
He was previously treated for an infection resulting from his prostate cancer treatment.
Archbishop Tutu retired from public life in 2011 but continues to travel.
The statement said Mr Tutu has expressed his thanks to staff at the Cape Town hospital.
"The love, prayers and good wishes expressed by people around the world had been just as important as the medical attention in aiding the arch's [Tutu's] recovery," his daughter Rev Canon Mpho Tutu said.
Mr Tutu was readmitted on 20 August two weeks after being discharged.
The first black archbishop of Cape Town played a vocal role opposing white-minority rule in South Africa.
