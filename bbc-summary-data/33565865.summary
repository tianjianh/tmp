Police said two men, aged 31 and 33, were victims of a serious assault on Renfield Street, in central Glasgow, at 03:15 on 19 October last year.
The group of men which attacked them later boarded a taxi near Buchanan Street Bus Station.
Police said they wanted to trace all six men pictured in the CCTV images.
Det Con David Copeland, of Police Scotland, said: "This was an unprovoked attack on two men by a much larger group which left the victims with serious injuries.
"This type of activity on what seems to be a night out cannot be tolerated. We seek the assistance of the public in tracking down those responsible."
The men in the images are described as white, Scottish, in their late 20s or early 30s, of medium build, with one being of heavy build.
Four men wore dark tops and jeans, one was wearing a yellow coloured t-shirt and another wore a white cardigan with dark sleeves. The other man was wearing a light coloured t-shirt.
Det Con Copeland added: "One of the men wearing dark clothing was also wearing a green Robin Hood-type hat with a red feather at the left hand side.
"Another male was wearing a Heidi-type blonde wig with plaits on either side.
"I am particularly keen to trace the taxi driver who picked up a group of men from a taxi rank at Buchanan Street Bus Station at 0346 hours."
Anyone with information is asked to contact police.
