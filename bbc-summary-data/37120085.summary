Alberto Moreno: Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp backs under-fire full-back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists he will not be swayed by recent criticism of Reds left-back Alberto Moreno.

The 24-year-old Spain player conceded a penalty in last week's win at Arsenal and BBC pundit Garth Crooks claimed Liverpool would be relegated if he remained in the team.
"Alberto could have done better but I don't really understand what we are talking about," Klopp said.
"I cannot be interested in criticism from other people."
Moreno's tackle on Theo Walcott for the penalty at the Emirates was described on TV by former England coach Gary Neville as "absolute garbage".
Klopp said of the Spanish defender, a Â£12m signing from Sevilla two years ago: "Are we doing this every time someone's performance isn't very good then we talk about it in a press conference?
"He played, so there was a reason for it - that is what I think about and not what other people want me to think."
Moreno remains the only specialist left-back at the club after summer target Ben Chilwell opted to sign a new contract with Premier League champions Leicester.
However, Klopp says he is not concerned by the position, claiming: "We are not blind and we have other options. Milly [James Milner] can play it really good, we saw that in the Barcelona game.
"I had a talk to him as I didn't want to force a new position on an experienced player.
"Nathaniel Clyne played it, Trent Alexander plays right full-back so we have options and on a very defensive day Ragnar Klavan can play there.
"It is possible to take another [player on a transfer] but only if it is the guy we want."
Meanwhile, the German was optimistic the shoulder injury sustained by recent signing Sadio Mane in training would not sideline the former Southampton forward for too long.
"It was a challenge with two players up in the air coming down and Sadio fell on his shoulder but it is not that serious," Klopp explained
"At this moment I have no idea if he could be available for the weekend [at Burnley] but I don't think it will take a long time.
"At the first moment it was not too good but I think it is all OK."
