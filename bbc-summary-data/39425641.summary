Everton defender Seamus Coleman is expected to leave hospital on Wednesday, says Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill.

Coleman suffered a double break of his right leg during Friday's draw with Wales, and O'Neill said the injury had put a "dampener" on Tuesday's friendly with Iceland, who won 1-0 in Dublin.
"He's getting out tomorrow, I think," said O'Neill after the game on Tuesday.
"Seamus is doing much better. I went to see him again. He's in better spirits."
He added: "It's as much to do with he's still got the family around - his brother, his wife, his mother and the youngster all keeping him pretty busy."
The Republic captain fractured both the tibia and fibula in his leg when he was tackled by Wales defender Neil Taylor, who was sent off.
O'Neill said Coleman's "strong character" increased his chances of making a full recovery.
"If anybody is going to come roaring back from this injury, it will certainly be him," he added.
Coleman was not only the only Republic regular missing from Tuesday's friendly, as O'Neill fielded four debutants against the Euro 2016 quarter-finalists.
Brentford defender John Egan and Aston Villa midfielder Conor Hourihane both started, while O'Neill introduced Preston pair Daryl Horgan and Andy Boyle from the bench.
Egan's concession of a free-kick was punished as Bristol City full-back Hordur Magnusson curled in Iceland's winner in the 21st minute.
Despite that, O'Neill praised Egan and his fellow debutants.
"John Egan, I thought, did fine. He got a cut head after a couple of minutes - we bandaged him up - and Hourihane played for the first time," he said.
"Horgan's dribbled between players and he's put in a couple of really great balls. For the length of the time he was on the pitch, that was an excellent contribution."
