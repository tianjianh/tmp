Wales 'dominates' disposable income growth, study says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales has dominated growth in disposable income compared with England over five years, a report says.

The study found households in Powys have 15.4% more spending money than five years ago, while those in Flintshire, Wrexham and south west Wales have more than 14% more.
Investment from large manufacturers based in Wales including Toyota and Airbus was partly responsible, it said.
Areas with the slowest growth included Sheffield (5.8%) and Portsmouth (5.6%).
UHY Hacker Young, which produced the report using growth and income figures from the Office of National Statistics' household income report, said it showed the "hugely important role" played by manufacturing in Wales.
But last week Trussell Trust figures showed the use of food banks in Wales "remains at record levels" despite a slight drop.
It said 85,656 three-day food packages were given out in the 2015/16 financial year, compared to 85,875 the year before.
