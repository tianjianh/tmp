Police could smell the class B drug when they stopped a car being driven by Andrew Smith on the M6 near Carlisle.
They found 8.75kg of cannabis inside a sports bag in the boot, Carlisle Crown Court heard.
Smith was jailed along with his passenger Joseph Broadhurst, both from Liverpool, after they both admitted possession with intent to supply.
The court heard Smith, 28, was making a one-off trip north in October to pay off a drugs debt.
His task was to drive to a location chosen by Broadhurst, 50, who was said to have a more significant role in the enterprise.
Broadhurst, of Storrington Avenue, was jailed for 15 months while Smith, of Coral Avenue, was sentenced to nine months.
