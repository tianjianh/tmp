Glamorgan chief Hugh Morris wants to develop local talent

Hugh Morris says Glamorgan will be able to afford to recruit some experienced players for next season after several departures from the squad.

But the Glamorgan chief executive says the emphasis at the Welsh county will be on developing home-grown talent.
"The strategy is to identify and develop our local talent," Morris said.
"And, where we do have gaps, to make sure we bring in one or two players from outside the borders to fill in those gaps."
Glamorgan have lost batsmen Murray Goodwin and Gareth Rees, who are retiring from first-class cricket, while fellow batsmen Stewart Walters and Tom Lancefield have not had their contracts renewed.
Bowlers Mike Reed, John Glover and Huw Waters all previously announced they would be leaving the Swalec Stadium.
"We're down to a core squad of 14 players. That's very small, but what it does do is provide an opportunity to play some youngsters around some pillars of real experience that we have in the side," Morris said.
"In many regards I find that exciting."
"I was fortunate enough to play in a side that 75-80 per cent of the team had come through our own development programme.
"But there are going to be certain areas of our team that we're going to need to look to supplement the players we have... we have done that throughout the years."
As well as the possibility of signing a seasoned professional from another county, Morris confirmed there would also be space in the Glamorgan squad for talented overseas players.
South Africa opener Jacques Rudolph impressed this year for the Welsh county, as did Australian bowler Michael Hogan, while Glamorgan also brought in West Indies all-rounder Darren Sammy for part of their T20 Blast campaign.
"Jacques Rudolph, I'm delighted to say, has got another year left on his contract. Jacques has made a huge contribution, particularly in one-day cricket and in the dressing room, and he is exactly the type of person we'd want around young players," Morris added.
"But we will certainly be looking, as we did this year, at potentially bringing in a second T20 player."
