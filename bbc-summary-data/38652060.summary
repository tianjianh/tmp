The National Football Museum's exhibition will benefit from a new £4m Museums and Galleries Improvement fund.
Interim director Kevin Haygarth said the money would "piece together the lost history of women's football".
The collection includes World Cup shirts worn by players including Brazil forward Marta and the USA's Mia Hamm.
The largest part of the government's £4m cultural grant will go to Weald and Downland Museum in Singleton, West Sussex.
It will get £224,500 to fund a bakery and dairy showcasing heritage food production.
An ancient Egyptian gallery in Leicester and a Roman fort in Tyneside will also be among 39 projects to benefit.
The grants are funded by the Wolfson Foundation and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).
Minister for Digital and Culture, Matt Hancock, said the grants "will make an important contribution toward increasing access to their wonderful collections and improving the visitor experience at museums right across the country".
Paul Ramsbottom, chief executive of the Wolfson Foundation, said: "From Egyptian mummies in Leicester to a Roman fort on Tyneside, this is a gloriously diverse set of projects - but all demonstrate excellence and all will improve the visitor experience."
