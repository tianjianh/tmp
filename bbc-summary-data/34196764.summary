[SN]TITLE[SN]
Trade union bill is matter for Wales, says Carwyn Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for the biggest shake-up in trade union law for 30 years should be run past the Welsh assembly, the first minister has told the UK government.

Strikes in some public services will need the approval of 40% of a union's members to be legal under proposals from Conservative ministers.
Carwyn Jones has written to David Cameron raising objections, saying sectors like health were devolved.
The first minister branded the trade union bill as "socially divisive".
He wrote: "Significant elements of the Bill relate specifically to public services which in Wales are unambiguously devolved responsibilities.
"I therefore do not accept the suggestion that the Bill must be regarded as concerned exclusively with non-devolved issues.
"Policy on how to support, or 'protect', the delivery of devolved public services such as health, education and fire is ... for the Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales.
"This includes the way public sector bodies in such devolved services work with trade unions to ensure effective delivery of services to the public."
Responding, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the legislation was "about balancing the rights of trade unions with the rights of working people and businesses".
"They have a right to expect that essential services won't be disrupted at short notice by strikes supported by only a small proportion of union members," he added.
