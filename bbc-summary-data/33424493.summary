Reports say the Turkish Airlines flight, flying from Bangkok to Istanbul, made an emergency landing after crew spotted a message on a toilet mirror written in lipstick.
The message reportedly warned that there was a bomb in the cargo hold.
The plane landed safely at the Indira Gandhi International airport and all the 148 passengers were evacuated.
"There was a bomb threat to the Turkish Airlines flight and therefore they decided to land it in New Delhi," an official from the federal Central Industrial Security Forces told the Reuters news agency.
Local media have said that operations at the airport are operating normally, apart from the bay where the plane has been taken.
Investigations are continuing.
