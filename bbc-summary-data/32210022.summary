Election 2015: You tell us how politicians could win your trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It seems a lot of you don't trust politicians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whether it's failing to answer questions, breaking promises or just generally being rowdy, it appears politicians don't rank highly for you in the trust stakes.
Ahead of our debate in Leeds tonight you've been using the hashtag #ToWinMyTrust to tell us how you feel.
You can see what other people are saying by clicking here. Here's our round up of the rest.
Election 2015 latest: #Newsbeat in Leeds - the big trust debate as it happened
PMQs or Prime Minister's Questions has a poor reputation when it comes to politicians acting like "kids in a playground."
It's one half an hour a week in the House of Commons where MPs get to ask the prime minister a question. Usually very loudly.
A "disrespectful, unpassionate, football match," is how Keesha, 21 and from London, described it.
Anna and Keesha aren't alone.
Also on Twitter, Dafydd MacLennan (@daffydmac) says "#ToWinMyTrust politicians need to stop slagging each other off and concentrate on how THEY can create positive change."
Echoing this, Bethany Lila (@bethanylila) tweets: "#ToWinMyTrust stop putting down other parties to better yourselves, rely on the strength of your own policies, not the weakness of others."
Neil Underwood (@underwood_81) says they need to "stop bickering like children, answer questions directly".
Over 63,000 people have signed a petition to "make changes to PMQs to rebuild trust in politics".
Polling company YouGov say that people who like PMQs describe it as "humorous" and "interesting" whereas those who don't say it's "embarrassing" and "cringey".
People want them answered. Some tweeted saying politicians were dodging giving real answers.
Isabel Hardman (@isabelhardman), a journalist from political magazine The Spectator said: "Politicians not saying 'I've given you a very clear answer' when they haven't would be a start."
"Answer the question you were asked, instead of answering the question you wish you were asked" says Pete Clark.
Watch: That "answer the question!" from Newsbeat's debate in Leeds
When you're a politician, it seems saying you're being clear doesn't always come across well.
On Twitter Jamie (@jamie4england) says "never, ever begin a sentence with 'let me be clear' or 'well look, we're perfectly clear on this'".
"Be principled" - that's what Thomas Johnson (@thomasjohnstn1) says on Twitter.
Politicians should "demonstrate that they're acting in the interests of the people who elected them."
Also on Twitter, Dom Hewitson (@_frankzappa) says "#ToWinMyTrust I want equality whether you're from Chester le Street or Chelsea, we should all have the same opportunities".
They should "stop making promises you've no intention to keep" says Mark Everclear (@markeverclear) and "blaming circumstances after you're elected is a cop-out" says Phil Taylor (@pstni).
Some felt that it was one rule for politicians and another for them.
On Twitter, Martin Holland (@martinholland7) said it was "impossible" for politicians to win his trust.
Bert (@hawkkyaa) says politicians are "all the same breed" but Ellie Jones (@elliejones1993) says "we are all human so admit your mistakes and tell us honestly what your going to do about them!"
In Newsbeat's recent survey of young people, the NHS came out as the top priority. The cost of everyday items and controlling immigration came second and third.
"Care for the elderly should be free" says Sharon Kirkbride (@kirkbridesharon) and the "the current erosion of the justice system" should stop says Cameron Stocks (@cameronstocks_).
Ian Howell(@ianhowell88) says "funding for the NHS and social services need to be increased".
Other tweeters asked politicians to "lower the voting age" and provide more "help for first time buyers".
