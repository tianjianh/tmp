Laughing Dog 1950s Morris van 'slower than a greyhound'

A 1950s delivery van rebuilt with bodywork from a salvage yard was unveiled at Crufts - after its owner ignored calls to scrap it.

The Morris Commercial J-Type belonging to Lincolnshire-based Laughing Dog farm bakery went on show at the NEC.
Its 1,750-hour restoration was overseen by 27-year-old William Grant, who named the van after his grandfather Ted Grant OBE, who set up the company.
Its 40mph top speed - slower than some greyhounds - rules out long journeys.
"It's almost dangerously slow now and it will be owned by the factory and used as a promotional vehicle," said Mr Grant.
The restoration at Laughing Dog's site in Old Leake, near Boston, went ahead despite the front of the 1.5-litre J-Type - bought in 2013 - being badly rusted.
Mr Grant sourced a rear section from a scrapyard in Stoke-on-Trent and reproduced other panels using more than 20 sheets of mild steel.
The new panels were shaped by hand to produce parts indistinguishable from factory-made equivalents fashioned in 1951.
Asked how the van performs when driven, Mr Grant added: "It's very, very noisy. It's got a very high back axle ratio, so it accelerates quickly but has a top speed of about 40mph.
