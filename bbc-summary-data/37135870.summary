The International Olympic Committee (IOC) sanctioned the 26-year-old after her retested samples were found to contain banned anabolic steroids.
In recent days, Russia have also lost their women's 4x400m relay silver and women's 4x100m relay gold from 2008.
The IOC also annulled the results of two other Russian athletes.
Kolodko tested positive for anabolic steroid dehydrochlormethyltestosterone and growth hormone ipamorelin.
The IOC has asked the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to modify the 2012 result, with Chinese duo Li Ling and Gong Lijiao promoted to silver and bronze respectively.
On Friday, the IOC stripped Russia of their 4x400m silver from 2008 after Anastasiya Kapachinskaya's retested samples were found to contain banned anabolic steroids.
The IAAF was asked to modify the results, with Jamaica promoted to silver and Belarus to bronze.
The IOC also annulled the results of Alexander Pogorelov, who was fourth in the decathlon in Beijing, and Ivan Yushkov, who finished 10th in the shot put.
On Tuesday, Russia lost their 4x100m women's relay gold from 2008 following a ban for Yuliya Chermoshanskaya.
The IOC carried out more than 4,500 drugs tests at the 2008 Olympics but only nine athletes tested positive.
It has since retested more than 450 samples, using new methods to uncover banned substances which would have gone undetected at the time.
The IOC has also carried out about 250 retests on samples from London 2012.
Russian track and field athletes were banned from competing at Rio 2016 by the IAAF after widespread doping was uncovered in the country.
