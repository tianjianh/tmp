[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bayer 04 Leverkusen 5-0 B M'gladbach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez scored a hat-trick as Bayer Leverkusen thrashed Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hernandez, 27, struck three times in the second half to take his tally to 17 goals since he moved to Germany from United for £7.3m in August.
Stefan Kiessling scored the other two goals as Leverkusen won for the only the second time in nine games.
Borussia would have gone back up to third in the table with a win.
But the side that went out of Europe with a 4-2 defeat by Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday lost their first league game since September and first under coach Andre Schubert.
Germany international Kiessling, 31, headed Leverkusen in front before half-time then set up Hernandez to slot in his first goal 18 minutes into the second half.
Kiessling added the next with another header and Hernandez then completed his hat-trick with two goals in as many minutes.
The Mexico international converted another pass from Kiessling with a low finish past Yann Sommer before Karim Bellarabi played him in to add his 10th league goal of the season as Leverkusen moved up to sixth place.
