The 36-year-old batter helped the team to a domestic double in 2016, and won a total of 10 trophies with the county.
Kent chief executive Jamie Clifford described Edwards as "the cornerstone of the game" for women and girls.
"Her playing record is of course extraordinary, but it will be captaincy - leading Kent to so much success - that will never be forgotten," he said.
Huntingdon-born Edwards retired from international cricket in May, having captained England in over 200 internationals.
She joined Kent in 2000 from East Anglia Women and led the Canterbury-based club to seven women's County Championship titles and five second-placed finishes.
Edwards, made a CBE in 2014, scored 6,164 runs at an average of 61.64 for the county, and took 124 wickets at an average of 17.51.
Edwards, who has played in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) in Australia and captained the Southern Vipers to the inaugural Women's Super League title this summer, said winning the double was a "fitting end" to her time with Kent.
"I'm immensely proud to have played for the county and what the team has achieved within that time," she said.
"It's been a really tough decision to leave Kent but ultimately I feel it's the right decision for me and more importantly the current team."
Edwards has agreed a deal to play for Adelaide Strikers in the WBBL this winter.
