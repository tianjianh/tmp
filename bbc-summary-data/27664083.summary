Chesneau accepted the £10,000 top prize from Shepherd at an event in London on Monday night.
The artist's winning work illustrates his trademark style of using recycled metals for his pieces.
"Who couldn't love it? It stopped me in my tracks and I keep going back to see more," said head judge Mark Carwardine.
The runner-up was Singapore-based Choon Chew's Aiming, for which the artist won £1,000.  The drawing was also the winner of the wildlife in action category.
The annual Wildlife Artist of the Year competition has become a major event in the art world calendar, attracting participants from around the world.
Overall, there are eight competition categories besides the top award. Category winners each receive £500.
This year, 150 works were shortlisted from more than 1,000 entrants and they will be exhibited at London's Mall Galleries from 2-7 June.
"The extraordinary talent and creativity of all the artists involved never ceases to amaze me," said Shepherd - who set up the competition in 2007 to raise funds and awareness for endangered animals.
"And what is so utterly brilliant is that all these talented artists share my passion - to give something back to the animals that inspire our work."
Since it began, Wildlife Artist of the Year has raised more than £100,000 for conservation projects supported by the charity.
The week of wildlife art at the Mall Galleries, London runs from 2-7 June 2014.
