Charlie Dunn, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was pulled from the Blue Lagoon at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on Saturday afternoon.
Step-grandmother Sharon Robinson said he was a "funny and lovely little boy".
A couple, believed to be Charlie's mother Lynsey Dunn and stepfather Paul Smith, have been arrested.
The couple were held on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence shortly after the "tragic incident" and have since been released on bail pending further inquiries.
Ms Robinson has accused Leicestershire Police of showing a "lack of compassion" after the couple were taken into custody on the day of Charlie's death.
She said: "They needed each other that day, they needed to comfort each other.
"They were put in separate police cars, weren't allowed to talk to each other or have any type of consoling each other."
In a statement, Leicestershire Police said: "Our investigations into the circumstances surrounding the death are ongoing.
"We would continue to ask people not to speculate about the incident and the circumstances around the death and leave the authorities to carry out their investigations."
Charlie was airlifted to hospital where he died despite desperate efforts to save him.
Ms Robinson said the family was struggling to understand why a boy who did not like water would have gone back to the lake by himself.
She said her grandson was "very loving and always happy".
"We used to call him the Milkybar Kid because he looked like him.
"He was outstanding on his school report. It's such a shame because he had a lot of future in front of him."
Witness Olivia Quinn said the scene at the water park was "horrific... everyone was in shock, crying and praying for the little boy".
Park owner Nigel Riley described the incident as "dreadful" after the park reopened on Sunday.
In a statement, Bosworth Water Park said on its Facebook page: "We would like to pass on our deepest condolences to all effected by this tragic incident.
"A full investigation will also be carried out by the health and safety executive and we will of course fully co-operate with all investigations."
