The schemes, on Great Patrick Street and York Street, are opposite the Ulster University's new campus.
The larger of the two developments consists of 590 en suite bedrooms and 92 studio apartments.
It is being developed by Yorkshire-based UniCiti which has built similar schemes in England and Scotland.
The second scheme, by Patton Developments LLP, is for 475 bedrooms and a ground-level retail unit.
Both buildings have been designed by Belfast firm LIKE Architects.
Ciaran Deazley, director at LIKE, said the approvals "usher in a new era for Belfast City Centre".
"These two landmarks will provide a significant investment in the area supporting jobs at all phases of construction," he said.
Work on the schemes is expected to begin in the summer with a target completion date of May 2018.
The council has also approved two hotel projects.
They are a 179-bedroom new-build hotel on Hope Street, being developed by Lord Rana and Andras House, and an extension to Ten Square on Donegall Square.
The Hope Street hotel is likely to operate under the Hampton by Hilton brand.
The council planning chairperson, councillor Matt Garrett, said six major hotel projects had now been approved in the last nine months.
