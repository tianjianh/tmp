The 23-year-old replaces Dan Braid who retired to join the coaching staff.
Beaumont, who is the son of World Rugby chairman and ex-England captain Bill, made his debut in 2013 while studying at Durham University.
"Securing Josh on a three-year deal is a big statement of intent," said director of rugby Steve Diamond.
"Josh, as everyone knows, comes from a rugby family and is a born leader."
Beaumont was called up by England head coach Eddie Jones before their triumphant Six Nations campaign, but he failed to make an appearance after he suffered a shoulder injury playing for Sale.
The injury also forced him to miss the last three months of the Premiership season.
"With the takeover of the club being completed and the vision the new owners have, I was delighted to sign and commit my future to the club," Beaumont said.
"I am from the north west and want to help Sale Sharks reach their full potential and be one of the leading clubs in the Premiership."
