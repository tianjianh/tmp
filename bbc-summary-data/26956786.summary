Redevelopment plans for a high profile site in the south of the Isle of Man will go on public display at the weekend, said the Manx government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A planning application for Callow's Yard in Castletown was submitted by private developers in March.
The proposals would involve amendments to both residential and retail premises in the centre of the town.
Callow's Yard in Castletown, the former capital of the island, opened in 2009 to help rejuvenate the historic town.
Originally a shopping complex and apartments, the private project cost in the region of Â£20m.
Current facilities include a bar, restaurant, coffee shop, newsagent, clothing outlets and a conference area.
MHK Graham Cregeen said: "This is an important site and obviously the people of Castletown are now keen to see the next step for Callow's Yard.
"I would urge all Castletown residents to get further information on the plans - they will be able to ask questions and get immediate feedback from the developers."
The plans will go on display in Arbory Street, Castletown on 12 April, between 10:00 and 14:00 (BST).
"I think there is currently a lack of understanding about what is being proposed so this event will help clarify some of those issues," continued Mr Cregeen.
