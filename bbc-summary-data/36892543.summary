[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dr Gareth Christopher Menagh struck off for filming female colleagues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim doctor has been struck off because of a conviction relating to offences committed at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital five years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2014, Dr Gareth Christopher Menagh, 33, admitted three charges of recording women doing a private act, for his own sexual gratification.
Menagh, of Lady Wallace Lane in Lisburn, filmed two female colleagues, one of whom was heavily pregnant, changing their clothing in 2011.
He was fined Â£6,000 on his conviction.
Since 2011, he has been only allowed to work under conditions imposed by the General Medical Council.
In deciding to remove the doctor from the medical register, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found that his conduct was "fundamentally incompatible with continued registration".
The panel found that Menagh showed a deliberate disregard for the principles set out in general medical practice.
It also reported that he abused his position of trust, exploited vulnerable people, and committed offences of a sexual nature.
It also said voyeurism is a serious offence and his actions showed a lack of respect for both his colleagues and the law.
The report added: "The tribunal determined that your actions have brought the profession into disrepute, and that your conviction seriously undermines public confidence in the medical profession."
Menagh, who has been working in a trust in England, has 28 days to appeal.
