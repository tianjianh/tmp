Recresco fined £180k over forklift truck driver Ian Aliski's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recycling company has been fined £180,000 after a man was killed on his first day at work when the forklift truck he was driving overturned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Aliski, 29, from Ellesmere Port, was using the forklift at Recresco Ltd's glass recycling plant in the town on 26 April 2010 when it turned over and fatally crushed him.
The firm pleaded guilty to a breach of Health and Safety laws.
Since the incident, the company now uses four-wheel drive vehicles.
Recresco Ltd was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which said an investigation revealed that forklift truck drivers regularly had to work in an area that was often covered in waste materials which prevented them from turning the vehicles safely.
Mr Aliski had been hired on a temporary four-day contract and was just a few hours into his first day when the incident happened, Liverpool Crown Court heard.
On the day of the incident, Mr Aliski was moving waste material to a storage shed when the forklift truck became unstable on the uneven surface and overturned.
The court was told Mr Aliski was not wearing a seatbelt and there was no company policy in place to ensure they were worn.
The HSE's investigation also found that the forklift trucks in use at the plant were not suitable for operation on uneven surfaces or over loose material such as that found on the site.
Alternative vehicles, such as four-wheel-drive, all-terrain shovel loaders, could have been used and were already in use elsewhere on the site.
Since the incident, the company now uses these vehicles to move all the waste material on the site and it is now company policy for seatbelts to be worn at all times in all vehicles.
Recresco Ltd, of Lane End, Urban Road, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottingham, was fined £180,000 and ordered to pay £38,693 in prosecution costs after pleading guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.
HSE inspector Martin Paren said it was "entirely foreseeable" that somebody was at risk of being badly injured and the death could have been avoided had "simple measures to reduce the risks" been taken.
