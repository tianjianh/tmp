O'Sullivan, 39, had reached the final for the last three years, but exited following Bingham's brilliant display.
The 38-year-old took a 5-3 lead after the first session, before O'Sullivan hit back to lead 9-8.
Bingham won four in a row to go 12-9 ahead, before clinching the next to set up a semi-final against Judd Trump.
"I was way off the pace," said O'Sullivan. "He just pushed me around and I felt second best all match."
Bingham revealed he was in tears after the match and described the victory as "unbelievable".
"Ronnie is the best player in the world, but time is catching up," he added. "I knew I had been playing well."
O'Sullivan was a clear favourite heading into the match, but looked ill-at-ease at times, missing opportunities he would usually have taken.
He caused controversy in the fifth frame after placing a chalk on the table to line up a shot, breaking snooker rules, but was not reprimanded by the referee.
There have been several incidents at this year's championship involving the 2014 runner-up, including playing in his socks, almost snapping a cue and making an obscene gesture.
The pair met at the same stage in 2013, when O'Sullivan ran out a comfortable 13-4 winner, but it was a different story this time.
Bingham, who reaches his first Crucible semi-final in nine attempts, led 6-3 with a sublime 145 break in the second session, equalling the highest of the tournament.
But O'Sullivan hit back with three frames on the trot, before the pair went all-square at 8-8.
Bingham, winner of two ranking events, broke down on a maximum 147 effort having pocketed 11 reds and 11 blacks, as he edged two frames away from victory.
A composed 51 took the world number 10 closer to the winning line, before a 66 break gave him a famous victory.
