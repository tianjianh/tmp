A major street art festival which saw paintings appear on buildings across Aberdeen could be returning for the next three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nuart has taken place in Stavanger, Norway, since 2001 but was introduced in Aberdeen earlier this month.
Images both large and small appeared on city buildings.
Business-led initiative Aberdeen Inspired will decide next month whether to bring the festival back. Council backing would then be sought.
The images attracted intense interest on social media.
Walking tours organised to guide members of the public around the artwork also proved popular.
A council spokesman said: "Given the enormous success of Nuart, there is a desire from both Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeen Inspired to see the festival return to the city in the near future.
"It is hoped that Nuart will become a fixture in the cultural calendar and officers have been asked to look at what needs to be done to help secure its presence in the longer term."
