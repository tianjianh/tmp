Resuming on 71 after the first session of day two was washed out, former Lancashire captain Horton reached his ton off 167 balls - hitting 14 fours.
The 33-year-old shared a 114-run third-wicket stand with Foxes captain Mark Cosgrove, before being caught behind off George Garton.
Garton then bowled Cosgrove (80) as the hosts closed on 300-4, a lead of 137.
Sussex coach Mark Davis told BBC Sussex:
"We're behind the eight-ball, there's no doubt about that.
"If you get knocked over for 163 on a decent pitch you are under pressure, but I was pleased with how we came back fighting today. George Garton gave it his all and I was delighted he got two wickets.
"There's obviously a lot more work for us ahead but I know our squad are up for a challenge and I would back them to bat a lot better in our second innings."
Leicestershire batsman Paul Horton told BBC Radio Leicester:
"After going past 50 and not converting in two of my previous innings it was nice to reach the landmark of my first hundred for my new county.
"I got a start on the first day and although the conditions were quite tough today, with it being overcast and with the lights on, I felt good.
"The bowlers set the game up for us on the first day. To bowl a side as strong as Sussex out for 163 was an amazing effort and as a batting unit it was important for us to back that up.
"There are more batting bonus points up for grabs and we will be looking to extend our lead as much as we can and then hopefully the bowlers can do the business again for us."
