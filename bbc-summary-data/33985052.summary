Ciara Breen was 17 when she was last seen at her home at Bachelor's Walk in Dundalk in the early hours of 13 February 1997.
Officers began searching land in Dundalk on Tuesday.
They have been focusing on an area called Balmer's Bog, a marshland just off the Ardee Road.
An extensive police investigation at the time of Ciara's disappearance failed to locate her.
Last year, two witnesses came forward with potential sightings of her.
Police also received two anonymous letters with information about the case.
A man in his 50s was arrested in April and later released without charge in connection with Ciara's disappearance.
On Tuesday, police said they were acting on information they had received following recent appeals for information.
