[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The English pair, seeded seventh, lost 21-16 21-15 to unseeded Thai duo Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Sapsiree Taerattanachai in 34 minutes.
The Adcocks had led 8-5 early on but lost four consecutive points and never regained control of the tie.
They had been in fine form recently, reaching the semi-finals of the Indian Open last week.
