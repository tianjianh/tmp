City signed Dorrans on loan in February, after which the 27-year-old Scotsman scored three times in 18 appearances to help the Canaries secure promotion to the Premier League.
The Scotland international was signed in July 2008 by then boss Tony Mowbray from Livingston for just Â£150,000.
He went on to make 189 appearances for the Baggies, finding the net 26 times.
"Graham has been a very important part of the team over the last few months," said Canaries boss Alex Neil. "He has Premier League experience and is a top player.
"His experience and quality will help us. We're delighted he has joined us on a permanent basis."
Meanwhile Albion manager Tony Pulis has released midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu, 28, and utility players Chris Baird, 32, and Jason Davidson, 23.
The club have exercised contract options on goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, 32, and midfielder Claudio Yacob, 27, while they will enter negotiations on a new deal with centre-back Gareth McAuley, 35.
Three Academy graduates, striker Adil Nabi, midfielder Liam O'Neil and defender Donervon Daniels, all 21, have also had their contract options taken up.
Three young professionals, full-backs Bradley Garmston, 21 and Wez Atkinson, 20, and midfielder Mani O'Sullivan, 21, have been released, along with striker Alex Jones, 20, who has already joined Birmingham City.
