Ford recalls over a million cars for faulty steering

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US car giant Ford has announced it is recalling a total of 1.4 million vehicles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Approximately 1.1 million sport utility vehicles (SUVs) sold in North America are being recalled because they could suffer a loss of power steering.
An additional 200,000 Taurus sedans built between 2010 and 2014 could be prone to a corrosion issue.
The recent spate of similar incidents could mean carmakers will soon break the record for most recalls in a year.
For power steering issues:
For floor mat issues:
For corrosion issues:
Most of those recalls have come in the wake of a safety scandal at Ford rival General Motors (GM).
GM is accused of failing to report safety defects in some of its cars that could cause the engine to suddenly switch off.
The fault has been linked to at least 13 deaths, although US regulators believe that figure could grow.
In the wake of the disclosures, both carmakers and US regulators have stepped up efforts to recall vehicles once defects are discovered.
