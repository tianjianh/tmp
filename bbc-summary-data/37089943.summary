Former England Under-20 centre-half Turnbull failed to make a senior appearance for Southampton.
The 21-year-old spent the last two seasons on loan at Swindon, playing in a total of 86 League One games.
"Jordan played twice against us last season and impressed me both times with his accomplished performances," said manager Tony Mowbray.
Turnbull becomes the second defender to join the Sky Blues from Premier League side Saints inside six months, following Jack Stephens' loan move in February.
