Tens of thousands of children in the UK are young carers.
January 28th is Young Carers Awareness Day so to mark the day we've been hearing from two sisters who look after their mum with mental ill health.
Shannon and Scarlett care for their mum who has mental illness. She has periods when she feels sad and depressed. But the girls say that looking after their mum makes them really grateful for the good times.
This is their story.
