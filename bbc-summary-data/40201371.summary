[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men, aged 24 and 29, were detained in Huddersfield and Sheffield on 1 June.
The North East Counter-Terrorism Unit said "an additional warrant of further detention has been granted".
Police said the arrests were not linked to last month's Manchester Arena attack.
Officers raided properties in Kelham Island, Sheffield, and Crosland Moor, Huddersfield, and both arrests are understood to be Islamist-related.
The men are being held on suspicion of offences under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act.
