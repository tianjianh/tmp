He will replace the current SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey who announced he is stepping down for health reasons.
Mr Diver will be formally endorsed at a selection convention on 22 December.
He is currently the party leader on Derry City and Strabane District Council and has been a councillor for 14 years.
"Pat Ramsey is a political legend locally," said Mr Diver.
"I am honoured to have been put forward and I look forward to the many challenges. I'm looking forward to being in Stormont.
"Foyle faces a number of challenges like economic disadvantages, infrastructure issues and the growth of the university."
Mr Diver has been working in the community and voluntary sector for 20 years.
"I want to focus on job creation and investment in the north west," he said.
"Derry and the Foyle constituency has never really got what it deserved.
"I'm going to bring my expertise to the table but it's not for Gerard Diver to make changes alone.
"I imagine I will be co-opted into the assembly early in January. I'm excited and look forward to the months ahead."
