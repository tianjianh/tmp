Liz O'Neill came across the meat at Crosland Moor and posted the pictures on Facebook to warn others after her dog ate some.
She described those responsible for leaving the meat as "sick".
Previously, drawing pins were found scattered on the same field, which is used by a local dog agility club.
Ms O'Neill said she became concerned after her four-year-old dog Marley ate some of the meat left near a hut on the Dryclough recreation ground.
"It was fresh raw meat, no smell. Nothing on it," she said.
She said the experience had left her feeling frightened, but thankful Marley seemed to be fine.
During a previous incident, dozens of drawing pins were scattered on the field.
In 2014, officials from  Springers Agility and Flyball Club told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner those responsible were also putting children at risk of injury.
Police said they had received several reports in recent months of poisoned, or tampered with, meat left in popular dog walking areas.
Last month, bran flakes thought to have been laced with rat poison were eaten by a dog near Guiseley Football Club.
Sausages laced with nails were also reported at Dovestone Reservoir, Oldham.
West Yorkshire Police urged people to remove food out of harm's way and advised anyone affected to take their pet to a vet.
The force said it has increased patrols in the area.
