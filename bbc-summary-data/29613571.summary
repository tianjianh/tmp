The New Zealander, 31, submitted an early guilty plea to the Rugby Football League for his part in the clash.
Flower faces a tribunal on Tuesday, and is facing a minimum eight-game ban.
Flower punched Hohaia to the ground and then landed a second blow to the face of his opponent as he lay on the pitch.

Police are investigating the incident, but have not received any complaints from members of the public.
However, they will continue to liaise with relevant parties - including the Rugby Football League, the Criminal Prosecution Service and St Helens - before deciding on a course of action.
Hohaia had been charged with a grade B offence of striking, which normally carries a ban of one or two matches,
But because of his previous record, Hohaia was entitled to submit an early guilty plea to receive the smallest sanction and avoid a hearing.
"Lance Hohaia has accepted the EGP and will miss the first warm-up game of next season," a St Helens spokesman said.
Saints have also announced that forward Richard Beaumont has left the club - he failed to play a game after joining on a two-year deal from Hull KR.
