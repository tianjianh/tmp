Hundreds of volunteer builders gathered in the city centre to make the tower, using 1,000 cardboard bricks.
The People's Tower community art event was created to mark the opening weekend of the annual Norfolk and Norwich Festival.
The tower is 22 metres tall and is designed to look like the St Peter Mancroft Church tower.
It took more than eight hours to complete and was held together by more than eight miles of packing tape.
It was designed by French artist Olivier GrossetÃªte.
