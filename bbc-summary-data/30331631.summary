Betty Goodchild told staff in Halesworth, Suffolk, she first went skating at Earl's Court in London when she was 12 years old.
Carehome owners, The Partnership In Care (TPIC), set up an artificial ice rink at one of their homes in Risby, near Bury St Edmunds.
Ms Goodchild said she had a "wonderful time."
The nursing home group has been running coach trips to the rink in Risby from its other homes in Halesworth, Ipswich and Sudbury.
It has about 300 residents, many of whom have dementia.
They were able to sit in their own wheelchairs or use a chair designed for ice rinks.
Emma John, resource manager at TPIC, said: "We always ask what people's wishes are for Christmas and this lady said she wanted to go on an ice rink again.
"It's about the magic of Christmas and the opportunity for residents to take part."
The nursing home also invited local schoolchildren to meet residents and skate.
