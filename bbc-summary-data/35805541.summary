North Warwickshire Police uploaded a picture of its new "mobile station", emblazoned with a map of the force area.

The force said it was working to resolve the mistake "as quickly and cost effectively as possible."

The misspellings - Shipstone-on-Stour and Wellsbourne - were picked up by a local team from one of the towns.

Policing North Warwickshire replied: "For Sale 2016 mobile police station, 187 miles, slight artwork issue...."
