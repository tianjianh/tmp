[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Seal, 49, of Ogmore Vale, Bridgend county, was charged with the murder of Gwilym Jones but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday. He was remanded in custody until sentencing next month.
Mr Jones died from stab wounds sustained in the attack in Ogmore Vale in May.
He also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of 21-year-old Bridie Jones.
Prosecutor Michael Jones said: "It's clear he had pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility."
Seal will be sentenced in December after psychiatric reports are completed.
