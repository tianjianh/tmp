The island's director of squash, Nick Taylor, hailed their performance after Jersey beat Luxembourg 3-1 to finish third in the tournament in Romania.
"It really sets us with the other nations and puts Jersey on the map.
"It's as big, if not bigger, than the medals that we have got in the previous Island Games," Taylor told BBC Jersey.
Having come second to Italy in the pool stages following wins over Greece, Romania and Gibraltar, Jersey lost 3-1 to Portugal in the semi-finals before beating Luxembourg for third place.
"We can compete at the top level, we were one place off being promoted to the second division," added Taylor.
"We'll continue to stay in the third division, we'll continue to try and strengthen our squad and bring some of the young players in."
