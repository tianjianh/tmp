A group of Welsh celebrities has called on the UK government to protect Welsh-language broadcasting.

The signatories, who include Radio 1's Huw Stephens and rugby referee Nigel Owens, wrote to David Cameron saying S4C had already faced cuts.
S4C said it had lost 36% of its income since 2010 when the cost of most of its budget was shifted to the licence fee.
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has said it was reasonable to expect S4C to make the same cuts as the BBC.
The group's letter, which was also co-signed by presenter Sian Lloyd, singers Caryl Parry Jones and Dafydd Iwan, and British Jamaican poet Benjamin Zephaniah, said S4C made a "priceless contribution to ensuring a prosperous future for Welsh, the oldest living language in Britain".
Jamie Bevan, chairman of the Welsh Language Society, said: "The letter reflects the strong support for the channel.
"Welsh is a treasure for so many people across the British Isles, it would be a blow to the cultural wealth of the world if S4C was threatened further."
