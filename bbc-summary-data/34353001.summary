More than 2,000 people signed a petition to save Broomhill House in Gedling.
Mark Hughes, of Friends of Broomhill, said it offered "vital support" and he was disappointed by the decision.
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said it was part of a move towards community-based services so people could be cared for at home.
Health bosses also announced the closure of Heather Close in Mansfield.
Mr Hughes said: "It's a quality service... It does a very good job, it's very cost effective and it's popular.
"The careers approve of it, which is a big thing for us and... it does what it's supposed to do, so why close it?"
Simon Smith, of the trust, said the closure decisions, "based on evidence and best practice guidance", have not been "taken lightly".
"They are difficult decisions of course, but actually they are based on a strong belief and evidence that we have that supports changing our services in this way to make sure that they are giving the right type of care for people," he said.
The trust said patient feedback showed most preferred to be cared for at home.
There would be an outreach service in the community to ensure people did not fall into a crisis situation.
It added that the units would remain open until all inpatients had been clinically assessed and an appropriate discharge package is in place for each person.
