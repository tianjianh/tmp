A man and a woman were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after the crash between Inverurie and Huntly at about 10:15 on Saturday.
Police said the crash involved a blue Vauxhall Astra VXR, which was travelling north, and a white Vauxhall Corsa VXR, heading south.
The road was closed for three hours following the crash near Bainshole.
Officers said the 21-year-old male Astra driver suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries in the crash.
The 23-year-old woman who was the wheel of the second car received minor injuries.
There were no passengers in either vehicle.
PC Alexander Bowser-Riley, who is investigating the collision, appealed for information from witnesses.
He said: "I would appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision or saw either vehicle on the A96 prior to the incident to contact Police Scotland on 101."
"I would also like to thank the various members of the public who stopped to offer assistance and help both drivers immediately after the collision.
"Again, if any of these people have not spoken to police, I would ask them to make contact on 101."
