The 30-year-old, 58th in both sprint qualification and the 10km classic, tested positive for trimetazidine.
The Ukrainian Olympic Committee said Lisogor told an International Olympic Committee disciplinary hearing her breach had been unintentional.
Latvian ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs has also failed a drugs test.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said 24-year-old Pavlovs tested positive on February 19 for methylhexaneamine and had also been thrown out of the Olympics.
German biathlete Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle and Italian bobsleigh brakeman William Frullani have already left Sochi 2014 after failed drugs tests.
Trimetazidine has been on the forbidden substances list since 1 January 2014.
The IOC said Lisogor would be disqualified from the women's team sprint classic semi-final B event, along with her team-mates.
They also stated Lisogor "shall be excluded from the XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi in 2014, and shall have her Olympic identity and accreditation card immediately cancelled".
