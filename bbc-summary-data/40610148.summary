The 21-year-old was an ever-present member of the Vixens side for this year's WSL 1 Spring Series.
The England Under-23 international then helped the young Lionesses win the Nordic Cup this summer.
"I came here to play regular football. I really appreciate the manager's faith in me," Turner told the club website.
