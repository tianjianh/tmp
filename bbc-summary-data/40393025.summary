The 35-year-old former Oxford United man left Eastleigh by mutual consent in April after a seven-month stay.
A former Bristol Rovers trainee, Clarke has also previously played for clubs including Northampton Town, AFC Wimbledon and Forest Green Rovers.
"Ryan is a proven goalkeeper at this level and levels above," Torquay boss Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
