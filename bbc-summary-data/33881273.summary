Q&A: A-levels - expert advice 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The big results day has finally arrived and many young people will be celebrating their success. But what do you do if your grades are not quite what you were expecting?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The situation can be confusing, especially at a time of stress, and with only a few days to secure a university place or take an alternative path, getting the right advice is key.
Experts Alex Neill of Which? University and Nick Davy, higher education manager at the Association of Colleges, are offering advice to readers with unexpected results.
Good point - and it will be interesting to see how many young people question progressing to university once we have a full understanding of debts over the next five years. And of course many apprenticeships frameworks are being placed at level 4 and above/degree equivalent.
Although employers seem to want to employ graduates - more seem to be looking at apprenticeships and in-house training.

Hi Steve
I hope things are now resolved and your son is less stressed. This will happen to a very few - but it's exceptional. There will always be a few glitches in such a complex system with over half a million applications; but in my experience these sorts of issues can be sorted out quickly.

Alex adds:
I hope things are smoothed over as soon as possible, so he can celebrate his achievements.  It sounds like he's already been on the case with Ucas but if he hasn't already, I'd also suggest giving his chosen university a call to explain the situation. If for nothing else than to give him a bit of reassurance that things will get sorted out in the end.
Firstly, speak to a teacher or member of staff at your current school or college to discuss a way forward. If you're committed to studying hard over the next year, they may be willing to support your studies into A2.
You might be able to retake certain AS-level exams alongside studying for your A-levels next year, although be prepared to put in lots of extra work! You might want to drop certain subjects to focus on your strongest ones. Retaking Year 12 altogether might be another option (although be aware that the structure and assessment of A-levels is changing for certain subjects for those starting A-level studies this September).

Nick adds:
I presume that you are asking about AS grades.  I would suggest that the first things that you do is contact your current school/college and discuss the situation with them.  Another school or college might be an option - ring around. However, there are many other opportunities out there such as advanced apprenticeships or other level 3 qualifications such as BTEC which are available in a number of subject areas and are more assignment-based than A-levels.  Contact your local general further education college to find out more.
Hi Jane
Excellent question - especially with the majority of entrants to HE now coming from non-A-level qualification backgrounds. The good news is that more universities are taking students with BTEC qualifications and this is likely to increase this year with no cap on student numbers

Hi Rosamund
If you're not happy with an exam result and feel it's been unfairly marked, it's important you first talk to your school or college about appealing your grade.  You won't be able to enquire directly with the examining board yourself.
If your university place depends on the outcome, you can use the rapid appeals process to fast track matters. I'd also suggest calling your university directly to explain your circumstances, as - depending on the number of places they have available - they may be willing to hold yours open.
Alex
Nick adds:
Don't panic everyone is sympathetic in these situations!
Hi Umair
Yes - you can . It is worth looking at Adjustment on the Ucas website where you can trade up and start talking to universities you are interested in going to, and indicate your re-sit results.
Nick
Alex adds:
To first find out if you are in Clearing, you can check Ucas Track. While looking through vacancies, we'd suggest a good place to start your search is with the courses and universities you originally considered as part of your application. Draw up a shortlist of universities before hitting the phones.
I wouldn't recommend straying too far from the subject area you originally applied for. The universities you speak to during Clearing will be able to view your original application and personal statement and may question your commitment to a different course. A joint or combined honours subject may be an option to consider but think carefully before you change paths completely. Be prepared to explain your decisions openly and honestly during the call.
Hi Carol
You're right that schools and colleges tend to over rather than under-predict grades. However, university admissions tutors making offers have a range of indicators to go on in order to decide whether or not a student will cut it on their course. They'll assess actual AS-level results as well as academic references and the personal statement.
Hopefully your son exceeds the grades he's been predicted today.  If he does better than expected, the Ucas Adjustment scheme would be open to him. Unlike Clearing, there's no vacancy list, so he'll need to contact the university he's interested in directly.
Alex
Nick adds:
You make some very sensible remarks regarding England's system of application and entry to higher education. The way to solve this problem would be to have a post-results entry system - common in many countries. Unfortunately that idea was rejected a few years ago. Basically the universities were unprepared to put back the start of their semester start time and schools/colleges/awarding bodies did not want to bring exams forward. So - an impasse. On the other hand, the predictions are often not enormously inaccurate - so they can be a good indicator and universities get to know schools/colleges which have a tendency to over-estimate. But good points and the  debate on a post-results system is worth revisiting.
Hi Lynne
Fascinating question - and there is a huge academic literature on this subject - how do learners "recontextualise" their knowledge leant in the classroom in occupational situations? Actually medical training puts a lot of stress on this issue - often employing teachers using problem-solving learning techniques - trainee doctors bringing back into the classroom problems they have experienced on clinical placement - to fine-tune diagnostic skills.
