The National Weather Service reported at least three tornadoes touching down in southern Louisiana.
Severe thunderstorms continued on Tuesday afternoon as emergency officials began to assess the damage.
Some injuries have been reported but authorities have yet to confirm how many, according to local media reports.
A second tornado was reported near the town of Donaldsonville and another in the town of Killian, according to Danielle Manning, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Images shared on social media showed the aftermath of the storms, including damaged homes, flipped cars and fallen trees strewn across the road.
Nasa's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans was also reportedly damaged by a tornado.
More than 9,300 city residents were experiencing power outages after the storms, according to power company Entergy.
The Louisiana Red Cross said 6,500 people in New Orleans East alone were without power.
At least seven homes were damaged in Livingston Parish, located just northwest of New Orleans, said Brandi Janes, the deputy emergency preparedness director.
"Two of them are completely gone... all the way to the ground," she told the AP news agency.
An estimated 2.7 million people in parts of Louisiana were at the highest risk of severe weather, according to the national Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.
New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison said federal, state and local agencies were working with search patrols in the area.
