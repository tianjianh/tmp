[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A south London primary school concerned about high levels of air pollution is issuing parents with advice about buying face masks for children.

City Hall estimates about 450 schools in London are currently affected by unsafe pollution levels.
Adam Matthews, chair of governors at Archbishop Sumner school, proposed giving face masks to pupils as a pilot.
However, governors have voted instead to offer parents information enabling them to make their own choices.
Mr Matthews, who has three children at the school in Lambeth, said he would rather his children did not have to wear masks but "unfortunately" he felt in some cases it was necessary because pollution levels were now "so bad".
"At the moment the diesel fumes are really impacting on kids' lungs," he added.
His daughter Scarlett, aged eight, said she was not keen on wearing a mask as she thought it would maker her "look odd."
Following the governors' meeting on Thursday, the school has decided to hold a briefing session for parents and invite experts to deliver a presentation on air pollution and face masks.
The school has also agreed to:
9,400
Premature deaths a year in London linked to air pollution
500,000 aged under 19 who live in areas that breach EU limits
443 schools that have unsafe pollution levels
86 of these are secondary
2025 year London is expected to meet EU limits
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, previously announced that London's most polluted schools would receive "toxic air audits" to help protect students.
The jury is still out on whether pollution masks really work, with supporters claiming they can filter out some harmful toxins.
Detractors say their efficiency depends on how well the masks fit the wearer and the specific purpose they are being used for - as not all masks perform the same function.
