The holder of a winning lottery ticket has missed out on spending Christmas as a millionaire after they failed to claim the money in time.

Someone in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda won the £1m winning raffle prize in the Lottery draw on 28 May.
But the 180-day time limit to claim the winnings has now passed and the money has gone back in the pot.
Camelot's winners' advisor Andy Carter said the ticket-holder had missed out on a "substantial amount of money".
"To avoid this unfortunate situation happening again, I would urge all National Lottery players to check their tickets on a regular basis," he said.
Every week the Lotto Millionaire Raffle - an automatic code printed on Lottery tickets - creates two millionaires, one on Wednesday and one on Saturday.
