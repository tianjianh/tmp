The winger, 29, was taken to hospital following the game in Beijing, which Chelsea won 3-0, and stayed overnight.
He also suffered concussion but posted a message saying "everything is OK" before travelling back to London.
Pedro is expected to wear a protective mask when he returns to training.
The rest of the Chelsea squad are now in Singapore where they will play two games - against Bayern Munich on Tuesday and Inter Milan on 29 July.
