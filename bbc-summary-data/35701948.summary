Olympic boxing: Men to stop wearing protective headguards

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Male boxers will not wear protective headgear at Rio 2016 after the International Olympic Committee ratified the rule change by the sport's governing body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The International Boxing Association (AIBA) adopted the change for amateur fighters three years ago.
Female fighters will continue to wear headgear.
Boxers have worn headgear in every Olympics since the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
The change will result in a decrease in concussions, AIBA president Ching-Kuo Wu predicted.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: "AIBA provided medical and technical data that showed the number of concussions is lower without headgear. They have done a lot of research in the last three years. The rule will go ahead for Rio."
However, the rule has not yet been implemented for women due to a relative lack of data on head injuries in the comparatively young sport of female boxing.
