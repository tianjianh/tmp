[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 1-2 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone United extended their unbeaten run to nine games in the National League after coming from behind to claim a 2-1 victory at play-off chasing Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took a somewhat fortuitous 26th-minute lead as the ball pinged around the Maidstone penalty area and then took a touch off Tom Mills before nestling in the net.
Maidstone goalkeeper Lee Worgan made a fine save to deny Jordan Burrow before a second own goal in the match in the 73rd minute, this time for the visitors as Liam Hogan's deflection was adjudged to have crossed the goal-line.
That seemed to galvanise the Stones, who took the lead three minutes later thanks to Bobby-Joe Taylor rifling home and they held on to walk away with all three points.
