A wreath was laid next a statue of Hill outside Coventry City's Ricoh Arena by current manager Tony Mowbray and goalkeeping coach Steve Ogrizovic.
Hill, who died last Saturday aged 87, joined the club as manager in 1961, leaving six years later shortly after they were promoted to the First Division for the first time.
He also served as club chairman.
The Dean of Coventry, John Witcombe, led a short ceremony ahead of the club's Boxing Day clash against Port Vale at 15:00 GMT.
Hill - diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2008 - made more than 600 appearances as presenter of Match of the Day after leaving his role as head of sport for ITV in 1967.
Described as one of English football's most influential figures, he was remembered by the Football League as "player, manager, chairman, broadcaster, visionary, and all time great in so many ways."
As chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, he led the campaign for the scrapping of maximum wages for professional footballers.
He also commissioned the first English all-seater stadium, lifted a ban on media interviews, introduced the first electronic scoreboard in 1964 and the first colour match-day programme.
