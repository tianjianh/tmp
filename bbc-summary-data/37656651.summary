The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been greeted by children dressed in royal comedy masks during their visit to Manchester.

The Duchess, 34, smiled as she arrived at the National Football Museum to be met by a grinning 'Kate' lookalike.
There was also a mask of her husband William along with those of the Queen, Princes Charles and Harry, and a corgi.
William, 34, cheered as he scored during a penalty shoot-out after missing his first shot at the museum.
His shot went in off the bar in the Euro 96 computer-generated game but then asked "Katherine" to take one.
However the Duchess, wearing heels and wearing a blue Erdem coat, politely declined.
William put on white gloves to handle the orange leather ball from the 1966 World Cup final when England beat West Germany 4-2.
He met former Liverpool player Roger Hunt who played in the final and famously celebrated as Geoff Hurst's disputed goal crossed the line.
Mr Hunt said: "We were talking about the final and the weight of the ball and how heavy it gets when wet.
"He was very nice to talk to."
William declined to handle the Jules Rimet Trophy as he said he did not want to jinx England's hopes of once again lifting the World Cup.
The Cambridges later laid commemorative paving stones to the city's six Victoria Cross recipients during World War One at the Manchester cenotaph.
And William also sat in the world's first car to include graphene, a "wonder material" only one atom thick, at the University of Manchester's pioneering National Graphene Institute
The couple ended their trip by going to Francis House, a hospice which provides care for children and young adults with life-limiting conditions.
It was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales, 25 years ago.
