Oxford United: Liam Sercombe set to stay but not play under new contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United are to trigger an extension clause in midfielder Liam Sercombe's contract - even though he may never play for the club again.

The 26-year-old has been left out of the first team for "disciplinary reasons" for the past three games.
Despite boss Michael Appleton saying the situation has not changed, he wants to ensure the club receive a fee.
Appleton is also not guaranteeing new contracts in the summer for players he intends to keep next season.
"I know that sometimes putting an offer in front of some people isn't the best thing to do," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
"I'll manage the football club as best as I see fit. But, I don't want Oxford United to be a bargaining tool.
"It's difficult, but the reality is I don't want anyone who doesn't want to be here next year anyway. As harsh as that is, that's how it is.
"We've created a culture and talked a lot about it. But, I want players who want to play for Oxford United and if they don't, they can leave - simple as that."
Meanwhile, on-loan midfielder Conor McAleny has admitted a permanent move to Oxford from Everton could be among his summer options.
The 24-year-old, who has scored eight goals for The U's, is out of contract at Goodison Park at the end of the season.
"I'm not going to rush into anything," he said. "It's my future and I'll take my time and weigh up the pros and cons of every option and hopefully make the right choice."
