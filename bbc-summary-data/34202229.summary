A hotel, care home, shops and restaurants are also proposed for the Omega site near the M62 at Burtonwood.
Some concerns have been voiced about the potential for increased traffic in the area, and the impact on wildlife.
The Omega project is already home to distribution warehouses and has reportedly created 2,000 jobs.
The land at the former RAF Burtonwood airbase has been labelled "the largest employment site in Western Europe" by Warrington Borough Council.
Council leader Terry O'Neill said: "The continued development of Omega is a key priority in our ambitious growth agenda.
"This planning application brings much-needed housing to the town."
The proposals will now be considered by the authority's planning department.
Developers Miller Developments and KUC Properties said more than 200 local residents have been consulted on the plans, and promised there would be improvements to local roads and wildlife habitat preservation.
Managing Director of Miller Developments Andrew Sutherland said "Naturally there were numerous concerns expressed about traffic congestion and our transport consultants continue to work hard with Warrington's highways team and public transport providers to address this."
Planning permission has already been granted for a new primary school on the site, whilst government funding has been committed for improvements to Junction 8 of the M62.
The land is owned by government body the Homes and Communities Agency.
Spokesman Karl Tupling said: "The development of Omega is one of the largest construction projects happening in the North West.
"This will create significant employment opportunities and contribute to the delivery of the government's Northern Powerhouse agenda."
