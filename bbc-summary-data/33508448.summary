Former John Brown's shipyard set for development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to convert a derelict shipyard in Clydebank into a major housing and retail development have taken a major step forward.

West Dunbartonshire Council is to invest more than £15m in preparing John Brown's shipyard for development.
The investment will unlock plans for more than 1,000 new homes, a retail unit, a hotel, a care home, a health centre and a new boulevard.
The shipyard was famous for building the QE2 and Queen Mary.
It closed 30 years ago and the majority of the site - now known as Queens Quay - has been derelict for decades.
The site was bought by private firm Clydeside Regeneration in 2004 but the owners were unable to attract the investment to fund necessary infrastructure works.
Under a new agreement, the council will fund the repair of quay walls and create a new road layout.
In return the council will recoup its investment from a share of any future land sales at the site.
The local authority said the deal would pave the way for more than £250m worth of private investment.
The works are expected to start early next year, with completion scheduled for early 2018.
West Dunbartonshire Council leader Martin Rooney said: "For too long our once proud shipyard has been a derelict site at the heart of Clydebank, but that is all about to change."
