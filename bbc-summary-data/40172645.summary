Worcester Warriors: Ex-London Broncos CEO to replace departing Jim O'Toole

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors chief executive Jim O'Toole will step down at the end of June, with Gus Mackay replacing him in a managing director's role.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Toole joined Worcester in 2015 having previously worked at London Irish.
Former cricketer Mackay, who begins his new job on Monday, was chief executive of rugby league club London Broncos.
"We welcome Gus to his new role at a very exciting time for the commercial side of the business," chairman Bill Bolsover told Warriors' website.
Mackay, 49, played three one-day international matches for his native Zimbabwe in 2001, and later moved into the administrative side while also working as a banker.
In 2006, he was appointed chief executive of Sussex CCC and two years later moved to Surrey CCC as managing director of cricket, before switching sports to join the Broncos between 2011 and 2014.
As managing director, Mackay will have responsibility for the business operations of the club, with responsibility for the rugby department remaining with director of rugby Gary Gold.
The departing O'Toole said: "This new structure makes sense for the business and I would like to thank our partners, staff and fans for their support during my tenure as chief executive."
