The bill that made David Cameron so angry at the EU

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ever had that sinking feeling when a bill you weren't expecting lands on your doormat at the worst possible time?

That's just a small insight into David Cameron's day.
After being hit with a £1.7 billion bill by the EU to be paid by 1 December.
The prime minister's hands repeatedly thumped against a wooden lectern as he accused EU officials of "unacceptable" behaviour after a meeting in Brussels.
All 28 member states of the EU agree to pay a set amount from their economy each year to fund the running of the world's biggest trading club.
Every year, EU officials get their calculators out to check if each country has paid the right amount.
In the past they've found that the UK was owed a refund because it overpaid.  This year, though, they've worked out that the UK owes an extra contribution of £1.7 billion in addition to the £8.7 billion that was already handed over.
This is because the UK has recently changed how it measures the size of its economy to include the work of charities plus, strange as it may sound, the value of illegal activities such as prostitution.
The EU says because the UK economy was bigger than thought in previous years, it has been underpaying and therefore owes this extra money.
The UK has been hit with the biggest bill but The Netherlands, Italy and Greece have also been told they have been underpaying.  The Netherlands owes £506m, Italy £268m and Greece £70m.
Where there are losers there must also be winners and countries that have paid too little in the past will be handing that cash to countries that have paid too much.
For example, France gets £801m back and Germany is owed £614m.
First of all he says he's going to make sure that the sums have been correctly and check if there's any way to prove the UK owes less money.
Even if the amount turns out to be correct the PM has made it clear he thinks the 1 December deadline is "unacceptable."
He told reporters in Brussels: "If people think I am paying that bill on 1 December, they have another thing coming."
Crucially, the PM didn't rule out handing over the money at a later date.
As well as the loss of almost £2 billion pounds of public money, this problem for Cameron plays very nicely into the hands of UKIP.
Off the back of winning a Conservative seat at the Clacton by-election, the anti EU party are now hoping to do the same in Rochester next month.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage says this latest row is another example of the UK government struggling to cope with demands from Brussels.
He says: "It just leaves Mr Cameron in a hopeless position.
"Remember one of his big claims is that he would cut the EU budget. The result of that cut is that our contribution had gone up a little bit and now it has gone up a lot."
