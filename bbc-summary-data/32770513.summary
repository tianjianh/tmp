Rory McIlroy shot a 61 to break his own Quail Hollow course record and take a four-stroke lead after three rounds of the Wells Fargo Championship.

It was McIlroy's lowest career round - and one better than the record he set in 2010 - and put him on 18 under par.
McIlory needed to birdie the last two holes to join the seven PGA players to score 59 but only managed two pars.
"I was thinking about 59 from the 14th teebox," said the 26-year-old world number one after his 11 under round.
"I feel like it's one of these courses I can get on a roll with."
Anthony Kim set the tournament record of 16 under in 2008, while Jim Furyk was the last player to card a 59 on the PGA Tour in 2013.
McIlroy started the day three shots behind co-leaders Webb Simpson and Robert Streb and had five birdies in a front-nine 31. He then birdied six of the first seven holes on the back nine.
The highlight came when McIlroy drove the green on the 345-yard, par four 14th hole for the fourth time in his career - more than any player in tournament history.
