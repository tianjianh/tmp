Stoke-on-Trent City Council approves Hanley smoke-free plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Stoke-on-Trent are being asked about proposals to "control" smoking in some public spaces.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city council will launch a public consultation on its plans in October and, depending on the results, will seek to make some areas smoke-free.
The council said it would rely on people's goodwill to enforce the smoke-free areas and there would not be fines for those that smoked.
But smokers' groups said the policy was "patronising" and a "slippery slope".
The Smithfield development and Hanley bus station are among zones earmarked, with a view to expanding the policy to play areas across the city.
Smoking rates in the city were about 10% higher than the national average last year, according to Public Health England figures.
It is hoped they would be reduced by 5% by 2018 as smoking costs the authority £4m annually in social care costs, the council said.
In a cabinet meeting, the council agreed to launch a £2,000 public consultation with residents on the implementation of smoke-free public places.
The measure is one of a range of options proposed by the authority. Others include supporting families to quit and helping schools with educational material.
Ann James, cabinet member for health and social care, said: "Smokers have got to realise some people find it offensive. It's just asking them to be more considerate."
However, officers warned public support for smoke-free areas was "poor".
Smokers' rights group Forest said increasing numbers of councils were seeking to bring in voluntary bans, such as Brighton.
He said: "It's very patronising of local authorities to assume people need to be forced to quit.
"There is no evidence smoking outdoors is putting people's health at risk. The smoke is massively diluted and blows away on the breeze.
"Any voluntary ban is tantamount to a ban. It's a slippery slope. If these bans are ignored, the next stage is that people demand a law with penalties."
