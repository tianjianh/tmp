[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 3-2 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool ended a miserable run of form with a 3-2 win over Morecambe in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Without a win or a goal since 22 November, Hartlepool established control early on and bagged three goals in 14 first-half minutes.
They ended the drought after 10 minutes when Padraig Amond took a touch, turned and looped a volley over goalkeeper Barry Roche, who was slow to react as the ball sailed over him.
It only took four minutes for a second to arrive as Jake Carroll crossed from deep and defender Ryan Edwards handled the ball. Hartlepool missed a penalty last time out, but Billy Paynter made no mistake on this occasion as he sent Roche the wrong way.
A third goal for the home side came after 24 minutes. Michael Woods, whose inclusion was one of four line-up changes, was playing behind the front two and released a delightful pass for Nicky Featherstone to get in behind the defence. Featherstone showed great composure to finish.
In first-half injury time, the Shrimps should have got one back but Rhys Turner managed to clip his finish against the bar from eight yards.
They did score after 52 minutes when Hartlepool failed to clear from the back and a low shot from Andrew Fleming was deflected high into the net.
Morecambe scrambled a second in injury time but it came too late to deny the hosts.
