Northern Ireland striker Josh Magennis says Michael O'Neill's decision to make five changes for Thursday's Euro 2016 win over Ukraine was a masterstroke.

Manager O'Neill's selection included dropping star striker Kyle Lafferty but Northern Ireland won 2-0 to revive their hopes of reaching the last 16.
"It was a massive decision, and it paid off," said 25-year-old Magennis.
"If it had been Jose Mourinho or Roy Hodgson, he would be hailed as a magician."
Following a deserved day off, O'Neill and his Northern Ireland team returned to training on Saturday to prepare for the final Group C game against Germany.
After his team selection for Thursday's historic victory, few would put money on what O'Neill's line-up will be for Tuesday's crucial match at Parc des Princes.
Magennis said all the changes made by O'Neill after the opening 1-0 defeat by Poland had been entirely justified.
"There were not many who could say they deserved to stay in the team," he added.
"We went back to the format which worked for us in qualifying and the boys who stepped in were magnificent.
"We nullified their wide men who were their big threat."

Magennis said Northern Ireland would not be going out to try to hold the Germans to a draw.
"They are a dominant force who can hurt you from all angles - we know it is going to be tough," said Magennis.
"But as a group, from the manager to the kitman, everybody who wears the badge on their chest believes we can progress in this tournament.
"Our attitude is we are going to try to win this game. Every team has weaknesses and it is just a matter of us finding Germany's.
"There is no team we fear in this tournament."
