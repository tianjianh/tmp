[SN]TITLE[SN]
PM Herbert Asquith's birthplace for sale with 'Downing Street' door

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The birthplace of the British Prime Minister who took the country to war in 1914 has gone on sale in West Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Herbert Henry Asquith was born at Croft House in Morley, Leeds in 1852, the son of a cloth merchant.
The Grade II-listed house is on the market for Â£435,000.
The house's front door, which replicates 10 Downing Street's entrance, can only be opened from the inside.
Asquith became Liberal Prime Minister in 1908, until December 1916 when he resigned amid political unrest and was succeeded by his war secretary David Lloyd George.
Paul Cooke of estate agents Manning Stainton said the current owner is selling the building on on Church Street because she is downsizing but is "passionate about the house's political history."
