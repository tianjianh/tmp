It comes as cost cutting and "continued growth in digital income" countered what it said were "challenging" market conditions for print advertising
The Daily and Sunday Mirror publisher said first-half revenue fell by 8.7%, and publishing revenue fell by 8.8%.
Trinity Mirror publishes a number of UK newspapers, including The People, Liverpool Echo, Manchester Evening News, and Birmingham Mail.
But cost savings helped to limit the fall in adjusted profit before tax to  2.5% to Â£47m in the first half.
Meanwhile, revenue from print sales was down 11.6%.
Simon Fox, Chief Executive, Trinity Mirror plc, said: "The print advertising environment has been more challenging than anticipated in the first half," said Simon Fox, Trinity Mirror chief executive.
"As a result, whilst continuing to invest in people and technology to drive the ongoing growth in digital audience and revenue, we have taken further action to address our print cost base."
He said that the business had been generating cash to such an extent the group had a net cash position for the first time in its history at the end of the half year.
