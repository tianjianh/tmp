Police in Minneapolis arrested 51 people on Monday night following a second day of protests over the police shooting of a black man.

The 43 adults and eight juveniles were part of a group that blocked a major highway for two and a half hours.
Police have released little detail about the shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark, an assault suspect, who remains on life support in hospital.
Some witnesses have said that Mr Clark was handcuffed when he was shot.
A number of high-profile police shootings of black people have sparked protests nationwide about the police use of excessive force against African Americans.
The latest round of protests in Minneapolis came on the heels of the mayor's decision to ask the federal government to launch a civil rights investigation.
Mayor Betsy Hodges said she was asking for the investigation in the "interest of transparency and community confidence".
While a state agency has already launched a criminal investigation, the mayor said that the city needs "all the tools we have available to us".
Two officers involved in the shooting are on paid leave - which is standard procedure after incidents such as this.
The police chief has said that the officers were not wearing body cameras, but would not say whether the squad car or other surveillance video captured the incident.
Protesters have welcomed the federal investigation, but have vowed to continue demonstrating until any video of the situation is released and the officers involved are identified.
The protests began on Sunday and included an overnight encampment at a Minneapolis police station near the scene of the shooting.
At least eight tents were seen at the campsite on Monday, and a few protesters were sitting inside the glass doors of the station - including one who was knitting.
"We're still not moving until we get that footage," said Michael McDowell, a demonstrator with the Black Lives Matter movement.
According to police, the incident began at around 00:45 local time (06:45 GMT) on Sunday when police were called to north Minneapolis following the report of an assault.
Upon arriving at the scene, police found Mr Clark interfering with paramedics who were attempting to help the victim. They attempted to calm him, which resulted in a struggle and a shot being fired.
Mr Clark has not been formally identified by police, but was named by family members.
His father told the Associated Press news agency that his son suffered a single gunshot wound over his left eye.
