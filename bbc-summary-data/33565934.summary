The 24-year-old midfielder joined Dale from Stoke in 2013, but missed most of last season with a shoulder injury.
A former Northern Ireland Under-21 international, Lund started his career at Crewe and has also had stints at Oldham, Bristol Rovers and Southend.
"It shows that the manager has got faith in me by offering me a new contract," said Lund.
He joins Peter Vincenti in agreeing a new deal at Spotland this week.
