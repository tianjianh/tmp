Middlesbrough midfielder Adam Forshaw says Tuesday's 3-1 win against Cardiff was a "fitting" tribute to BBC Tees commentator Ali Brownlee.

Boro fans applauded in the 56th-minute of the game in memory of Brownlee who died at the age of 56 on 14 February.
"You're normally focused on the job in hand but you couldn't help but notice it," the 24-year-old told BBC Tees.
"It was such a touching moment in the game and it was fitting that we got the win for him."

The result, which was Middlesbrough's first victory in five games, capped off an emotional night on Teesside and put their promotion charge back on track.
"That was for Ali, the support and the meaning for it all was quite touching for everyone so for us to put in the performance and get the three goals in the end for him was fantastic," Forshaw added.
Third-placed Boro are now one point off automatic promotion, with two games in hand on second-placed Burnley.
And manager Aitor Karanka said the best way to honour Brownlee would be to achieve promotion after a seven-year spell out of the top flight.
"He is the kind of person you are never going to forget and for that reason we had to take his spirit and keep going. The best tribute for him would be for us to play in the Premier League," he said.
