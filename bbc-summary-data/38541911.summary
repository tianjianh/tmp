More from the inquest, and other news
The search started for Mr Clayton, from Taunton, after he went missing on 13 September 2015.
His body was discovered 10 days later by a French yachtsman.
Tom Leeper, barrister for the Clayton family, said other witnesses at the party said Mr Clayton was only "a bit drunk".
He told the inquest one witness had described Mr Clayton as "his normal affectionate self" on the night of the party.
Coastguards, police dogs, divers and a helicopter were involved in the search along with local people and holidaymakers.
Mr Clayton's disappearance was described as "out of character" at the time.
Pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said he found blood on Mr Clayton's T-shirt but no sign of an attack on him, and no sign of drugs.
The inquest continues.
