The right-back has been promoted from the stand-by list after Dani Carvajal suffered a thigh injury in Real Madrid's Champions League final win over Atletico Madrid.
Bellerin, 21, won his first full cap in a warm-up win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday night.
Midfielders Isco of Real Madrid and Atletico's Saul Niguez were left out.
Juanfran, who missed the crucial penalty in Saturday's Champions League final shootout, made the cut along with the his Atletico team-mate Koke and Real Madrid winger Lucas Vazquez.
Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and Manchester City's David Silva are both in Vicente del Bosque's squad.
Carvajal, 24, will miss the tournament in France after being substituted early in the second half of Real's win over Atletico in Milan.
"I had to leave and I knew there and then that I would probably miss Euro 2016," Carvajal told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope.
Spain, who won the tournament in 2008 and 2012, are in Group D alongside the Czech Republic, Turkey and Croatia.
