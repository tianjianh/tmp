[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Wilson is the new first team coach at Airdrieonians, with Gordon Dalziel taking on the role of director of football at the League One club.

Manager Eddie Wolecki Black suffered a stroke during a game in March and is unable to return.
Former Celtic and Dundee United full-back Wilson, 32, replaces Kevin McBride, who had stepped up from his Under-20s job to take over from Black.
Dalziel, 54, has managerial experience at Ayr United and Raith Rovers.
Meanwhile, former Scotland international Andy Goram has parted with the Diamonds as goalkeeping coach.
Airdrie returned to full-time football this summer after six years as a part-time outfit and they sit fourth in the league, seven points behind leaders Livingston.
"Sadly, the club has had significant challenges over the last six months, but matters must move on," said a club statement.
"Eddie Wolecki Black will now not be returning to us and we wish him all the best in his recovery.
"Kevin McBride stepped up from the U20s to take the post of acting head coach at a very difficult time for us all and we would like to thank him for all his help.
"However, we have been conducting a detailed review of all operations since commencing the full-time structure and it is now time to set the club on a more formal structured footing.
"The board has been concerned that the progress made, albeit under difficult circumstances, has not been in line with the substantial resources being invested so changes must be made to address this."
