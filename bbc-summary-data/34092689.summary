Isaac Nash's family raises £10,000 for RNLI through trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a schoolboy who was swept out to sea by waves off Anglesey and never found, will hand over £10,000 to RNLI from funds raised by a trust set up in his name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isaac Nash, 12, from Huddersfield, was on holiday when he got into difficulty at Aberffraw in August 2014.
The volunteer lifeboat crew at Trearddur Bay have also bought a plaque which will be placed in its boathouse.
An inquest earlier this year concluded Isaac's death was through misadventure.
