Marc Gray faces jail over Holy Cross Parish Church fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is facing a jail term for starting a fire which caused £85,000 of damage to a Glasgow church and garage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marc Gray and another man set the blaze at the garage beside Holy Cross Parish Church, Govanhill, in November 2013.
The fire destroyed the garage and two cars inside belonging to priests. It also caused damage to the church building.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Gray admitted setting the fire and was remanded in custody. Sentence was deferred.
The court heard that Gray and the other man had gone to the garage, in the city's south side, to look for re-usable bottles to take to a local shop.
When they were there, Gray gave the other man a lighter. He set fire to a jacket that was hanging up and the blaze quickly spread.
Gray was identified from CCTV as he fled the scene.
The court was told that there was some damage to the chapel building wall and two windows were smashed.
The damage to the building and garden and garage area was £70,913 and the damage to the two cars totalled £14,665.
