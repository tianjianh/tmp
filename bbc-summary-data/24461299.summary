Dr Akong Rinpoche set up the Samye Ling Tibetan centre in Dumfries and Galloway in 1967.
A statement from police in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Tuesday said Dr Rinpoche, his nephew and his driver had been killed in a residential area.
Dumfriesshire MSP Elaine Murray said he had been an influential figure in southern Scotland and beyond.
"His founding of the Samye Ling Tibetan centre had a major impact not just on our region but on Britain as a whole," she said.
"Although he is no longer with us, Dr Rinpoche's legacy in our area will endure.
"My thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time."
A statement from Chinese police said three suspects - all of whom were Tibetan - had stabbed the men to death in a dispute about money.
It said they had confessed to the crime and the case was still under investigation.
