[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan ground their way to a five-wicket victory over Worcestershire thanks to a marathon career-best of 103 not out by Owen Morgan.

Morgan, 22, played a composed knock to register the highest ever score by a Glamorgan night-watchman.
Morgan shared partnerships of 59 with Jacques Rudolph, 88 with Will Bragg, and 99 with Aneurin Donald (57).
The loss is a blow to Worcestershire's pursuit of leaders Essex.
Worcestershire did not manage to overcome a slow and unresponsive New Road pitch despite the continuing efforts of Joe Leach, with 108 runs and eight wickets in the match.
Donald started slowly, but changed the tempo with 17 runs off the first over with the new ball to erase lingering home hopes.
Morgan wrote his own script by reaching his century with the winning boundary after batting since the third ball of the innings.
His knock overtook the previous night-watchman best of 84, by Colin Metson against Kent in 1991.
It was only Glamorgan's second Championship win of the 2016 season.
Worcestershire have a rapid turn-around for their One-Day Cup quarter-final away to Somerset on Wednesday 17 August.
Glamorgan's Owen Morgan told BBC Wales Sport: "Not in my wildest imagination (did I think I'd bat through), my main target was to see out the first hour with Jakesy (captain Jacques Rudolph), and hopefully build from there.
"Thankfully I managed to bat the whole day, I didn't think of seeing it through until Aneurin (Donald) started whacking a few and the winning line came in sight quite quickly.
"At the start of the year I wouldn't have imagined myself in this position, so I'm very pleased. I've always been able to bat but this year it's glued together a bit more and it's given me a lot more more confidence.
"Being a bowler is obviously my main suit but hopefully I can become a good all-rounder."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Radio Hereford & Worcester: "The first-innings batting cost us at 37 for 5, we tried to play catch-up cricket and we fought back really hard but we need to start the match better.
"It was 50/50 overnight but the wicket wasn't deteriorating, it got a bit flatter and the foot-holes didn't react badly for the batsmen.
"We'll take our hat off to Morgan, who applied himself really well and deserved to be on the winning side, though Joe Leach was unlucky to be on the losing side.
"Somerset have had a week off and it would be lovely to have that to prepare for white-ball cricket, but we've had a tough four days. Energy levels seem to come back in a quarter-final though with a lot at stake and a big crowd."
