Next week's junior doctor strike on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Next week's strike by junior doctors in England will go ahead as talks with the government have failed to reach a solution - but union leaders say medics will provide emergency cover.

The 10 February action was originally a full walk-out meaning medics would not have staffed emergency care.
It would have been an historic move and caused major disruption to hospitals.
But the British Medical Association has now stepped back from that, saying it wants to minimise disruption.
However, the strike will last longer than planned - 24 hours rather than the 08:00 to 17:00 which was first announced.
But the decision to scale back on the scope of the strike will bring a huge sigh of relief to hospitals.
A full walk-out has never happened before in the history of the NHS and would have led to a mass cancellation of routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, as consultants and other staff were redeployed to cover behind the junior doctors.
The stoppage will be the second walk-out by junior doctors over the contract dispute.
The first took place over 24 hours on 12 January and led to about one in 10 non-emergency operations being cancelled, while a 48-hour walk-out planned for last week was called off while talks took place at the conciliation service Acas.

BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said despite some "good progress" the union had been left no choice but to announced the stoppage would take place.
He accused the government of taking an "entrenched" position.
The key sticking point is thought to be the government's insistence that the amount of extra pay that doctors get for working a Saturday is cut.
The union had also raised concerns about career progression and patient safety.
Dr Malawana said: "What we are asking for is fair and affordable recognition of unsocial hours."
"We deeply regret the disruption action will cause," he added.
