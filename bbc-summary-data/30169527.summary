And the first voice to congratulate him when he crossed the line was Prince Harry's.
"Thank you very much Lewis for not letting the British public down. Well done Lewis you are a legend," he said over the Mercedes team radio.
"Woooooaaahh world champion, oh my god, can't believe it, thanks everyone," replied the new world champion.
The driver's friends and family, including girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, were among the first to see him after he left his car.
The singer said: "For me he's always a world champion. So I'm just really proud of his dedication and heart and sacrifice this year and I'm really glad it's paid off."
And although support of split ahead of the race, some big names from the world of sport, and Brian Mcfadden, were quick to followed Prince Harry in saying well done.
And even if they weren't congratulating Lewis on his win, other stars were in Abu Dhabi to soak up the atmosphere.
After qualifying, Hamilton - who has become the fourth British driver to win more than one world title, was pictured with Pharrell Williams and Fast and Furious actor Tyrese.
