The left-back scored a fine leveller in the 72nd minute after the home side took the lead early in the second half through Dean Winnard.
Michael Rose swung over a left-wing corner that was flicked on by Cole Stockton and Winnard sneaked in at the far post to stroke the loose ball home from close range.
But Sterry replied with a fine goal after he cut inside onto his right foot and drilled a low shot that beat Barry Roche to his left and went in off the foot of the left-hand post
Morecambe wasted a glorious chance to win the game three minutes later when Lee Burge saved well from Stockton's shot on the turn and Tom Barkhuizen somehow managed to miss the target from the rebound from six yards.
The Shrimps had dominated the first half but failed to make the most of chances they created
The closest they came to an opener was when Aaron Wildig saw a close-range shot superbly cleared off the line by Jordan Willis after being found by Barkhuizen.
Before that City keeper Burge made excellent blocks to deny Stockton from close range and Rose who let fly with two goalbound efforts from distance.
