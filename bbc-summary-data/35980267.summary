Clive Arrowsmith, who was born in Mancot and grew up in Mold, Flintshire, unearthed the original photos from his loft in London.
They were taken at the end of a shoot for The Wings' Speed of Sound album in 1976 and during the 1993 session for McCartney's solo album Off The Ground.
They have been scanned and published.
The Royal Photographic Society's magazine The Journal has featured the pictures after Mr Arrowsmith showed them to a friend.
Mr Arrowsmith said finding the pictures has triggered a lot of happy memories for him.
"They really capture the seminal moments of the shoot when it all came together," he said.
"The fun we were all having, plus Paul and Linda's closeness, it's the naturalness of the pictures that is the key to their success."
He told BBC Wales: "I kept copies for myself and sent some to Paul but I've never seen him release them."
Mr Arrowsmith, who came to know The Beatles through Stuart Sutcliffe while studying in Queensferry, has also snapped the likes of Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench, Art Garfunkel, Def Leppard, Prince Charles, Michael Caine and the Dalai Lama.
