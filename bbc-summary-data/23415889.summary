Forty-eight people had to be rescued from the 14-loop ride, called The Smiler, on Sunday.
A spokesperson from the amusement park said a small piece of debris had allegedly fallen from the track.
"The health and safety of our guests is our primary concern [and] the ride will remain closed whilst the resort's technical team investigate," they said.
Staff are working to reopen the ride as soon as possible.
The Smiler - which includes a drop of 30m (98ft) - opened in May.
