Gay US veteran's discharge upgraded to honourable after 68 years

A 91-year-old servicemen who was sacked from the US Air Force in 1948 because he was gay has succeeded in getting his dismissal reclassified as an honourable discharge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward Spires served as a chaplain's assistant before being removed because he was deemed "undesirable".
He was forced out of the military after a probe into his sexual orientation.
The Air Force announced a discharge upgrade on Friday in response to a lawsuit filed by Mr Spires in November.
The veteran was initially denied an honourable discharge because the Air Force said his records had probably been destroyed in a 1973 fire.
But with the help of lawyers he was able to prove that he did indeed serve - and is now entitled to financial benefits and a military funeral because of the discharge upgrade.
Mr Spires has described his removal from the military as a "horrific and unbearable" experience.
His case has been backed by Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that the move by the Air Force rectifies "an incredible injustice".
