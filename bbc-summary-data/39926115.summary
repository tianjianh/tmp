Four transformers for an electricity substation in Caithness have arrived in the area by sea from Sweden.

Each of the four large pieces of equipment weighs about 170 tonnes.
They have been unloaded from a ship at Port of Scrabster, near Thurso, to be taken by road to SSE's Spittal substation at Achanarras.
