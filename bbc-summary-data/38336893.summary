Philip Hammond said he hoped more discussions mean "we are able to move forward in the new year".
Japanese-owned Horizon Nuclear Power wants to submit planning applications for the Wylfa Newydd reactors on Anglesey in 2017.
Energy Secretary Greg Clark will fly out to Japan for more talks next week.
Talking to reporters in Tokyo, Mr Hammond said the companies involved in the Wylfa Newydd bid had been "trying to put together a financing package that meets our requirements".
"We are very grateful to the Japanese system for the way it has engaged with our particular needs and think we are making good progress."
Mr Hammond had negotiations with Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and Mr Clark will follow him out to the Far East before Christmas for what was hoped to be a "fruitful discussion".
"He is coming to talk with representatives of the government and the companies as we try to take this project forward," said the chancellor.
Hitachi, which owns Horizon Nuclear, has declined to comment on reports it is in discussions with banks over funding the project, or at what stage talks are at with the UK Government.
However, a spokesperson for Horizon added: ""It is no secret that we are in discussions with the UK Government and have been for some time. These discussions are of course complex and while they are ongoing it would be premature and inappropriate for us to comment on the nature of them."
