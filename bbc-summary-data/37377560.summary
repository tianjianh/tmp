Mark Warburton: Rangers boss rounds on 'negativity' following Old Firm loss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Mark Warburton says media coverage following Rangers' 5-1 defeat by Celtic has been "inappropriate" and "depressing".

The Ibrox side suffered their first Premiership defeat of the season at Celtic Park on Saturday.
"The whole media aspect up here is so negative," said Warburton, whose team host Ross County on Saturday.
"I'm not understating the importance of the result but no-one has died. We've got to get on with it."
Warburton referred to press and television coverage and compared it to his view of the way the Scottish game is reported in England.
His side have won two of their five Premiership games this season, dropping points to Hamilton and Kilmarnock before the defeat at Celtic Park last weekend.
The result left Celtic four points ahead of Rangers, and two clear of Hearts, at the top of the table and with one game in hand.
"I'm an Englishman working in Scotland and I find it depressing that some of the comments, some of the programmes on TV, are so negative," Warburton said.
"One of the comments that irritated was, 'Go to your friends on TalkSport for a positive outlook'.
"I'd rather have a positive outlook. I'm not going to say you enjoy losing but I'd rather have a positive outlook on football than a negative one.
"Too many aspects of the Scottish media are negative and it would be good for everybody in the game if there was a little bit positivity when the situation arises. I'm told it's part of the culture. I can't understand it.
"Before Saturday I heard TalkSport say, 'Good start to the season. Unbeaten. Things are shaping up well'. But the Scottish version is, 'Just drawn with Kilmarnock - disaster'. It's two completely different perspectives on the game."
Rangers face Ross County at home on Saturday, but face trips to Aberdeen, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hearts in their next five games.
"People keep asking me if I'm okay. Of course we're okay," Warburton said.
"We are professionals. The result hurt so many people, none more so than us, but we have to get on with it."
