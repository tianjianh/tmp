The body of Kirk Cole, 36, was found in a flat in Cairnhill Drive at about 09:15 on Thursday.
Following a post-mortem examination on Friday, police said they were now treating the death as murder.
A Police Scotland spokesman said relatives had been made aware and a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.
Det Ch Insp Alan McAlpine, of Police Scotland's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "My officers are currently reviewing CCTV and carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
"Our initial inquiries have revealed that Mr Cole was with a friend within a flat in Cairnhill Drive from around 2100hrs on Wednesday 21 June.
"We also believe that at least one person, possibly more, arrived at the flat during that night and into the early hours of the morning.
"Early indications suggest that there may have been a disturbance at the flat during the night and therefore it is vital that anyone who was with Mr Cole since 2100hrs on Wednesday 21 June until the early hours of Thursday morning contact police immediately."
He added: "A police incident caravan will remain at the scene and there will be extra patrols in the area. However, I must stress that there is no information to suggest that anyone else in the local area is at risk.
"I'd encourage local residents to speak to the officers in the area if they have any concerns."
