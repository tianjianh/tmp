[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed that Liam Kerr, 19, died on Thursday. He had been in hospital since an incident on 13 January.
A second inmate, Robert Wagstaff, 18, died on Sunday.
A spokesman for the SPS said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding either of the deaths and reports would be sent to the procurator fiscal.
He added that their next of kin have been informed and fatal accident inquiries may be held in due course.
Both men were serving sentences at the young offenders institution near Falkirk after being convicted at Paisley Sheriff Court last year.
