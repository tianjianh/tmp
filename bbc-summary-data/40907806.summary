[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall continued their winless start to the Championship season despite holding Bristol City to a hard-fought goalless draw at Ashton Gate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lions created the better of the chances, with Jed Wallace forcing Robins goalkeeper Frank Fielding into a fine safe after half-time.
Left-back Joe Bryan went closest for the hosts, hitting the crossbar after exchanging passes with Bobby Reid.
Bristol City are now without a victory in their past three matches.
Having snatched a last-gasp draw at Brentford on Tuesday, Lee Johnson's side were again short of their best against a hard-working Millwall side.
Steve Morison and Conor McLaughlin missed further opportunities for the Lions, who have two draws and two defeats from their first four games.
Millwall manager Neil Harris:
"I was delighted with the way we nullified Bristol City's strengths and kept them under pressure. All we lacked was a bit of luck in front of goal.
"Our defending as a team was terrific and my strikers also looked dangerous going forward.
"If they keep playing like they have been this season victories will come soon. It is only a matter of time before we get the right reward."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson:
"I'm slightly disappointed, but still proud of my players for the commitment they showed to achieve our first clean sheet of the season.
"It was a very tough game for us and Millwall deserve credit for that.
"The fans will probably be disappointed that we weren't as creative as in our previous home games, but it was asking a lot to maintain that standard."
