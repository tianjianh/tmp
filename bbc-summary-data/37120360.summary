Harry Monaghan poked home the opening goal in the 39th minute after the ball had been headed down inside the area.
Nathan Boyle sneaked in at the back post to hammer home his eighth goal of the season after 48 minutes.
For the Candystripes, it was their third victory over Bohs this season. Kenny Shiels's side having also won two league encounters between the sides.
Shiels opted to rest a number of players for the third round tie, including striker Rory Patterson, who was named among the substitutes.
Patterson had scored the match-winning goal in both Premier Division clashes between the teams, including a 1-0 triumph at the same venue four weeks ago.
With regular central defensive pair Ryan McBride and Aaron Barry both injured, former Alicante defender Christian Castells was handed his debut, while it was revealed prior to kick-off that Austrian centre-back Max Karner had been signed until the end of the season to provide further cover.
Keith Ward, Monaghan and Ronan Curtis came into the starting line-up as Derry continued their bid to win the FAI Cup for the sixth time in their history, their last final appearance having come in 2014.
The Brandywell men had sealed their place in the last 16 with a 2-1 replay win away to Drogheda in round two in May, the sides having drawn 1-1 in the initial tie.
The hosts had a couple of first-half chances but Stephen Best headed straight at Ger Doherty and Mark Quigley's headed effort went over the bar.
At the other end, Dean Delany saved from Curtis, before the impressive Monaghan nudged his side in front, and Boyle extended the visitors' advantage.
Derry had opportunities to add to their tally, Curtis flashing a header narrowly wide, Conor McCormack firing a 25-yard shot just over and Patterson seeing an attempt cleared off the line.
For the home side, Dan Byrne headed over and Paddy Kavanagh struck the woodwork, before Doherty saved the rebound from the same player on the line.
