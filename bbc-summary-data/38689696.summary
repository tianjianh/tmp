Brexit: The big decision being announced on Tuesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An important decision is being announced on Tuesday morning about the way that the UK can officially start the process to leave the European Union (EU).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
UK Prime Minister Theresa May thinks that she has the power to start the process herself, without asking Parliament's permission.
But others think that she should have to ask Parliament before she can do this.
The Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country, will decide whether or not Theresa May needs to ask for Parliament's approval.
All 11 Supreme Court judges have come together to decide this, which has never happened since the group was created in 1876 (although it was called something different back then). This shows how significant it is.
While UK adults have voted that they want to leave the EU, the official process to leave hasn't started yet.
Ever since the UK voted to leave the EU, there have been discussions about how the UK can officially start the process to leave the group.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May wants to start the process by doing something called triggering Article 50. Ricky explains what this is below.
She does not think she needs to ask the rest of Parliament for permission to do this because the UK government has something called 'prerogative powers'.
This is an old type of power from when kings and queens could basically do what they wanted.
But not everyone agrees that this is the case here.
Others think Theresa May should have to ask for Parliament's permission before she can trigger Article 50 and officially start the process for the UK to leave the EU.
This is because of how much it could affect the lives of people who live in the UK.
The case also involves the governments in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
They say they have a right to be involved in certain Brexit decisions because of how the result could affect people living in their countries, which make up the UK.
Not everyone agrees on how much say these other governments should have.
On 3 November, the High Court - which is a court below the Supreme Court - decided the government did not have the power to trigger Article 50 without getting approval from Parliament.
But the UK government did not accept this decision.
Now, the Article 50 issue is being decided by the most important court in the country, the Supreme Court - and this decision will be final.
The Supreme Court is not going to decide whether or not the UK should leave the EU.
It is ruling on who can start the process to leave - and how.
On Tuesday morning, we will find out if Theresa May has the power to trigger Article 50 - and officially start the process for the UK to leave the EU - without asking Parliament first.
If the Supreme Court says that Parliament does get to give its approval, a special piece of law may need to be made for it.
It is expected that Theresa May would hurry to get this sorted, so that she can have the vote in Parliament and hopefully trigger Article 50 before the end of March, as this is when she has said she wants to do it.
If the Supreme Court says that Parliament does not need to give its approval, it is thought that Theresa May will trigger Article 50 at some point over the coming weeks.
However, we have to wait to see what will happen, and when.
Once Article 50 is triggered, the UK will not be able to come back into the EU unless all the other 27 countries in the group agree that it can.
