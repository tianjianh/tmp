Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn.
Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights.
The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid.
In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout.
It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division.
He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux.
On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez.
Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests.
"This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight.
"I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago.
"Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me.
"We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight.
"I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion.
"I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."
