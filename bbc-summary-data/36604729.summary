The 22-year-old forward has made over 100 appearances since his Rugby Park debut in April 2011.
Having scored three goals in 33 appearances last season - often in a wide position - McKenzie is hoping to play a more central role.
"I'm looking forward to next season. There have been big changes at the club," he said.
"The whole place needed a revamp."
Manager Lee Clark is planning a major overhaul after keeping Killie in the top flight following a play-off final with Falkirk.
Eight out-of-contract players have moved on and another seven were placed on the transfer list, with Kevin McHattie, Mark O'Hara and David Syme having found new clubs.
