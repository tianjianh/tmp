Jan Woerner: New director general takes Esa reins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The European Space Agency (Esa) has a new director general from Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Johann-Dietrich Woerner vacates his chairmanship of the German space agency (DLR) to take the reins at the Paris-based organisation for an initial period of four years.
He succeeds Frenchman Jean-Jacques Dordain, who had been in post since 2003 - the longest any individual has been DG in the agency’s history.
Mr Woerner has told delegations that he will be reviewing Esa’s structure.
Current directors are staying in post, but there is likely to be change in the coming year as he draws new lines of responsibility for Esa's executive.
The agency’s most high-profile mission currently is Rosetta and its investigations at Comet 67P, but the future programme is a busy one, as the agency seeks to build a new rocket, extend its participation in the space station, land on Mars, loft constellations of sat-nav and Earth-observation spacecraft, while at the same time overhauling Europe’s weather satellites.
"After harvesting the seeds my next task to fulfil is continuation," Mr Woerner told reporters at the recent Paris Airshow.
"It's very simple: it's Ariane 6, it's ISS, it's ExoMars, Galileo, Copernicus , MSG, MTG, EDRS, and so and so on.
"There are a lot of programmes running, and it will be my automatic duty to continue in these programmes together with the member states, the executive and all Esa staff."
Mr Woerner likes to talk about what he calls "Space 4.0".  This is the new era of space endeavour following astronomy (1.0), Apollo (2.0) and the ISS project (3.0).
Space 4.0 is all about day-to-day business, interactions with society in general, and the commercialisation of all areas of activity.  And that, Mr Woerner believes, requires new roles and new relationships for the traditional space actors like Esa.
He has talked of making Esa more transparent and approachable. He wants to see "Jam sessions" that would open up agency policy to outside suggestions.
"We would like to have people from very different backgrounds - not just the people baptised with the water of space, but also people from other areas, because space nowadays is in everyone’s hands, in their homes.
"And after eight years at the top of DLR, I know that people are really interested in space. And I think we can get from them a lot of good ideas and visions on what to do, and where the priorities should be, because money is always limited."
Mr Woerner has written a blog to mark his first day in office.
