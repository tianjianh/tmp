US election: To endorse or not endorse Donald Trump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some of Donald Trump's defeated rivals for the Republican ticket have been back in the spotlight at the US Republican convention in Cleveland, Ohio, with the party waiting to hear how, or even if, they would endorse him.

So what did they say? Did they even show up? And was it something Donald Trump said?
He is in Cleveland, but has been avoiding the convention hall and has refused to endorse Mr Trump.
Booed for failing to endorse Mr Trump, though he did congratulate the businessman on winning the nomination. Mr Cruz's words which caused most offense were: "Please, don't stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution."
Did not turn up in the flesh but sent a pre-recorded video message in which he said: "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is committed to cut taxes, curb spending, and get our national debt under control... The time for fighting each other is over, it's time to come together and fight for a new direction for America, it's time to win in November."
Told convention: "I'm proud to support Donald Trump, an extraordinary businessman. The right leader for a time such as this."
Like his father George and brother George W, he is staying away from the convention. In an email to Reuters news agency, he wrote: "Working out of my office in Miami this week".
The New Jersey governor told the convention: "We have a man who is unafraid. We have a man who wants to lead us. We have a man who understands the frustrations and the aspirations of our fellow citizens... It is time to come together and make sure that Donald Trump is our next president."
Other former contenders
Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul were both expected to stay away from the convention, according to US broadcaster NPR. Mike Huckabee congratulated Mr Trump on his nomination in a tweet, and attacked other former contenders for failing to endorse him.
