Police forensics: Lawrence duo 'could cheat justice today'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stephen Lawrence's killers might escape justice if their cold case were looked at today, due to a crisis in police forensics, a top scientist has warned.

Gary Dobson was jailed after forensic experts found a droplet of Mr Lawrence's blood on fibres in his coat.
But a BBC London investigation has been told the number of forensic fibre experts has plummeted from 40 to six due to a drain in expertise.
The Met said fibre forensics are less important in the era of DNA.
A Freedom of Information request by the BBC suggested increasing problems with forensic work since the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was shut down in 2012 to save money.
The FSS was replaced by a mixture of private and police-run laboratories.
Last year saw a spike in the number of complaints made about the quality of work by lawyers or police officers to seven - up from three in 2013 and one in 2012.
The BBC has also learned the Met routinely uses laboratories that do not meet the ISO 17025 gold standard accreditation, leading forensic experts to warn about the potential for miscarriages of justice.
Tiernan Coyle, chief scientist at private laboratory Contact Traces, warned the drop in fibre experts meant so much expertise has been lost that the Dobson evidence may not have been found, were the Lawrence case subjected to a cold case review today.
In 2012 Dobson and Stephen Norris were both jailed for life over the 1993 killing. Three other suspects, Luke Knight and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, have never been brought to trial for lack of evidence.
The process that eventually saw Dobson and Norris brought to justice began in 2007 with a cold case review that used new technology to re-examine forensic evidence.
Mr Coyle, who worked on both the Lawrence and Damilola Taylor cases, said: "You need a body of expertise in the country available to do fibre work - we are at a skeleton crew level.
"Any further loss would see the country lose its fibre expertise altogether. Our staffing levels are at dangerously low levels."
He warned many police are not routinely recovering fibres as they used to, while some police forces now use non-scientific personnel to decide the forensic approach.
Of the laboratories lacking ISO 17025 accreditation, he said: "Accreditation matters because it provides reassurance to the public and the criminal justice system that what you are doing is fit for purpose.
"We've got the potential for evidence to be presented from unaccredited laboratories which may be dubious and could lead to a miscarriage of justice."
His concerns were echoed by Dr Sue Pope, a consultant forensic scientist and DNA expert at Principle Forensic Services.
She said the use of numerous smaller laboratories instead of a centralised service meant there was a risk due to "fragmentation".
Dr Pope explained: "A single sample could go through a number of different providers before a result is ready to present to a court. My concern is there is no one person who has an overview of the history of this sample.
"A person will have been charged on the basis of a DNA match, but at court the issues are not about whose DNA this is, but how it got there. The reaction is very often to drop the case.
"Perhaps a person who should have been convicted isn't. It's also possible a person who shouldn't have been convicted is."
Dr Gillian Tully, the Forensic Science Regulator, said: "The vast majority of forensic work is done to a very high quality.
"Reductions in spending have significantly impacted on the number of really experienced qualified forensics scientists we have, and have the potential to impact more on smaller evidence types.
"There certainly is a possibility in fibres that we could see quite a catastrophic loss of expertise."
She added: "There are always going to be balances with respect to what resources the police have, because someone has to pay for forensic science and the pot of money is not endless."
Gary Pugh, director of forensic services at the Metropolitan Police, denied there was a crisis.
He said: "We had some real challenges when the FSS closed. That left a capacity gap and we had to take action.
"I think we have got on a reasonably even keel. But the austerity that faces the whole of the public sector really does give us a challenge."
Mr Pugh said he could not comment on the Lawrence investigation, but he said the use of fibre evidence was now less called for.
He said: "Fibre examination in general has reduced as science has progressed. In days gone by when there wasn't DNA profiling we would have looked for fibres.
"But nowadays we might find your DNA and that would provide much more powerful evidence than fibres would."
The Met said the number of complaints had to be seen in the context of 100,000 annual forensic submissions.
It insisted the force operates to all industry standards when it comes to accreditation.
Home Office minister Damien Green said: "There is no evidence that Forensic Science Providers and police laboratories are not delivering at least the same level of service to the Criminal Justice Service as the FSS.
"We monitor the market closely to make sure it remains competitive and it continues to provide forces with what they need."
