The 23-year-old versatile attacking midfielder previously played for Preston and joined Brighton in 2012.
He did not play for the Seagulls but had loan spells at five British clubs, including Aberdeen, before switching to Romanian side Voluntari in January.
He was close to signing for League Two outfit Cheltenham Town in August, but the move was never finalised.
He told Sutton United's website: "I had other options to sign for Football League teams but, having spoken to the gaffer, I really feel this is the right move for me at this stage of my career."
