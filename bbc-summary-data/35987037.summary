Speaking to BBC Newsnight in his first interview since his release last month, Mr Haigh said there had been five "serious episodes" of physical abuse.
He claims he was tasered, hit, and threatened during detention in Dubai, which lasted a total of 23 months.
The authorities in Dubai have yet to comment on his allegations. Mr Haigh spoke to Newsnight's Mark Lobel.
