It will become the 19th member of the eurozone out of 28 countries in the European Union, and the last of the Baltic states to join.
The Commission, in its report, said a formal decision would be made by EU governments next month.
The UK and Denmark are the only EU states with opt-outs from the euro.
All other countries are expected to join. Estonia was the first Baltic state to become a member of the eurozone in 2011, followed by Latvia on 1 January 2014.
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, on a visit to Poland, welcomed the decision: "We'll be in the club of the strongest, we'll be able to take part in the decisions ourselves - currently we are on the other side of the door."

Prospective members have to meet "convergence criteria", which are also assessed by the European Central Bank (ECB), requiring
In its assessment, the ECB warned that keeping inflation low in Lithuania "will be challenging in the medium term". Lithuania tried to join the euro earlier but was badly affected by the financial crisis.
However, EU Economics Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn praised the economic reforms adopted by the government in Vilnius.
"That reform momentum, driven in part by Lithuania's EU accession 10 years ago, has led to a striking increase in Lithuanians' prosperity," he said in a statement.
