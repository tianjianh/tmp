US Open 2015: Andy Murray & Jo Konta aim for last eight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britons Andy Murray and Jo Konta will take hugely different levels of experience into their US Open fourth-round matches on Monday.

Murray will play South African 14th seed Kevin Anderson on Louis Armstrong Stadium at around 20:00 BST.
The Scot has been to at least the quarter-finals at the last 18 Grand Slams, while Konta had never been past round two before this week.
She plays Petra Kvitova in the first night match at 00:00 BST on Tuesday.
Five-time champion Roger Federer will play American number one John Isner in the second night session match on Arthur Ashe Stadium.
"She's obviously been on an excellent run lately," Murray said of Konta. "She's very close to being the number one in Britain.
"It suggests she has the potential to go very high if she continues on the right path."
British number one Murray looked to have put some early drama and a nagging cold behind him in his previous match.
The 28-year-old came through a high-profile first-round encounter against Nick Kyrgios and then fell two sets down before beating Adrian Mannarino in round two.
Brazilian 30th seed Thomaz Bellucci was seen off in straight sets on Saturday, to leave Murray facing Anderson for the seventh time.
He leads the head-to-head 5-1 but Anderson is a man on the up, at his career-high ranking off 14, through to his first US Open fourth round and top of the aces charts with 69.
"Getting a lot of returns in play is something that throughout most of my career I've been good at," said Murray.
"Often the big servers come into matches used to getting a lot of free points. It changes their mindset a little bit in the way they play the match and play the points."
Anderson, 29, has now reached the fourth round at all four Grand Slam without taking the next step.
"Obviously it would mean a lot," he said. "I've been in the fourth round a few times but it's my first time here and it's obviously a small step in the right direction."
Konta began her US Open campaign in qualifying against Hungarian Reka-Luca Jani on 26 August, since when her career has been transformed.
A winning run in challenger events has stretched to 16 matches in New York, a first trip into week two of a Grand Slam and now the prospect of facing two-time Wimbledon champion Kvitova on the biggest court in tennis.
"A two-time Grand Slam champion, I'm feeling pretty lucky that I get an opportunity to play against such a player," said Konta.
The pair have never met on court - the closest they have come is sharing lockers near each other at Flushing Meadows - and the gulf in experience is huge.
However, Konta has already knocked out two seeds this week and Kvitova could start feeling the effects of a busy fortnight.
The Czech won the title in New Haven last Saturday and then headed straight to New York, where she has struggled in the past and is yet to get past round four.
Kvitova has also been limiting her practice time as she recovers from glandular fever.
"When you're winning everything a little bit easier," sad Kvitova. "Mentally I'm feeling great."
