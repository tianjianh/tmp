New Zealand-born McIntosh left his role as Pontypridd head coach to join the Blues on a full-time basis in 2013.
The 45-year-old spent two spells alongside Paul John in caretaker charge of the region.
"I leave with a lot of fond memories and life changing experiences," McIntosh said.
"The only regret I have is not being able to help the region to be more successful in achieving European Champions Cup status."
McIntosh's departure comes a week after former Wales Under-20 coach Danny Wilson was appointed Blues head coach.
Blues say Wilson will appoint his own backroom staff in contrast to predecessor Mark Hammett, who did not have his own coaching team.
McIntosh and backs coach John had been in temporary charge of the Blues after Hammett left his role as director of rugby only six months into a three-year contract.
The pair had also been in caretaker prior to Hammett's appointment after Phil Davies stepped down in March 2014.
McIntosh, nicknamed 'The Chief', won two caps for Wales during a notable playing career with Pontypridd, whom he later coach.
"He has been an extremely popular member of the coaching team and has worked passionately to develop our forwards and to try and secure positive results," Blues chief executive Richard Holland said.
"Our head coach, Danny Wilson, is looking at the make-up and dynamic of the coaching team he wants to take us forward over the coming years.
"Further announcements will be made in due course."
