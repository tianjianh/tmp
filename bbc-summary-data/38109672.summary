Jack Wilshere: Arsenal will offer midfielder a new contract, says Arsene Wenger

Arsenal will offer Jack Wilshere a new contract, says manager Arsene Wenger.

The midfielder, 24, has made nine Premier League appearances for Bournemouth since joining the Cherries on a season-long loan in August.
Wilshere has 18 months left on his Gunners deal, and Wenger said he has not spoken to the England international since he left on loan.
But, speaking of contract talks, Wenger said: "We have to plan that around the new year."
Wilshere has struggled with a number of injuries in recent seasons and made only three appearances for the Gunners in 2015-16.
In contrast, he has started Bournemouth's past eight league matches and was recently recalled by England, for whom he was an unused substitute against Scotland and Spain earlier this month.
"That's exactly what he needed - to have regular football, maybe not every three days but every week at the start," said Wenger.
"That has helped him a lot to develop and come back to the level he deserves to be at.
"He gets regular football and now on the observations I get from our people who watch him, he's getting stronger every week.
"I leave him to deal with his manager. I read the reports and when I can see highlights or watch him on television, I will watch him."
Eddie Howe's Bournemouth face Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Sunday with Wilshere - who has said he wants the Cherries to win - ineligible to face his parent club.
"That is normal when you're committed to a club," added Wenger.
"When you sign for a club, you are committed to a project and you have to do well in that season."
