Trott took the women's title in a sprint finish ahead of Dani King and defending champion Lizzie Armitstead.
The men's race was also won in dramatic fashion as Kennaugh, 26, overtook his fellow Team Sky rider Ben Swift on the line.
"Maybe out of the whole peloton I was the guy who wanted it the most," Kennaugh told BBC Sport.
He added: "It feels amazing to finally win the race as for years I've been second, third, fourth.
"I came here so focused. When I was in that mood today I thought if it doesn't happen this year it's probably never going to happen.
"But today I rode it well tactically."
Simon Yates of Orica Green Edge took bronze ahead of Wales and Team Sky's Luke Rowe.
Trott, who also retained her Under-23 crown, said the victory was "up there with winning a World Championships".
Boels Dolmans rider Armitstead was in front by 15 seconds at one point and still led with 5km to go of the 101km race.
But she was caught by Trott, 22, and her Wiggle Honda team-mate King, 23, on the final lap.
Double Olympic gold medallist Trott, a four-time world champion in the team pursuit, said she had been "really disappointed" after Thursday's time trial when she finished fifth behind Emma Pooley.
"I woke up this morning and I just really, really wanted to win," Trott told BBC Sport. "To try and beat someone like Lizzie Armitstead - I just didn't really know how we were going to do it.
"I didn't feel very good or strong enough. But she was only 10 seconds ahead and Dani King made the jump and it all came back together."
Second-placed Armitstead  said: "It was a case of being aggressive all day and then unfortunately I was in a solo break and got caught on the last lap and didn't quite have anything left for the sprint.
"I'm gutted. It's not the biggest goal of my season so I'll get over it - but it's a disappointment."
With defending champion Mark Cavendish absent from the men's race with bronchitis and Sir Bradley Wiggins pulling out through injury, the scene was set for double Olympic track champion Geraint Thomas to win on home soil.
As the race entered Abergavenny, the Wales and Team Sky rider launched a solo attack in a bid to reel in the leading pack.
But the 28-year-old failed to close the gap and eventually finished eighth.
The hopes of the home supporters then turned to Thomas's team-mate Rowe, who opened up a nine-second lead as he tried to pull clear with five circuits of the town to go.
But he was hauled back and had to settle for fourth, as Kennaugh and Swift made a decisive break to battle it out for the title.
Manxman Kennaugh was omitted from Team Sky's line-up to compete at this year's Tour de France, which begins on 5 July in Yorkshire.
He said it was a "great shame" to miss out on the Tour, but added: "I wanted this race badly whether I was in the Tour or not."
