NI Events Company: Top civil servant defends £1.2m investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top civil servant has defended a £1.2m tax-payer investigation into the NI Events Company, saying he believed it was value for money.

But MLAs heard there was no business case and the initial cost was estimated at a sum of at least £250,000.
The investigation, launched by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti), took five-and-a-half years to complete.
It was carried out by an outside firm of experts.
The Events Company - a quango run by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Dcal) - folded in 2007 after losses of £1.5m were discovered.
The Northern Ireland Audit Office recently described the conduct of its former chief executive, Janice McAleese, as the worst it had seen from a senior public official.
Deti's permanent secretary, Andrew McCormick, has been defending a follow-up investigation, launched in 2008, at a session of the Public Accounts Committee (Pac).
He said the inquiry would help the PSNI in its ongoing criminal probe.
Mr McCormick said the initial estimate was only "a stab" at costs, but it turned out to be a "long, tortuous investigative process".
He said investigators had to examine 122,000 documents and 350,000 emails.
He said the investigation had been partly held-up by the PSNI and Ms McAleese's refusal to co-operate for a year.
Disqualification proceedings are being considered against members of the Events Company board.
