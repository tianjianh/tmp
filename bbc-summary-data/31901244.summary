The three largest providers received customer satisfaction scores below 50% in a survey.
Smaller providers such as John Lewis Broadband, Plusnet, Utility Warehouse and Zen Internet scored over 70%.
Which? is campaigning for greater clarity in the broadband speeds companies are allowed to advertise.
"Smaller suppliers are leaving larger rivals in their wake when it comes to the service they provide so we need to see the big players up their game," said the executive director of Which? Richard Lloyd.
The consumer campaign group says most of the internet service providers in the survey received scores of three stars when people were asked to rate their broadband speed.
TalkTalk customers were least happy, giving their provider two stars for speed.
Which? is campaigning against rules which it says allow providers to advertise broadband speeds that only 10% of their customers actually receive.
