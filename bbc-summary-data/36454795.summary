Paul Pike, 23, was killed as he waited in his red van at traffic lights at the junction of Crosby Road North and South Road on 5 June 2010.
Police said a silver Audi TT, stolen in Hawarden, North Wales, then turned around and further shots were fired.
The car was found abandoned and burnt out a short time later in Fairfield, a street off Endbutt Lane.
Det Supt Neil Bickley said there have been a number of arrests in the last six years, but police are still keen to talk to any witnesses.
"The offer of the reward could be strong incentive for someone with knows who is responsible for Paul's murder, which has caused a great deal of pain and suffering to his loved ones, to do the right thing and come forward," he said.
