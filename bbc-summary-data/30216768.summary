Terror threat: Teachers become spies?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"People need to stop the generalisation of Asians."

That's the view of a student in the Midlands, talking about his life as a young Asian now that the terror threat to the UK has been labelled "severe."
Home Secretary Theresa May announced new anti-terrorism measures this week which call on schools and colleges to lead the way in preventing radicalisation.
Newsbeat spent the day in a school to find out what that means for teachers and pupils.
Holly Hall Academy is in Dudley, an area viewed as a potential breeding ground for extremist views from both radical Islam and the far right.
The government says schools like this will now have to play a key part in spotting the early signs of radicalisation.
Teachers and students both have a role to play.
Graham Lloyd, the head of the academy, says he doesn't see this as staff and students spying on each other.
"Teachers are always going to be concerned about anything that impacts on a student.
"Happy students are going to be successful students. We've always looked at what is going on in personal lives - it's nothing new and nothing we should be worried about".
The police have been working with a local theatre group to put on a play to teach the pupils to identify signs their friends could be becoming radicalised.
Prittesh, one of the students who saw the play, said it was an interesting way to illustrate the dangers of online radicalisation.
He said: "I thought it showed all sides of the argument and that it [extremism] can't be tolerated."
The 15-year-old was also worried people might generalise about Asians: "Just because they are brown does not make them a terrorist".
He added: "I think the whole Muslim culture is being closely inspected, especially with the media showing bomb scares and events overseas. If one is like that everyone thinks they're all like that."
He's also worried that social networks like Facebook and YouTube are being asked to spot users who may be looking for or posting extremist material.
Facebook has been coming in for criticism for apparently not passing on warning signs from one of the men who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year.
In response, Facebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.
Prittesh doesn't want every word he writes being monitored: "Obviously it's for the good, but you can't be sure that it will be used for that."
Another pupil, Pavanya, 15, welcomes it: "If they control the extent of how much they are looking at your posts, I guess that should be good."
Chief Inspector Dale Randle said: "We want young people to know about the vulnerability of going online, the dangers of getting involved with extremism and the dangers of becoming radicalised.
"This play is just another way to get into schools and get young people [to be] aware of the issues."
