Becky James' return to the GB cycling team ended in disappointment when she was eliminated in the first round of the individual sprint at the Track World Cup in New Zealand.

The former double world champion was beaten by fellow-Brit Kay Marchant.
James was competing for GB for the first time in nearly two years following injury and illness.
"I'm a long way off but I'm hoping I'm going to keep progressing," said the 24-year-old from Abergavenny.
"I've got a lot more work to do so hopefully in the next few months I'll be back to my best."
James last rode for GB in 2014, but since then has had surgery to remove abnormal cells following a cervical screening, and suffered a knee injury after winning the sprint and keirin titles at the 2013 World Championships in Belarus.
She returned to competition in August this year, and says she was happy to be back in a GB vest.
"It's been really nice to be back racing again in this environment," she added.
"I was a little bit nervous and didn't really know what to expect, but I'm happy to gave got to this level in such a short time so it's a good step forward."
James is hoping to gain selection for the GB team at the Rio Olympics in 2016, but missed out on qualifying points and will not compete in Sunday's keirin.
