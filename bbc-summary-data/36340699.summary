People logging on are asked which team they want to follow to get the latest news during the tournament.
All countries taking part in the competition were listed apart from Wales, Turkey, Switzerland and Ukraine.
Football body UEFA, which runs the app, blamed a "technical issue" on some devices which it has now resolved.
Wales fan Tim Hartley said he was "very disappointed" that his team was not on the app after it launched.
"It's surprising that I've received tickets to follow my team right through to the final, and yet UEFA has left Wales out of app," he said.
"But having said that, the fans will stand together in France next month regardless, app or not."
After BBC Wales contacted UEFA it said it resolved the glitch and the missing countries were now available to fans.
A spokesman said no teams were left out but a technical issue had meant the last row of participating teams could not be seen.
