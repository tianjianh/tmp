Joe Latta and Joe Batley: Bristol sign Gloucester pair for 2017-18

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol have signed Gloucester second row pair Joe Latta and Joe Batley ahead of the 2017-18 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England-qualified former New Zealand Under-20 player Latta, 24, joined Gloucester from Highlanders in 2015.
Batley, 20, has represented England up to Under-20 level and has made four appearances for the Cherry and Whites.
"The arrival of these two players in the summer gives us fierce competition in the second row," interim head coach Mark Tainton told the club website.
