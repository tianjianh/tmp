Germany stormed into a 2-0 lead but Mark Gleghorne pulled one back for England before half-time.
Phil Roper then equalised with a deft finish before Adam Dixon put England ahead from a penalty corner.
Germany replied with goals from Lukas Windfeder and Anton Boekel, which means England must beat Ireland in their final pool match to make the semis.
Ireland, who beat Poland 7-1 earlier on Monday, are level on four points with Germany at the top of the pool.
They need a point to progress to the semi-finals when they face England on Wednesday.
