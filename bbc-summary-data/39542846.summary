Neymar: Barcelona forward could miss El Clasico after lace-tying booking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neymar's decision to tie his laces as a delaying tactic in Barcelona's 2-0 defeat at Malaga might eventually contribute towards a suspension for the crucial El Clasico game on 23 April.

The Barca forward received a booking for blocking a free-kick before going on to receive a second yellow for a foul on Diego Llorente.
His sarcastic applause as he walked off could result in him receiving more than the standard one-match ban.
Barcelona are second in La Liga.
Coach Luis Enrique's side remain on 69 points, three behind Real Madrid, who drew their derby against Atletico Madrid earlier on Saturday and have a game in hand. Barcelona face their fierce rivals after next week's match against Real Sociedad.
Under Spanish league rules, Brazil international Neymar, 25, would receive a longer suspension if his reaction to the sending off is deemed as contempt for the officials.
