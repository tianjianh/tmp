[SN]TITLE[SN]
Taggart brothers owe creditors up to £213m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two County Londonderry brothers facing bankruptcy owe their creditors up to £213m, the High Court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Property developers Michael and John Taggart are offering a settlement where they would repay less than 1p for every pound they owe.
That arrangement, known as an  Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), would allow them to avoid bankruptcy.
The brothers' house-building business collapsed in 2008. Their creditors will vote on the IVA proposal next month.
In December 2015, the brothers lost a long-running legal battle with the Ulster Bank.
