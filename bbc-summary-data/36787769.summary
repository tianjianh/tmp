A dance music festival held on the shores of Loch Ness is to pay tribute to an Inverness DJ who died earlier this year at the age of 30.

Ross Lyall, who had type one diabetes, died in March after five days in intensive care at Raigmore Hospital.
His DJ partner Andrew McGibbon will play a special set in his memory during Groove Loch Ness on 20 August.
The duo played at the festival at Dores last year, the first time the event was staged.
Organisers said Mr Lyall, who fundraised for Diabetes UK, had been among the first to support the festival and been a "sounding board" for ideas for the event.
Mr McGibbon said: "Last year, Ross and I were delighted to be a part of Groove.
"I clearly remember a moment when we stopped and took a minute to take in the atmosphere and the sights around us and really appreciate what we were experiencing.
"Sadly we won't have a chance to do that again, but I'm delighted that Groove have made this gesture and giving us the chance to celebrate Ross and his massive effect on so many people's lives."
Filth, the Inverness-based DJ act Mr McGibbon started with Mr Lyall, will play its set before Boys Noize, one of the festival's main acts.
In a statement, Mr Lyall's family said: "Ross was so privileged and excited that Filth were asked to play at the inaugural Groove Festival at Dores last year.
"Tragically Ross won't be with us, but one think is absolutely certain - he would want you all to chill and have a great time."
This year's Groove will feature a DJ set by electronic group Leftfield.
Other acts confirmed include Duke Dumont, Mark Knight and underground dance music acts Leon Vynehall, Dan Shake and Moxie.
