Boxing weigh-in murder: Kevin Murray remanded in shooting extradition case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from Northern Ireland arrested in connection with a murder at a Dublin boxing match weigh-in has appeared at an extradition hearing in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Murray, 46, from Townsend Street in Strabane, County Tyrone, is objecting to a bid to extradite him to the Republic of Ireland.
A warrant for his extradition said GardaÃ­ (Irish police) believe he played a central role in the hotel shooting.
He was remanded in custody until a bail hearing scheduled for Friday.
The judge at Belfast Recorder's Court is awaiting medical reports before ruling on whether to release Mr Murray on bail.
The fatal shooting took place at Dublin's Regency Hotel on 5 February.
David Byrne, 33, was shot dead and two other men were injured in the attack, which GardaÃ­ linked to a gangland feud in Dublin.
Mr Murray was arrested by PSNI officers in Strabane on Monday, using a European Arrest Warrant.
