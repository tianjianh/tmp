The 48-year-old had been favourite to take over after Feeney was sacked with the club bottom of League Two.
He will assume his duties on Monday with joint caretaker managers Sean McCarthy and James Bittner remaining in charge for Saturday's League Two game at Colchester United.
Westley was in charge at Peterborough from September 2015 until April.
Hounslow-born Westley managed Stevenage on three separate occasions, leading the club into the Football League and then into League One.
He also been manager at Preston North End, Rushden & Diamonds, Farnborough Town, Enfield and Kingstonian.
Newport revealed they interviewed five shortlisted candidates for the vacancy following Feeney's sacking after just over eight months in charge.
"The board were unanimous in their decision to appoint Graham due to his extensive managerial experience in the Football League," Newport said in a statement.
