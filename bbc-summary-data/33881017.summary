United Utilities has confirmed customers will be compensated but it has not named a figure.
The firm has been investigating how the microbial parasite, cryptosporidium, was found at a water treatment works near Preston on 6 August.
The company believes it has "identified and isolated" the source.
Samples have improved but "highly specialised testing in some external laboratories" is being carried out.
United Utilities said once it received test results a meeting would take place with Public Health England and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.
A decision would then be made on whether to lift the water alert.
The areas affected include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
Domestic retail director at United Utilities, Gary Dixon, said: "The traces were small in the beginning and are even smaller now. We are continuing to see the levels of cryptosporidium in the tests reducing day after day.
"We are confident we are going in the right direction and confident we are doing the right things. Tomorrow is a big meeting for us when we get these results back."
He said he hoped to have "more news" for customers by Thursday evening.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate will carry out a formal investigation into how the bug contaminated the water.

Some customers earlier criticised the company for not informing customers quickly enough or communicating well throughout.
About 1,000 members of United Utilities staff have been working in response to the incident.
Jo Harrison, who has been co-ordinating the customer information service, said: "We've been experiencing about two and a half times our normal call volume. On Friday we had about 4,500 calls from customers enquiring about their water supply."
Compensation will be available for both domestic and business customers, Mr Dixon said.
"We will be proactively going out to customers to compensate them. There are real examples where businesses have not been able to operate. We have contacted them.
"We're really, really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused."
Cryptosporidium exists in the environment in a form called an oocyst, which is less than a tenth of the thickness of a human hair.
Infection with the parasite can cause diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.
People with weak immune systems are likely to be more seriously affected.
