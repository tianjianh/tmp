[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trudy Jones, 51, from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, was among 38 people killed by gunman Seifeddine Rezgui in Sousse on 26 June.
Ms Jones was just 48 hours away from returning home when she was shot dead.
A service for the mother-of-four was held at St David's Church, Blackwood, on Monday.
Ms Jones's white coffin was brought into the packed church as mourners paid their respects to the nursing home worker.
The congregation sang two hymns - The Old Rugged Cross and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer - before hearing a reading from Corinthians.
Wreaths bearing the words "Trudy" and "mam" featured among the floral tributes.
One read: "We're missing you so much. We would give anything in the world to have you with us now. Don't know what we're going to do without you."
Another added: "To my mam, my best friend, my everything. I love you more than words can say."
An inquest into her death at West London Coroner's Court was told she died from a single shot.
