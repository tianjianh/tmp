English fourth seed Matthew, 36, lost 11-9 11-4 11-9 to the sixth seed who will now play world number one and compatriot Mohamed Elshorbagy.
"I feel great, over the moon, especially because I had a very slow start to the tournament," said Gawad.
Top seed Elshorbagy beat another Egyptian, Ali Farag, 11-8 11-5 11-8.
The other all-Egyptian quarter-final between Fares Dessouky and Ramy Ashour, and fellow countryman Tarek Momen's match against Frenchman Gregory Gaultier, will be played on Wednesday.
Matthew won the World Championship in 2010, 2011 and 2013.
