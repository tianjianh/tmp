[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
French voters will pick either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen to be the next leader of their country on 7 May.

Unlike Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron has never tried to be president before.
He used to be a banker, before becoming an economic advisor for the current president Francois Hollande.
He then got the job of economic minister (which is more senior) in 2014.

En Marche! now has more than 200,000 followers

While he had not yet officially said that he would be running for president, people had a good idea that this was what he was doing.
He later confirmed that is exactly what he was up to.
Both Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen have made this one of the most interesting elections in France in a long time.
One of the main reasons for this is that neither of them belong to one of the two main political parties in France, which - between them - have been in charge of France for more than 50 years.
Emmanuel Macron has also never been elected as an MP before (called dÃ©putÃ©s in France).
He is 39 years old, which means that if he wins, he will become France's youngest-ever president.
We would have to wait to see what will happen if he wins the job of president, but he has said there are certain things he would like to achieve. For example:
