Susan McLean, 61, was last seen on CCTV outside the Moness Resort on Crieff Road in Aberfeldy at about 19:45.
Ms McLean was on a two-week tour of Scotland with her family.
Her husband Donald said: "Susan is a loving wife and mother to our sons James and Donald and we miss her terribly."
He said: "Everyone in Aberfeldy has been very supportive and I want to thank all the people who have spoken to the police and given their time to help in our search for Susan.
"We just want her to be here with us, if anyone knows anything that might help to bring her back to our family, please let the police know so that we can bring her home."
Police Scotland has carried out extensive searches in the town, with support from Tayside Mountain Rescue Team and search dogs.
