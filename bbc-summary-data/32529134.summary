[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters have "seven days to take your chance to run Britain for working people once again", Ed Miliband has said.

Launching Labour's final week of election campaigning, he told voters: "This is your time and your chance."
And he claimed that Labour has had "four million conversations" with voters on the campaign trail and set a target of one million more.
With one week to go, polls show Labour and the Conservatives neck-and-neck.
The latest BBC poll of polls put the Conservatives on 34%, Labour on 33%, UKIP on 13%, the Lib Dems on 9% and the Greens on 5%.
At a campaign event in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the Labour leader said the election was "not just about parties or leaders".
Labour has claimed it has had "four million conversations" with voters on the doorstep since January.
"Because we've achieved that, I'm setting a new target," Mr Miliband said, aiming for a total of five million by polling day on 7 May.
He said Labour policies such as an Â£8 per hour minimum wage and an end to what the party calls "exploitative" zero-hours contracts would provide a "bedrock of security for working families".
He accused the Conservatives of "planning to devastate family finances" by cutting tax credits and child benefit in order to make Â£12bn of welfare cuts.
The Conservatives have dismissed Labour's claim and said their opponents would "wreck" the economic recovery.
