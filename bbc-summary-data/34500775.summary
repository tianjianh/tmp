The hosts won Friday's first one-day international by two wickets and this result puts them 2-0 up in the three-match series.
Paul Stirling (72) and Gary Wilson (65) were the top contributors as the Irish finished on 268-7.
Zimbabwe won with nine balls to spare, Ervine hitting 101 from 174 balls while Sean Williams added 43.
Ireland increased their run-rate from Thursday and with Kevin O'Brien chipping in with a half-century, they gave themselves a good chance of levelling the series.
Sikandar Raza was the stand-out bowler for Zimbabwe, his three wickets coming at a cost of 49 runs.
Zimbabwe reached the target with ease and Ervine followed up his 60 in the opener with another impressive display.
It was a tough day for the Irish attack with all-rounder O'Brien picking up two wickets.
Zimbabwe moved above Ireland in the ODI rankings into 10th place with Friday's victory and will remain above the tourists even if they lose Tuesday's final game.
