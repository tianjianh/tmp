The Volkswagen rolled backwards down a hill and over a wall before coming to rest on the top of a Fiat 500 parked below on Southpark Avenue.
Passers-by were attracted to the scene, in the Hillhead area, on Sunday.
No-one was injured and police were stationed at the scene until a recovery vehicle arrived shortly after 18:00.
A police spokesman said: "Neither vehicle was occupied at the time and there were no injuries."
