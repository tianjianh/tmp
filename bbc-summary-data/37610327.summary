[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was the fiddler and frontman for Edinburgh-based band Shooglenifty, and before that performed with Swamptrash.
With Shooglenifty he helped to create a genre of music called acid croft, described as "a blend of Celtic traditional music and dance grooves".
The band, which has posted a tribute to Grant on its website, said Grant died on Sunday after a short illness.
Grant grew up in Lochaber and was the son of well-known left-handed fiddle player Aonghas Grant.
He played fiddle and wrote music, including the tunes Two Fifty to Vigo, She's In The Attic, Nordal Rhumba, Glenfinnan Dawn and Fitzroy Crossing.
In the tribute on Shooglenifty's website, the musician was described as having "lived without ties and responsibility, but was devoted to his music, his family and his fellow musicians".
Shooglenifty has performed at the HebCelt in the Western Isles, the Highlands' Blas festivals and Glasgow's Celtic Connections.
The band rounded off its 25th anniversary tour last December with a special performance at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations.
