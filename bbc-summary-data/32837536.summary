Jane Andrews, from Cleethorpes, north-east Lincolnshire, and an ex-dresser to the Duchess of York, murdered businessman Tom Cressman in 2000.
The duchess had employed her for nine years and was involved in police efforts to her track down.
A spokesman for the Parole Board said a three-member panel of the board had directed the release of Andrews.
He added: "The decision to release is a matter for the board, which is independent. Arrangements and the date of the release are a matter for the Ministry of Justice.
"We are unable to comment further on the details of this case."
Andrews went on the run after stabbing her lover at the flat they shared in Fulham, south-west London, after he refused to marry her.
She hit him around the head with a cricket bat while he slept in their bed and then plunged an 19cm kitchen knife into his chest, before going on the run.
Four days after the murder, Andrews was found in her car in a lay-by in Cornwall, having taken an overdose of painkillers. She told police she panicked after killing her boyfriend by accident, in self-defence.
During the police search, the duchess left her two voicemail messages, urging Andrews to give herself up.
She also gave a witness statement to police - but it was not included in Andrews' four week trial at the Old Bailey in 2001, where she was was ordered to serve at least 15 years in jail.
That sentence was reduced by three years on appeal.
In 2009 Andrews absconded from East Sutton Park, an open prison in Maidstone, before being apprehended days later.
