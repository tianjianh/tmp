England v Scotland: Quality needed as well as passion - Craig Brown

Former manager Craig Brown is warning Scotland that spirit and determination will not be enough against England.

Brown, 76, was in charge when the rivals last met competitively, losing a play-off for Euro 2000 over two legs.
He expects the Scots to feed off the noise of the Tartan Army in Friday's World Cup qualifier at Wembley.
"The passion you take for granted, but we've got to be able to play," said Brown.
"The ability is there, but not always, at the moment.
"Gordon [Strachan] is the man for the job, but he doesn't have the quality of player, they're not playing at clubs that are competing in Europe.
"When I went to England to look for players, I could get three from the champions of England - Blackburn Rovers - or Gary McAllister, captain of Liverpool.
"It's a different quality of players that Gordon has. I'm not being disrespectful, but they don't have the European experience that my boys had."
England's interim manager Southgate intends to emphasise how committed Scotland will be, given the long-standing rivalry between the nations.
Like Brown, he believes his team's display will need to match the passion of the Scots but also deliver enough quality to prove decisive.
"The history of the occasion is something I will speak to the players about because I think it's important they understand what to expect," said Southgate.
"We also have to have emotional control going into the game, so we've got to pitch that at the right level.
"It's the oldest international fixture and it's important for our players that they understand that, which I'm sure they do.
"I stood pitch-side at the last game at Wembley [a 3-2 friendly win for England in August 2013], which was a fantastic atmosphere and there's something special about those fixtures."
Brown, Scotland boss from 1993-2001, believes that with England yet to commit to appointing Southgate as the permanent successor to Sam Allardyce, they remain in a "state of indecision" that presents "a great chance" for the visitors.
On the 1999 play-off, Brown recalls how Scotland were written off after losing 2-0 at Hampden, only to win 1-0 at Wembley.
"The chemistry in the team was always very good, but it was particularly good because there was this persecution complex," said Brown, who was speaking at the launch of the North Lanarkshire Sporting Hall of Fame at Ravenscraig.
"The feeling was that it would be the end of the road for Craig [Brown] and Scotland had we not done something. We didn't manage to qualify, but we emerged with credit from the game.
"We were being slaughtered by the media - but never by the fans. The Tartan Army support was exceptional.
"We had far fewer fans than England yet made more noise. I would always say in my team meeting that it's cost these guys a fortune, not only in travel and hotels but in drink, to support this team and we must reward them with wholehearted endeavour and a result if possible.
"It was just a reminder and I would even find out from one or two guys what it cost them to go to the game."
