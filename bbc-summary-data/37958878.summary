[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 2-0 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless Charlton secured their third home league victory in as many matches with a 2-0 win over play-off chasing Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the week which saw previous boss Russell Slade sacked, the seventh departure from The Valley since March 2014, Charlton started on the front-foot as Jason Pearce's header hit the bar early on.
The Addicks took the lead in the 30th minute through a superb Josh Magennis header, with the Northern Ireland international finding the far corner from Morgan Fox's cross.
Charlton - with caretaker boss Kevin Nugent overseeing proceedings - doubled their advantage a minute before half-time, as Fox's pass found Nicky Ajose who slotted the ball past Jak Alnwick in the Port Vale goal.
The visitors, as expected, came out after the break searching for a goal back but Nathan Smith's flicked effort that evaded Declan Rudd's goal was the closest Bruno Ribeiro's side came to scoring.
The win was only Charlton's fifth in League One this campaign and sees them rise to 14th in the table, while Port Vale remain without a win on the road since early October.
