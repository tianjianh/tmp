[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Morrison, 51, from Burton Leonard, was punched to the ground outside the Winter Gardens pub, in Harrogate, on 1 November.
He suffered head injuries and remained in hospital until his death on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.
A 43-year-old man was also injured during the incident. A 44-year-old Harrogate man has been charged in connection with the attacks.
Mr Morrison was described by his wife, Lisa, and three children, Marie, Leah and Joe, as a "devoted family man".
They said: "Paul was a larger-than-life character, loved by so many people.
"He was a devoted family man, friend and businessman who will leave a hole which can't be filled."
The man charged in relation to the incidents appeared at York Crown Court on 17 November charged with causing grievous bodily harm without intent to Mr Morrison and causing actual bodily harm to the 43-year-old man.
He was bailed to reappear before the court on 24 February.
A force representative said it was now liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service following Mr Morrison's death.
Det Sgt Steve Menzies has appealed for witnesses to come forward.
The pub, run by JD Wetherspoon, is in the Royal Baths complex in Parliament Street.
