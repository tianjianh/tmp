BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty assesses England's display as they start 2017 with a narrow defeat.
Joe Hart (goalkeeper) 6
One misplaced punch created a second-half chance for Julian Brandt but made an excellent low save from Leroy Sane.
Michael Keane (defence) 7
Big night for Burnley's 24-year-old but did not look out of place against the World Cup holders. Very assured and almost scored.
Chris Smalling (defence) 6
Rarely troubled and looked solid in a three-man defensive system.
Gary Cahill (defence) 7
Misjudged one header but made crucial blocks and battled with real determination.
Kyle Walker (wing-back) 7
England's undisputed first-choice right back now. Real thrust and energy as an extra attacking threat.
Eric Dier (midfield) 6
Reliable presence as a midfield anchor and took the chance to have a couple of efforts on goal.
Jake Livermore (midfield) 6
Not an earth-shattering night for West Brom's midfielder but did not do himself a disservice either.
Ryan Bertrand (wing-back) 7
Took his chance well with Danny Rose injured. Lent weight to the attack and solid defensively.
Dele Alli (attacking midfield) 8 MAN OF THE MATCH
England's stand-out performer although marred his otherwise excellent display by missing a great first-half chance. A genuine international performer.
Adam Lallana (attacking midfield) 7
Liverpool's midfielder has made himself a permanent fixture in the England side. Energetic, lively and unlucky to hit the post with a first-half effort.
Jamie Vardy (striker) 6
Too often isolated but full of running and troubled Mats Hummels with his pace. Did not impress the German gallery with a rather desperate attempt to win an early penalty.
Substitutes
Nathan Redmond (for Lallana 66) 5
England debut and a quiet introduction although Germany had taken command when he was introduced.
Marcus Rashford (for Vardy 70) 6
Showed his pace to out-run Mats Hummels in one telling moment.
Jesse Lingard (for Alli 71) 6
Little time to make an impact.
Luke Shaw (for Ryan Betrand 83) No rating
James Ward-Prowse (for Jake Livermore 83) No rating
John Stones (for Chris Smalling 84) No rating
