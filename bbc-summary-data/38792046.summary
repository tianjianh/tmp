Ice hockey: Fife Flyers still positive - Carlo Finucci

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forward Carlo Finucci insists the two losses Fife Flyers suffered are not a setback as his team remain in the top half of the Elite League table.

They lost 5-2 at Braehead Clan on Saturday then 2-1 at home to Cardiff Devils on Sunday.
But Finucci is adamant there is still a positive vibe around the dressing room.
"One or two bounces didn't go our way and if the power play has clicked on one or two occasions, things might have gone a little differently," he said.
"The boys worked hard, but the results were unfortunate. However, I wouldn't say it was a setback for us. We've been playing good hockey and have been playing well in the last few weeks.
"The mood is still good in the locker room, but if we didn't do a lot of the things we did in terms of working hard and not performing over the two games, then we could view it as a setback."
Flyers were the league's in-form team going into the weekend. Sitting fourth in the table, taking 17 points from 20 in their previous 10 games, losing only one, but one team had their number.
And Braehead Clan did it again, making it seven straight wins over the Flyers as they took the points in a 5-2 victory over their Kirkcaldy rivals.
Lee Baldwin, Alex Leavitt and Cody Carlsson had the Clan three up before Sebastien Thinel and Finucci brought Fife to within one after two periods.
Two from Mike Hammond late on secured a big win for Ryan Finnerty's side, but an arguably bigger test awaited Flyers on Sunday when league leaders Cardiff Devils came to town.
It was a much closer affair as the Welsh side took the 2-1 win as Sean Bentivoglio and Joey Martin netted for the Andrew Lord's men to take the points, despite a late Chris Wands consolation.
Dundee Stars looked to bounce back after failing to score a goal last weekend and while they got two on the board at Manchester Storm on Saturday, they finished with a 4-2 loss.
Stars captain Joey Sides put them ahead, but Storm turned it around with goals from Paul Swindlehurst, Mario Valery-Trabucco and Adam Harding.
Sides added Dundee's second, but Manchester claimed the points with a finish from Darian Dzuirzynski late in the third period.
Marc LeFebvre's side were met by Braehead on Sunday and snapped the three-game losing run by beating the Clan 6-5 after penalty shots to get them some much needed points.
Matt Haywood and Matt Beca put the Glasgow side in front and although Kevin Hart pulled one back, Matt Keith and Scott Aarssen had Ryan Finnerty's side up to 4-1 ahead early in the second.
The Stars clawed it back to 4-4 with Matt White, Kevin Bruijsten and Mikael Lidhammar all scoring with Bruijsten adding a fifth to give them the lead, but Haywood's leveller took the contest further.
Overtime couldn't separate them so penalty shots were needed, where Vinny Scarsella came up trumps to clinch a much coveted win for the Tayside men.
Edinburgh Capitals' fight to escape from the bottom hit a further snag on Saturday when Coventry Blaze strengthened their play-off credentials with a 4-1 victory at the Skydome.
Taylor MacDougall's opening goal was soon a memory as Coventry took victory through goals from Barry Almeida, Jordan Pietrus, Liam Stewart and Jim Jorgensen.
The Caps were back home on Sunday to meet Manchester Storm, but didn't fare much better as the visitors took a 6-4 win from Murrayfield.
MacDougall's opener for the Capitals was cancelled out by Jack Prince with Jacob Johnston and Mason Wilgosh putting the home side 3-1 in front.
Storm hit back through Prince's second and one from Swindlehurst, but MacDougall added his second to retake Edinburgh's lead, but Mark Heatley levelled again to make it 4-4.
Prince completed his hat-trick to edge Omar Pacha's side in front before Heatley picked up his second with an empty net goal to confirm victory to end Edinburgh's weekend on a low note.
