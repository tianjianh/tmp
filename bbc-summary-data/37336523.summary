Sheffield's second University Technical College (UTC) will specialise in sports science, healthcare and wellbeing.
It has been built on the 26-acre Olympic Legacy Park being created on the site of the Don Valley Stadium, which was pulled down in 2013.
UTC principal Sarah Clark said it would "develop the health professionals, the sports coaches and the sports scientists of the future".
The city's first UTC campus on Matilda Street in the city centre opened in 2013, with a focus on engineering and creative/digital industries.
Richard Caborn, former sports minister and lead of the Olympic Legacy Park Project, said: "This probably will be one of the major centres of excellence in the world."
The National Centre for Sports Exercise and Medicine will open at the park in October, when development of the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre will begin.
A 3,000-seat arena is also planned. The 600 pupils, aged 14-19, and 56 staff, will move in gradually from the nearby Oasis Academy until the college fully opens on 26 September.
