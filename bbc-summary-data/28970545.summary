Swansea council leader David Phillips has resigned from his post.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Phillips said the decision was to focus on building Swansea's regional and national profile although details of his new role are not yet known.
It comes a week after he was told to expect a leadership challenge after sacking two cabinet members in a reshuffle but he would not comment on whether his departure was linked.
Mr Phillips led the council's Labour group for 10 years.
The Labour group has been in power at the authority for the last two years.
The selection process to find a new leader begins on Monday.
He said from the back benches he will continue to give his "complete support to the new cabinet and the group as we work to continue to deliver on our manifesto commitments for the good of the people of Swansea and the wider region".
Labour group chairman Robert Francis Davies said: "David Phillips has made an enormous contribution to Swansea and to Labour and will continue to do so in the future. We want to keep his talents working for our city."
