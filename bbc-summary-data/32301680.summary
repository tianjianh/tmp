Reigning London marathon champion Wilson Kipsang has hit out at Kenya's athletics authority for suspending his foreign agent without informing him.

He told the BBC that Athletics Kenya (AK) was "fighting with fire".
Two leading sports agencies have been suspended for six months by AK.
AK's chief executive Isaac Mwangi said the suspension of the agency Rosa & Associates' related to its doping investigation and Volare Sports' suspension was "procedural".
AK said it would ensure that athletes did not miss international competitions.
For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page.
Rosa & Associates is run by Italian Federico Rosa and Volare Sports is headed by Dutchman Gerard van de Veen.
One of Mr Rosa's recent clients was the Boston marathon winner Rita Jeptoo, who was banned for two years from athletics after failing a doping test.
His lawyers have written to AK demanding to know the exact allegations against his clients and what to do with the Kenyan athletes who are trained and ready for competitions in Spain, China, the Czech Republic and the UK.
Mr Kipsang, who is represented by Volare Sports, is also the president of the Professional Athletes Association of Kenya.
He told the BBC that AK did not have the knowledge or experience to represent athletes.
"We have confidential matters between an athlete and a manager which we can't discuss with Athletics Kenya," the former marathon world record holder said.
Last year, Mr Kipsang was furious after AK revealed that he had missed a doping test.
He said that he was representing Kenyan athletics at a conference in South Africa at the time.
Mr Mwangi did not give any details about the investigation into Volare Sports.
He told the BBC that a commission had been set up to look into the doping allegations and other issues.
The BBC's John Nene in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, says many athletes are very bitter about the suspensions.
They do not trust Kenya's athletics body with financial matters, he says.
The suspensions are also a blow for the agents, who represent some of the best athletes on the circuit.
Rosa & Associates handles 1,500m world champion Asbel Kiprop and Volare Sports counts Dennis Kimetto, the current marathon world record holder, among its clients.
There is no suggestion that either of these athletes are involved in any wrongdoing and both are completely untainted by the ongoing investigation.
