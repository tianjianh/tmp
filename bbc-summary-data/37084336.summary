The Polish-born 31-year-old helped his country win the 2014 World Cup, and scored 48 goals in a 129-cap career.
An appearance off the bench in the 3-0 win over Slovakia at Euro 2016 was Podolski's final outing for Germany.
The ex-FC Koln, Bayern Munich and Arsenal player, now at Galatasaray, told German fans, "It was amazing, it was great, and it was an honour."
