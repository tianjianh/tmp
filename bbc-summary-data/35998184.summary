NHS Wales can be among the world's best for cancer care if big changes are made in how quickly it is diagnosed, says an international expert.

Wales and the other UK nations have some of the worst cancer survival rates in the developed world.
Prof Frede Olesen said lessons can be learned from Denmark, which has improved how patients with less obvious symptoms are diagnosed.
Welsh health experts have just returned from a fact-finding visit.
Glynis Watkins, a nurse from Merthyr Tydfil, was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago.
She had been diagnosed with a bad back and had seen an orthopaedic surgeon but a consultant where she worked became suspicious of her symptoms and sent her for a CT scan.
Ms Watkins explained more to BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke.
