Ebola outbreak: Liberia medics defy 'danger money' strike call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nurses and medical assistants fighting the Ebola outbreak in Liberia have largely ignored a call to strike over danger money and conditions.

Most health workers were working as normal on Monday, the BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia said.
A union official said the government had coerced workers to ignore the strike - but the government said it had simply asked them to be reasonable.
Liberia is the country hit hardest by the deadliest ever Ebola outbreak.
Health workers are among those most at risk of catching the disease. Ninety-five have died from the virus in Liberia.
The latest outbreak has killed more than 4,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria since it was identified in March.
World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan said the outbreak threatened the "very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries".
"I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure," she said in a speech delivered on her behalf at a health conference in the Philippines.
In the US, President Barack Obama has directed tighter safety procedures when dealing with suspected Ebola patients, after a health worker treating an Ebola victim at a Texas hospital caught the virus.
Liberia's National Health Workers Association had called the strike to demand an increase in the monthly risk fee paid to those treating Ebola cases.
The union wants workers to be paid a risk fee of $700 (Â£434) a month. The fee is currently less than $500 a month, on top of basic salaries of between $200 and $300.
The association also wants more protective equipment and insurance for workers, and has accused the government of not providing enough protection from the virus.
On Monday, the association's secretary-general, George Williams, said the government had put some health workers under "duress" and persuaded them to work.
Liberia's Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said a strike would have negative consequences on those suffering from Ebola and would adversely affect progress made so far.
The government says the scale of the epidemic means it now cannot afford the risk fee originally agreed.
Information Minister Lewis Brown said the government had asked health workers to be reasonable.
"We are working with them the best way we possibly can, so that they understand we should have a common interest in saving lives by fighting this disease," Mr Brown said.

Note: figures have occasionally been revised down as suspected or probable cases are found to be unrelated to Ebola. They do not include one death in the US recorded on 8 October.

Ebola: Mapping the outbreak
Liberia has about 50 doctors to serve the country's 4.2 million people - an average of 0.1 doctor per 10,000 people, according to data compiled by the Afri-Dev.Info health and social development agency.
Six months after the epidemic began in West Africa, there are still only about a quarter of the treatment beds required to tackle it.
Food is now in short supply as markets are disrupted in some parts of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The cap forms part of a protective hood covering the head and neck. It offers medical workers an added layer of protection, ensuring that they cannot touch any part of their face whilst in the treatment centre.
Goggles, or eye visors, are used to provide cover to the eyes, protecting them from splashes. The goggles are sprayed with an anti-fogging solution before being worn. On October 21, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  announced stringent new guidelines for healthcare personnel who may be dealing with Ebola patients. In the new guidelines, health workers are advised to use a single use disposable full face shield as goggles may not provide complete skin coverage.
Covers the mouth to protect from sprays of blood or body fluids from patients. When wearing a respirator, the medical worker must  tear this outer mask to allow the respirator through.
A respirator is worn to protect the wearer from a patient's coughs. According to guidelines from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the respirator should be put on second, right after donning the overalls.
A surgical scrub suit, durable hospital clothing that absorbs liquid and is  easily cleaned, is worn as a baselayer underneath the overalls. It is normally tucked into rubber boots to ensure no skin is exposed.
The overalls are placed on top of the scrubs. These suits are similar to hazardous material (hazmat) suits worn in toxic environments. The team member supervising the process should check that the equipment is not damaged.
A minimum two sets of gloves are required, covering the suit cuff. When putting on the gloves, care must be taken to ensure that no skin is exposed and that they are worn in such a way that any fluid on the sleeve will run off the suit and glove. Medical workers must change gloves between patients, performing thorough hand hygiene before donning a new pair. Heavy duty gloves are used whenever workers need to handle infectious waste.
A waterproof apron is placed on top of the overalls as a final layer of protective clothing.
Ebola health workers typically wear rubber boots, with the scrubs tucked into the footwear. If boots are unavailable, workers must wear closed, puncture and fluid-resistant shoes.
