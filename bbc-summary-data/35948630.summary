[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Charley Hull is two shots off the lead at the first women's major of the year after carding a second-round 69 at the ANA Inspiration.

The 20-year-old posted an eagle and two birdies at Rancho Mirage in California to sit tied for ninth at five under.
She is one shot ahead of compatriot Jordi Ewart Shadoff (68) and Scotland's Catriona Matthew (72).
American Lexi Thompson joined overnight leader Ai Miyazato at the top of the leaderboard after a four-under 68.
Thompson carded four birdies in her final seven holes, including three consecutively from the 12th, to move alongside Japan's Miyazato at seven-under.
Former world number one Miyazato recorded five birdies and three bogeys on her way to a round of 70.
And the current rankings leader, Lydia Ko, is one further back after shooting a 68 to go with her first round 70.
Ewart Shadoff, 28, recovered from bogeying two of the first four holes to compile a four-under par round.
Matthew, who was in a tie for second - one shot behind Miyazato - after the first day, slipped back after a haphazard round that contained four birdies and four bogeys.
