[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Entrance to the Grand Canal in Venice by Edward Seago was one of 12 works sold by Christie's of London for a total of £306,875 on Thursday.
Ludham Marshes From Upper Horning, near the artist's home, sold for £37,500.
This work was once owned by royal servant William Tallon who assembled a collection of Seago paintings, buying some and receiving others as gifts.
Mr Tallon, who worked for the Queen Mother, died aged 72 in November 2007 and eight of his Seagos were sold for £66,100 at Reeman Dansie Auctions in Colchester the following July.
That sale included Ludham Marshes which went for £11,000.
In a foreword to a biography of Edward Seago by James Russell, published earlier this year, Prince Charles wrote: "My grandmother was particularly fond of Ted (Seago) and every year he would be invited, with other old friends, to stay at Sandringham during the week of the annual Flower Show at the end of July.
"There was always a wonderful moment, I remember, when Ted would give my grandmother his annual present of a painting."
Mr Tallon was affectionately known as Backstairs Billy and his official title, in the Queen Mother's household, was Steward and Page of the Backstairs.
After Seago died his ashes were scattered over the Norfolk marshes.
