The UAE Team Emirates rider finished 16 seconds ahead of Poland's Pawel Poljanski who pipped Spaniard Jose Joaquin Rojas on the line.
"It's been a long time since my last big win," said Mohoric. "It feels great to get a victory again.
"I felt good in a breakaway the other day so I knew my shape was good."
Saturday's eighth stage sees the riders move on to Hellin where they will navigate a 199.5km course which includes an ascent up the testing Xorret de Cati followed by a slight uphill finish.
Team Sky rider Froome said: "Today was a lot more relaxed and we were more in control. Tomorrow is a really tough finish. It'll be a big battle tomorrow."
