Now the 24-year-old can add author to her skillset - her debut novel is set to be published later this year.
Mirror, Mirror is described as a "gripping coming-of-age" young adult novel exploring identity, sexuality, betrayal and friendship.
Delevingne has co-written the book with Rowan Coleman, the author of 2014 novel The Memory Book.
The star said the book deal was a "pinch me" moment.
"So excited! Mirror, Mirror is a twisty coming-of-age story about 16-year-old friends Red, Leo, Naima and Rose who are all trying to figure out who they are and navigate the minefield of school and relationships," Delevingne wrote on Instagram.
"I love these characters so much, I love what they stand for, what this story represents.
"The process of putting this novel together has been life changing and something I hold really close to my heart! I cannot wait to share with everyone!"
Mirror, Mirror will be published on 5 October.
