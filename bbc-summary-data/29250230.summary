A group of Donegal-based insurance workers could be popping champagne corks this weekend after scooping a 4.9m euro (Â£3.9m)lotto jackpot.

The 13, including two from Londonderry, all work in Malin Head and will take home 375,000 euro (Â£295,000) each.
It comes days before Donegal take on Kerry in the All-Ireland Gaelic football final and many will be hoping the county is on a winning streak.
Amanda McFadden, who is one of the lucky 13, spoke of their delight.
She told the Shaun Doherty Show Highland Radio that they had celebrated already with a simple cuppa.
Most of the group met up for breakfast in a cafe in Carndonagh on Thursday.
"We had to go for coffee as nobody would serve us champagne," she said.
"One of the girls is in Tenerife. She's flying home today."
She later told the BBC that it was the "first big win for Donegal" this week, and added that she hoped "Sam's back on Sunday", a reference to the Sam Maguire Cup that Donegal and Kerry will be playing for on Sunday.
However, Ms McFadden has, to date, been unable to secure a much-sought after ticket for the GAA final at Croke Park.
The Irish National Lottery confirmed that the winning ticket was sold by Cullen's shop in Buncrana.
The winning numbers were 19, 25, 26, 27, 39, 45.
In June,  a  12m euro (Â£9.4m)jackpot ticket was sold in Bundoran, County Donegal.
