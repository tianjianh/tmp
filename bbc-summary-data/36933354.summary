Jutanugarn, 20, didn't drop a shot and made six birdies to move within sight of the tournament record-winning score of 19-under par.
South Korea's Mirim Lee, who led after the first and second rounds, slipped to second after carding a 69.
Scot Catriona Matthew will start the final round six shots back in fourth.
Jutanugarn will become the first Thai to win a major tournament if she can protect her lead on Sunday.
She missed a chance at the ANA Inspiration earlier this season when bogeying her final three holes, but believes she has learned from that experience.
Jutanugarn, who displayed calmness and consistency during her third round, told BBC Sport: "I think I know how to play under pressure. I have to focus on what is under my control."

Despite three birdies in her opening four holes, Matthew was unable to match the quality of her second-round 65 as she slipped off the pace.
However, she has not given up hope of closing the gap on the final day in her attempt to win a second British Open, seven years after her win at Lytham in 2009.
Matthew said: "It's possible. I will need to hole everything I look at.
"If Ariya plays as she can she will be tough to catch but I will just go out and try and make as many birdies as I can."
England's Charlie Hull suffered a triple-bogey on the opening hole and her challenge faded away with a three-over par 75.
But Ireland's Leona Maguire, who will be competing at the Rio Olympics next month, enjoyed an outstanding day. The 21-year-old went round in a four-under 68 to move to 10th place on seven-under par as the leading amateur.
