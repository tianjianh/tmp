[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side dominated the first half and went close to breaking the deadlock in the 19th minute when Michael Green picked out Matt Tubbs, whose shot just missed the far post from a tight angle.
But the hosts capitalised on a defensive blunder three minutes later to take the lead. Gavin Hoyte's attempted backward header left goalkeeper Michael Stack stranded and Robbie Tinkler tapped the ball into an empty net.
Ross Stearn levelled in the 77th minute with a great shot into the far corner from the edge of the area, but Villagers striker Thompson struck two minutes from time to win it.
Stearn nearly equalised again in stoppage time, but his fierce strike was well saved by Owen Evans.
