Motorists confused over Europe emergency number, RAC warns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists crossing the Channel are confused about which three-digit number to dial in an emergency, the RAC has claimed.

In a survey, the motoring organisation found most people were unaware that the emergency number in Europe is 112.
Some people thought the number was 111, which is in fact the non-emergency number for the NHS in most of the UK.
Others thought they should dial 911, the emergency number in the United States and Canada.
The 112 number works in all 28 member states of the EU - including the UK - as well as in 11 other countries.
They are: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia.
It is free, and connects the caller with the Police, the Fire Brigade or emergency medical assistance. In many cases, the call will be answered in English.
The RAC is advising motorists going abroad to make a note of the 112 number.
"It doesn't get a lot of promotion - certainly not in Britain, where we have 999 anyway, but not a great deal in continental Europe either," said RAC European breakdown manager David Huggon.
The introduction of the 101 number in the UK has caused further complications, according to the RAC.
That is the non-emergency assistance line for the Police.
The non-emergency number for the NHS - 111 - currently operates in England and Scotland, but not in Wales.

The UK regulator Ofcom had no comment to make on the RAC's claims, which it said were the responsibility of the European Commission.
