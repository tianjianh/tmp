[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man king scallop fishery reopens fully after toxins scare

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man king scallop fishery has reopened fully after being suspended due to shellfish toxins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The season, which began on 1 November, was halted on the west coast of the island after scientific tests showed abnormally high levels of domoic acid.
Excessive levels of the naturally-occurring substance, stored in the scallop's digestive system, can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP).
The fisheries department said levels had fallen to satisfactory levels.
Unusually high levels of domoic acid were caused by a bloom of the phytoplankton this summer.
Shellfish toxin levels are regulated by EU legislation.
The industry is worth millions of pounds to the Isle of Man every year.
The king scallop fishing season in Manx waters runs until 31st May.
