[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northumberland County Council has been given planning permission for a new HQ.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The current County Hall in Morpeth dates from 1981, but needs to be substantially refurbished.
The authority said it would be more cost-effective to sell off the land, and build a new £40m HQ in Ashington.
Council Leader Grant Davey said the proposals had been "well received by residents from the town and wider area".
The overall economic benefit to the north east could be as high as £93m, he said.
