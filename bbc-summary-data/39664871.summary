Eyewitnesses told BBC Hindi's Omer Farooq that the speeding lorry first hit a car and then an electricity pole before running into the protesting farmers.
Officials said that "many" injured had been taken to local hospitals for treatment.
The driver of the lorry has also been admitted to hospital with injuries.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has announced compensation of 500,000 rupees ($7,739;Â£6,048) to the families of those killed in the incident.
