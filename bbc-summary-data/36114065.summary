David Raven's Inverness Caledonian Thistle future in doubt

Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager John Hughes admits it looks unlikely that full-back David Raven will be offered a new contract.

Caley Thistle missed out on a top-six Premiership finish this season and the club will prioritise recruiting quality in attacking areas.
"There's not been a decision made," Hughes said of 31-year-old Raven.
"Right at this moment in time, it seems very unlikely it'll be the case that he might get something."
A fairly ominous number of decisions await Hughes regarding personnel, with only Greg Tansey, Josh Meekings, Ross Draper, Gary Warren, Richie Foran, Carl Tremarco and goalkeeping reserve/coach Ryan Esson currently contracted beyond the end of the season.
Raven joined Caley Thistle in 2012 after leaving Tranmere Rovers but might have only five more games to add to his 137 appearances for the Scottish Premiership club.
"The reason being is, when I'm spinning plates, if I've got anything extra, I want to put it in the top end," explained Hughes.
The Caley Thistle boss resolved his striker shortage this season by signing Miles Storey on loan, but the Englishman is likely to return to Swindon Town this summer.
"I want to bring that quality in the top end," said Hughes. "Someone has to sacrifice. Unfortunately, it might have to be David.
"I'm not saying it is. It might have to be one or two others for us to bring in that quality or finishing up the league."
Hughes believes the loss of key players over the last 18 months has significantly hampered his side and midfielders Danny Williams and James Vincent have already agreed pre-contracts to move to Dundee this close season.
"I would like to identify two or three players that the fans can identify with and gets them excited," added Hughes.
"Over the years, if I'm a supporter of Inverness, I've seen Billy Mckay go, Marley Watkins go, Graeme Shinnie go, Ryan Christie go.
"Real good footballers and I think it's affected us, especially in the final third. People that can unlock the door, score a goal.
"All my concentration and any money that's available, that's what I'm scouting. That top end that can win us games.
"We're playing to finish as high up the league as we can to hopefully try and get a little bit more finance."
