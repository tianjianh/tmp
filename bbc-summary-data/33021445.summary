[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stan Laurel Bishop Auckland baptism church for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The church where Stan Laurel was baptised has been put up for sale by the Diocese of Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although the comedy legend was born in Ulverston, now in Cumbria, his family moved to Bishop Auckland, and he was baptised at St Peter's Church in 1891, and went to King James Grammar School.
The Grade II-listed church closed a year ago, and a buyer is being sought.
It would be suitable for a range of uses such as residential development, a gallery, soft play area, or a cafe.
St Peter's Church was completed in 1875 at a cost of Â£7,000, more than double the average of the period.
The last service was held in December 2013. It closed the following June and is now at risk of falling into neglect.
It is expected the building will be sold along with the adjoining church hall.
Bill Heslop, diocesan care of churches secretary, said: "We are keen that whoever takes on the building respects its architecture."
