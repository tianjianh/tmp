The discovery was made by a member of staff at the plant in Bray, County Wicklow, on Wednesday morning.
A preliminary examination of the scene has been carried out by the state pathologist.
Garda√≠ (Irish police) said it was "investigating all the circumstances surrounding the discovery".
"We don't know exactly what happened leading up to the birth of the baby," said Supt Pat Ward.
"However, it is possible that the baby was stillborn and, if this is the case, my priority now is to get all medical assistance and support to the baby's mum.
"I am very concerned for the welfare of the mum of this baby as she is possibly in a distressed state and in need of medical assistance."
A full post-mortem will be carried out on Thursday.
