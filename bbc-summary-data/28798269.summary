Mekhissi-Benabbad put his top in his mouth after pulling clear of the field.
Initially he appeared to be shown a yellow card by an official but was subsequently disqualified.
Frenchman Yoann Kowal now wins gold, Poland's Krystian Zalewski gets silver and Spain's Angel Mullera wins bronze.
The Spanish team protested after the race, which saw Mullera cross the line fourth.
Mekhissi-Benabbad, 29, who has won two Olympic silver medals, has previously caused controversy by fighting with France team-mate Mehdi Baala on the track in 2011.
He also pushed a mascot after winning European Championships gold in Helsinki in 2012.
