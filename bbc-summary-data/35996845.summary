Welsh election: Ask the Leader - Conservatives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies faces questions from an audience in Swansea in the first of a daily series of live TV election specials.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Monday.
Andrew Robert Tudor Davies relishes his larger-than-life reputation, and once described himself as "19 stone of prime Welsh beef".
When elected Welsh Tory leader in 2011, he was thought of as being on the right of the party and perhaps a little sceptical of devolution.
However, time and again he has supported more powers for the assembly, seeking the ability to cut taxes to attract business to Wales.
Mr Davies has also gone against many within his own party, most recently in a rift with the prime minister over the referendum on Europe.
While David Cameron campaigns to remain in the European Union, the Welsh Tory leader is backing Brexit.
He is also more liberal on some matters than other Tories, such as his support for gay marriage.
