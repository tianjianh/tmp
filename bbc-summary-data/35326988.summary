His new album, Blackstar, reached number one, selling almost 150,000 copies since its release last week.
It had already been on course to top the charts before news of his death was announced on Monday, said the Official Charts Company.
Thirteen Bowie tracks also entered the top 100, led by Heroes at number 12.
The song, which originally peaked at 24 in 1977, is joined in the top 40 by Life On Mars, Starman, Let's Dance and Space Oddity.
In total, Bowie sold 241,000 albums and 167,000 singles over the course of the week, while his songs were streamed more than 19 million times on services like Apple Music and Spotify, which said streams jumped by 2,822% following news of his death.
The star accounts for 25% of this week's Top 40, with the best-sellers including greatest hits collections Nothing Has Changed and Best Of 1969/1974.
Hunky Dory was the most popular of the Bowie's classic albums, charting at 14. The 1971 record includes the singles Life on Mars and Changes, as well as Kooks, an ode to Bowie's son whose lyrics went viral earlier this week.
BBC 6 Music is celebrating the music of David Bowie this weekend with specials from Steve Lamacq and Adam Buxton.
Elsewhere, Justin Bieber maintained his grip on the top five singles, with his Ed Sheeran-penned ballad Love Yourself spending a sixth week at the top.
His previous singles Sorry and What Do You Mean each slipped one place - to three and four respectively - pushed down by Shawn Mendes' new single Stitches.
The top five was rounded off by Sigala's dance track Sweet Lovin', up from number eight last week.
Elsewhere, Little Mix scored their 13th top 40 hit with Secret Love Song a duet with US singer Jason Derulo, which entered the chart at 34; while Craig David's career comeback continues apace, as the grime collaboration When The Bassline Drops, featuring Big Narstie, climbs 21 places to Number 15.
In doing so, it gives the British singer his first top 20 single since 2007's Hot Stuff (Let's Dance).
In the album chart, Elvis Presley holds firm at number two with If I Can Dream, featuring orchestral arrangements of his biggest hits. Adele's 25 fell to number three, giving up the top spot for the first time since its release last November.
Justin Bieber's Purpose is at four, while Stevie McCrorie - who won last year's edition of The Voice UK - scores a new entry at 35 with his first post-victory release, Big World.
