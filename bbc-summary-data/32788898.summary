[SN]TITLE[SN]
Defective door blamed for boy's coach fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 13-year-old boy fell out of a coach and broke his wrist due to a defective emergency door, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened on 16 May last year as the vehicle travelled along the M49 near Severn Beach.
Bristol Crown Court heard the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, leaned against the door, which opened due to "a badly maintained latch".
Tudor West, of Bridgend, denies dangerous driving and driving a vehicle in a dangerous condition.
Coach company owner Keith Jones denies permitting the driving of a vehicle in a dangerous condition, and aiding and abetting dangerous driving.
The trial continues.
