The boys - aged between 11 and 12 - raised the alarm after the woman entered the water at Gypsy Brae at around 16:30 on Sunday, 20 September.
Police and coastguard officers then used information given to them by the boys to rescue the woman.
The boys identified the area where the woman was and provided footage of her entering the water as evidence.
She was taken for treatment and is now recovering following the incident.
Sgt John Brock said: "This incident could have quite easily had a tragic ending.
"Due to the swift and conscientious actions of these boys a woman's life was saved. Police Scotland commends them for their bravery and quick thinking.
"It is also notable that they learned these skills through their attendance at the Risk Factory, an initiative purposely designed to equip young people with the ability to use their initiative in crucial situations.
"Thank you to these five boys for demonstrating outstanding community spirit."
As a reward, 11-year-olds Wacka Ceesay, Andrew Bell and Kian McGee, along with 12-year-olds Tyler Jay Anderson and Aleks Czernecki, were given a tour of Drylaw Police Station.
