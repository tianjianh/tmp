[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Highland still needs to save £2m before April in order to balance its books, the health board's finance chiefs have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was facing a potential overspend of £15.6m at the start of the financial year. Raigmore Hospital in Inverness accounted for £10.5m of that figure.
Health board chiefs said at the time that they expected to break even.
They said further savings and "successful management of service pressures" will now be required.
