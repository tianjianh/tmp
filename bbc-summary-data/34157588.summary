More than a tonne of cocaine with an estimated street value of £56m was seized from a yacht intercepted off the Kent coast, it has emerged.

Border Force officers boarded the yacht on Monday, before escorting it into Dover marina.
The yacht was searched by the force's deep rummage team, which found 1,200 kilos of cocaine.
Two Dutch nationals, who were on board the yacht, have been charged with drug trafficking offences.
Elaine Game, from the National Crime Agency's Dover border investigation team, said: "This was an exceptional seizure.
"At this stage the end destination for the boat is unclear, however given the amount recovered it seems likely that at least part of the shipment would have ended up back in Britain."
