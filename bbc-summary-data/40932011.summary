[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal was involved in an altercation with a steward as Bolton reached the EFL Cup third round.

Carvalhal and opposition manager Phil Parkinson were both sent off late in the game - a 3-2 win for Bolton.
And Carvalhal was then engaged in a heated discussion with a steward as he attempted to take a seat in the stands.
Dorian Dervite, Adam Armstrong and Jem Karacan had put Bolton 3-0 up, before Jordan Rhodes' consolation double.
Parkinson and Carvalhal were sent off two minutes from time after a confrontation sparked by a foul by visiting midfielder Barry Bannan on Filipe Morais.
Portuguese manager Carvahal told BBC Radio Sheffield that the steward had apologised to him.
"It was a person with age. I must respect older persons but in that moment he acted really badly," he said.
Greater Manchester Police confirmed they would not be taking further action.
Dervite volleyed the Trotters ahead before half time from 12 yards.
Owls keeper Joe Wildsmith fouled Will Buckley, with Armstrong scoring from the spot, before Karacan headed the hosts three goals in front.
But a close-range finish and header from Rhodes set up a grandstand finish on and off the pitch.
Stephen Darby cleared a shot off the line and substitute Atdhe Nuhiu wasted an excellent chance to force extra time, but newly promoted Wanderers clung on to beat their Championship rivals.
