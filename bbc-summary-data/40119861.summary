A new Scottish mentoring programme has been launched for women-led businesses.

The initiative, set up by Scottish Chambers of Commerce and Women's Enterprise Scotland, will see leading female entrepreneurs act as mentors.
They include Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief Liz Cameron, Carolyn Currie of Women's Enterprise Scotland, Marie Macklin of Macklin Partnerships and Petra Wetzel of West Brewery.
Jeanette Forbes of PCL Group and Poonam Gupta of PG Paper are also on board.
The Women's Business Mentoring initiative aims to tackle challenges faced by women in business.
Those challenges include accessing finance, overcoming gender bias or managing family responsibilities alongside a business.
A dedicated website has been set up to help prospective businesses find a mentor, attend events and access resources.
Women in business can also sign up as mentors.
According to the website, only 20% of Scottish small and medium enterprises are majority-owned by women.
Ms Macklin said: "Young talent is the lifeblood of any business and it's critical that as senior business leaders, we shine a torch on the path ahead and guide this talent to future success.
"It can be a long, hard road to the top.
"We've all had someone who supported us when we needed it most and showed us the way.
"It's only right that we find time to give back and help the leaders of the future fulfil their true potential."
Ms Cameron said: "Our approach is innovative and fresh and is all about tapping into the talents and experience of successful women entrepreneurs and matching them with ambitious, driven and aspiring women in business."
