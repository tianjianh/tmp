Longer hours for Sunday trading?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Could we be shopping for longer on a Sunday by the end of this year?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We understand the government is preparing to push ahead with plans to relax the Sunday trading laws, even though it was facing almost certain defeat in parliament over the issue just a few months ago.
The official line is that ministers are currently considering the results of a consultation, but we've been told that the intention is to get the law changed sometime this year.
Ministers believe they can win round many of those who've expressed concern. They won't just argue about the economic benefits of shops staying open for longer, they will also argue that longer trading hours on a Sunday could save struggling high streets.
Under the new proposals being drawn up by Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis, it will be left to local councils to decide whether to allow shops to stay open for longer on a Sunday.
Mr Lewis believes that it would allow councils to favour areas which struggle to attract shoppers and he points to his own constituency of Great Yarmouth.
Already some on Great Yarmouth Borough Council are talking about attracting people into the town centre and sea front by allowing shops there to stay open much later, while popular out of town business parks would not necessarily be afforded the same privilege.
"If we had this power this could be a shot in the arm to local businesses and allow them to compete with the big boys," the Conservative leader of Great Yarmouth council Graham Plant said.
The town centre manager Jonathan Newman said: "Shopping in a town centre which has longer hours could be a draw for shoppers rather than a retail park with shorter hours.
"But all the shops would have to coordinate their hours or else the public would just get confused."
Campaigners opposed to longer opening hours question if the move would really benefit the high street, pointing out that under the existing law smaller traders are allowed to open for longer.
"The only people who would benefit from this would be the large retailers," Adam Swierawski from Keep Sunday Special said.
He points to research by his organisation which found 91% of shop workers and 67% of the general public who were questioned don't want to see any extension of Sunday trading.
But others can see the benefits.
Chloe Smith, the MP for Norwich North, said that three quarters of businesses in the city would like to see longer hours.
"I think ultimately this comes down to choice," she said.
"People lead very busy lives and you need flexibility to get the family shop and other shopping done when you can."
Ministers point out that Sunday is now the busiest day of the week for shopping, thanks to the internet.
They believe high street stores are being held back, they also believe a relaxation of the laws would be popular with shoppers.
That's why they're determined to see this happen.
