The 33-year-old Pakistan international's last appearance in English football was for the Bantams in November 2010.
He has since had spells in Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia, most recently with Super League side Pahang FA.
"I've spent six years and clocked up over 200 games overseas, so it's good to be back in England," he said.
Centre-back Rehman becomes the League One side's second signing of the week, following the arrival of midfielder Ollie Muldoon on Tuesday.
