[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough collected a point from a 1-1 draw at Shrewsbury despite being reduced to 10 men just before the hour when defender Ryan Tafazolli was sent off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posh started brightly, with Tom Nichols bending an effort just off target before Chris Forrester hammered a 20-yard shot narrowly over the bar.
The visitors eventually broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Marcus Maddison's free-kick from the right was headed home by Gwion Edwards from close range.
Shaun Whalley twice went close for Shrewsbury either side of the Posh goal with well-struck shots from just outside the penalty area which goalkeeper Luke McGee impressively turned away.
The visitors ended the half strongly, Maddison hitting a post with a low 20-yard drive before both he and Tafazolli forced good saves from Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler.
The home keeper then made a fine save from Paul Taylor before Shrewsbury went straight up the other end to grab a 56th-minute equaliser, Ian Black's looping header from Joe Riley's right-wing cross.
Three minutes later Tafazolli was sent off for bringing down Antoni Sarcevic, but Black's penalty was well saved by keeper McGee.
