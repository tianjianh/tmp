It's called "coral bleaching" - it happens when the water temperature gets a couple of degrees hotter than normal for two weeks or more - the coral changes colour to white and it's left damaged.
The Maldives is not the only place in the world affected, Australia's famous Great Barrier Reef has had plenty of its coral reef damaged and it's a problem in Hawaii and Japan too.
See what is being done to try and help.
