Wooching played rugby union in high school, but was a linebacker for the University of Washington's American football team in college.
The 23-year-old opted against entering the NFL Draft this year, despite being touted as a possible late-round pick.
He has played for the Seattle Saracens rugby team since leaving college, and also had a trial with Top 14 side Pau.
"This will be a great opportunity and experience for Psalm to continue his pathway into rugby from American football," Harlequins academy and global development director Tony Diprose said.
"It also provides Harlequins with the opportunity to have a good look at him in a high-quality international tournament such as this one.
"This will also give him the chance to see how an elite professional rugby team operates."
The World Club 10s tournament takes place in Mauritius from 17-18 June, with eight teams competing.
