[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six years after a man from south Cheshire went missing on holiday in Crete, police have released an image of how he might look now.

Steven Cook, from Sandbach, was 20 when he was last seen outside a pub in Malia asking for directions to his hotel.
Greek police have failed to find any concrete leads in their investigation into why he went missing in 2005.
His father Norman said posters with the new image would be circulated around the island.
Cheshire Police used photographs of different members of Steven's family when they were in their 20s to help construct the enhanced image.
Norman said that his family had never given up hope of finding Steven.
"It takes over your whole life. For the last five or six years we've led an unreal life.
"Every day, several times a day, either myself or members of my family are looking to see if any bit of information has come through on the internet and emails.
"We always look positively at what we can do. That way, it gets you through the dark days."
The image has now been posted on the Find Steven Cook website and anyone with any information in regard to Steven's disappearance - his whereabouts or his movements since 2005 - is asked to contact Cheshire Police.
