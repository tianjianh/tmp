Science Central, built on the site of the former Scottish and Newcastle Brewery, has been hailed as one of the UK's biggest regeneration projects.
Up to 2,000 jobs are expected to be based at the 24-acre site by 2020.
The development - a partnership between Newcastle City Council and Newcastle University - was opened by Universities Minister Greg Clark.
The complex will include a £58m "urban sciences" facility, which will house Newcastle University's School of Computing Science, along with 1,500 staff and students.
Mr Clark said: "Science Central is a unique city centre development that will not only drive scientific advances and innovation in the region, it will create jobs and a thriving community to grow the North East economy."
Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council said: "This is all part of our vision for putting Newcastle on the map for new and emerging science and technology-based industries."
Vice-Chancellor of Newcastle University, Prof Chris Brink added: "Over the next four years, we hope to see Science Central grow to become an exemplar of urban sustainability research, bringing together academia, organisations, industry, democracy and communities to develop solutions that will make a difference to people's lives across the globe."
Science Central has also received funding from the European Union Regional Development Fund and the Regional Growth Fund.
