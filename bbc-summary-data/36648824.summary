Euro 2016: Gareth Southgate should not be next England boss - Harry Redknapp

Gareth Southgate being favourite to succeed Roy Hodgson as England manager is "scary", says Harry Redknapp.

Hodgson resigned on Monday after England were knocked out of Euro 2016 in the last 16 by minnows Iceland.
But Redknapp said Southgate was only seen as a favourite for the job because he had won a "second-rate tournament" with England Under-21s in Toulon.
"Why should he get it in front of Steve Bruce and Sam Allardyce, who are proven managers?" asked the former QPR boss.
When it was suggested that Southgate knew the way the Football Association (FA) worked as well as the English "system", Redknapp responded: "Knows what system? The losing system? He knows the losing formula?
"I like Gareth Southgate, he's a great lad, but what's he done?"

Redknapp, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, said former England boss Glenn Hoddle, 58, was a more suitable candidate.
"I think he had an idea of how he wanted to play," said Redknapp. "He would have come up with a system that we all know how we're going to play."
However, he said he did not "have a lot of faith" in the FA making the right choice.
"Look at what they've done in the past," he said. "We've had Sven-Goran Eriksson. It's scary. They are going to make a right decision one day, but I probably won't be alive to see it."
Redknapp also suggested former Tottenham and Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood as a possible option.
"He's got passion, enthusiasm, I'll come and work with him all day," said the 69-year-old. "He's young, enthusiastic, knows the game."
But he played down suggestions he might finally get the England job after missing out to Hodgson in 2012.
"It was a long time ago I was one of the favourites," said the former QPR, Tottenham, Portsmouth and West Ham boss.
"I don't fit. I would love to manage England, but I'm a realistic person and I realise I've got absolutely no chance."

BBC pundit Alan Shearer also thinks Hoddle should be given a second chance at taking control of England, perhaps alongside Southgate.
Hoddle managed England at the 1998 World Cup but was sacked following comments he made about disabled people.
"Hoddle is a great coach who's still got a lot to offer," said Shearer.
Under Hoddle, England, with Shearer leading the attack, reached the last 16 at the 1998 World Cup before losing to Argentina on penalties.
Hoddle, who replaced Terry Venables after the 1996 European Championship, was then sacked in 1999 following an interview he gave to The Times.
In it, the former Tottenham, Monaco, Swindon and Chelsea midfielder suggested disabled people were being made to pay for the sins of past lives.

Hoddle has not managed since leaving Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, while Southgate's only other managerial job ended with the sack following Middlesbrough's relegation from the Premier League in 2009.
Rangers midfielder Joey Barton, who was at QPR in 2014 when Hoddle was appointed as a first-team coach, tweeted: "Those mentioning Hoddle are really so far away."
He added: "He did OK in 1998 but he's been out of the game a long time and having worked with him at QPR, he is so far behind where he needs to be."
Shearer said Southgate, 45, had done a "very good job" with the Under-21s but would benefit from being able to call upon Hoddle's "experience".
"It's about having a leader in there," said Shearer. "Southgate is certainly one of those guys. As is Hoddle. Glenn was brilliant for England."

The Match of the Day pundit also expressed an interest in the vacancy himself, revealing he had wanted to take over in 2012.
"I would speak to the FA now, definitely," he said. "I'd offer my experience, tournament experience. Even if Southgate gets it."
Shearer's former England striker partner, Teddy Sheringham, said Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would be his choice.
"People will disagree with me backing him for the England job, but you need a bit of everything in a football team," said Sheringham.
"That blend is crucial. England have strength, passion, desire, hunger, and bullishness. They are strong-mindedness and resilient. But England need structure. They need guile and finesse.
"At this level. you need to keep the ball and control games. That is what Arsene Wenger's teams do."
Hodgson waited just a few minutes after England's defeat by Iceland before announcing he was stepping down.
England won just three of 11 games in major tournament finals under the former Liverpool, West Brom and Switzerland boss.
They were knocked out by Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 and failed to progress from their group at the 2014 World Cup.
Their next game is the first of the qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup, away to Slovakia on 4 September.
That is followed by home matches against Malta and Slovenia in October, with their group also including Scotland and Lithuania.
"Under Roy, it's been a disaster," said Shearer, 45.
"It's been noticeable in the tournament that Italy and Germany have a system and stick to it. The players fit into it. That is what England need."
Southgate, who has been in charge of the Under-21s since 2013, is the favourite with bookmakers to be England's next manager.
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew, Bournemouth coach Eddie Howe and former England coach Gary Neville, who served under Hodgson, are also in the frame.
