The week-long WTA event is being held in Nottingham for the second successive year and finishes just 15 days before Wimbledon begins on 27 June.
Two-time Australian Open winner Azarenka said: "I've heard great things about what great preparation it was.
"It's so important to get time on this surface ahead of Wimbledon."
Azarenka, 26, is currently ranked 15 in the world and has twice reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon, while 21-year-old world number 24 Keys is a former quarter-finalist at the All England Club.
The Nottingham Open will see two tournaments take place in June, with the women's tournament from 4-12 June and the men's ATP event being staged from 18-25.
