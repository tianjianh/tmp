Hundreds of people lined the harbour walls and jetty to wave home the Royal Navy's helicopter carrier.
The ship, which has clocked up 898,893 miles on operations, will be retired after 32 years of service.
Illustrious gave a gun salute as it arrived at the mouth of Portsmouth Harbour and its arrival was marked with a flypast of Apache, Lynx, Merlin, Sea King and Chinook helicopters.
The warship, which arrived with its 700-strong ship's company, flew a 210m decommissioning pennant.
The band of the Royal Marines also performed.
HMS Illustrious, nicknamed Lusty, was was built by Swan Hunter shipbuilders on the Tyne. The picture below shows its launch on 14 December 1978 by Princess Margaret.
The warship is the last of the Invincible class of aircraft carriers which included the Ark Royal and Invincible, introduced into the navy in the 1980s.
Its entry into service was brought forward so it could assist in the Falklands War effort.
In 1986 it attended the Royal Australian Navy 75th anniversary fleet review, shown in this image, which was watched by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip.
It has also been deployed to conflict zones in Bosnia, Iraq, Sierra Leone and helped aid efforts after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in December. This picture shows boxes of aid waiting to be loaded on to the ship.
Last month the crew of HMS Illustrious took part in an exercise with the Royal Navy Merlin Mk2 helicopters, pictured below.
HMS Illustrious will be replaced by HMS Ocean, which has just received a Â£65m refit.
The Ministry of Defence has invited tenders from private companies and trusts to secure Illustrious's future.
