Mike Flynn says Newport County's players "have given everything" since he was appointed caretaker manager.

County were 11 points adrift at the bottom of League Two when Flynn replaced Graham Westley in March.
The Exiles remain in the relegation zone, but are five points from safety, having won three of Flynn's six games in charge.
"I'm proud of them. They have given everything since I've been here," Flynn said.
"That determination, that effort and that intensity has got to last every game to the end of the season.
"Nothing less than that will do. We've got six big games to go and if we close the gap one point every week we're going to stay up."
County ended a three-match winless run with a 1-0 win at home to Crawley Town to leave them five points behind Hartlepool, who were beaten by Portsmouth.
Fellow strugglers Cheltenham boosted their survival hopes with a home win over Morecambe and are six points ahead of Newport with six games remaining.
"It's so important we take care of our business because Cheltenham won," Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It could have been a lot worse. It could have been nine points, but thankfully we've closed the gap because Hartlepool lost.
"Two teams have been dragged into it again and we've got to keep concentrating on what we do."
Newport are at play-off contenders Exeter City on Saturday, 8 April.
