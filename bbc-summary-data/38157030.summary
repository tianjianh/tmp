Rafael Benitez: Wasteful Newcastle frustrate in EFL Cup quarter-final defeat by Hull City

Newcastle United had enough chances to beat Hull City before losing Tuesday's EFL Cup quarter-final in a penalty shoot-out, says manager Rafael Benitez.

The Magpies passed up the chance to reach the last four for only the second time in the history of the competition, missing three of their spot-kicks.
Mo Diame had put Newcastle in front in extra-time but Robert Snodgrass equalised almost instantly.
"We deserved to win," a frustrated Benitez told BBC Newcastle.
"Penalties are a lottery. It's something we have to learn from. When you do well, you have to finish the openings."
The statistics back up Benitez's claims, with 32 shots on goal, although only five of them were on target.
Despite the result it was a much improved display from Saturday's Championship defeat by Blackburn, of which the Spaniard was critical.
"We were much better in the first half and we had a lot of chances, but we have to score more goals," he added.
"After extra-time we had a lot of chances, but we made mistakes in terms of managing the situation. We have to have more experience and control these things."
