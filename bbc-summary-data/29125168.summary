[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Metrobus northern route approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The northern section of the Metrobus route in South Gloucestershire has been approved by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority approved two sections of the route which run to Cribbs Causeway and Emersons Green.
The southern sections - Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, and the South Bristol Link - have already been approved.
Bristol City Council planners gave consent in August saying the route would reduce travel time and traffic along key routes.
The proposed scheme will see buses use exclusive "segregated lanes" and "guided busways".
Both routes will run along the M32 before splitting - with one going to Cribbs Causeway via Bristol Parkway Railway Station and then on a new bypass which was granted permission last year.
The other section will run to Emersons Green to the east of Bristol.
The Â£200m project has been devised by the West of England Partnership - an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset.
