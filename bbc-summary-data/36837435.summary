Fierce Beer began as a home-brewing sized business working out of premises in the city's Great Western Road and selling products to local bars.
A limited company since April this year, it has set up a micro-brewery in Kirkhill Industrial Estate.
Owners Dave Grant and David McHardy used redundancy pay-offs from their other jobs to help fund the business.
Investors have also come on board to help finance the brewery, which is the only registered brewery in Aberdeen.
Before the official launch this week, the brewery had been in operation for two months and in that time produced more than 20,000 litres of beer.
With business development manager Louise Grant, the owners are producing eight beers which they are selling across the UK.
Mr McHardy said: "We have both been passionate about brewing ever since we purchased our first home brewing kits a few years ago.
"When I met Dave on a brewing course in England, it was clear to me then that we would be working in the brewing industry together very soon.
"Launching Fierce to the public has been extremely exciting, and we carried out a lot of research initially, investigating the best local ingredients and the most effective way to bottle our beers, all of which has been really important."
He added: "We have managed to gain the support of a number of larger craft beer breweries and businesses which has been incredible, and I am looking forward to seeing how the company progresses over the next few months."
