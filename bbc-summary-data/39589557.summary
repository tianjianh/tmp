Harlequins centre Matt Hopper will leave the Premiership club at the end of the season to join French second-tier side Oyonnax.

Hopper has made 112 appearances for Harlequins since joining the club from Championship side Cornish Pirates.
The 32-year-old has played in 12 games this season, scoring his only try in a win over Bristol Rugby in February.
