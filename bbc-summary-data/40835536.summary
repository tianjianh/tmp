[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 0-0 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macclesfield and Bromley both remained unbeaten three games into the season after a fairly mundane stalemate at Moss Rose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side were disappointed not to go in front in the first 15 minutes when Koby Arthur's shot was saved by David Gregory.
At the other end, Brett Williams nearly broke the deadlock with a deflected shot that was tipped over by Shwan Jalal.
In the second half, affairs remained tight and the visitors' Iffy Allen fired just over from the edge of the box.
Noe Baba produced a late, spectacular drive that went just over, but both sides ended up with a point.
