[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish government error gave council middle managers covert powers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "administrative error" by the Scottish government incorrectly handed surveillance powers and the ability to deploy children undercover to public-sector middle managers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson told MSPs the powers should only have been given to more senior personnel.
He said the error had been made in two codes of practice published in February last year.
The incorrect guidance was in place for more than a year.
It had been given to all 32 councils as well as Marine Scotland, the Scottish Prison Service, Transport Scotland, the Common Services Agency for the Scottish Health Service and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.
Mr Matheson said it did not affect Police Scotland, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner or the Accountant in Bankruptcy.
The error also saw less senior personnel given powers to collect confidential information - such as health records, communications with parliamentarians and journalists' sources - which should have required the authorisation of top executives.
Mr Matheson said middle managers had wrongly been given the power to deploy juveniles and vulnerable people as "covert human intelligence sources".
Juvenile sources could be deployed to "befriend" shopkeepers suspected of selling alcohol to children, for example.
Vulnerable sources, such as people in community care due to mental or other disabilities, age or illness, may be used to uncover harm or exploitation.
Graeme Waugh, of the Scottish government's safer communities division, has now written to the councils and public bodies seeking an assurance that none of them have conducted covert activity using the incorrect codes of practice.
Mr Matheson has also written to Holyrood's justice committee to inform MSPs that covert activity will now require "a more senior level of authorisation".
Only the chief constable has the power to authorise acquisition of confidential information at Police Scotland, while juvenile and vulnerable sources must be signed off by the deputy chief constable.
But at the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), 13 prison governors were given the power to acquire confidential information and deputy governors could deploy juvenile or vulnerable sources.
At Scotland's two private prisons, run by Serco and Sodexo, prison controllers could obtain confidential information.
Covert activity at both public and "contracted-out" prisons must now be signed off by the SPS chief executive or director of operations.
At Scotland's 32 councils, assistant heads of services and investigations managers could obtain confidential information but this must now be authorised by the chief executives, who will also be able to deploy covert sources under the revisions.
Six directors at Transport Scotland could obtain confidential information when this power should have been reserved for the chief executive.
Similar revisions have also been made at Marine Scotland, the Common Services Agency for the Scottish Health Service and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.
Mr Matheson told the committee: "I am writing to make you aware of an administrative error by the Scottish government when publishing two codes of practice and to advise you of our interim and longer-term remedies."
He said the errors had been made in two revised code of practices for "covert surveillance and property interference" and "covert human intelligence sources" under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 at the beginning of 2015.
Mr Matheson added: "Each code contains an annex which lists the level of authorisation required in circumstances where confidential information is likely to be obtained, or where consideration is being given to the use of a juvenile or vulnerable source.
"The information contained in the annexes, however, reflects the 'normal' level of authorisation required for this conduct."
He said that the intended policy was "that a more senior level of authorisation would be needed in the circumstances mentioned".
Mr Matheson added: "Our interim solution is to write to the affected bodies to provide them with the correct information.
"It is highly unlikely that any of these bodies will have made authorisations which would have required reference to these annexes. We are, nevertheless, seeking that assurance.
"The Chief Surveillance Commissioner, Lord Judge, has agreed to this interim solution."
In the codes, confidential information is described as: "Personal information, such as medical records or spiritual counselling, confidential journalistic material, confidential discussions between Members of the Scottish Parliament and Members of Parliament and their constituents, or matters subject to legal privilege."
