Eastleigh manager Ronnie Moore says his squad have surprised him after three successive National League wins.

The 63-year-old, who replaced Chris Todd as manager last month, has secured 10 points from 12 since taking over.
The Spitfires are one point outside the play-off places after a 2-0 win over promoted North Ferriby.
"I can't fault the effort from them. I thought the job was going to be a lot harder when I saw the (0-0) game at Wrexham (last month)," said Moore.
"I'm pleasantly surprised and pleased.
"They do listen, they do pass the ball when I though they couldn't pass it."
Eastleigh have now kept clean sheets in each of their last four matches.
Meanwhile, Moore indicated that Ryan Cresswell will retain the captain's armband for the time being despite Joe Partington's return to the starting line-up.
"It's hard on Parts because he's just got the captaincy, but I'm a bit superstitious and Cress has had it and we've won," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"I think he [Partington] was a little bit disappointed, but he took it well. We should all be captains once we cross that white line."
