[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of causing the death of a toddler in a car crash in County Fermanagh was attempting to blame the child's mother, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nineteen-month-old Ryan Cox died in the crash on Boa Island Road near Belleek in January 2013.
John Fahy, 25, of Groagagh, Grange in County Sligo, denies causing death by driving without due care and attention.
A prosecutor said evidence would prove it was him who was driving on the wrong side of the road when the cars crashed.
He told Dungannon Crown Court that Mr Fahy had lost control of his car as he drove around a bend.
He said the former Ulster University student's driving had fallen far below what one would expect of a competent and careful driver.
Mr Fahy, who was seriously injured in the crash, also denies causing grievous bodily injury to Ryan's mother, Katriona, by his careless driving.
The prosecution lawyer said that while Mrs Cox had no memory of the crash, Mr Fahy had attempted "to blame her for the accident".
The court was told how Mr Fahy told police: "The last thing I remember being in my lane doing about 45 to 50 mph."
He said he remembered seeing her "trying to correct" her position and get back into her own lane, the court heard.
When asked by police if he was suggesting Mrs Cox was in the wrong lane, the student answered "yes".
The lawyer said it was the prosecution's case that Mr Fahy's "account does simply not add up or fit any of the evidence".
The case continues.
