Algeria Football Federation (FAF) president Mohamed Raouraoua has strongly denied reports that they have approached current Morocco national team coach Herve Renard over the vacant manager's post.

The Desert Foxes are managerless following the shock resignation of Milovan Rajevac earlier this week.
Raouraoua told the FAF website: "I categorically state that we have never contacted Herve Renard and not even when he was unemployed about the Algeria coaching post.
"It is not our usual practice to contact a manager under the employment of another federation. We will never engage in such an irresponsible and unacceptable act."
Meanwhile, former AS Roma and Lille manager Rudi Garcia has rejected an approach from Algeria, according to reports in his native France.
Garcia, 52, was listed as one of the favourites to replace Rajevac along with Alain Perrin, Paul Le Guen, Rolland Courbis and Marc Wilmots.
It had been reported in the French media that Garcia was offered the position by FAF officials, but had turned them down.
Garcia, who has never managed a national side, has been out of management since being sacked by Italian Serie A side Roma in January.
Algeria were forced to a 1-1 draw at home by Cameroon last Sunday in Group B of 2018 World Cup qualifying.
Their next 2018 World Cup qualifier is away to group leaders Nigeria on 12 November.
Only the group winners will qualify for the tournament in Russia.
