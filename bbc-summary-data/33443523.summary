Lancashire Police said a white Audi A1 was in collision with a silver Vauxhall Zafira near the Black Bull on Black Bull Lane, Fulwood, on Tuesday night.
Both vehicles then collided with a Volkswagen Golf, which shunted into a car of the same make.
A man from Bolton, who was driving the Audi, was arrested on suspicion of the unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle.
Police said the 27-year-old remained under arrest at Chorley Hospital, where he is being treated for a head injury.
The driver of the Zafira, 56, and the front seat passenger, 62, both from Preston, were taken to Royal Preston Hospital with serious injuries. They remain in a serious but stable condition.
A 16-year-old boy, who was also in the Zafira, suffered a cut to his head and an eye injury.
Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
