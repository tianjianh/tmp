Bristol City Women clinched promotion back to Women's Super League One after goalkeeper Caitlin Leach's stoppage-time penalty save sealed a dramatic 3-2 win at promotion rivals Everton Ladies.

City led through Claire Emslie's strike before Claudia Walker levelled from the spot for Everton in the first half.
Millie Farrow and Emslie put them back ahead but Danielle Turner made it 3-2.
And Leach tipped Walker's last-gasp spot-kick onto the post to ensure City will make an immediate return to WSL 1.
The result means Yeovil Town will also go up if they win at London Bees on Sunday or in their final game at home to Sheffield FC on 6 November.
Third-placed Everton began Saturday two points behind City and Yeovil, but they now need Yeovil to fail to win either of their final two matches to have a chance of promotion.
After their relegation from the top flight last season, City - who rebranded from Bristol Academy last November - will now play in the transitional WSL Spring Series in 2017 and are guaranteed top-flight football until at least spring 2018 as the WSL switches to a winter calendar from next autumn.
Bristol City Women forward Claire Emslie said: "I just can't believe it right now. Now we want to win the league next weekend.
"I didn't want to think about what it might be like to get promoted because I didn't want to jinx it, but we're there now and it feels fantastic.
"It feels a bit surreal right now. This has been our goal, it's been the club's goal all season."
Bristol City Women manager Willie Kirk said: "We're delighted with promotion.
"We're trying to keep a lid on it because we want to win the league but we're delighted we're up - it takes a little bit of pressure off."
