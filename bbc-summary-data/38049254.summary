Tony Blair's office denies Brexit campaign role report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Suggestions that Tony Blair is positioning himself to play a role in shaping Brexit are "wholly wrong", his spokeswoman has said.

She also denied a report that the former Labour prime minister regarded Theresa May as "a total lightweight" and Jeremy Corbyn as "a nutter".
Mr Blair has announced he is winding up some of his businesses, leading to speculation over his future.
He has also recommended keeping "options open" over Brexit.
Mr Blair, who won three general elections and was in Downing from 1997 to 2007, campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union in the run-up to June's referendum.
He has described the decision to leave the EU - by 51.9% to 48.1% - as a "catastrophe".
In September, Mr Blair announced he was closing his lobbying and consultancy business, Tony Blair Associates, and associated companies Windrush and Firerush, and wanted to spend most of his time on not-for-profit work.
And last month, he said he was considering whether he had a future "role" in UK politics.
In a Sunday Times report, a source was quoted as saying the former prime minister had criticised Labour's Mr Corbyn and Mrs May. It was also reported that he had had "lots of conversations" with former Chancellor George Osborne "about the post-Brexit political climate". The Sunday Times added that Mr Blair was looking at potential office sites in Westminster.
Asked about the report, Mr Blair's office said: "Tony Blair has already announced that he is bringing all staff under one roof. So, yes, the London staff will all come together in one location. It won't be in Westminster, however.
"The new organisation will be all not-for-profit, as we have announced, and the commercial side has been shut down. The assets of the business will be gifted to the new not-for-profit organisation."
Mr Blair's spokeswoman said he would continue to write articles and give some interviews during the Brexit process, but said he was not seeking a formal position.
She added: "Mr Blair has not had 'regular' discussions with George Osborne regarding Brexit, though he has discussed it with him as he has with many people.
"He does discuss the Middle East and aid with government ministers because he is still very active in the Middle East and Africa with his not-for-profit work. He hasn't discussed Brexit with government ministers."
Mr Blair will "make a proper announcement around all of this in the New Year", she added.
