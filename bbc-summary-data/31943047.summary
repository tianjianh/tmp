Bob McColm, 59, will take over on 23 March from Alison Gomme, who announced her retirement last October.
Mr McColm, who has 30 years' experience in the UK's prison service, will lead an island staff of about 140.
He said: "I will place a strong focus on meeting the rehabilitation needs of prisoners to keep them out of custody."
He added: "I'm aware of the work taking place to reform the island's criminal justice system and the important contribution to be made by the prison and probation service."
Mr McColm has served as governor at HM Young Offenders Institute Lancaster Farms, HMP Garth, HMYOI Thorn Cross, HMP Kirkham and HMP Altcourse.
The Manx government said he also led the transformation of HMP Risley from a failing prison into one with significant performance improvements.
