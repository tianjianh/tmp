Paddy Barnes: Belfast to host WBO European flyweight title fight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two-time Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes is to fight for the WBO European flyweight belt in what will be his third professional bout on 17 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An opponent has yet to be announced for 30-year-old Barnes but the contest will be at the Waterfront Hall in his home city of Belfast.
Barnes made it two pro wins from two with a points victory in a six-rounder against Adrian Dimas Garzon in March.
Jamie Conlan will also feature on the bill at the Waterfront.
Unbeaten Conlan defeated Yader Cardoza on a split decision to take the vacant WBC International Silver super-flyweight crown on 10 March.
Conlan, also 30 and from Belfast, is aiming to secure a world title eliminator having won all 19 of his professional fights.
