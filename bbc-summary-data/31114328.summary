[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mariusz Dobkowski, 30, formerly of Eaton Road, Margate, was convicted of attempted murder at Canterbury Crown Court on Monday.
Ken Seymour, of Cliftonville, needed 40 stitches to his face and was left with a fractured skull and back in the attack in his home in December 2013.
Dobkowski was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 12 years.
Mr Seymour had been out with friends in Margate when he was befriended by Dobkowski as he waited to catch a bus home.
Both men got off the bus together and headed towards Mr Seymour's flat.
Several hours later, a neighbour heard Mr Seymour shout for help and found him covered in blood.
Kent Police said the elderly man had no memory of the attack, but forensic experts matched items in his home with Dobkowski's DNA.
After the hearing, Insp Richard Vickery said: "Instead of facing up to the consequences of his actions, Mariusz Dobkowski ran away to Belgium and tried to carry on with his life while his victim lay in a hospital bed recovering from a number of serious injuries."
Officers tracked Dobkowki down and brought him back under a European arrest warrant last July.
