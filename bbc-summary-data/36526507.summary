A rescue operation was mounted on Saturday after Dover coastguard was alerted to the three-metre dinghy, leaking off Hastings.
The Hastings lifeboat and the Lydd coastguard helicopter were sent, but a Border Force cutter picked the men up.
The Home Office said they had been interviewed by immigration officers and made immigration applications.
"These applications are being progressed in line with immigration rules," said a spokesman.
Five Albanian migrants rescued from a boat carrying 15 other people off the Kent coast on 29 May claimed asylum.
The Home Office said a further 13 fellow Albanians were "processed for removal from the UK".
