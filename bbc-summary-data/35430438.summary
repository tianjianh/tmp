The expansion proposal could see the plant at Dalcross on the A96 double its annual production from 350,000 cubic metres to 750,000.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise has also offered a grant of about £11.5m towards the proposed expansion.
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP Drew Hendry has welcomed the announcement.
Norbord said the project would secure the future of 130 people employed at the factory. The site also supports about 300 indirect jobs in the area.
Two years ago, Highland Council approved plans to expand the site.
