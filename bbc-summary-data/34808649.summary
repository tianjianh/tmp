The Sale Sharks player was arrested after a collision between his Mercedes and a Toyota in the Chelsea area of London at about 05:00 BST on 1 June.
The 28-year-old was given a breath test and taken to a police station before being released on bail.
Scotland Yard confirmed he was charged on Thursday and will appear at West London Magistrates' Court on 10 December.
There were no reports of any injuries following the crash involving Mr Cipriani's black Mercedes C63 and a silver Toyota Prius.
The player, from West Wimbledon, joined Aviva Premiership side Sale Sharks as a fly-half in 2012, four years after his England debut.
However, he was left out of the squad for this year's World Cup tournament amid a reported disagreement with attack coach Mike Catt.
