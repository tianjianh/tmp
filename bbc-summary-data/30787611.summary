Harsent won the prestigious £20,000 award for his eleventh collection Fire Songs. It was his fifth nomination, dating back to 1998, but he had not previously won.
Chair of the judges Helen Dunmore described Harsent as "a poet for dark and dangerous days".
She added: "Fire Songs plumbs language and emotion with technical brilliance and prophetic power."
This year's other nominees included former winners John Burnside and Michael Longley. The 10 shortlisted authors received £1,500 each.
To mark the 50th anniversary of Eliot's death on 4 January 2015, the prize money for the winner has been increased from £15,000 to £20,000.
Judges Dunmore, Sean Borodale and Fiona Sampson chose the shortlist from 113 books submitted by publishers.
