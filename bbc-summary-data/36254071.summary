Sales edged up by 0.3% to £1.77bn and passenger numbers grew from 28.9 million to 31 million..
Attacks in Egypt, Paris and Brussels affected bookings but profits were more strongly affected by a fall in the value of the pound.
The company said it was "confident" that passenger numbers, sales and profits will grow this year.
Chief executive Carolyn McCall told the BBC that Easyjet had had a very strong first half of the year despite "very challenging events".
She said the reason for the loss was because the pound had lost value against the euro since last year: "Technically the reason for the loss is foreign exchange - the softening of the pound against the euro," she added.
The company said the change in values meant Easyjet lost around £30m compared with a year ago.
Ms McCall said: "So if you actually take it at constant currency [assuming the euro and the pound stayed at the same value as they were the year before] we will have made a profit of £5m which is nearly the same as last year."
Winter is often a slow period for airlines and many make a loss for the period.
However, events in Sharm el-Sheikh, Paris and Brussels  did have an effect on demand, said Ms McCall, adding: "There's no question that you have to stimulate demand at the right time to get passengers back in flying and that does happen.
"It does take weeks but actually after a few weeks people want to get back to normality and they start flying again."
On Monday shares in Easyjet rose by 3.8% after broker RBC raised its outlook to "outperform" from "underperform", saying that the business was tackling its cost inflation problems.
"What we have surprised the City about is our cost controls," said Ms McCall.
"We have very actively managed our cost base as you would expect in light of a much more unpredictable revenue environment because of external events and actually I think that has gone very well, so far because our cost per seat is down year on year and we've said it will be flat and down for the year."
Shares in EasyJet edged down slightly following the publication of the results.
