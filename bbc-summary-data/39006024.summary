Police have renewed an appeal to trace a 70-year-old Falkirk man who has been missing from his home for a week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Stevenson, who lives in Glenfuir Court, was last seen in the High Station Road area of the town at about 23:00 on 10 February.
Officers said concern was growing for his welfare as he had not made contact with his friends or family.
Mr Stevenson is 5ft 8in tall, with thinning hair on top and longer hair at the back and sides.
He was believed to be wearing a green tammy hat, black jacket, long cardigan, a blue and white checked shirt, black jeans and khaki trainers.
Det Insp Jim Thomson, from Police Scotland, said: "George has now been missing over a week without being seen or heard from and so far our inquiries have not led us to establish his whereabouts.
"Officers will be in the area of High Station Road Falkirk near to where George was last seen and around his home address in the Summerford area of Falkirk."
