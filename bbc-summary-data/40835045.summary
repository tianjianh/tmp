Barnet 1-0 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Taylor scored an injury-time winner for Barnet as they beat Luton Town at the Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old, whose goal was his first in the professional ranks, broke the deadlock with a 25-yard curling effort in the dying embers of the game.
Rossi Eames' side struggled find their rhythm in the first half, with the manager forced to make two early changes due to injuries to Elliott Johnson and Harry Taylor.
The latter, who left the field with blood pouring from his head, was taken to hospital.
The away side came inches away from scoring early in the first half when Dan Potts directed Alan Sheehan's corner towards goal but Jamie Stephens managed to tip the header onto his crossbar.
Barnet started the second half well and forced Marek Stech into several good saves, but they couldn't find a way past the Czech goalkeeper.
The game looked like it was heading for a goalless draw but Taylor's late strike gave the home side a late lead.
Despite late pressure from Town, the Bees managed to defend successive corners and hold on for their first league win of the season.
