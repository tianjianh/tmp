Sean Cavanagh named in strong Dr McKenna Cup panel by six-in-a-row chasing Tyrone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Cavanagh has been named in a strong Tyrone Dr McKenna Cup squad as Mickey Harte's charges chase a sixth straight triumph in the competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cavanagh, 33, ended speculation over his future by committing to another Red Hands campaign in November.
The  Tyrone squad includes Niall Morgan, Peter Harte, Mattie Donnelly, Tiernan McCann, Connor McAliskey, Colm Cavanagh and Cathal McCarron.
Harte will be minus a number of third-level players including Conall McCann.

Conall McCann, Kieran McGeary, Conor McShane and Conor Meyler will also be in action for St Mary's College in the season-opening Ulster competition.
But despite the absence of the St Mary's quartet, Harte's squad indicates the manager's continuing determination to win the McKenna Cup, in marked contrast to Section C rivals Donegal who have named an under-21 squad for this month's competition.
The Tyrone panel includes Omagh star Conor Clarke who missed all of the 2016 inter-county season because of injury.
Squad newcomers include Clonoe's Declan McClure, Greencastle's Cahir McCullagh, Aghyaran's Ronan McHugh and Cookstown's Ruairi Mullan.
Tyrone will begin their McKenna Cup campaign against Cavan during Sunday's opening round of fixtures.
