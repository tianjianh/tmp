[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 1,000 ravers are being dispersed at an illegal gathering in woods on Dartmoor, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Devon and Cornwall Police said they were called to Bellever Woods at about 02:00 GMT, and between 600 and 1,000 people were estimated to be there when officers arrived.
A number of people were being treated for suspected hypothermia because of being out overnight, officers said.
The gathering continued in the morning but people were leaving, they added.
Ch Insp Richard Hooper-Bennett said people were only being allowed to leave when they were "fit to do so" because it had been an "exceptionally cold night and a few people could be worse for wear".
He added that there had been no arrests so far, no vehicles or sound equipment seized, and he expected it would take take "a few more hours before all people have left".
