Truro City have re-appointed former boss Lee Hodges as their new manager, with New Zealand international striker Rory Fallon joining as his assistant.

Both have signed two-year deals with the National League South side to replace Steve Tully and Wayne Carlisle.
Hodges managed the Cornish club between 2010 and 2013, gaining promotion, but left due because of financial problems.
Fallon featured in the 2010 World Cup and played for the Kiwis in a 1-0 win over New Caledonia on Wednesday.
"I'm looking forward to coming back to Truro and to getting back to the buzz of winning games," Hodges said.
"It's all happened very quickly and it's been a bit of a whirlwind but I feel like I have unfinished business at Treyew Road."
Hodges, 42, played for various clubs including Plymouth, Barnet and Reading and got the White Tigers promoted to the sixth tier in his previous spell in charge.
Fallon, who will play for Truro alongside his role as assistant boss, was released by Bristol Rovers last month and his previous clubs include Aberdeen, Plymouth and Swansea.
The 34-year-old has 24 New Zealand caps and scored his most recent international goal in a 5-0 victory against Vanuatu last month.
Meanwhile, Truro have signed striker Andrew Neal and midfielder River Allen from Bodmin Town and handed new deals to six players, including Aaron Bentley and Jamie Richards.
