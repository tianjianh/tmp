Bromley 3-2 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley stunned high-flying Gateshead to secure their first National League win of the season with a 3-2 victory at Hayes Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Bolton's first goal for Gateshead looked like setting up a routine afternoon for the Heed after five minutes, but that lead lasted only a minute as Tobi Sho-Silva struck a quickfire equaliser with a drilled shot from 20 yards.
The former Charlton forward added his second with a cool finish from close range after 11 minutes, before Joe Anderson made it 3-1 to the hosts with an opportunist strike nine minutes before the interval.
Tempers frayed as the second half wore on, with both sides going down to 10 men as Manny Smith and Sho-Silva saw red for second yellow cards.
Danny Johnson pulled one back for Gateshead from the spot with 10 minutes remaining, but it was too late to affect the outcome.
