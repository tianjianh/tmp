[SN]TITLE[SN]
Caerphilly tunnel jam driver jailed and disqualified

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who led police on a high-speed chase in Caerphilly county before getting stuck in a tunnel has been jailed for 18 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Paul Jones, 27, admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop for police, driving while disqualified and without insurance, and failing to provide a blood sample.
Cardiff Crown Court heard he reached speeds of 78mph.
It came to an end when the car got wedged under a railway bridge.
The court was told police attempted to stop Jones' car near to Brynhyfryd to carry out checks on 15 June.
He initially stopped, but when officers approached he made off.
The seven-mile (11km) pursuit came to and end in what Gwent Police described as a "moment of sheer recklessness and stupidity" when Jones drove down a footpath and got wedged under a railway bridge towards Churchhill Park.
PC Matt Richley said: "He proceeded to drive in such a manner that he not only put members of the public at risk but also himself, his passengers and the police."
As well as the jail sentence, Jones of Pontypridd, was disqualified from driving for four years and nine months.
