[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The New Saints were beaten by Rijeka in the first leg of their Champions League second qualifying round tie in Croatia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Croatian champions dominated to lead 1-0 at half-time thanks to Josip Misic's free-kick after seven minutes.
TNS defended doggedly but fell further behind when Florentin Matei tapped in from close range on 68 minutes.
Scott Quigley fired wide in a rare attack from the visitors and, although Rijeka continued to pour forward, the Croatians could not add to their lead.
The second leg will be played at TNS's Park Hall home in Oswestry next Tuesday night (18 July, 19:00 BST).
"It was disappointing to concede quite early on," said TNS midfielder Aeron Edwards. "After that, we defended really well, and played well at times.
"We had chances at the end and, if we could have nicked a goal, it would have been all to play for.
"But we'll go back hopeful next week. Maybe we can get an early goal and put them on the back foot."
