Boxing at the Rio Olympics was marred by several controversial decisions.
Irish bantamweight Michael Conlan, who said he was "robbed", and Kazakhstan's Vassiliy Levit lost bouts in which they both appeared to win comfortably.
The International Boxing Association (AIBA) said it would "fully assess what action needs to be taken".
"While the majority of the boxing competition in Rio 2016 was received very positively, a small number of decisions under debate indicated that further reforms in the AIBA referee and judging procedures were necessary," amateur boxing's governing body said.
The AIBA dropped a number of unidentified judges and referees during the competition, after finding that "less than a handful" of the decisions from 239 bouts reviewed were not at the level expected.
It also "reassigned" executive director Karim Bouzidi to a new role.
