Plans for a £42m cinema and restaurant complex have been approved by councillors in Plymouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The coach station at Bretonside will be pulled down and replaced with the development, which will also include a car park with 420 spaces.
Sixteen food and drink units are planned for the bus station site, which was built in 1958.
The former Mayflower West Car Park, about half-a-mile from Bretonside, will be turned into a new coach station.
Seven councillors voted in favour of the plans and there were six abstentions.
Previously, developer British Land claimed the new complex could create 350 jobs and 260 construction jobs.
