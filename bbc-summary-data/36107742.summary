Angry Marseille fans criticised owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and described her as an "incompetent rich heiress" during the draw on 11 April.
Another banner held up said: "Go back to your real job, housewife."
The French League (LFP) said that two stands will remain partially shut while an investigation takes place.
England play their opening Euro 2016 fixture against Russia at the stadium on 11 June.
Around 200 supporters were dispersed by police using tear gas at the end of the game.
Marseille, whose coach Michel was replaced by Franck Passi on Tuesday, are 15th in the Ligue 1 standings, six points above the relegation zone with four games left.
