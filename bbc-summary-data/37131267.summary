[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes teacher banned over ill-treatment conviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been banned indefinitely from teaching after he failed to disclose a conviction for locking a vulnerable adult in his bedroom using a belt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theophilus Horsoo, 41, of Milton Keynes, registered as a supply teacher with Simply Education Limited in 2014.
A National College for Teaching conduct panel heard he was convicted in 2013 of "ill-treating or wilfully neglecting" a person without capacity.
Mr Horsoo admitted he was "dishonest" in not disclosing the offence.
The panel heard the conviction related to an incident in 2012 in which a vulnerable adult "service user" was locked in a bedroom by Mr Horsoo who used a belt to secure the door shut.
The panel was told the Mr Horsoo "took no account of the risk to the service user".
In banning him from teaching, the panel said: "Mr Horsoo stated how sorry he was for the actions he took to lock the service user in his room. This was a serious error of judgment on his part.
"He also apologised for not disclosing this conviction when applying for jobs in 2014 which he realised, with the benefit of hindsight, he was clearly obligated to so."
