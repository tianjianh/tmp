Ipswich could have been ahead after 18 minutes when Liam Feeney hit the post with a fierce drive.
Town's Brett Pitman also had an effort cleared off the line by Kortney Hause late in the first half after the 20-year-old Wolves defender had given the ball away to the striker.
Matt Doherty had Wolves' best chance, but his effort was saved home goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
The result means Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy extended his unbeaten record against former club Wolves to six games since being sacked as manager in February 2012.
Town stay eighth in the Championship, but are now five points off the play-off places having managed just one win in their past four games, while Wolves stay in 12th place.
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett:

"I felt that defensively we did well and I was pleased that the back four looked quite cohesive and competitive and we needed to be as otherwise at the start of the game Ipswich would have swept us away.
"It was hard to get our passing game going through midfield which has been a feature when we have got it right this season.
"While we are pleased defensively we want more. We want to be able to pass the ball and flow and it through midfield and create chances and score goals which can give us a chance of progressing.
"We have been a mid-table side this season and that is what it has been.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"I view it as a compliment (on being linked with the Aston Villa job). I can't help but feel it is a compliment when clubs of that ilk think that I am doing a good job as a manager bearing in mind that I have got two similar clubs promoted.
"But I have for a job here and there is nothing I can do about whatever they are saying. I won't even talk about what another job might entail.
"We have seven games and we want to get in the play-offs. My focus is on trying to get in the play-offs.
"We have got two home games coming up now and I do feel that we are going to have to win them to be in the mix."
