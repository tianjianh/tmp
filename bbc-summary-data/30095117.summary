IPCC investigates Gwent Police contact with Martin Bowen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The actions of five police officers are to be investigated by the police watchdog after a woman was stabbed several times by her ex-partner hours after calling police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman called Gwent Police as Martin Bowen, 24, was texting her, in breach of a harassment warning.
But officers did not attend her home, and hours later Bowen stabbed her in the neck and chest.
He was jailed for eight years at Cardiff Crown Court on 19 September.
Bowen pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm.
The woman called police to say Bowen was sending her threatening text messages.
He then burst into her home and attacked her.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said it will look into how Gwent Police handled allegations made by the victim against Bowen before the attack on 19 July.
It said it would look at why officers did not attend the woman's address after she rang them to report Bowen, but also at "actions taken by police in response to previous incidents between the two, dating back two years".
A sergeant, four constables and two police call centre staff are being investigated.
IPCC Commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said: "This has been a traumatic time for the woman and her family and my thoughts are with them.
She added: "In view of previous IPCC recommendations to the force from earlier investigations, we will also be examining more closely what action has been taken to improve Gwent Police's response to, and handling of, domestic abuse cases."
Gwent Police said: "We are fully co-operating with the IPCC investigation, and it would be inappropriate to provide any further comment until the investigation is complete."
In September the IPCC found Gwent Police missed chances to help Caroline Parry who was shot dead by her estranged husband after she told them she was scared of him.
Mrs Parry was shot at close range outside her Newport home by husband Christopher Parry in 2013. She had contacted Gwent Police twice in the months leading up to her death, raising concerns and asking for help.
