[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At least 40 pupils have been taken out of lessons at a school in Cheshire for refusing to remove a charity badge from their blazers.

Pupils at Runcorn's Grange School were asked to take off the Marie Curie trademark yellow daffodil because it broke the dress code.
However, some refused and were segregated from other children.
Head teacher Barry Carney said the "unfortunate" row was "an enormous distraction".
Marie Ward, whose daughter was taken out of class, said it was "disgraceful".
She said she did not understand why the school, which raises money on behalf of other charities, would not allow the badges.
"A little pin badge on the blazer and they say 'no', yet they have a big [school badge] on the blazer," she said.
Mr Carney said 70 pupils wore the cancer charity's trademark daffodil badge but many had decided to remove it when asked.
However, he said, a "small number" of those who refused were kept in separate classrooms while staff explained why they could not wear them.
Pupils who were kept in classrooms disputed the claim, and told the BBC the actual number isolated was more like 120.
Mr Carney said he would review the current rules if the issue was raised through the school council.
"We don't want the school blazer to be adorned with badges, we're happy for the children to wear them on their coats or on their bag," he said.
He said the school was not against charities and has a nominated charity each year, chosen by the head boy and head girl.
Marie Curie said while it was "very happy" Grange School pupils have been collecting money and supporting the charity it could not comment on schools' policies.
