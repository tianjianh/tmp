Eircode: Shannon airport relocates under Ireland's new postcode system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the Republic of Ireland's three major airports has taken flight and 'relocated' under the country's new postcode system.

Every house in the country is receiving a unique seven-digit identifying code, known as an Eircode.
The system has been criticised by some organisations that say its database has "gaps and inaccuracies".
Shannon airport in County Clare, for example, is listed on the system as being based in County Limerick.
The Eircode website is now live and the public can use it to search for up to 15 addresses a day.
Eircode's commercial manager Alan Dignam told Irish state broadcaster RTÉ he believed the new system will make industry more efficient by using an exact latitude/longitude mapping system that will drive down costs.
He also acknowledged that there are some issues that still need to be ironed out.
Households will be notified of their new Eircode within two weeks.
Neil McDonnell, the general manager of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, said that while revenue, social welfare and the health service would benefit from the system, it does not go far enough to help the parcel and package industry.
Conradh na Gaeilge, an organisation promoting the Irish language, also criticised the new system, saying that "up to 50,000 place names are inaccurate or completely missing from the database".
Its president, Cóilín Ó Cearbhaill, said the country's department of communications was "treating those of who wish to use Irish in our lives as second class citizens" because "the new postcode system won't acknowledge the Irish-speaking community".
Sat-nav systems do not recognise Eircodes yet, but negotiations are taking place with digital mapping companies to change this "within months".
