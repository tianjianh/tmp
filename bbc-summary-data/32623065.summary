[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grant Ferguson has become one of the first people to pass a new-style UK driving test, that includes following directions on a sat-nav.

The revised test has been on trial in 20 locations across the UK since April.
Mr Ferguson, who's 17, took his test at the Bishopbriggs driving centre in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland.
Among other more standard manoeuvres, he had to follow a route on a sat-nav for 20 minutes.
The changes are designed to "better reflect real driving", explained a spokesman for the DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency).
"Any future changes to the test would be subject to full public consultation," he added.
Other changes being tested include:
The DVSA hopes to complete 1,000 of the new tests, which will continue until early 2016.
So far, around 20 people have taken the new test.
Driving instructor Drew Nicol, who taught Mr Ferguson, thinks the update is a good idea.
"Lots of people have criticised the idea of using sat-navs but people are going to use them when they drive so it makes sense that we teach them to use them properly," he told the BBC.
"I teach learners to listen to it rather than look at it or glance at it only when it is safe to do so."
