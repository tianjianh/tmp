What is life like in Kobane, as Islamic State advance?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 400 people have died in three weeks of fighting in Kobane - the Syria-Turkey border town Islamic State (IS) is trying to capture.

The Syrian Kurd defenders have been supported by air strikes, carried out by the US-led coalition, but the Turkish president has warned these aren't helping enough.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Kobane is "about to fall".
About 160,000 Syrian people have fled, but civilians remain in the town.
If IS captures Kobane, its militants will control a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.
Kobane, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab, and the villages surrounding it have been home to about 400,000 people, most of them Kurds.
Since earlier this year it has been surrounded on three sides by IS forces.
In September IS began to advance, with more than 100,000 people seeking refuge in Turkey.
The Turkish government is opposed to President Assad and his regime in Syria.
The country has promised not to let Kobane fall but is doing little about it.
It's powerful military, just watches and waits. Tanks are lined up on the hills overlooking the town but they remain silent.
The country is reluctant to intervene, partly because it has a long history of unrest with its own Kurdish population, but also because it wants the US-led coalition to agree on a number of things before it gets involved.
These include setting up a no-fly zone and a buffer zone in northern Syria and helping to get rid of President Assad.
There have been clashes in Turkey as well, mainly between police and pro-Turkish protestors.
Cities including Istanbul and Diyarbakir have witnessed demonstrations, and a 25-year-old Kurdish man has died in Varto in eastern Turkey during a protest.
US officials say the campaign against IS will take months and years, not days and weeks; there are going to be setbacks along the way and the loss of Kobane could be one.
They have led coalition forces, carrying out air strikes in Syria against IS command and economic targets like oil installations.
Much of their focus has remained in Iraq however.
Brigadier Ben Barry, the land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, says the problems around Kobane show "the lack of any real ability to synchronise the air effort with what is taking place on the ground".
BBC journalist Paul Adams is in the area and has been tweeting updates on the conflict, including monitoring the number of air strikes.
Piers Scholfied, another BBC journalist, has described the "sound of grenades, gunfire, echoes across the valley".
