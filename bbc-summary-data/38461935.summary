The boys, both 17 and named locally as Reigan Knight and Liam Phillips, were passengers in a Ford Escort which crashed in Leigh-on-Sea on Tuesday.
Paper lanterns were lit near the beach in Leigh-on-Sea as about 300 people turned out to pay their respects.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has started an investigation into the crash.
Chloe Carter, a friend of Reigan who helped organise the vigil, said: "It is horrible, especially for his loved one. As soon as I met Reigan I had an instant connection with him. He's lovely. He has a heart of gold."
Another friend, Paige Hall, said: "I have come to show respect to Reigan and Liam... I was really close to them. I want to celebrate their lives with friends and family and prove that they will never be forgotten."
The IPCC is looking at the actions of Essex Police officers in a patrol car and in the control room before the crash.
It has identified CCTV that may help the inquiry and has been conducting door-to-door enquiries following the collision in Southsea Avenue.
Friends and family of the boys who died have started a GoFundMe internet page and have gone on Facebook to remember them.
Liam's mother, Cindy, posted that she "can't believe two young lives have been taken so needlessly".
She said Liam had taken a difficult path and she was desperate to get him back on track, but fate had intervened.
A 16-year-old from Great Wakering has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and possession of cannabis.
A 17-year-old from Shoebury arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs has been released on bail until 14 January.
