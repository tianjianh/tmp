[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 0-0 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester twice needed the help of the woodwork at their former home at Moss Rose as they held Macclesfield to a goalless Cheshire derby draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Macclesfield substitute Danny Rowe's late left-foot curler hit the post, before he then struck the same upright with a low left-foot shot.
In an entertainingly competitive game, midfielder Danny Whitaker was also denied by a fine first-half save by debutant Chester keeper Alex Lynch.
But Chester deserved to extend their unbeaten National League run to nine games, during which they have conceded just one goal.
Chester went close before the break as Jordan Chappell and Elliott Durrell were both denied.
But the pace and trickery of ex-Chester striker Chris Holroyd also caused the visitors problems.
