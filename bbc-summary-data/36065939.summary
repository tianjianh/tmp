The bodies were found at a house in Dawson Avenue in Spalding on Friday.
Police believe they are Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her 13-year-old daughter Katie although they have not been formally identified.
The two teenagers have both been remanded to appear before Lincoln Magistrates' Court on Monday.
They are believed to be a boy and a girl, but officers have not confirmed this.
Post-mortem examinations on the victims are due to be carried out shortly.
Det Ch Insp Martin Holvey, who is leading the inquiry, has appealed for anyone who was in the Dawson Avenue area from about midday on Wednesday 13 April to the same time on Friday to contact the police.
He added: "Our officers will continue to carry out inquiries in the locality and local uniformed officers will also be in the area.
"If you have any concerns please don't hesitate to talk to them."
Neighbours said that they last saw Ms Edwards, a dinner lady at a local primary school, on Tuesday.
Posting on Facebook, Ms Edwards' partner Graham Green wrote: "My babe has gone but you will always in my heart forever and ever and ever.
"The lady meant the world to me, she was my rock. Katie, so young, lots of good times in front of us been taken away r.i.p."
A friend of Katie's described her as being "like a sister" and Ms Edwards as a second mother.
