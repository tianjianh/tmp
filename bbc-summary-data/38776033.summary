Aleena Kauser was walking with her mother when she was hit by a car travelling at more than 60mph (96km/h) in a 30mph zone.
Adil Manir, 20, admitted causing death by dangerous driving while Mohsen Saddique, 23, was found guilty after a trial at Burnley Crown Court.
The pair were given four-year sentences.
Aleena was walking on a pavement with her mother along Bacup Road in Rawtenstall, Lancashire to a mosque when she was hit by Manir's Audi A5 on 18 September 2015.
She was airlifted to the Royal Blackburn Hospital but later died.
Saddique was tailgating Manir in a Volkswagen Golf immediately before the crash, with only 6ft (2m) between the cars as they drove at speeds between 55mph and 64mph, the court heard.
Saddique was "actively encouraging [Manir] to drive faster and more dangerously", Senior Crown Prosecutor Tom Snape said.
He added: "Both men showed complete disregard for all other road users when they used their cars to race with each other.
"Even though only one car actually struck Aleena, they are both culpable for her fatal injuries. Today as they begin their sentences, they must now face up to the consequences of their reckless actions."
