Ghana's President John Mahama has said that he will respect the outcome of Wednesday's tightly contested election.

He also said in a tweet that the Electoral Commission should be allowed to carry out its mandate.
Local media are reporting that opposition candidate Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, 72, has an unassailable lead but official results have not been released.
Final results must be declared by 17:00 GMT on Saturday.
The electoral commission announced on Thursday that it was manually verifying the results because its electronic system had been targeted by hackers.
In a tweet, it urged people to ignore the "fake results" circulating on social media.
"I want to assure the nation that we will respect the outcome of the  elections, positive or negative," said Mr Mahama.
The ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) candidate's quest for a second term is facing a strong challenge from a revitalised New Patriotic Party (NPP).
A run-off will be held later in the month if neither of the two main candidates secures more than 50% of the votes.
The campaign was dominated by Ghana's faltering economy.
In the previous election in 2012, Mr Mahama defeated Mr Akufo-Addo by less than 300,000 votes.
NDC candidate: John Dramani Mahama, 58
Can 'Mr Power Cut' John Mahama win a second term?
NPP candidate: Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, 72
Third time lucky for opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo?
Defeat for Mr Mahama would make him the first incumbent to lose an election since Ghana returned to multi-party democracy in 1992.
He has been nicknamed "Mr Dumsor", a local word that refers to the power cuts that have blighted the country during his term, but on the campaign trial has been trying to convince Ghanaians that he is delivering on his promise of creating more jobs.
Mr Akufo-Addo has promised free high-school education and more factories, but his critics have questioned the viability of his ambitions.
The other four candidates include former first lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings of the National Democratic Party (NDP), whose husband Jerry John Rawlings initially took power in the 1979 coup.
She is the first woman to run for president in the West African country.
Although the EC is yet to declare the winner, parliamentary results declared at the constituency level show that the NPP has won 107 seats out of 175.
The results for 100 remaining constituencies are still to come.
