Bristol City forward Lee Tomlin has been warned by head coach Lee Johnson that he could lose his place in the side if he picks up a suspension.

The 27-year-old collected his fourth booking of the season during Saturday's 2-2 Championship draw at Rotherham.
Tomlin will be forced to serve an automatic one-match ban if he receives another booking.
"He's like our Gascoigne or Zidane. There's a fine line between insanity and genius," said Johnson.
He told BBC Radio Bristol: "You can't change a personality and you really don't want to change a personality."
With Callum O'Dowda, Jamie Paterson and Gustav Engvall - all omitted from Saturday's starting line-up - pushing for places, Tomlin could face competition for a first-team start.
"I don't think it's a given that anyone is going to start every game," said Johnson. "If you're forcing somebody's hand, it's going to be difficult to get in a team that's hopefully playing well."
