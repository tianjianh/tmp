A second series of his BBC One drama Taboo has been commissioned - thanks in part to its success on the BBC iPlayer.
Set in 19th Century London, the first series saw Hardy's character return from Africa to claim an inheritance.
The actor, who conceived the show with his father Chips and writer Steven Knight, said its recommissioning was "fantastic news".
"We are grateful and excited to continue our relationship with the BBC and FX in contributing towards British drama," he added.
The first series came to an end on 25 February and drew an average consolidated audience of 5.8 million - a figure reached after seven days that takes some catch-up viewing into account.
According to the BBC, though, the drama's average audience was closer to 7 million, with viewers discovering it after that seven-day window.
Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content, said Taboo "proves overnight ratings are not the only measure of success."
"I'm thrilled that a work which pushes boundaries has been so well received," said Knight, who produced the show with Tom and Sir Ridley Scott.
The first series of Taboo will remain on the iPlayer until 27 March.
