[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has challenged Labour's leadership contenders during a live radio hustings to say whether they would ever consider EU withdrawal.

Introduced as "Nigel from Kent", he posed the question during a debate and phone-in on LBC Radio.
In response, Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham said they could not conceive ever arguing for an EU exit.
Jeremy Corbyn said the EU would lose public support if it treated all its members "like it had treated Greece".
During the 90-minute hustings, the latest ahead of September's leadership election, the four contenders were asked a range of questions about policy and personality, being scrutinised about their religious beliefs, attitudes to private education, their musical tastes and whether they would give ex-leader Ed Miliband a job in their shadow cabinet.
Mr Corbyn said Mr Miliband had a lot to contribute and hinted that he might offer him the job of energy and climate change spokesman, a job the ex-leader held in the last Labour government.
Ms Kendall said she had no idea what Mr Miliband's plans were but suggested it was time for a "new generation".
Asked by Mr Farage if there were circumstances in which he might vote no in the planned referendum on EU membership, Mr Burnham said: "There aren't, because I always will believe that being in Europe is better for jobs in our country."
Ms Cooper said EU membership was in the UK's national interest while Liz Kendall said she was a Yes voter "first and last and always".
Mr Corbyn, who according to a YouGov Poll published on Tuesday, is leading the contest, said the EU needed to do more to defend workers' rights and increase social protection.
But he suggested that "if Europe becomes a totally brutal organisation which treats member states in the way it has treated Greece", then it would lose the support of many people.
The candidates were asked what songs they would chose for a victory party if they were elected leader.
Mr Burnham opted for a song by the Manchester band The Courteeners, while Ms Kendall chose Get Up, Stand Up by Public Enemy and Mr Corbyn opted for John Lennon's Imagine.
When the host Iain Dale said he would choose Dancing Queen, Ms Cooper said the quartet had spent so much time together recently they risked being seen as an Abba tribute band, made up of the "the dark one, the blond one, the bearded one and the other one".
