Belfast: Michael Stitt charged with attempted murder over car attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court charged with attempted murder, after allegedly driving a car at his neighbour during a row over a paint attack on a vehicle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Stitt, from Butler Place in north Belfast, was refused bail at Belfast Magistrates' Court.
He is accused of driving "directly at" his neighbour, Daniel McFarland, after a confrontation on Friday, 15 October.
The court was told Mr McFarland is still in hospital after he sustained a fractured skull and broken ankle.
Mr Stitt, 25, was also charged with driving while disqualified and driving without insurance on the same date.
He confirmed that he understood the three charges against him.
The attack allegedly took place in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast, when a dispute between neighbours about paint being poured over Mr Stitt's car erupted into violence.
A detective constable, who said he believed he could connect Mr Stitt to the charges, objected to bail.
The judge said there was "obviously a background" to the allegations and that everyone involved lived "close together".
He refused bail but added that he would be more inclined to grant the application if there was an alternative address further from the scene of the attack.
