The world number three raced through the first set - but had to come from a break down in the second before sealing a 6-0 6-4 victory over a Frenchman.
Britain's Murray, 28, will meet David Goffin, who thrashed Tomas Berdych 6-0 6-0, for a place in the last four.
Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal both won, but Roger Federer was beaten by world number 15 Dominic Thiem.
Murray, the number two seed, has had his path to the final cleared after Stan Wawrinka - the number four seed and in the same half of the draw as the Scot - was beaten in three sets by Juan Monaco.
The victory over the world number 32 Chardy continues Murray's build-up to the French Open, which begins on 22 May, and follows his run to the final in Madrid last week.
Asked about Goffin's one-sided win over Berdych, Murray told BBC Sport: "The scoreline was the big surprise.
"Goffin's a top quality player so it was a match that could go either way, but a very surprising scoreline - you don't see results like that much nowadays, at this top level anyway."
Murray is now guaranteed to return to number two in the rankings next week, following Federer's defeat.
"It's not incredibly important but it's positive," he said. "Being seeded two is a little bit better than being seeded three or four in the major events, it can help the draw a little bit for sure. It's a positive thing."
On court for an hour and 17 minutes, Murray won 87% of points when he landed his first serve and only gave Chardy a sniff when mistakes in the second set followed a virtually error-free first.
But from 3-4 down, three consecutive games, including two breaks, confirmed a passage to the semi-finals.
Federer, who has struggled with a back injury, lost 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 to Austrian Thiem, who moves on to face Kei Nishikori.
The 34-year-old Swiss, a 17-time Grand Slam winner, made 34 unforced errors and said he fears for his chances at Roland Garros.
"I see my chances as not great to have the most unbelievable run," said Federer.
"But if maybe in three, four days I can practise 100% for next week, then I believe that something is possible again."
World number one Djokovic, who will reach $100m (Â£69m) in career prize money if he defends his title at the Foro Italico, battled past world number 37 Tomaz Belluci in three sets in strange circumstances.
The Serb was 'bagelled' for only the ninth time in his career, winning only eight points in the first set.
He then offered animated celebrations when he scraped a hold of serve in the first game of the second.
From there, though, he moved to a 0-6 6-3 6-2 victory and a quarter-final meeting with Nadal, who defeated Australian Nick Kyrgios in three sets.
