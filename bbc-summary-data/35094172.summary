How Russia and Turkey are deep in a tit-for-tat dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In less than a month, Russia and Turkey have illustrated what can quickly happen when two countries launch a tit-for-tat dispute.

The disagreement goes back to the downing of a Russian air force jet by two Turkish F-16s  around Turkey's border with Syria on 24 November.
Since then, Ankara and Moscow have traded barbs, introduced retaliatory measures and made calculated threats at one another.
On 25 November, Gennady Onishchenko, a Russian prime ministerial aide, said that "each Turkish tomato" bought in Russia contributed to Turkey's economy and thus to purchasing missiles that could potentially be fired at Russian warplanes.
Russia's agriculture minister said that around 15% of Turkish produce did not meet Russian safety standards. As a result, hundreds of tonnes of Turkish food was stopped at the border and prevented from entering Russia.
Sanctions against Turkey were expected, and they were duly announced three days later on 28 November.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move affected imports from Turkey, the work of Turkish companies in Russia and any Turkish nationals working for Russian companies.
The decree also called for an end to charter flights between the countries and suspended the visa-free arrangement for Turks visiting Russia.
It also means that Russian football clubs are banned from buying Turkish players - for the time being at least.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan started to make conciliatory noises at this point, saying he hoped for talks with Mr Putin. But then he said he refused to apologise, and then...
On 2 December, Russia's defence ministry accused Mr Erdogan's family of being directly involved in the trade of oil with the so-called Islamic State group - Mr Erdogan called the claim "slander".
A day later, it was Turkey's turn to accuse Russia of buying oil from IS. "We have the proof in our hands," Mr Erdogan said - but no more was forthcoming on this from Ankara.
Turkey was not happy when images emerged on 6 December showing a Russian serviceman apparently holding a missile launcher as his ship passed through Turkish waters.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the incident a "provocation" and Russia's ambassador was summonsed.
On 13 December, Russia said one of its warships fired warning shots at a Turkish fishing boat in the Aegean Sea to avoid a collision, claiming that the Turkish vessel approached to 600m (1,800ft) before turning away in response to Russian small arms fire.
The captain of the Turkish boat said he was unaware that his vessel had been shot at. Russia demands Turkey's defence attache come to talks.
In the most recent development, a Russian company said on 14 December that a Turkish boat refused to move out of the way of a convoy of Russian ships transporting oil rigs in the Black Sea.
The AFP news agency reports that a patrol boat from the Russian FSB security service's border guard and a missile boat from the Russian Black Sea Fleet forced it to change course.
The incident reportedly occurred on 24 November, the same day the plane was shot down, but was announced only on Monday.
