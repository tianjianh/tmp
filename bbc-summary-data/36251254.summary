There was a first day at school feeling - and a back to school feeling - as the fifth session of the Scottish Parliament gets under way.

Thursday's election saw a major shifting of sands and change of scenery in the Scottish political landscape.
Along with upheavals in party pecking orders, more than 45 new MSPs turned up for work at Holyrood for the first time on Monday.
First-timer, Conservative MSP Annie Wells, confessed to be having trouble sleeping, so she was out for an early walk with Princess Faith.
The Green's Mark Ruskell was quick off the mark, to get in and to get down to business.
The Scottish Parliament itself got round to welcoming the new intake, including the youngest ever member, Ross Greer.
Today was more of a flit for the SNP's Shirley-Anne Somerville, as she moved into her new office.
While Conservative Brian Whittle was left wondering a bit how electoral events had led him to the parliament.
For some, after the formalities of photos, induction, security pass - there was time for selfies in the chamber.
One veteran, Labour's Ken Macintosh, had uploaded a #CarpoolKaroke video during the campaign, calling on a Return of the Mack.
Well the Mack was back, but he had time to spare a thought for those who were left behind as the #SP16 session got under way.
