Volunteers will start running Woodland Road Sports and Social Centre, in Croesyceiliog, Cwmbran, from April.
The move will save Torfaen council more than £60,000 a year.
The proposal was part of the authority's wider budget savings of £11.2m for 2014/15.
A group of community council members, sports and social club members, centre users and volunteers will receive training from the council before they take charge.
Croesyceiliog and Llanyrafon community council will take on some of the legal responsibilities in the short term.
A business plan is being drawn up to explore the possibility of the partnership taking over the whole site, with the long-term aim of making it self-sustainable.
In the meantime, current agreements with sports clubs and those who use the pitches at the centre will be honoured.
Community council chairman Colin Crick said the partnership planned to turn the centre into an "even more attractive and thriving hub" for all ages and interests.
"This is an exciting opportunity to acquire this site for the community and ensure its long-term future," he added.
The club is home to a number of drama, dance and choir groups, and provides exercise and sports sessions such as kickboxing.
It also has a child contact centre, a club for people with learning disabilities and a group for men with mental health issues.
