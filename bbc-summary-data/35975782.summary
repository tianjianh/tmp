[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Street signs in tribute to leading suffragettes who lived in Salford have had to be amended after a spelling slip-up.

The signs, to honour Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter, were misspelt Parkhurst Close and Chrisable Walk.
Emmeline Pankhurst lived in Seedley where the new streets have been built.
Councillor John Warmisham, who had suggested the street names, said he was "gutted" by the error.

The Labour councillor for Pendleton said the misspelling had been pointed out by a constituent and he raised the matter with Urban Vision who are responsible for naming streets in the city.
"They told me that they sent the correct spellings to the developers Countryside Properties so something must have gone wrong somewhere," he said.
Emmeline Pankhurst was the founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) that campaigned for women's suffrage.
Her daughters Christabel and Sylvia were also leading figures in the suffragette movement.
A spokeswoman for Countryside Properties said: "Our attention has been drawn to the spelling mistakes made on the new street signs at the new Liverpool Street development in Salford.
"Countryside accepts full responsibility for this matter and we would like to apologise for any offence caused. We took the signs down as soon as we realised the error and new ones will be in place as soon as possible."
