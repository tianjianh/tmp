A collection of four silver $2 coins costs NZ$469 (Â£240) while silver-plated $1 coins cost NZ$23.50 (Â£12) each.
All Niueans are New Zealand citizens and Queen Elizabeth II, who appears on the reverse of coins, is head of state.
Coin-issuer New Zealand Mint said they were gift products and would not be used "to go buy an ice cream with".
The first 10 silver-plated Star Wars coins will be available in November with a further 30 to be issued in the future.
A maximum of 50,000 copies of each silver-plated coin will be produced.
No more than 7,500 of each of the silver coins - which contain 1oz of the precious metal - will be produced.
In April, Niue premier Toke Talagi defended stamps celebrating the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton which featured a perforated line that split the couple.
