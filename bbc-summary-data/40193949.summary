The Fermanagh rider sustained three broken vertebrae, a broken tailbone, a fractured thumb and a broken finger in Saturday's supersport practice crash.
Johnston has also revealed that he had a bleed in his brain after the crash.
"If I can get fit again within a month or a month and a half I plan to be at Dundrod in August," said Johnston, 28.
"I want to get back out as soon as possible and I want to try and be fit for the Ulster," said Johnston.
The 28-year-old was released from Noble's Hospital on Wednesday and made his way to the TT grandstand to catch some of the racing action.
"As well as my other injuries, I had some bleeding on the brain but that has stopped and that is why they thought I was stable enough to let me out.
"It's testament to all my safety gear that I am fit and walking about so soon.
"It is a very fast place and a very dangerous place to come off and I remember nothing of the crash, the air ambulance or arriving at hospital," added the Northern Irishman.
Johnston is disappointed to miss racing at this year's event on the Isle of Man but is grateful for the many messages of support from road racing fans.
"It's frustrating as I had really good bikes but all the messages of support show how much the road racing community care for each other. It's been crazy.
"I won't be retiring anyhow. That thought hasn't entered my head. I'm too afraid of having to get a real job."
