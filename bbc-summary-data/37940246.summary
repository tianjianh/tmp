[SN]TITLE[SN]
Councillor Matthew Bryan guilty of assault on bouncer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor who sat on a licensing committee has been found guilty of assaulting a doorman at a bar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire West and Chester councillor Matthew Bryan, 30, received a 12-month community order from Chester City magistrates for common assault in an altercation in Chester in February.
The Upton councillor had denied hitting the doorman at the Kuckoo bar.
A case against Bryan for obstructing a police officer during an anti-fracking protest was dismissed last month.
The Labour Party suspended the councillor when he was charged for the bar assault.
Bryan, of Cambrian Avenue, Vicars Cross, Chester, has stepped down as vice-chair of the committee responsible for alcohol licences.
He said his solicitor had lodged an appeal in the case.
Cheshire West and Chester Council said it would not be commenting but said he would remain on the council.
Bryan was elected to the authority in 2015, when control shifted from the Conservatives.
