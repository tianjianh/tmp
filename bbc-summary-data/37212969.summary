Leicester rail users 'most underserved' in Britain, survey suggests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail users in Leicester are the most underserved in Britain, according to research which suggests the city has the fewest number of railway stations per head of population.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city has one railway station serving almost 350,000 people.
Campaign for Better Transport Leicestershire said public transport "could be better".
It has been campaigning for the Ivanhoe line, from Leicester to Burton-upon-Trent, to reopen to passenger trains.
The group's chairman, Terry Kirby, said: "We've struggled for 20 to 30 years. Leicester station is busy and there are only four platforms.
"Cardiff is a similar sized city but it has more than a dozen stations."
The capital of Wales has 20 stations, which works out as one per 17,858 people.
The research, carried out by the Press Association, listed 10 places with the fewest number of railway stations.
Areas served by a mixture of mainline and light rail services, such as Sunderland and Wolverhampton, were not included in the ranking.
The City of London was found to top a list of the highest concentration of stations per population, with one for just 1,460 residents.
