"With over two million women and girls currently playing the sport, I have no doubt that next year's Women's Rugby World Cup in Dublin and Belfast will be a fantastic event and encourage many more ladies to get involved."

BBC Sport's Sara Orchard:
"The draw couldn't have gone any better for England, who avoided both the four-time champions New Zealand and hosts Ireland.
"There will be high expectations for the Red Roses, especially after becoming the first nation to offer professional contracts to its XVs players.
"Wales head coach Rowland Phillips has only just started his role and the next year will be a baptism of fire after his side were drawn in the toughest pool with New Zealand and 2014 runners-up Canada.
"Ireland's biggest pool opponents are reigning Six Nations champions France."
