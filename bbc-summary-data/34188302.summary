Outdated York care home closures leave elderly facing move

Elderly people face having to move out of care homes deemed out-of-date.

Seven homes in York - some less than 50 years old - face closure, but two have been scheduled for emptying next year.
Grove House on Penleys Grove Street and Oakhaven on Acomb Road are home to 48 residents served by 61 staff.
City of York Council promised residents would be offered a range of alternatives including residential or nursing homes, or a place in sheltered housing with extra care provision.
A final decision on the closures is expected in October.
The authority said: "We recognise that the closure consultation process can be an unsettling and upsetting one and we will be working closely with them, and their families, to make sure they have the support and advice they need.
"However, we have to keep the aims of the wider older people's accommodation programme in sight."
The council said staff would be offered redeployment, voluntary redundancy or support in finding employment in the private sector.
The public sector union, Unison, said the decision was not "unexpected" and it was in talks with the council.
Plans to dispose of the care homes have been discussed since 2012.
The previous Labour administration had opted to close all its homes and build two specialised units with support for people with dementia and those requiring high dependency care.
The scheme was dropped in February when officers decided it was no longer affordable.
The current Conservative-Liberal Democrat run authority still plans a phased-closure of all its homes, replacing them with additional sheltered housing places with extra care for people with more complex needs, a new residential home and purchasing additional beds from the private sector.
