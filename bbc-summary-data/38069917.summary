[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A carer has been jailed for more than two years for the "shocking" physical and verbal abuse of an elderly woman he was looking after.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maurice Campbell, 56, of Illston Place, Peterborough, admitted ill-treating and wilfully neglecting the victim.
He and his wife Deborah were caught on CCTV abusing the woman. Campbell was seen twisting her fingers and ramming an object in her mouth to try to get her to take tablets.
His wife will be sentenced in January.
Det Con Les Ellmer, from Cambridgeshire Police, said the case involved "some of the most shocking abuse of an elderly and vulnerable victim" he had come across.
Peterborough Crown Court heard the 85-year-old victim had dementia and was bed bound.
She needed regular visits from carers and was being looked after by the Campbells.
Her family were initially happy with the care but later became suspicious when they saw food splashed near her bed.
Det Con Ellmer said: "Due to her dementia, the victim struggles to communicate and could not provide a witness statement so without the CCTV in her bedroom, no one would have been any the wiser to the abuse she was receiving."
Campbell, who was also found to have slapped the victim across the head, was jailed for 28 months.
His wife will be sentenced on 10 January.
