Will 'pee-proof paint' prevent anti-social behaviour?

Will pee-proof paint prevent people from peeing on walls?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
San Francisco's public works agency says it is testing a new urine-repellent paint in areas popular with people looking to relieve themselves.
Anyone choosing to use the treated walls as a toilet will see their urine "bounce back", according to a spokeswoman for the agency.
We have been finding out what you think of the idea and asking for your alternative solutions.
@Chrisbolton tweets: There is only one sane answer to this. More public toilets.
@NothappyMatt poses the question: What happens when they don't use the walls? It was a kind of courtesy.
While @MikayalaAmbrose raises an interesting point: You realise this paint won't work with women right?
@Mr_MuddyPuddle came up with another solution "A real life RoboCop".
@Jawhara333 had more ideas: big fines, strict rules, public teaching boards & more public toilets.
Jan van de Hoeven agreed with the idea via email: 'This is a good thing for sure, but at the same time a lot more public toilets should be placed throughout cities around the world.  I'm an older man and my bladder doesn't have the holding power it used to have.'
@Jay_Worrell tweeted: I'd create "Parenting Skills" - I know it's pretty out there.
The idea could also be popular elsewhere in the world with @FreshtaKarim tweeting: We should also start similar campaign in Kabul where many men urinate on streets.  While @Tamana_nainani adds: Haha - this should be introduced in India!
And @ShadesofIndia tweets: If this happens in Pakistan lots of men will be seen walking around in wall-repelled-pee-filled clothes.
And finally, @rosemleeds wants to address a different form of anti social behaviour: Concrete pavements that chewing gum won't stick to.
Thank you for all of your suggestions. We've had great fun reading them. You can see more via the replies to our tweet.
