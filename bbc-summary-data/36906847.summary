Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav has lodged a police complaint after claiming he tested positive for banned substances due to a "conspiracy".

The Indian government says a final report into the freestyle wrestler's case will be presented on Friday.
The 26-year-old, who failed tests on both his A and B samples, claims his food was spiked with steroids by two fellow wrestlers.
He has been provisionally suspended from competing at the Rio Olympics.
Yadav was under provisional suspension for failing a doping test on 25 June and failed a second test on 5 July. He was due to appear in front of India's National Anti-Doping Agency on Wednesday.
The wrestler's food supplements have reportedly been found to be clean in tests conducted since his allegations.
The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has backed Yadav, with assistant secretary Vinod Tomar saying the body believed him to be "a victim of conspiracy".
It had already identified the person behind it, Tomar claimed.
Yadav was picked over two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar after he won India's quota place with a bronze medal in last year's World Championships.
Following the positive tests, Parveen Rana was named as his replacement, a move that has been approved by United World Wrestling.
On Tuesday, Rio-bound Indian shot put champion Inderjeet Singh also claimed he had failed a drugs test because of a "conspiracy" against him.
