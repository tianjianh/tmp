Midfielder Mitch Rose, the brother of Tottenham and England defender Danny, has also been let go by the Exiles.
Defenders Jazzi Barnum-Bobb and Ben Tozer have both triggered one year contract extensions, however.
Tozer has not played since January 7 after falling out with previous boss Graham Westley, but seems set to stay.
Newport have already released Liam Angel, Marcus Beauchamp, Paul Bignot, Jack Compton, Tom Meechan, Kieran Parselle, Finlay Wood following the end of the season after confirming Mike Flynn as their permanent manager.
Darren Jones, who has had three spells with the club, also announced his retirement after a campaign when the Exiles survived relegation on the final day despite being 11 points adrift with 12 games remaining.
Elsewhere, midfielder Tom Owen-Evans remains at the club after signing a new two-year contract.
