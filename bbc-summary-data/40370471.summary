[SN]TITLE[SN]
David Miller murder: Jury told 'vulnerable man' was partially dismembered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has heard how a "vulnerable" man died after a "sustained attack" with knives and scissors in his own home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The partially-dismembered body of David Miller, 56, was found at his flat in Patterdale Walk in Boothville, Northampton, on 14 June 2016.
He had been stabbed multiple times and "crude attempts" were made to destroy his body, a court heard.
Ian Cuthbertson, 49, Michael Hallett, 37, Joseph Catlin, 30, and Zena Kane, 35, of no fixed address, deny murder.
At the start of their trial, Northampton Crown Court heard police officers had forced entry into the flat and found Mr Miller's remains in the bedroom.
Several items were found at the property including knives, scissors and a rolling pin which had been used as weapons during the attack on 10 June, and an angle grinder which had been borrowed to try and destroy the body.
A post-mortem examination found he had substantial facial injuries and had been stabbed fifteen times in the back and in the chest.
Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said that Mr Catlin had been living with Mr Miller in the two months before his death and that the pair had known each other for years.
The court heard that Mr Miller was "well known and well liked" in the area but had long-standing issues with drink.
Mr Joyce said the four defendants were part of the "Northampton street drinking fraternity".
"They lived chaotic lives with long periods of homelessness and regularly used Mr Miller's flat as a place to drink, " he said.
"These four defendants all took part in the murder of a vulnerable man in his own home and then spent days trying to cover up what they had done," he added.
The trial, expected to last for four weeks, continues.
