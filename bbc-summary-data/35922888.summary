The blaze broke out at a semi-detached house in Navan Court in Armagh just before 20:20 BST on Tuesday.
About 20 firefighters went to the house and found the woman had jumped from an upstairs window.
The fire was extinguished by the crew and the woman taken to hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation.
Alan O'Neill, group commander with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, said it is believed the fire started accidentally.
"When firefighters arrived they found a well-developed fire at the house," he said.
"The woman had been alerted to the fire by her smoke alarm."
