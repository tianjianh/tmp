He met 45 ex-servicemen at Southwick House, near Portsmouth, ahead of their annual pilgrimage to Normandy.
Veteran Denys Hunter said it was a chance to "remember the ones we left behind".
The prince also saw the room in which the 1944 invasion was plotted and the invasion map which covers an entire wall.
Harry spent time chatting with many of the veterans including John Dennett, from Wallasey, Wirral, and Frank Diffell, from Melksham, Wiltshire, who are both 91.
He said to them: "I have so much respect for you guys - running off a boat on to those beaches."
The prince then wished them well on their trip to France for the commemorations and added: "Don't get into trouble and if you do, don't get caught."
During his visit Harry visited the Map Room where the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D Eisenhower, with naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Ramsay and Army Commander-in-Chief General Montgomery plotted the campaign.
The pins, tapes and markers on the map have since been reset to mark the moment when the landings began on the British and Canadian beaches on D-Day.
The veterans are due to travel to France with the D-Day Revisited charity which has been organising an annual pilgrimage to Normandy since 2008.
