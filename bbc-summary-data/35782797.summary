[SN]TITLE[SN]
Immigration from a different angle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Baucher has always approached his subject matter in new ways, and his latest series is no exception.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baucher was asked to explore the theme of immigration as part of the Imagine Festival in Belfast, and so set about coming up with an idea that would open the viewer's mind to a new way of seeing.
He set upon a plan to take pictures from the viewpoint of the sitter, each person looking down on a possession that reflects their journey to Northern Ireland.
He began with a few friends and then used social media to spread the word.
"Over two-thirds of the images came about because of this approach," says Baucher.
"Whilst I contacted some of the statutory bodies dealing with migrants there was an understandable reticence to be involved. With this in mind, I continued to find people who wouldn't necessarily fall into the broad term immigrant."
His pictures are simply captioned.
"The identities of the sitters is not revealed, just the countries their families lived in before their arrival here in Northern Ireland," adds Baucher.
"These images are just a very small sample of the complex demographic of Northern Ireland yet hold truths for us all."
The pictures are part of Belfast's Imagine: Festival of Ideas and Politics and are on show at the Framewerk Gallery in Belfast until 19 March.
