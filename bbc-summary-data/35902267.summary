Chris Basham gave the Blades the lead when he headed Matt Done's cross past Walsall goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.
United quickly doubled their advantage through a superb Billy Sharp volley after good work from Basham.
Tom Bradshaw came closest for the Saddlers, but George Long was quickly off his line to smother as the Blades ended Walsall's three-game winning run.
Walsall are now nine points behind League One leaders Wigan, but have two games in hand, while Sheffield United are eight points off the play-offs with six games remaining.
Interim Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC WM 95.6:

"I'm a bit frustrated, but win or lose we don't over analyse straight after the game because emotions are quite raw so we always try and think a bit more logically.
"I can't fault our effort or our application. Of course there are decisions that we think we could have made better. Individually, we'll look at each goal as well.
"What we have to do now is make ourselves hard to beat next week and see if we can get the three points at Oldham."
