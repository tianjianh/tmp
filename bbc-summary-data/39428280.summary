'Deliberately poisoned' pine trees die in Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two of three pine trees that were deliberately drilled and had poison poured into them have died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trunks of two pines on West Cliff Green, Bournemouth, were each drilled up to 15 times last June.
A third pine was damaged the following month and a "crystal-like" substance was discovered on its bark.
Tests revealed the substance was the herbicide glyphosate, the borough council said. Residents have said they are "appalled" by the loss.
Nick Colledge, from Bournemouth Borough Council, said the samples from all three trees "tested positive for very high levels of the herbicide glyphosate".
In a bid to prevent further damage and save the pines, the holes were plugged with wooden dowels to stop any other substances from being poured inside, and CCTV was installed in the area last October.
But two of the trees have now died and the third is in a poor condition, the council said.
Chris Colledge, of West Cliff Green Residents' Association, said: "Residents and a number of hoteliers along West Cliff are absolutely appalled that someone should take the law into their own hands, with a motive of whatever purpose, and target these beautiful trees."
The council now plans to plant six new trees around the existing damaged trees.
Dorset Police is investigating the damage, but no arrests have been made.
