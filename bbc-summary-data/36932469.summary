And Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was only 0.099secs off the pace as tiny margins separated the top teams in the last race before F1's summer break.
Hamilton will have a nervous time before qualifying after being summoned to the stewards for an unsafe release.
He could potentially face a penalty that would affect his grid position.
Although the team decides when to release a car from the pits, a driver can be given a reprimand for the incident - and if Hamilton receives one it would be his third of the season and an automatic 10-place grid penalty.
The rules governing such incidents also give the stewards the option to impose a grid drop of "such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate".
The incident in question saw Hamilton released from the Mercedes garage as Haas' Romain Grosjean was coming into the pits, forcing the Frenchman to stop in the 'fast lane'. Grosjean complained over the radio over the incident.
Grosjean, meanwhile, will face a five-place grid drop from wherever he qualifies because Haas have to change his gearbox.
Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat was given a reprimand for a similar incident at last year's Belgian Grand Prix.
Mercedes had looked totally dominant on Friday but Red Bull and Ferrari appeared much closer on Saturday morning.
With Ricciardo within 0.1secs of the silver cars, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was only 0.164secs off the pace in fourth.
The Finn's team-mate Sebastian Vettel was fifth fastest, ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who was 0.345secs slower than Ricciardo.
Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa were seventh and eighth, ahead of McLaren's Fernando Alonso.
The Spaniard's team-mate Jenson Button was struggling with poor rear grip and understeer and was only 19th fastest, 1.177secs behind Alonso.
