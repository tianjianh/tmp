Fulton wants to give Peter Caruth and John Jeremyn as much time as possible to prove their fitness and a final squad of 18 will be named this weekend.
Ireland will take on Austria, Italy and Ukraine in Pool A.
"It will not be an easy tournament and we will not underestimate the task at hand," said Irish player Eugene Magee.
Ireland need a top-three finish in the eight-team tournament to book a spot in World League 3.
Pool B see France, Poland, Scotland and Wales in action at the east Belfast venue.

Banbridge midfielder Magee will be one of the most experienced members of the squad with 240 caps, but is confident in the combination of youth and experience of the team.
"We have great depth in our squad and the young players coming up through have proven that they are more than capable of playing at senior international level," he added.
"Austria will be the toughest challenge in our group and all teams in Pool B will prove to be a challenge.
"We have had some good preparation games in the lead up to this tournament including games against France, who are top ranked in Pool B.
"It should be a very exciting tournament in Belfast and I'm really looking forward to getting our World Cup qualifying campaign underway in front of a home crowd."
The Hockey World League Round 2 will be played over three men's and three women's events.
Ireland extended squad: David Harte (GK), Jamie Carr (GK), Jonathan Bell, John McKee, Ronan Gormley, Chris Cargo, Matthew Nelson, John Jermyn, Eugene Magee, Peter Caruth, Neal Glassey, Shane O'Donoghue, Sean Murray, Matthew Bell, Callum Robson, Julian Dale, Jamie Wright, Paul Gleghorne, Conor Harte, Jeremy Duncan, Lee Cole, Luke Madeley, Drew Carlisle, Mark Ingram.
