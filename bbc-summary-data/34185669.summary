Mark Avis and Aaron Saddleton produced the rare feat while playing on the Royal Norwich Golf Club course.
Bookmaker Paddy Power gave the odds of two amateur golfers scoring aces at the same hole as 25 million-to-one.
Morgan Thompson, assistant professional at the club, said the achievement, reported first in the Eastern Daily Press, was "remarkable".
Mr Saddleton, 29, from Norwich, was the first to tee off at the 135-yard hole and was delighted to sink an ace.
But he had little time to celebrate as Mr Avis, 43, of Attleborough, quickly stepped up and repeated the feat.
Mr Thompson said: "I was working in the shop at the time and suddenly saw everybody celebrating.
"I don't think they could quite believe it and it was all they were talking about afterwards."
Mr Thompson said the course averaged one hole-in-one every six months.
The players were on opposing sides in a 2v2 game during a Norfolk Handicapped League match between Sprowston Manor Golf Club and Royal Norwich Golf Club.
