Stourbridge's FA Cup hero Jack Duggan did not allow himself long for life to get back to normal following his late match-winner against Northampton Town.

The defender fired in at the far post on Tuesday to take his team into the third round for the first time.
But not even 12 hours later he was getting up for a university lecture.
"I've got a lecture at 9am. And I've got to go," he told BBC WM. "I've got a dissertation to do. I want to be a primary school teacher."
Duggan, who is doing a teaching degree at Newman University in Birmingham, also works behind the bar at a golf club when he is not writing his name into FA Cup folklore.
And, as one might expect of any celebrating footballer who plays for a club named the Glassboys, he did suggest he would first be having a glass of beer or two.
"Not too many people in life have played in the third round of the FA Cup, or even scored in the FA Cup," he said. "You've got to enjoy it."
Having reached the second round for the fourth time in six seasons, manager Gary Hackett had already acclaimed his seventh-tier Northern Premier League side as the FA Cup's new non-league kings.
And, after claiming a second Football League cup scalp in five years following a win over Plymouth in 2011, Duggan believes they are capable of doing it again at League Two Wycombe in round three on 7 January.
"We don't fear anyone," said Duggan. "Northampton might have had an off day but that was down to us. Every first or second ball we won.
"There's not much difference between league and non-league football, as hard work always outweighs talent. We just wanted it more.
"I'm only in my first season here, but this is why I came. To be part of nights like this."
Jack Duggan was talking to BBC WM's Steve Hermon.
