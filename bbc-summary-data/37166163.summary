The snake was anaesthetised for the seven-hour operation, Dr Taweesak Anansiriwattana told BBC Thai's Issariya Praithongyaem.
Doctors at Klongluang Animal Hospital had to cut through the skin and abdominal cavity wall in order to reach the tumour, which weighed 1kg (2lb).
Tissue samples have been sent for tests to determine if the snake has cancer.
The snake weighed about 52kg (114 lbs).
Most of the tumour was removed but a small part remains as it was too close to arteries, vets say.
The snake was brought to the hospital by a private owner.
