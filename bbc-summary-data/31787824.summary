A sex offenders' register is to be introduced in Guernsey, the Home Department has announced.

It comes as a group concerned about the potential threat of paedophiles contacted all Guernsey politicians.
The "Lets stop the pedophila in Guernsey" Facebook group claims it was created to "protect society from sexual perverts".
Home Minister Peter Gillson said he would meet group members to "allay their fears".
But, he added: "I think people need to be cautious what they post on social media that they don't fall foul of criminal or civil laws."
Deputy Gillson said he was "confident" the island had a "very robust and balanced set of procedures to ensure the safety of the public".
Anna Guilbert, chief probation officer, said the updated sex offenders' law was expected to be introduced in July, but currently each convicted sex offender was "monitored and supervised".
She said the new element was a "requirement to notify, or what people colloquially call a sex offenders' register".
The creation of a register was agreed by the States in 2011, but no date for its roll out had previously been set.
Michael Brender set up the group and said, as a father he was concerned a convicted paedophile could be living next door and he would not know about it.
On the closed Facebook group, which has more than 1,400 members, its cover photo says "if we find you to be hosting, promoting or supporting child pornography you will become a target".
Mr Brender said the page was strictly governed with only convicted criminals named: "It's not a witch hunt, it's not so we can track them down and beat them up, it's just for the children's safety."
He wants paedophiles to be tagged on release to ensure they stay away from schools and other areas.
