[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kent v Gloucestershire: James Harris hits valuable debut runs on even first day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent's lower order struck valuable runs to frustrate Gloucestershire's bowlers on an even opening day at Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Tredwell (26) and James Harris (33 not out) helped Kent recover from 154-5 to reach 298 all out.
Earlier, batsmen Joe Denly (62) and Darren Stevens (50) hit half-centuries, but both were guilty of poor shots to give away their wickets.
Liam Norwell (3-46) was the pick of Gloucestershire's bowlers, who reached 9-1 at the close.
Harris, making his debut following a loan move from Middlesex, was particularly impressive with the bat, striking five fours in his 54-ball knock.
His 10th-wicket partnership of 36 with Mitch Claydon delayed Gloucestershire's reply with the bat but in the five overs they faced before stumps, Stevens struck for the home side when he bowled Cameron Bancroft with his fifth delivery.
