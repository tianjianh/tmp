[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner who ran a brothel from a Glasgow flat for nearly a decade has been ordered to pay almost £43,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isabella Qazi, 72, from Bishopbriggs, was in charge of the sex den, which fronted as a massage parlour, between 2003 and 2012.
Qazi, who hired mature women, denied managing the brothel on Birkenshaw Street, Dennistoun. She said she knew nothing about extra services on offer.
A jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court unanimously found her guilty.
Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell deferred sentencing on condition of good behaviour but ordered Qazi to pay £42,973.
Workers at the brothel gave evidence at the trial, including Agnes "Marie" Stephenson, 57 and Winifred "Alexis" Archibald, 63, who is hard of hearing.
They told the jury that Qazi was never involved in conversations about the extra services.
The court also heard from a number of her regular customers who explained that once they had been buzzed inside the flat, they would be met by a receptionist who would take a £10 entry fee, which paid for a massage.
They would then be led to a bedroom where they would be offered additional services by another female and a price would be agreed on.
The court heard that condoms were provided at no extra cost and customers paid between £50 and £60 for sex.
Intelligence led the police to raid the brothel on Birkenshaw Street where sex toys were found. A man who was leaving the property at the time of the raid gave a police statement to confirm he had just paid for sex.
Officers found spreadsheets from 2010 and 2011 at Qazi's home in Bishopbriggs, which she shares with a man. Client numbers and expenses were detailed on the paperwork, including information about supplies for the Birkenshaw flat.
Defence counsel Paul Nelson suggested that the £20 per month spent on supplies, according to the spreadsheets, might cover the cost of baby oil and other things a masseuse might use but condoms would cost a lot more.
However, Harry Findlay, prosecuting, highlighted that some months detailed expense payments of more than £100.
Keys for the Birkenshaw Street property were also found in Qazi's home, as well as more than £1,500 in cash, which her defence claimed was her funeral money.
The court heard that between 2000 and 2013, during the time that she ran the brothel, Qazi was also employed as a secretary of Continuum Scotland Ltd.
She resigned from the firm days after the police raid.
