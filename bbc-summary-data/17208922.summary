Belgium profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belgian broadcasting mirrors the unique political and linguistic nature of the country. The cultural communities, rather than the federal authorities, are responsible for regulating radio and TV.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
So, unlike most other European countries, Belgium does not have a single public broadcasting organisation, but two separate bodies, with their own regulations, running their own radio, TV and external broadcasting.
Some 95% of Belgians are hooked-up to cable TV; one of the highest take-up rates in the world. Cable offers dozens of domestic and foreign channels, including Dutch and French stations.
The Belgian press is self-regulated by the Federation of Editors - to which all editors of major newspapers belong. A small number of media groups owns the main newspaper titles.
There were nearly 8.5 million internet users by December 2011 (InternetWorldStats.com). Belgium is home to the Netlog social media platform.
