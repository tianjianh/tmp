A third teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a celebrity bodyguard who was trying to stop thieves stealing his moped in east London.

Ricky Hayden, 27, was fatally stabbed in the thigh outside his Chadwell Heath home on 13 September.
His father, Paul, 46, who was also stabbed in the attack, has since been discharged from hospital.
The 19-year-old man arrested is currently in police custody.
Mr Hayden died a day after he was attacked in Gibbfield Close at about 01:25 BST when he and his father confronted a group of up to four men who were attempting to take his moped.
Detectives believe the killers arrived and left on another grey or silver moped which had a dark coloured box on the rear.
The Met has urged residents in the area to check outbuildings or garages for the moped which is "crucial to the investigation".
Police had previously arrested two teenagers on suspicion of Mr Hayden's murder.
One 19-year-old is due to answer bail later this month while a 16-year-old has been released with no further action.
