The Finn's Law campaign is named after the Hertfordshire police dog who, along with his handler, was stabbed in Stevenage while chasing a suspect.
It wants people who attack police animals to face charges similar to those for attacking a person.
A teenager has been charged with criminal damage over the dog attack.

German shepherd Finn was stabbed in the head and chest and his handler, PC Dave Wardell, received a hand injury in Denton Road after they pursued a suspect at about 01:15 BST.
A 16-year-old boy from Lewisham, south-east London, is accused of the assault of the officer and criminal damage relating to the dog.
The petition, set up by David Burstow on the UK government's petition site, proposes that police animals "be given protection that reflects their status if assaulted in the line of duty".
The campaign's Twitter feed said it had been set up by a private individual - and not serving police officers - to "ensure police animals are recognised for the excellent work they do in upholding the law".
Assistant Chief Constable Dan Vajzovic - from the Joint Protected Services for Beds, Cambs and Herts - said officers had been "overwhelmed" by the support for Finn and his handler.
He said "anything to help promote the safety of members of the police family should be looked at positively" but that decisions on legislative change were a government matter.
"Were there to be a proposal for legislative change I would support legislation that offered an effective mechanism for reducing the likelihood of officers and their police dogs being subject to assault and injury," he said.
The seriously injured dog underwent four hours of emergency surgery and is now recovering at home.
The officer was treated in hospital and discharged.
