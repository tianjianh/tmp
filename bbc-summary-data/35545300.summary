Fly-tipped waste on Oxford railway costs £250,000 to clear

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clearing 200 lorry loads of fly-tipped rubbish from Oxford's railways has cost Network Rail about £250,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The railway operator has removed waste including shopping trolleys, asbestos and a trampoline as part of work on the Oxford to London Marylebone line.
In the St Peter's Road area, between Oxford Parkway and Oxford station, it found 4,000 tonnes of waste.
The government agency has now pleaded with the public not to "blight" the environment.
The rubbish also included bicycles, televisions and gas canisters.
Rob Mole, Network Rail programme manager, said those who dumped the rubbish were "mindless".
He said: "Fly-tipping is not only illegal it blights the environment and poses a safety threat to the operation of the railway and our staff who maintain it.
"People should dispose of waste materials in the appropriate manner and not use the railway as a dumping ground."
Fly-tipping on the railway is illegal and can result in a fine of up to £1,000.
