Substitute Javier Favarel struck from 30 yards before wheeling away to celebrate what he thought was the winner.
However, referee Robert Whitton had called time on the game just as the ball had left Favarel's foot.
As a result, the game ended 1-1, with Dan Scarr earning Stourbridge a replay by cancelling out Glen Southam's opener.
Things got worse for Whitehawk after full-time as goalkeeper Ross Flitney was sent off for protesting against the referee's decision.
Whitehawk boss Richard Hill told BBC Radio Sussex: "I've just said to the referee 'why don't you just wait two seconds?' But time is up so he has to blow the whistle."
The club's striker, Danny Mills, felt the goal should have stood.
"I think the way the ball has sat up the referee has to leave it and see what happens," he said.
"It was an unbelievable strike. A split second before and we would be in the second round, but it is what it is and we have to forget about it now."
