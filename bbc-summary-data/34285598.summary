The men kicked in the door of a flat in Skegness and savagely beat the occupants with baseball bats, an axe and a knuckle duster.
One of the victims almost bled to death from a severed artery and was cut across the face, scarring him for life.
At Lincoln Crown Court Judge John Pini QC told the men: "This was an extremely serious and grave matter."
The court was told the two victims, aged 19 and 23, were friends of a local man who was involved in a turf war with rival dealer Thomas Barraclough, who had recently moved to the resort.
Barraclough, joined by four men from his home city of Bradford, broke into the flat in South Parade on 7 March and carried out what police described as a "brutal attack".
Stephen Kemp, prosecuting, said the "extreme violence" used in the attack was an attempt to "destroy the local competition".
Passing sentence, Judge Pini said: "It is drugs that are entirely behind this dreadful episode.
"Extreme violence was brought to Skegness over drug dealing. This court will send out a message that it will not be tolerated."
