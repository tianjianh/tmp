Glasgow light-welterweight Willie Limond says he was ready to give up on his professional career before getting the "buzz back again for boxing".

After being out of the ring for 18 months, the British and Commonwealth champion, 36, is now targeting the WBC silver title.
"I was ready to call it a day," he told BBC Scotland.
"After the [Curtis] Woodhouse fight, I kind of went flat - fights were promised, nothing happened."

Along with trainer Billy Nelson and businessman James White, the boxer formed a promotions company and have since taken a number of up-and-coming athletes under their wing.
"It's good training with all the younger boys again, showing them that old school is still the best school," said Limond.
Limond, bidding for his first world title, will take on former French champion Christopher Sebir at Bellahouston on 19 March for the WBC silver title.
Sebir, 29, has 34 fights under his belt - the victor in 24 of them, losing nine and drawing one.
"He'll have 10 weeks' notice come fight time so he'll be in great shape and I believe it's the best we're going to see him," said Limond.
"And I'll need to be the best to beat him and believe I will be.
"It was good to be back in training on Monday, being put through my paces by [trainer] Peter Harrison.
"In my eyes, I'm in the best hands to get myself in the best possible shape for my age."
Limond also revealed two rising Mexican stars will appear on the bill, brought over by former WBA, WBO and IBF welterweight champion Antonio Margarito.
It has come about due to his friendship with his former opponent, Erik Morales - the first Mexican-born boxer in history to win world titles in four different weight classes.
Paul Valenzuela Jr and Oliver Quintana will feature at Bellahouston, with Limond saying Quintana has "blown them out of the water over there" with seven knockouts in 10 matches.
"These two are touted as being the next best things in Mexico and the Scottish public have got a chance to see them first, before anyone else," the Scot explained.
"They're really screaming about them, especially Quintana; they're saying he's the next [Marco] Barrera - he's absolutely amazing."
"It's something different, we just want to bring different fighters in."
After 17 years as a professional who appears to have found a renewed love for his sport, Limond is not sure when he will will hang up his gloves.
"It may be my last year, maybe no," he debated, "I'll see after January and then after March where I'm at - Peter will tell me if he thinks I should call it a day.
"But my last three fights I've been getting better each fight, I just hope I'm getting better for this next one and the one after that.
"Just feels like there's a plan in place now. Instead of waiting for the phone to go, we're on our own path."
