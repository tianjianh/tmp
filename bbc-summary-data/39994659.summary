The Rio Olympics 10,000m finalist from Glasgow won Saturday's 10K event in Hampstead, which doubled as the British trials, in 32 minutes, four seconds.
It justified her decision to quit her job as a physics teacher to train full-time this year, and relocate to Leeds.
"At the start of the year it was a big move, big change in career," she said.
"I quit my job and left my running base in London, but it has worked out really well.
"I am up in Leeds and living with Jonny Brownlee and training up there. The squad is great and it has obviously paid off doing all that biking and swimming!"
The 25-year-old, who competed for Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, finishing ninth in 5,000m and fifth in the 10,000m, is in the early stages of making the transition from athletics to triathlon.
As well as double Olympic gold medallist Alistair Brownlee and his brother Jonny, the Rio silver medallist, Potter's training group also includes 2013 world champion Non Stanford.
"I am doing a lot less running, I am not doing as many sessions, the volume hasn't been as big but I am doing way more aerobic - five-and-a-half hours on a Wednesday," Potter explained of her change in training.
"Just having that in my heart and lungs, I am saving my legs a bit and I can come in and run pretty quick.
"It felt good, the legs were fresh, I was just ready. This was on my race plan for the last year or so, so it was nice for it to finally come round and get rolling."
Fellow Scot Steph Twell, 27, finished second in Hampstead but missed out on the qualifying mark of 32:15 by just over a second in 32:16.23.  She has until 9 July to reach the standard and book her World Championships spot.
