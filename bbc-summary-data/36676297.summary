Euro 2016: Belgium can dream of final - Vincent Kompany

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belgium play Wales in Lille on Friday for a place in the semi-finals of Euro 2016.

Both teams know each other well from qualifying - Wales drew 0-0 in Brussels and won 1-0 in Cardiff when Radja Nainggolan's misdirected header let Gareth Bale in to score the winner. Will the Red Devils get revenge in France?
Injured Belgium and Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, a BBC pundit in France, explains which areas he thinks will decide the tie, why his side have found their form, the importance of Eden Hazard and how his own comeback is progressing.

Belgium lost to Italy in their opening game at Euro 2016 and only sparkled briefly as they beat Republic of Ireland and Sweden to get out of Group D in second place. They came to life with an impressive 4-0 win over Hungary in the last 16.
Kompany: You have seen in this tournament that Belgium got the job done in our group, but we were not great until the Hungary game, when we produced a big performance.
The key for us against Hungary was for everyone to play down the situation we were in, because we were very relaxed from the start in that game. Ultimately the big teams who have been able to perform in this tournament are the ones who have done the same.
Once you have produced a big performance like that, it gives everyone a lot of confidence.
Our squad is on a cloud right now and the players have every right to be positive about our form going into the quarter-finals - and about our chances of going much further in this tournament.
Like a few people have said, that is as much the case for the Wales squad as it is for Belgium. We have both ended up on the good side of the draw and I think all the teams left in there have got a chance and can dream of the final.
The Wales team will not need to watch a lot of videos before the game, because they know us so well - and we know them so well too.
Our games in qualifiers were very close and the last team to make a mistake was us, so you learn from your mistakes. In that sense I think and I hope it is advantage to us this time.

Chelsea forward Eden Hazard has had a poor season in the Premier League but was the star of the show against Hungary, scoring one dazzling solo goal and making another as his side strolled to a comprehensive victory.
Kompany: Wales and Belgium are very strong on the counter-attack, so whichever team attacks could be the more exposed.
That was the case in the Hungary game - as soon as we scored, they showed their hand a little bit and showed that they were going to be positive. It all of a sudden transformed the game for us, in a good way.
The main player everyone wanted to talk about after that game was Eden Hazard. For us he has been a revelation in this tournament because he has never performed this way for us before.
If he can keep performing the way he did against Hungary, then it puts him into a completely different bracket for me.
If he is fit enough to play and can maintain this level then we are talking about a player who is as good as the top two in the world - Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
The way Eden played against Hungary was like art, it was beautiful - and that is what everyone is expecting from him again against Wales.
Kompany was ruled out of Euro 2016 at the start of May when he had surgery after suffering a groin injury playing for City against Real Madrid and was told he would be out for four months. He suffered five injuries during the 2014-15 season, playing 22 games out of a possible 59 for his club and will miss pre-season under new  manager Pep Guardiola.
Kompany: I have spoken to Pep a few times now and I also met him briefly when he came to Manchester at the end of May. We have had some positive conversations and he has some very big ambitions for the club.
I am really looking forward to next season - my rehab is going well. For the injury I had and at the stage I am at, it is the best it could have been.
There is no date set for me to play again but I am recovering really well. Initially it was pretty long injury - as has been mentioned, I was looking at about four months out. But we will see.
Could I come back earlier? I am conscious I am not allowed to push it too much and also conscious I need to look after my body first and foremost.
I know what I have got to offer - when I have felt good I have felt I could achieve such a high level of football so the only thing I am doing at the moment is looking after my body and making sure I make the right calls every single time - living the right life to play the most amount of games possible in the future.
