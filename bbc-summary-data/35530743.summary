The first incident involving six cars occurred at about 08:30 on the A9 near Allangrange between the Tore roundabout and Kessock Bridge.
Four cars were caught up in the second accident an hour later at North Kessock, just south of the first crash.
Police said no-one was thought to have been seriously injured.
The southbound carriageway was closed for nearly two hours.
Traffic Scotland has suggested that sun glare may have been a contributing factor in the incident at Allangrange. There were similar conditions on Monday morning.
On Monday eight cars were caught up in two crashes that happened within minutes of each other on the same stretch of the A9.
A woman was injured when six cars collided before 09:00 near the road's Munlochy junction, north of Inverness.
Two cars were involved in the second incident near the scene of the first accident. One of the cars caught fire but no-one was hurt.
The accidents shut the southbound carriageway for several hours.
Insp Neil Lumsden, head of trunk roads policing in the north of Scotland, said a low lying sun had been a contributory factor in both Monday and Tuesday's accidents.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "In situations of reduced visibility, which drivers have experienced over the last two days, drivers should reduce their speed and extend the distance between themselves and vehicle in front.
"This will not only give drivers time sufficient time to react to what is happening in front of them, but it will also allow them to extend their braking distance."
