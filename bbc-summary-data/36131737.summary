Sheridan returned to the Latics for a second spell as manager in January when they sat 22nd, five points from safety.
The 51-year-old has won nine games of 20 since taking charge and the 1-0 win over Crewe confirmed their survival.
"Obviously it's a great relief. I'm chuffed to bits with everyone," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"The players and the supporters have all stuck together as a group and a club we've got over the line.
"It's a great achievement from the players from where they were and since I've come in they've just responded to me and we've got there."
Oldham have also confirmed in a statement on their website that they have not received any approaches for Sheridan, after he was linked with a move to the vacant managerial position at Bolton.
