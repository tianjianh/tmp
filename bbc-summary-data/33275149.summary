[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aer Lingus did not have 10-year Belfast International Airport deal, court rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An agreement that brought Aer Lingus to Belfast International Airport (BIA) in 2007 did not oblige the airline to remain there for a 10-year term, the High Court has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aer Lingus switched to Belfast City Airport in 2012 saying the operation at BIA was no longer financially viable.
BIA claimed it had a binding 10-year contract with the Irish airline.
But the judge ruled that a letter that formed the basis of the agreement did not "adopt the language of obligation".
BIA was suing for Â£20m in damages.
Aer Lingus and BIA never signed a formal contract, instead relying on a letter that was sent by the airport in June 2007.
The judge said that if an agreement had been drawn up in proper legal terms it may have achieved what the letter had not.
He said the letter had described a pricing obligation, if Aer Lingus had remained for 10 years, but did not provide for a 10-year flying obligation.
The question of whether Aer Lingus was entitled to terminate the arrangement in the way it did is still to be determined by the judge.
A further hearing in September is expected to focus on the amount of notice given.
The judge was critical of some of the evidence given by Aer Lingus, describing it as "elusive".
He said it had added to the case's time and expense, and that as a result he was "minded" to order the airline to pay half of BIA's costs.
BIA said in a statement that it "welcomes the finding of the High Court that it did have a contract with Aer Lingus on the document the airport contended as forming the contractual relationship".
