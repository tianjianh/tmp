[SN]TITLE[SN]
ICM health poll question on Welsh NHS breached code of conduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The polling company ICM breached the Market Research Society's (MRS) code of conduct in a health poll it conducted for BBC Wales, the MRS has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MRS said the wording of a question about cancer drugs funding led participants to a particular viewpoint.
Responding, ICM said the question was "entirely defensible and structured in exactly the same way as questions used by all polling companies all the time".
The complaint to the MRS was made by the Welsh government.
The MRS also determined that the procedure for agreeing questions was insufficient on this occasion.
The question used in the poll was: "In England, NHS money is ring-fenced for the Cancer Drugs Fund. In Wales, funding for cancer drugs is treated in the same way as funding drugs for all other illnesses. Do you believe money for cancer should be protected?"
ICM director Martin Boon said the outcome of the  investigation "raises questions as to the fitness and purpose of the MRS code of conduct in the context of public and political opinion polling, as the code makes no distinction between genuine concerns about question wording versus those driven by political motivation".
A Welsh government spokesman said: "We are pleased that this complaint has been upheld by the MRS.
"It is disappointing that ICM and BBC Wales dealt with a public policy issue of such sensitivity in the way this investigation finding has revealed."
A BBC Wales spokeswoman said: "We note the findings of the MRS relating to one question in a wider poll conducted by ICM on our behalf."
