Isabella Jackson, from Buckhaven, Fife, also admitted making bomb threats to Harrods, London's Kings Cross Station and Edinburgh Airport.
The pensioner also sent white powder labelled as "death" to police in Fife.
She previously served a two-year jail term for threatening to blow up a plane carrying then-President Barack Obama.
The 73-year-old will now serve a further 45 months behind bars over the threats, which started only months after she was released from prison from her previous sentence.
A sheriff told her that her "twisted mind" had led her to "cause the utmost disruption from the comfort of her sofa".
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court heard that on 24 November 2014, Jackson sent an e-mail from her home in Buckhaven to aides of then-Home Secretary Theresa May.
In it she threatened to kill the now prime minister.
An allegation that she sent images and details of bombs, explosives and violence in a string of other emails was deleted by the prosecution.
Then on 4 January this year Jackson, who was on bail for the Theresa May threat charges, made bomb threats against department store Harrods and Kings Cross Station in London, as well as Edinburgh Airport.
She sent an email from her home to the Police Scotland Professional Standards Department in Aberdeen and to the Professional Standards Department of the Metropolitan Police in London.
Shortly after the bomb threats, Jackson sent a package by post to the Levenmouth CID office in Methil, Fife.
In it she sent a packet of white powder and a card with the word "death" written on it, which sparked a major incident.
Firefighters and ambulances rushed to the scene and a major investigation was launched which led police to Jackson.
Jackson had not guilty pleas to charges that she made bomb threats against US Embassies in Paris and London accepted by the Crown.
