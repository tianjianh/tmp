Indians tweet 'Who is Maria Sharapova?'

Maria Sharapova may have been knocked out of Wimbledon, but in India she has hit the headlines with comments that are, for many Indians, akin to blasphemy.

At a post-match conference the French Open champion was asked whether she knew which stars had been watching her play from the Royal Box at Centre Court.
David Beckham was a "great guy" she said.  But what about the other sportsman at the scene, Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar?
She did not know who he was.
This is how Indians responded. #WhoisMariaSharapova is now trending worldwide.
As Sachin Tendulkar is clearly a god, then there is one perfectly understandable reason why Maria Sharapova would not know who he is - she must be an atheist, many tweeted.
Doctored images of Sharapova, picturing her hunched on the ground in apparent supplication in front of Tendulkar, made their rounds on the internet
One user @prasadvanjale urged God to "forgive her, for she doesn't know, what she is doing"  â€
