[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust criticised for failing to properly investigate hundreds of deaths has appointed a new chairwoman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In March the entire board of directors at Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust resigned after a review of its services.
The trust came under fire after Connor Sparrowhawk drowned at its Slade House facility in Oxford and boss Katrina Percy resigned in October.
Lynne Hunt will now take over as chairwoman of the trust on 3 July.
Previous interim chairman Tim Smart stood down after he was criticised for creating a new job for Ms Percy.
The trust is now being prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive over Connor's death in 2014.
Ms Hunt was previously vice-chair at Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and was described as having "a track record of almost 40 years public service".
She said: "With this new leadership and a board of newly appointed non-executive directors we can influence and develop a culture of change and improvement."
Southern Health provides mental health services to patients across Hampshire, Dorset, and Oxfordshire.
