Unite say York bus workers facing redundancy deserve a 'fair deal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus workers in York facing redundancy following service changes are not being offered a "fair deal" according to their trade union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bus company First York has confirmed it will be withdrawing its ftr buses from service in April.
Unite said the change would mean 29 job losses and that the company should offer workers better redundancy terms.
First York said it was still consulting employees and the union over the removal of the ftr service.
The large bendy buses employ both conductors and drivers and were introduced in York in 2006.
First York is planning to replace the ftr with double-decker buses following a review of passenger growth prospects in the city.
Unite said the decision would save First York more than Â£300,000 a year but it was only offering workers statutory redundancy terms.
Harriet Eisner, regional officer with Unite, said: "These workers are the face of First buses in York and they deserve a fair deal.
"The company should do everything possible to find them alternative work or pay them a redundancy settlement which recognises the contribution they have made to the company."
First York said it was currently in a formal consultation over the removal of the ftr buses in York and had no further comment.
