[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US President Donald Trump is continuing to back a ban on people from seven mainly Muslim countries entering America, despite protests against it.

The new rules, brought in on Friday, also include stopping Syrian refugees travelling to the US until further notice.
Mr Trump said the plans were about keeping America safe from terrorism, and it was not a ban against Muslims.
There have been big protests against the ban over the weekend.
Thousands gathered at airports around the US to protest against the ban on Saturday, including lawyers who offered their services for free to help those affected.
Further demonstrations were held on Sunday, including protests outside Mr Trump's new home, the White House, in the capital Washington DC.
More than 1.5 million people have signed a UK petition calling to stop Mr Trump from making a state visit to the country later this year.
There is also another petition with more than 90,000 signatures saying that the state visit, which is a special occasion hosted by the Queen, should be allowed.

There is a ban on all refugees entering the US for 120 days.
However, Syrian refugees will not be allowed to travel to the country until further notice.
Syria is a country in the Middle East that has been greatly effected by violence and war. It's led to many ordinary people living there, including lots of children, to leave the country to try and find safety.
President Trump has also signed an order to stop all nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - being given permission to travel to America for 90 days.
This includes those who share dual nationality with other countries, including the UK.
But there remains a lot of confusion about how it all works.
The UK government has now said only dual citizens travelling from one of the seven countries will be affected.
The US president made immigration a big issue in his election. The things he has said about migrants and refugees have made him popular with his supporters.
Mr Trump says the decision is part of new plans to protect Americans and keep radical terrorist groups out of the country.
Donald Trump's supporters say he's made the right choice to make Americans safe.
Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that the US needed "extreme vetting, NOW" but later, in a statement, tried to offer more reassuring words, saying: "This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe."
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she "did not agree" with the restrictions.
President Donald Trump also sacked the US attorney general Sally Yates - an important job in law in America - after she questioned what he had done.
