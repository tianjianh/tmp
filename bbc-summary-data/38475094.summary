[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 2-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil won for the first time in nine League Two matches with a 2-1 victory over promotion-chasing Plymouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two goals in three second-half minutes from Nathan Smith and Alex Lacey gave the hosts a 2-0 lead before Jakub Sokolik pulled one back.
After an even first 35 minutes, Plymouth started to look the better side, but were denied by some brave defending as the home side threw bodies in the way of shots on three occasions to keep it level at half-time.
The Glovers then seized the advantage in the 62nd minute as Smith bundled in a Ben Whitfield corner before Lacey doubled the lead two minutes later, finishing after substitute Jordan Slew sliced a Matt Dolan free-kick towards his own goal.
Former Yeovil man Sokolik reduced the arrears 13 minutes from time with a deftly flicked header from a Jake Jervis free-kick.
