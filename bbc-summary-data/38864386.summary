[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 1-0 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fred Onyedinma's second-half header proved enough as Millwall saw off play-off rivals Southend United at the Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers had midfielder Will Atkinson sent off in the 34th minute and the Lions took full advantage to secure all three points.
The home side had the better of the first half with Steve Morison and Aiden O'Brien both going close to scoring before the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Atkinson was sent off by referee Andre Marriner for a late challenge on Millwall skipper Tony Craig.
Southend initially held firm and momentarily threatened when Michael Timlin sliced Anthony Wordsworth's right-wing cross wide of the left post.
But Millwall made the breakthrough in the 62nd minute when Shaun Cummings' right-wing cross was missed by Southend defender Jason Demetriou at the far post, enabling Onyedinma to head the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the net.
The Shrimpers were unable to get back into the game but had strong shouts for a penalty waved away in the closing stages when Jermaine McGlashan appeared to be hauled down in the box by Craig.
