[SN]TITLE[SN]
Govia Thameslink win Gatwick Express Aslef injunction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rail company has secured an injunction against rail union Aslef over its members' refusal to drive new Gatwick Express trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) accused Aslef members of refusing to drive a new, longer train.
GTR said it went to the High Court with "great reluctance".
Earlier this month a new train was driven empty, with Aslef members not prepared to work "driver-only" services.
A spokesman for GTR said it was pleased Aslef "must not induce" its drivers to refuse to operate the new 12-car trains.
He said: "Gatwick Express services have operated without conductors operating the doors for 17 years, so we were never able to understand why the Aslef union objected to the operation of these new trains in the same way.
"The new trains will offer significant benefits to passengers, including a much better travelling environment."
The union said it had never reached an agreement for the new trains on the Gatwick Airport to London Victoria service and planned to ballot its members.
