[SN]TITLE[SN]
Heriot Watt student had 50,000 indecent images of children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A university student who had about 50,000 indecent images of children on his computer has been put on the sex offenders register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were found following a search of a property in Fountainhall, Selkirkshire, last May, by Police Scotland's cyber crime unit.
The images were discovered on a hard drive removed from the house.
At Jedburgh Sheriff Court, Heriot-Watt student Christopher Murdanaigum, 25, admitted the offence.
Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that the majority of the images were at the lowest end of the scale, with 36 at level two.
During a police interview Murdanaigum, who stays at the Lord Thomson halls of residence, insisted he was not intent on looking for images of children.
The finance and management student was placed on the register for five year.
He will be sentenced in March.
