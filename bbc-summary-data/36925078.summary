Baraclough is reunited with manager Stephen Robinson, with the newly appointed Latics boss having worked as Baraclough's number two at Motherwell.
"We know how each other work and it has been a good combination, so hopefully we can bring that into this job," Baraclough told the club's website.
The 45-year-old also previously managed Scunthorpe and Sligo Rovers.
Meanwhile, Oldham have signed striker Darius Osei from non-league Stalybridge Celtic on a one-year contract.
