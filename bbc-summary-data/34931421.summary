Syria air strikes: What you need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On Wednesday MPs are to debate - and later vote on - UK air strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government motion to be voted on specifically authorises air strikes "exclusively" against IS in Syria - but not British troops on the ground.
Here are the key questions answered:
The Commons debate begins at 11:30 GMT Wednesday, with a vote expected at about 22:00.
David Cameron had made it clear he would not hold a vote unless he was confident he would win.
The majority of Conservatives are expected to vote in favour. The DUP and the Liberal Democrats have indicated they could vote in favour.
Labour is split. Leader Jeremy Corbyn is opposed but has granted his MPs a free vote. The Greens, Plaid Cymru and UKIP are expected to vote against, and the SNP says it will oppose air strikes.
About 640 MPs are expected to vote - a majority is half of those who have voted, plus one.
At least 50 Labour MPs are expected to vote with the government, which is likely to give it a comfortable majority backing air strikes.
Syria bombing: Where UK parties stand
How to make sense of Syria vote jargon
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg quotes defence sources as saying the RAF could move "extremely fast" following approval.
Will we be bombing Syria by the end of the week?
David Cameron says IS poses a terror threat to British people, and so the UK must strike IS in its "heartland" - Syria.
He argues the UK has a moral obligation to get involved, and should not be "content with outsourcing our security to allies".
Britain's laser-guided Brimstone missiles - which no other country has - would greatly help the coalition with precision targeting IS fighters, he says.
Bombing IS in Syria 'will make UK 'safer'
MPs who oppose the plan, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, argue any British bombing in Syria will inevitably lead to civilians being killed, no matter how targeted the campaign.
He says the government should instead focus on finding a political solution, and cutting off streams of funding to IS.
The SNP says it is concerned that there is no effective ground support in place to take and hold territory, and no fully-costed reconstruction plan.
Other MPs who are opposed warn against repeating mistakes of the past, such as in Iraq and Libya, and question how bombing in Syria will prevent attacks from home-grown terrorists inspired by IS.
The case for and against UK air strikes in Syria
Viewpoints: Should the UK bomb IS in Syria?
What social media is saying about the vote
It is true that the UK has precision weapons that its allies do not. The government argues these will help the coalition reduce civilian casualties, and sustain the campaign.
However, a number of people, including the prime minister, have conceded that air strikes alone are not enough to defeat IS.
Defence think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), has said IS will only be dislodged by "credible Arab ground forces prepared to fight block by block" through urban centres.
The RAF's contribution will "not make much difference" to the coalition's strike capability, but the availability of British Tornado jets would provide "a greater range of options", it concluded.
Can British forces make a difference in Syria?
Mr Cameron has set out a seven-point plan for the UK's proposed involvement in Syria, which involves military, diplomatic and humanitarian action.
He insists the RAF's specialist bombing capabilities are needed by allies to "degrade and defeat" IS, and there is strong legal justification on grounds of self-defence and the recent UN Security Council resolution.
He has ruled out British "boots on the ground" - but says there are at least 70,000 moderate Syrian opposition fighters capable of retaking territory from IS, although this figure is disputed.
The UK will help deliver a government to "represent all of the Syrian people" and plan for post-conflict reconstruction, he says.
Are there 70,000 Syrian 'moderates' ready to back UK?
There is no definitive timescale. Some claim IS could be defeated within months - or even weeks - with the right strategy.
But others, including Jeremy Corbyn, say previous conflicts in Iraq and Syria raise doubts that Britain could ever help secure any "lasting defeat" of IS - or avoid what Barack Obama termed "unintended consequences", such as giving rise to new terror groups.
The end goal, Mr Cameron says, is the "eradication" of IS, and new government that represents all Syrian people.
He said it was a mission which would require "patience and persistence".
More than three million people have already left Syria as a result of the fighting, in one of the biggest forced migrations since World War Two. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, and 11 million made homeless.
Those still living in areas of conflict face being caught up in clashes between the Syrian government, opposition factions and jihadists groups.
There have also been claims that Russian air strikes in Syria have killed dozens of civilians. US officials say at least six civilians have been killed in their strikes against IS in Iraq.
Mr Cameron has said that Britain's Brimstone missiles are so precise that they will be able to avoid civilian casualties.
However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights warns that IS fighters are living "almost totally" among civilians, meaning that avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence.
What's life like under Islamic State?
IS group leaders have called on followers to carry out terror attacks against Western countries - particularly those involved in coalition air strikes.
Those opposed to air strikes have warned about potential repercussions, including former UK ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, who said: "Actions have consequences and the inevitable blowback on our streets will be severe."
However, Mr Cameron argues that the UK is already at severe threat level - and doing nothing could make the UK more of a target. Taking action will "reduce and degrade that threat over time", he says.
The UK has deployed air power to Iraq in the form of eight RAF Tornado aircraft, which operate out of a British base in Cyprus.
The jets have carried out about 30% of coalition surveillance missions, and under 5% of coalition air strikes in Iraq - launching guided bombs or Brimstone missiles aimed at IS targets.
Reaper drones, which are remotely piloted by RAF crews in the UK, have also carried out surveillance and launched missiles at IS targets in Iraq.
British pilots have also been embedded with coalition air forces, and two British jihadists in Syria were killed by an RAF drone strike in September.
David Cameron said the "act of self defence" was lawful, despite MPs previously ruling out UK military action in Syria.
In 2013, MPs voted against possible UK military action against President Assad's forces in Syria, after evidence chemical weapons were used against civilians.
Just over a year later, MPs overwhelmingly approved UK air strikes in Iraq - this time specifically against IS militants.
The influential Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warned against extending bombing to Syria without a "coherent international strategy".
Mr Cameron says it makes no sense to stop at a border IS does not recognise. He has come up with a strategy for Syria to try to build support among MPs ahead of a fresh vote.
Syria has been embroiled in a bloody armed conflict for nearly five years. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, and 11 million made homeless.
What started as pro-democracy Arab Spring protests in 2011 spiralled into a civil war between President Bashar al-Assad's government forces and opposition supporters.
In the chaos, jihadist group IS moved in over the border from Iraq and claimed territory.
The US, Russia, France and other world powers have entered the fray, adding to an already complex web.
Syria: The story of the conflict
To date, US aircraft have conducted nearly all of the air strikes undertaken in Syria and Iraq by some members of the international coalition of 63 states. France, Australia and Denmark have also taken part.
Russia is not part of the US-led coalition. It claims to be targeting IS strongholds - however, the US fears Russia is actually targeting opponents of President Assad, who is a Russian ally.
Islamic State: Where key countries stand
Battle for Iraq and Syria in maps
IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
What does it want?
IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death.
How strong is IS?
IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by the US-led multi-national coalition, which has vowed to destroy it.
