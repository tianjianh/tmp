Didier Deschamps' side went ahead after 20 minutes through Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Blaise Matuidi before Vincent Aboubakar levelled.
Paul Pogba's cross allowed Arsenal's Olivier Giroud to restore France's lead only for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to net an 87th-minute equaliser, before Payet's direct free-kick settled it at the end.
The 29-year-old beat keeper Fabrice Ondoa with a magnificent curling effort.
France, who play Scotland on 4 June in their final warm-up match, open their Euro 2016 campaign against Romania on 10 June in Paris.
Elsewhere, Sweden were held to a goalless draw by Slovenia in Malmo.
