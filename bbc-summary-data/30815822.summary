Two Scots building companies were also identified by the UK government on a list of 37 employers which withheld the correct rate from staff.
They owe workers a total of £177,000 and have been ordered to pay more than £51,000 in penalties.
Business Minister Jo Swinson branded their behaviour "illegal and immoral".
The national minimum wage is set at £6.50 per hour for adults.
The Scottish businesses among the 37 employers were:
Ms Swinson said: "Paying less than the minimum wage is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable.
"If employers break this law they need to know that we will take tough action by naming, shaming and fining them as well as helping workers recover the hundreds of thousands of pounds in pay owed to them.
"As well as being publicly named and shamed, employers that fail to pay their workers the National Minimum Wage face penalties of up to £20,000."
