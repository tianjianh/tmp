Dozens of rare seahorses have been born in captivity in Tyneside.

The baby spotted seahorses, which measure less than a centimetre in length, have started life at Tynemouth's Blue Reef Aquarium.
Usually found throughout south east Asia, Australia, Japan and Hawaii, the new arrivals are part of an ongoing captive breeding programme.
A spokesman for the aquarium said their birth was "very important" in easing the pressures on wild populations.
The seahorses, which are listed as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, will eventually grow up to 20cm (8ins) in height.
In the wild, the majority of species of seahorse are now under threat.
Displays supervisor Terry McKeone said: "The babies are doing extremely well and it's more than likely there will be more born over the coming days.
"Although tiny, the newborns are exact miniature replicas of their parents and are already learning and mimicking the adults' behaviour."
