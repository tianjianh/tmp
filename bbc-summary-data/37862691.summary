Hooker Wood, 27, made 74 appearances in his second spell with the Super League side, scoring 11 tries.
Prop Johnson, 22, made 17 appearances in 2016.
Giants managing director Richard Thewlis told the club website: "We were talking to Josh since the beginning of the season but in reality I don't think we ever got close to the valuation which he was seeking."
