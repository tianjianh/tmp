Andrew Jones made the announcement at a Westminster Hall debate on the Severn crossing tolls held by Newport East MP Jessica Morden.
The Dartford Crossing scheme was highlighted a good example for when the bridge is publically owned from 2018.
Mr Jones said this "made a significant difference in terms of time savings for commuters".
Under the Dartford scheme, barriers were removed from the crossing between Kent and Essex and drivers are recorded via number plate recognition cameras with payment made by text message or phone.
The parliamentary under secretary of state at Department for Transport said he was looking at whether lessons could be learned from other parts of the UK.
