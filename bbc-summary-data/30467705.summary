[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of a nightclub owner has been charged with his father's murder after he was found stabbed in central London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of David West, 70, who ran the HeyJo club in Mayfair, was discovered at an address in Ormond Yard behind Jermyn Street on Friday evening.
His son, also called David West, 44, of Jermyn Street, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday charged with murder.
A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a single stab wound.
Mr West senior made his fortune from a discount alcohol and tobacco business in Calais.
He also owned the Abracadabra restaurant in Jermyn Street, near the HeyJo club.
In 2007 Mr West hired Cherie Blair, the barrister and wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, to challenge the smoking ban that was about to come into force in enclosed public places in England.
