Pro12: Newport Gwent Dragons v Munster (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau will start for Newport Gwent Dragons for the first time in nearly a month in Sunday's home Pro12 match with Munster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A knee injury has limited Faletau to only two games for the Dragons since returning from the Rugby World Cup.
Captain Thomas Rhys Thomas starts his first game since September after recovering from a foot injury.
Flanker Lewis Evans and Nic Cudd join Faletau in an all-new back row, while tight-head prop Brok Harris returns.
The Dragons have won only twice in the league this season, beating Italian opposition at home on both occasions, and are in ninth place in the table.
Opponents Munster are third, but will arrive in Wales having lost their unbeaten home record this season after a 12-18 defeat by to leaders Connacht on Saturday.
Coach Anthony Foley has made 10 changes to that beaten side, with centre Denis Hurley in as captain. Niall and Rory Scannell will become the first brothers to start together for Munster in the Pro12.
Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones says the return of captain Thomas is a "big relief" as they look to arrest a run of three straight defeats.
"He has been appointed captain for his leadership and maturity," said Jones.
"We have missed those qualities in our side dreadfully.
"Elliot Dee has played very well and has shown the promise time and time again but at this stage we need to have Rhys back in."
The are three changes to the replacements' bench from Friday's 32-13 loss in Edinburgh as Rhys Buckley, Ed Jackson and Charlie Davies come in.
