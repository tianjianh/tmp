Her third album, Ultraviolence, went straight to the top of the chart, beating rockers Linkin Park.
Linkin Park's The Hunting Park is the US rockers' sixth album in 14 years.
Teenager Ella Henderson remained at number one in the singles chart with Ghost, halting Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer's bid for the top.
The four-piece had to settle for second spot with Don't Stop, following a close race with Henderson.
The Official Charts Company said just 4,000 copies separated number one and two.
Ed Sheeran's former number one, Sing, fell to number three.

George Ezra's single, Budapest, entered the chart at number four, followed by Sam Smith's Stay With Me. Both singers featured prominently on the BBC's Sound of 2014 list, with Smith coming out on top.
Londoner Smith, 22, is enjoying a hugely successful year, with three singles currently in the US Billboard 100, and his album expected to enter the US chart in the top five. In the Lonely Hour is at three in the UK.
Also in the album chart, last week's number one by Kasabian, 48:13, dropped to number five, while Coldplay are at four with Ghost Stories.
