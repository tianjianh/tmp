Plans for new crossing on River Spey near Kingussie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for a new bridge to take the A9 across the River Spey near Kingussie in the Highlands have been published.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new crossing is needed as part of Transport Scotland's Â£3bn project to make the road dual carriageway all the way between Inverness and Perth.
Transport Scotland has proposed building the new bridge further east of the present crossing, which would be removed along with an embankment.
The new structure would also have a lower profile.
The dualling project is to be completed in 2025.
Full details of the planned new bridge have been published online and views from the public have been sought.
