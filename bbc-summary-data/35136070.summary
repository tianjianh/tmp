Alex Parle, 22, Conor Gartland, 18, and Thomas O'Connor, 23, pleaded guilty to involvement in seven raids in London and Manchester.
The Old Bailey heard they smashed their way into cash transfer shops and jewellers wielding sledgehammers and machetes before escaping on mopeds.
The gang was caught after one of them was tackled by a London jeweller.
Parle was jailed for 10 years, while Gartland received eight years detention and "key organiser" O'Connor was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years.
The court heard that jeweller Dominic Carr, of Carr Jewellers in Liverpool Street, London, tackled Parle after the gang smashed their way into his premises on 22 January.
O'Connor and an unidentified robber used sledgehammers to shatter cabinets and snatched Rolex and Omega watches worth more than £222,000 before attempting to escape on a moped.
But a video by a member of public showed Parle failing to mount the back of one of the mopeds and Mr Carr managed to tackle him.
Parle produced a large machete and swung it around at the jeweller before running away.
He was later arrested by police.
In his statement, Mr Carr told the court: "I do not see myself as any kind of hero. My reaction that day was a spontaneous response to protect, but the repercussions of it have been tremendous.
"I am reminded of what happened on an almost daily basis. The attack on my premises was terrifying."
Mr Carr said he was now "wary" every time a motorbike passed his shop.
O'Connor, of Swan Road, Surrey Quays, Parle, of Brunel Road, Surrey Quays, and Gartland, of Druid Street, Bankside, pleaded guilty to plotting to commit robbery.
