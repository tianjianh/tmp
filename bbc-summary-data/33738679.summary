Hayley Pointon was shot at a house in Hinckley, Leicestershire, as she visited her on-off boyfriend Nigel Barwell, in February 2013.
Leicester Crown Court had heard that the 30-year-old Coventry woman was shot by two masked gunmen.
Aaron Power and Aaron Newman, both of Coventry, are due to be sentenced on Monday.
The eight-week trial heard evidence from both men who blamed each other for her death.
The court also heard that Mr Barwell was the intended target for the shooting.
Ms Pointon had been leaving the property when shots were fired, and died from a single gunshot wound.
Power had claimed he thought the intention was to steal cash and drugs from Mr Barwell's house and that his co-accused, Newman, and another man were the gunmen, while he waited with a getaway car nearby.
Prosecuting barrister James House QC suggested Power was lying and blaming his friends after being paid to target Nigel Barwell. Power denied being a "hitman".
Newman, 24, told the jury that although he joined Power on reconnaissance of the house a day earlier, he was at home on the night of the shooting.
He said Power had come back without anything and said something went wrong.
A third man, Dylan Whitty, 30, from Coventry, was found guilty of assisting an offender. He is due to be sentenced on 8 September.
Three other men were cleared of the same charge.
Det Insp Tony Yarwood, of Leicestershire Police, described it as "a horrific crime which has left two young children without a mother, and family without their loving daughter and sister".
Speaking after the case, Hayley's mother, Kerry Pointon, said: "This verdict, although the one we needed, and one which Hayley deserves, is now only the start to us rebuilding our shattered lives without her there.
"She can never be replaced in our lives and therefore we feel that there can never be any true justice for Hayley and her children."
