The crowd of all ages and backgrounds filled Potters Field Park, less than a mile from where three men drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in Borough Market.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan led the short ceremony with a defiant speech that was welcomed by applause.
The crowd filled the park and spilled out on to the area around City Hall, a snaking line of people waiting to leave flowers. The area is now a sea of floral tributes.
Hanyah Casam, 14, from Eden Girls School in Walthamstow, said: "I don't think there's an emotion to describe how we feel today. There's so much sorrow and heartbreak and we just wanted to be here to show our support."
Classmate Zahra Salamut, 15, said: "What happened is not a representation of Islam and we are here with love to represent British Muslims."
Doreen Hutchings, 67, from Camberwell, said: "I'm very angry that people think they can come and do this to my city so I wanted to be with other Londoners.
"It's nice there's a real mixture of people young and old from different backgrounds."
Gareth Snelling, 24, from Peckham, works for Help For Refugee Children. He drew a rainbow heart on a banner where people could leave messages.
He said: "It's really eerie being so quiet but it's nice to see so many people."
Monika Ober-Sahnoun, 31, is from Poland and lives in Greenwich. She said: "I wanted to show the spirit of coming together as a community and showing love and saying 'no' to fear and hate."
