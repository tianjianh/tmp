Louis Moss, 12, youngest Oxford University organist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 12-year-old schoolboy has become the youngest person ever to play the organ for an Oxford University college.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louis Moss, from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, began playing the piano when he was six and tried the organ for the first time just over a year ago.
He has now gained a scholarship to play at Jesus College where he will perform hymns for services from the spring.
Louis is thought to be one of only 750 young people learning to play the organ in the UK.
The student of The Cotswold School in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, said: "It is great to play such an amazing instrument.
"I am looking forward to improving further through my scholarship at Jesus College."
The scholarship scheme, run in conjunction with the Young Organ Scholars' Trust, hopes to reverse the declining numbers of organists in the country.
College principal, Sir Nigel Shadbolt, said: "By starting a young music scholarship scheme here - the first of its kind in an Oxford or Cambridge college - we are creating more opportunities to connect local state schools with Jesus College through music.
"We are delighted to have Louis with us."
