[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Audrey Swallow, 70, and son David, 48, died as a result of the blaze in Dunston, Lincolnshire, last August.
The inquest at Lincoln Coroners' Court heard how caring for David had taken a toll on the family.
The hearing concluded David's death was accidental and recorded an open conclusion in respect of Mrs Swallow.
Coroner Paul Smith said he was unable to give a verdict of suicide as evidence showed she had attempted to get out and call for help.

Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue told the inquest the most likely cause of the fire was an ignited naked flame held deliberately to a combustible material.
Mrs Swallow is said to have told her husband Patrick shortly before the fire "I've had enough darling".
The inquest also heard how Mr Swallow, who was outside when the fire started, told medical professionals: "She did it, I tried to save her and get to her but I couldn't,  - she's tried to do it before".
He later said he could not remember this conversation.
As well as serious health issues, Mrs Swallow had suffered depression and had previously attempted to take her own life.
