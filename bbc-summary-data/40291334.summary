In a statement, the IPCC said: "The force referred the matter to the IPCC shortly after, as Ms Wooding had made a 999 call to West Yorkshire Police on 10 May.
"As such, the IPCC has decided to independently investigate their response to this call, and any subsequent actions taken by police up to the discovery of her body."
