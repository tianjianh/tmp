The four-year deal that Cork signed in July 2011 expires in the summer.
Koeman revealed to BBC Radio Solent in December he had recommended to the board that 25-year-old Cork should be offered a new deal.
"The board of the club is talking to him and his agent," Koeman told BBC South Today. "We've offered him a contract."
Cork, 25, is currently out injured with ankle ligament damage and Koeman says it is now up to the player to decide if he wants to stay at St Mary's.
"He can stay," said Koeman. "Jack Cork by himself has to say yes or no. We are waiting."
