The 23-year-old has agreed a two-and-half-year deal with the Daggers.
"Ollie is a player we have watched for some time and everyone who saw him was impressed," boss John Still told the Dagenham website.
"I decided I would try and sign him in this transfer window and the fact that I changed clubs is Dagenham's gain."
Hawkins becomes the former Luton Town manager's fourth signing of the January transfer window.
