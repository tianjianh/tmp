[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union are against plans to stop extra payments paid to weekend and bank holiday staff.
A National Museum Wales spokeswoman apologised for strike disruption.
Six of National Museum Wales' sites were shut or partially closed due to the strike on Saturday.
A spokeswoman from National Museum Wales said a 6% salary rise for low-paid workers and a living wage of Â£7.85 an hour would mitigate the loss.
She added: "Like most other public sector organisations, we are operating within a reduced budget and are being forced to plan for even more cuts."
On Saturday, Swansea's National Waterfront Museum, the National Slate Museum in Llanberis, Gwynedd, and the National Wool Museum, Dre-fach Felindre, Carmarthenshire were closed.
St Fagans National History Museum and National Museum Cardiff were open on Saturday but with limited services.
Meanwhile, PCS union members at the DVLA in Swansea remain on strike on the second day of their three-day strike over Saturday pay.
