Six Nations 2016: 'Good times ahead' for Scotland - Humphreys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland can expect 'good times around the corner' according to forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys despite their worst ever run of Six Nations defeats.

Saturday's 15-9 loss to England was an eighth in a row since beating Italy in February 2014, surpassing their previous worst sequence in 2004-05.
Humphreys remains upbeat ahead of their next match against Wales in Cardiff, where they have not won for 14 years.
"The last 18 months we have made incredible strides forward," he said.
"It's just frustrating that we don't see it in the Six Nations in turning these close losses into wins.
"Six Nations games are incredibly difficult to win, and we're in there with a shout. We haven't been against England the last two times we have played them.
"Even though the scoreline was quite close at Twickenham (25-13 in 2015), we shouldn't have been in that game. Two years ago when we got beat (at Murrayfield) 20-0, we weren't in it, so we are making strides forward.
"I would say be patient, because there will be some good times around the corner for this team."

Scotland have not beaten Wales in their last eight matches since 2007, when they prevailed 21-9 at Murrayfield, and their last three visits to Cardiff have proved especially painful.
In 2010, they saw a 10-point lead evaporate in the final minutes as Shane Williams' last-gasp try denied Scotland - with two men in the sin-bin - even a draw.
Two years later they suffered two more yellow cards in a 27-13 defeat, while Stuart Hogg's early red card in 2014 was the cue for a record Six Nations defeat, 51-3.
"It hasn't been a happy hunting ground in the Six Nations for a lot of teams, not just Scotland," noted Humphreys, the former Wales hooker.
"Wales are an incredibly difficult side to beat. We are under no illusions that it is going to be a tough ask.
"Most of the Wales players have been together for eight or nine years now, have over 50 caps each, and understand their game.
"You don't have to be a genius to work out what they are trying to do, but it is another thing trying to stop it. But that is what we are trying to work out."
Scotland flanker Blair Cowan, in contention for a starting spot in Cardiff after coming on for the last quarter against England, insists the squad are itching to put their Murrayfield mis-fire behind them.
"It's super-easy to pick ourselves up," he said. "We are still hungry.  We were bitterly disappointed with the England game, especially coming off the World Cup and the buzz we had.
"Knowing that is nowhere near where we can be is motivation in itself. Everyone is frothing to get back into training and correct all our mistakes. This is an unbelievable opportunity down in Cardiff.  "
