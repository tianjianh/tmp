Transport for London to take over suburban rail routes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transport for London (TfL) has announced it will be taking over the running of the capital's suburban rail network.

It will take over the routes as the various rail franchises come up for renewal.
The new partnership between the Department for Transport and TfL says it aims to ensure there are more frequent trains and increased capacity.
The first rail franchise up for renewal is South West in 2017.

Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services could come under TfL's control by 2021.
The plan would mean more than 80% of stations would have a train at least every 15 minutes, up from 67%.
Services running from London Bridge, Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Moorgate would all be transformed under the scheme.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: "We are committed to making journeys better across London and the South East, and this new partnership represents a huge opportunity to transform travel by putting passengers where they should be - at the heart of the rail network.
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: "Our railways have been the workhorse of the London and South East economy since Victorian times.
"They're key in the day-to-day lives of millions of people and vital to our future prosperity, and that's exactly why this new partnership is such a seminal moment."
The proposals have been broadly welcomed but Labour's London mayoral candidate Sadiq Kahn said: "While today's announcement is a step in the right direction, it's still a consultation with no sign of a proper agreement with the relevant authorities.
"It will do little to address the anger and frustration of commuters who deserve action now.
"Rather than more inaction from the government, we need to get on with giving control of London's commuter routes to the mayor as soon as the contracts allow."
The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said the industry would work with the DfT and TfL to "make the best possible use of scarce capacity on our network".
Views are being sought from the public on the plans.
