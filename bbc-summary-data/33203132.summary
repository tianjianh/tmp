[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wife of accused denies Wrexham crossbow 'murder' knowledge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A great-grandmother has denied helping her husband evade arrest following his alleged part in a crossbow murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwenythe Munkley, 55, of Wrexham, claims she did not know about a body being found outside a flat in Wrexham until the following day.
Sion Davies, 25, died after falling from a balcony at Anthony Munkley's Caia Park estate flat last October.
Mold Crown Court heard Mrs Munkley also denies being part of her husband's admitted cannabis supply business.
The prosecution has claimed Mr Davies was stabbed and slashed with knives, shot with a crossbow, and was pushed or fell three storeys from the flat in an alleged row over a drug debt.
Mrs Munkley told the court she had no idea what had happened despite picking her husband up, who was in "a panic", in their Land Rover.
Mr Munkley, 53, of Deva Way, Wrexham, and Lee Michael Roberts, 33, of Pentre Gwyn, Wrexham, both deny murder.
The case continues.
