The 31-year-old played a key role as Accies secured promotion to the Scottish Premiership via the play-offs last season.
Cuthbert saved two penalties in the shoot-out win over Hibernian.
The former Ayr United, Morton and St Johnstone man played 43 times in total for Hamilton last term.
Raith also revealed on their club website that they have agreed a deal for another new face, but are waiting for the player to return from holiday to finalise the contract.
