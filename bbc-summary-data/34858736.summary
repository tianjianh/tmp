Northern Ireland average house price 'up 7 per cent'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
House prices in Northern Ireland continue to increase, according to the latest official figures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The standardised average price of a home in the region is almost Â£117,000 - that is 7% higher than a year ago.
Figures issued through the Department of Finance show all areas of Northern Ireland, except mid-Ulster, saw a rise in the latest quarter (July - Sept).
Between 2005 and 2007, Northern Ireland house prices doubled before collapsing, reaching a low point in early 2013.
However, the market has been in recovery mode since then. Prices are still about 40% below what they were before the crash.
