Andrew Bow, 36, was found dead at a house in the city 10 days ago.
A call about his wellbeing was handled by Bilston Glen - the same centre that dealt with a call about the M9 crash in July.
The police response is being examined by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
An investigation will look at how officers responded to initial concerns about the occupant of the house, who was understood to be vulnerable.
A Pirc spokesman said in a statement on Friday: "The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been instructed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to carry out an independent investigation after the body of Andrew Bow, 36, was discovered at a residential address in Edinburgh on 23 March 2016.
"The investigation will focus on the initial police response leading up to the incident, which included a report of concern about the welfare of the occupant of the property.
"A report on the commissioner's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."
Staffing shortages at Bilston Glen were highlighted after an HM Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) report into the M9 crash near Stirling in July in which Lamara Bell and John Yuill died.
Ms Bell, who was discovered critically injured in the crashed car, had been in the vehicle next to her dead partner Mr Yuill for three days. She died later in hospital.
Police Scotland admitted they did not investigate a report they had received about the crash until three days after it happened.
