[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tricia Lorenz, a patient at the North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre in Southport Hospital, married her partner of four years, Steve McEntee.
Ms Lorenz, from Wrexham, north-east Wales, was left paralysed and on a ventilator following a medical procedure in March last year. She has been in hospital since.
About 50 family and friends gathered to watch the couple take their vows.
Staff from the spinal unit also joined in the celebrations.
Special permission from the registrar was given for the couple to marry in the centre's day room.
Suppliers to Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust donated the food.
Ms Lorenz said: "We've had such a lovely day. Steve and I would like to say thank you to all the staff who have made our wedding possible, and to our family and friends who have travelled here to be with us."
Her husband is supervising the adaptation of his home in Frodsham, Cheshire, for when she can leave hospital.
