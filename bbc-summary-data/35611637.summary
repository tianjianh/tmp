Bobby Thomson, 64, was one of three men who were missing overnight in hills around Durisdeer in Dumfries and Galloway.
They were rescued on Wednesday but Geoffrey Stewart, 74, and George Crosbie, 73, died later in hospital.
In a statement, Mr Thomson's family thanked everyone involved in the search as well as staff at Dumfries hospital.
They said he hoped to be able to return to his home in the town soon.
"Our family would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of George and Geoff following this tragedy," they added.
"We are very grateful to all the services that were involved in the search and rescue and would like to thank them, and the staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, for all their efforts."
The men, all experienced hillwalkers, failed to return from a walk on Tuesday.
Moffat Mountain Rescue team led a search on Tuesday night but it was called off early on Wednesday amid heavy rain, snow, and high winds.
More than 50 people joined the search the following morning and the men were eventually found and airlifted to hospital.
