Pictures appear to show the structure - near the city of Villavicencio and made of boards and rope - dangling on its side.
It is believed to have collapsed under excess weight, the reports say.
The bridge is a local tourist attraction and was crowded with people enjoying a public holiday.
Young children are among the dead, with those on the bridge at the time reportedly plunging 80m (265ft) into a ravine.
