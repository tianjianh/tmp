Their mother sustained minor injuries in the attack inside the house in Harwich Road on Thursday afternoon.
The boys' parents, who asked not to be named, issued a statement saying: "Our beautiful sons Archie Joe Darby and Daniel-Jay Darby are so, so loved by us all and were such happy little loveable boys.
"It doesn't seem real that our little Archie Bum has gone to heaven and our little Daniel is in intensive care because of a tragic, tragic incident involving a dog attack.
"We have lost our gorgeous little four-month-old baby and our beautiful 22-month-old boy is currently being treated for his injuries.
"Heaven has gained a beautiful little angel and he will be greatly missed by us all and our other little soldier is still fighting strong.
"Please, please, please can you all respect our privacy at this time."
Daniel-Jay was left with "life-changing injuries" in the attack and is being treated at a specialist unit.
Tributes including flowers and toys have been left outside the house. One card left with a bunch of roses read: "RIP little man."
