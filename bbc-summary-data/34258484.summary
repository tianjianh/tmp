Edmund is vying for a spot in the team with James Ward as the second singles player, behind Andy Murray.
However, when asked about the situation by BBC Scotland, captain Leon Smith said: "It's all fine."
The semi-final meeting begins on Friday with two singles matches, followed by a doubles match on Saturday.
The reverse singles on Sunday complete the tie with Murray expected to play on all three days.
The winners in Glasgow will face either Argentina or Belgium in the final at the end of November.
