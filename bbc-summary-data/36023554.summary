The former Sunderland and England player was jailed last month following a trial at Bradford Crown Court.
An official at the court confirmed that Johnson's legal team had lodged an appeal against his sentence.
The 28-year-old has already begun an appeal against his conviction of sexual activity with a 15-year-old.
Johnson admitted grooming the girl and a separate, less serious charge, of sexual activity.
On the Adam Johnson's Appeal Fight Facebook page, run by his sister Faye, a post said: "Adam's appeal against his sentence has now been lodged!"
It added: "Thanks everyone for your support it means a lot! X"
Sentencing the player, Judge Jonathan Rose told him he had abused a position of trust and caused his victim "severe psychological harm".
Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012.
