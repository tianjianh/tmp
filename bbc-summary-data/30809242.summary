[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeremie Malenge, 17, from Hackney, died on Homerton High Street less than an hour after police spoke to him on 6 January.
The girl, also from Hackney, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at the Old Bailey.
A 14-year-old boy and a 17-year-old have also been charged with murder.
The boy, also from Hackney, and a 17-year-old from Redbridge, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are due before Stratford Youth Court later.
A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the chest.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the Met's prior contact with the victim on the night of the attack.
It is understood Mr Malenge was questioned on the night he was killed by officers because he matched the description of young people reported to be armed with knives in the area.
He was not arrested but was attacked less than an hour later in Ponsford Street.
A 17-year-old boy arrested in West Yorkshire on suspicion of murder remains in police custody.
Another youth, from Enfield, north London, who was also arrested on suspicion of murder, has been bailed pending further inquiries.
