Reid, 30, leaves Glasgow after making 109 appearances in seven years at the Scottish club, in which he helped win the Pro12 title in the 2014-15 season.
The loose-head prop has 24 caps for Scotland and joins Irish after they won the Championship play-off final.
"I had seven enjoyable seasons with Glasgow, but it's now time for a new challenge in my career," he said.
Irish have also secured the services of Australian scrum-half Ben Meehan, 24, who joins from Super Rugby side Melbourne Rebels and 24-year-old Georgian back row Lasha Lomidze from Russian side Krasny Yar.
Meehan switched codes after playing for NRL side Melbourne Storm, while Lomidze has 25 caps for Georgia and previously played for French clubs Montpellier and Beziers.
Reid, Meehan and Lomidze are the Exiles' first new signings for the 2017-18 season following their play-off win over Yorkshire Carnegie and promotion back to the Premiership at the first time of asking.
