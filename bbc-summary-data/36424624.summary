Injury-plagued Ogogo beat Gary Cooper in only his second fight in 22 months.
"On the way home I was buzzing but my mates were very tired and all fell asleep, so I drove pretty much all the way home from Glasgow," said Ogogo, 27.
"I didn't get home until 7:30. One of my mates is a very good runner and asked me to go for a run, so I said 'go on then' and went for an hour's run."
He continued to BBC Radio Suffolk: "All my fights before, I've been struggling the next few days because of injuries going into the fight, whereas now I feel 100% and I can't wait to get back into the ring."
After winning his first seven professional fights, Ogogo missed a year with an Achilles injury and made his comeback last July against Ruslan Schelev, when he suffered a dislocated shoulder that kept him out for 10 months.
Ogogo, an Olympic bronze medallist at London 2012, beat Cooper in three rounds on the undercard of the WBA world super-lightweight title fight between Ricky Burns and Michele di Rocco.
And he hopes to fight on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's IBF world heavyweight title defence on 25 June.
"Because I've missed so much time in the past, now it's all about being very active for me," continued Ogogo.
"If I can box every four to six weeks, I will. If I can build that momentum it won't be very long before I'm challenging for domestic titles, European and world titles."
