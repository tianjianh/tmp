Macclesfield Town 1-2 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Rankine's double helped Guiseley to their first away win of the season with an impressive display at Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors more than rode their luck in the opening exchanges, and led on the half-hour when James Wesolowski was tripped in the box. Rankine converted the penalty.
Chris Holroyd levelled within a couple of minutes, going on an inspired run and finishing calmly past Johnny Maxted.
But Rankine scored an unexpected winner for the Lions in the second half, after Will Hatfield was tripped in the box by goalkeeper Scott Flinders.
The stopper initially saved Rankine's second penalty, but the striker stayed calm to knock the rebound in.
