[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 0-1 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool fell to a 1-0 defeat against Dover in their first clash after being relegated from the Football League last season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New Pools boss Matthew Bates saw his side struggle to take control early on, with a half chance for Padraig Amond all they had to show for the first 25 minutes at Victoria Park.
Dover, who are adjusting to life without 40-goal marksman Ricky Miller, then took the lead after 29 minutes through debutant Jamie Allen. The ex-Southport striker turned sharply to find space in the box and curl home amid a scramble from a corner.
Amond continued to threaten for the hosts, but Kane Richards missed a gilt-edged chance to put the visitors 2-0 up after 55 minutes and then Ryan Bird headed just wide in the closing moments to leave Pools in no doubt that getting back up will not be easy.
