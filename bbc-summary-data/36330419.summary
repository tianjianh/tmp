MP Rebecca Pow urged people to support a move to restore the Wellington Monument, saying it could have an impact on the government.
The world's tallest three-sided obelisk, standing at 75ft, was built as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington.
It was recently fenced off due to falling stone debris posing a risk to the public.
The National Trust said it was looking at several repair options.
Conservative MP for Taunton Deane Ms Pow said: "There are a plethora of reasons why we should restore this much-loved local feature for future generations.
"It's a wonderful beacon in the area in a beautiful location and is enjoyed by thousands..."
