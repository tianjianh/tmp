Jack Marriott ensured the hosts' domination was rewarded as he headed in Olly Lee's cross after Joe Piggott had missed a host of Luton chances.
But Souleymane Coulibaly rescued County a point late on as the substitute striker nodded in Alex Rodman's cross.
Accrington's win over York mean the Minstermen drop out as County are safe.
Newport manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "When I first came in it was 'stay up at all costs' and (former manager) John Sheridan put the ground in there for me and I just tried to carry on what he left.
"And full credit to the players because people won't realise how hard it is down the bottom of that league.
"But they've responded and it's job done for us."
