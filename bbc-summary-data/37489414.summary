Colchester high school abolishes 'traditional' homework

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high school has scrapped traditional homework in favour of a more "independent" approach to learning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Morant School and College in Colchester has told pupils and parents that they will no longer set homework and will instead select their own "appropriate" tasks.
The new scheme is optional but there will be rewards for completed tasks.
It said it believes the new approach will give pupils "greater responsibility for their own learning".
The school has called the new approach 'Prove It+' at Key Stage 3 & 4 and Independent Study Tasks at Stage 5.
In a letter, it explained how tasks will be uploaded onto the school's website and pupils can select what they want to do based on guidance from teachers, as well as their own targets and interests.
Some of the tasks "support community and charity awareness" to help "develop the whole child", the letter said.
Principal Catherine Hutley told the Daily Gazette that teachers will use the time previously spent on setting and marking home on planning lessons more precisely.
She said the move away from traditional homework had been discussed for about a year.
Parents have been involved in a consultation period which has included 30-minute workshops.
