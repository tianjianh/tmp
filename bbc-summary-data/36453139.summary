UFC: Britain's Michael Bisping wins middleweight championship

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Bisping became the first Briton to win a UFC title with a sensational first-round knockout against middleweight champion Luke Rockhold in Los Angeles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old, who was given only 17 days notice to replace injured Chris Weidman for his first title chance, floored Rockhold with a left hook.
Another left saw the American down again moments later and the fight was stopped after three minutes, 36 seconds.
