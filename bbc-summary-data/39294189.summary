Nicholas Taylor, 47, and Joan Taylor, 43, targeted children as young as 11 and supplied them with crack cocaine.
The 84 offences by the "master manipulators" occurred between 1996 and 2006, Leicester Crown Court was told.
Taylor, who had previous convictions for indecency, and his wife, a former prostitute, pleaded guilty to 10 charges.
They will be sentenced at a later date.
Det Insp Adam Pendlebury, from Northamptonshire Police, praised the "extraordinary courage" of the Taylors' 11 victims.
He said: "The Taylors were master manipulators who used crack cocaine to force their victims to engage in sexual activity against their will and their actions have had a devastating impact on their victims' lives."
He described Nicholas Taylor as a "very dangerous, depraved individual" and his co-accused as "a more than willing accomplice".
The investigation into the couple began in 2014 and was the largest of its type in the force's history.
