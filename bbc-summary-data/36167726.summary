Snowfall has been reported in mainly eastern parts of the country, including Aberdeenshire and the Borders.
Traffic Scotland said the snow-gate on the A93 at the Spittal of Glenshee was temporarily closed.
Police in the north-east have warned of hazardous driving conditions and motorists have been asked to take care around Edinburgh.
The Met Office has issued a yellow "be aware" warning for snow for the south, east and north-east of Scotland.
Forecasters expected accumulations of 5-10cm (2-4in) above 100m (330ft), with 15cm (6in) or more possible above 200m (656ft).
A mix of rain and snow was expected at lower levels and near coasts.
The chief forecaster said: "A depression which has crossed northern parts of northern England early Friday is bringing a slow-moving band of rain, sleet and snow into the area.
"This has stalled across eastern Scotland for a time early on Friday and will go on to push away east or south-eastwards through the course of Friday."
Amey, which maintains some trunk roads in Scotland, said it had gritters and snow ploughs out in the east and south-east of the country.
Stagecoach said some services are running late due to "heavy snowfall" in the east of Scotland.
