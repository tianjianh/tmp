70mph M6 flasher Ian Cameron jailed for a year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flasher who twice exposed himself to female motorists while driving beside them at 70mph has been jailed, eight years after going on the run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Cameron, 45, exposed himself while driving on the M6 near Carlisle on two different days in February 2007.
But after being charged by police, Cameron fled to Spain where he remained for eight years until his arrest last month.
He has now been jailed for a year at Carlisle Crown Court.
Judge Peter Davies told him: "It is quite clear this was a course of conduct of deliberate, intentional lewd behaviour in front of female drivers."
Cameron, formerly of Waterfoot Drive, Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent exposure.
He also admitted perverting the court of justice, having initially told police he was not driving the Volkswagen Golf at the time his crimes occurred.
Cameron - said in court to be the son of a police officer - was also banned from driving for 18 months.
