Motherwell: Stephen Robinson says players have shown fighting spirit

Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson believes his players have responded to the pressure of fighting to stay in the Scottish Premiership.

Saturday's 1-0 victory over local rivals Hamilton means the Fir Park side's fate remains in their own hands.
"It's almost impossible [to take the pressure off]. The players know the importance of it however you dress it up," Robinson said.
"We out-scrapped and out-battled them, which was a real pleasing aspect."
Robinson has stressed to his players the need to build on the Hamilton result when they face Kilmarnock at Fir Park on Tuesday night.
If Motherwell win and their Lanarkshire neighbours Accies fail to win, then Robinson's side will have secured their Premiership status.
With only four victories at Fir Park all season, the manager acknowledges the side's home form has been poor.
"It's solely in our hands, that's what we wanted to come out of Saturday's game, but we have to follow that up on Tuesday," Robinson said.
"There's still pressure, but it will be a little bit more of a relaxed atmosphere on a better surface where we can get the ball down and play.
"We just have to put the same level of commitment in as we did on Saturday and add a little bit of quality to that. I believe it will be different on our own patch, we'll play more football, but it's paramount we take the game to them.
"The pressure's completely off Kilmarnock now, so they can relax and play. You do make decisions under pressure that you wouldn't normally make as footballers. I'm not going to worry too much about Kilmarnock. We're aware of their threats, they have a great record away from home and they have the best defensive record in the bottom six, so we're well aware it will be a tough game.
"Our home form hasn't been good enough. Things haven't gone for us, we've actually played well in the last three or four home games, but the harder you work sometimes the luckier you get. I don't think there's any fear of playing at home or a problem with fans getting on players' backs. In the main they've been very much behind the players given the situation and we ask for the same again."
Motherwell goalkeeper Russell Griffiths admits there was a "big sigh of relief" from the players following the full-time whistle at Hamilton on Saturday.
The 21-year-old is on loan at Fir Park from Everton and is playing for his future, with his contract at Goodison ending in the summer.
"I'm a free agent at the end of the season, so if everything went well here I could hopefully sign here, but I'm still waiting to hear back from Everton what their plans are," Griffiths said.
"We'll get the next few games out the way and then see where we stand from there. Depending on how I perform will contribute a lot to what happens to me next season."
