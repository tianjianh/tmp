Charlotte Bevan, 30, disappeared from St Michael's Hospital with her daughter, named Zaani Tiana, between 20:30 and 21:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Officers have cordoned off an area in the grounds of Clifton Observatory above the gorge.
Avon and Somerset police said Ms Bevan's family had been informed.
A formal identification of the body is due to take place later on Thursday. The search for baby Zaani is "still continuing", police said.
"We are searching in the same area along with police dogs from South Wales Police. We are only searching in that area," he said.
Mountain rescue teams and the police helicopter were also involved in the search at the observatory.
On Wednesday, CCTV footage was issued showing the 30-year-old mother leaving hospital.
Ms Bevan did not have a coat or shoes and is thought to have been wearing hospital slippers, while her baby was wrapped only in blankets.
The night she went missing temperatures in Bristol were close to freezing.
Police, her mother and her boyfriend Pascal Malbrouck made a direct appeal for her to get in touch at a press conference on Wednesday.
A spokesman for University Hospitals Bristol, which runs St Michael's Hospital, said Ms Bevan had discharged herself for "reasons unknown" and there had been no signs she was planning to leave.
"Charlotte and her baby were seen by staff at 20:30. When staff went to check on her at 21:05 they found Charlotte and her baby missing and immediately sounded the alarm," he said.
The hospital said access to the maternity unit is controlled by a "door release" and CCTV. It is not clear how Ms Bevan was able to leave.
