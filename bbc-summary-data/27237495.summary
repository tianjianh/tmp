[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains of Becky Godden, from Swindon, were found at the farm in Gloucestershire in 2011 by police probing the death of another woman.
Wiltshire Police searched the field again in April and found the bone, which matched Ms Godden's DNA.
Officers searching the field also discovered "other items" but did not elaborate on what was found.
Det Ch Insp Sean Memory added: "At this stage we cannot comment further on the nature of these items."
Ms Godden was aged 20 when she disappeared from her home in Shaw, Swindon, in 2003.
Her remains were unearthed at Baxter's Farm, Eastleach, following the arrest of taxi driver Christopher Halliwell over the disappearance of 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan.
Officers were led to the body by Halliwell, but he was not prosecuted over her death after a judge ruled detectives had ignored arrest guidelines.
Halliwell was later jailed for life for Ms O'Callaghan's murder.
