Newport County have brought in Lennie Lawrence to work with caretaker boss Mike Flynn.

The 69-year-old has been given the title 'First Team Management Consultant' at Rodney Parade.
Lawrence has managed over 1,000 league games in his career and he said he was delighted to join the Exiles.
"I have undertaken this type of role on several occasions and will be there for Michael to offer advice and guidance when needed," said Lawrence.
Lawrence will now link up with Flynn and assistant boss, Wayne Hatswell, until the end of the season as County look to avoid relegation from the Football League.
Since taking over after the sacking of Graham Westley, Flynn has had a reasonable start with two wins and a defeat, but the Exiles remain seven points from League Two safety ahead of tonight's game against Luton.
Flynn said he welcomed the arrival of Lawrence.
"I'm over the moon that Lennie's agreed to come on board," said Flynn.
"I'm always learning and if I can't learn from someone who's managed over a 1,000 times in the Football League then I won't be able to learn from anyone.
"Not only will Lennie be important for my development, he'll also be helpful to the board as he brings with him a wealth of football knowledge."
Lawrence has managed a host of clubs down the years including Charlton, Middlesbrough and Cardiff City.
Most recently he returned to the Welsh capital to act as assistant manager to Paul Trollope during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Bluebirds.
Lawrence said he was looking forward to working with Flynn at Newport, adding: "I met Michael at the FAW UEFA Pro license course and when approached I was delighted to offer some support."
