Merseyside Police said he was found on Okell Drive, Halewood at about 21:00 GMT on Monday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition is described as critical but stable.
Two boys - aged 16 and 17 from Huyton - and a 17-year-old boy from Kirkby are all being questioned by police.
Although the investigation is in its early stages, officers believe there was a fight between two groups of local youths which resulted in three teenagers being injured.
The two other boys were not seriously injured, and are recovering at home after being taken to hospital.
