[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cleveland Indians beat Toronto Blue Jays to reach first World Series for 19 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Cleveland Indians reached their first World Series since 1997 by beating the Toronto Blue Jays 3-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The win in Toronto gave the Indians a 4-1 lead in their best-of-seven series for the American League Championship.
The Indians have not won a World Series since 1948 - only the Chicago Cubs have a worse record, having not won baseball's biggest prize since 1908.
The Cubs are 2-1 down to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the best-of-seven National League Championship series.
The build-up to the Indians' game in Toronto involved an attempt to block the team's name and logo being used in Ontario.
But an indigenous activist's claim they were racist was dismissed by an Ontario Superior Court judge on Monday.
