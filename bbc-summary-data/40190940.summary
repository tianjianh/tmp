Allegri, 49, has steered Juve to three successive Serie A titles, two Champions League finals and three Coppa Italia triumphs since replacing Antonio Conte in July 2014.
"Side by side, Juventus and Allegri have created history and legend," said a Juventus statement.
"Now is the time to make the next step forwards together."
It added: "Today's agreement extends a working relationship that has seen the Bianconeri consolidate their position as Italy's top team and also evolve into one of European football's major forces."
In May 2016, former AC Milan boss Allegri extended his contract with Juve until the summer of 2018.
Juventus finished four points ahead of second-placed Roma in 2016-17 to be crowned Italian champions for a sixth straight season.
They also reached the final of the Champions League, losing 4-1 to Real Madrid in Cardiff last Saturday.
Elsewhere in Serie A, Simone Inzaghi has signed a two-year contract extension tying him to Lazio until 2020, the club said on Wednesday.
The 41-year-old coach enjoyed a positive 2016/17 season, guiding Lazio to fifth in Serie A and the Italian Cup final, which they lost to Juventus, meaning they will play in next season's Europa League.
