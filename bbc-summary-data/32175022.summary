Election 2015: Jim McGovern will not seek re-election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour is looking for a new candidate to fight the Dundee West seat in the general election after Jim McGovern announced he will not be standing for re-election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McGovern, who had held the seat for ten years, has decided not to seek a third term due to ill health.
It comes less than a week before the deadline for candidates to register.
Stewart Hosie, the SNP MP for Dundee, sent his best wishes to Mr McGovern, and wished him a speedy recovery.
