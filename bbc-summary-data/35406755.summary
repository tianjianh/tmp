[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 0-3 Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England striker Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham kept up the chase at the top with an easy win at Norwich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dele Alli tapped in inside the first two minutes after Christian Eriksen's low shot had been blocked.
Kane then stroked in the second from the spot after Alli, who came off with an illness at half-time, was fouled in trying to follow up Kane's saved shot.
He then fired his second of the night from 15 yards after Eriksen had dispossessed Martin Olsson.
The victory lifts Spurs up to third, above Arsenal on goal difference. Norwich could find themselves in the bottom three on Wednesday if Newcastle defeat Everton.

Keegan-Toshack, Cole-Beardsley, Shearer-Sheringham - Kane and Alli just seem to have an understanding that some of the game's legendary link-ups possessed.
The wholesome twosome have formed a formidable attack at Spurs. Alli has had a hand in 10 goals in his last 13 Premier League games for Spurs, and Kane has scored eight in his last eight. They are a fantasy football player's dream combo.
Kane was his usual hungry self - snapping at the heels of the last defender. He should have got his reward for his doggedness when late in the game he stole the ball from Youssouf Mulumbu, surged towards goal but saw his shot rebound off the post.
However, with seconds remaining he did grab his second when he pounced on the loose ball after good work from Eriksen and fired past Declan Rudd.
As for Alli, he only played a cameo today, but it was a memorable one. The 19-year-old is both a threat outside the area and inside, as proved today. He anticipated brilliantly for the first, and repeated the trick when he won the penalty, which was conceded by Sebastian Bassong.
Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said he was brought off at half-time because he felt unwell. Spurs fans will be praying he is fit for Saturday's home clash against Watford.
The Canaries were the most active team in the transfer window, but have they made the right purchases?
One of their buys was Portuguese right-back Ivo Pinto. He made his debut in the 5-4 defeat against Liverpool, and followed that up with a truly awful first-half display against Spurs.
He allowed Christian Eriksen far too much space down that flank and was then put into a spin by Kane, who forced a good save from the impressive Declan Rudd.
At the other end, there was little bite. Tall forward Dieumerci Mbokani looked the most potent, and had his side's best chance - a low drive that keeper Hugo Lloris was equal to.
Another new signing Steven Naismith had a relatively quiet game, but perhaps the Scot, his team-mates and manager Alex Neil will have been slightly aggrieved that a penalty was not awarded when he fell under the challenge of defender Kevin Wimmer.

Norwich manager Alex Neil: "Once you concede in the first minute and a half, we make it difficult for ourselves.
"The Spurs penalty is the softest penalty I've seen all season. We didn't get the fair share of the decisions and that cost us.
"If it was a clear penalty, I'd be the first to hold my hands up. The next game becomes huge for us now."
Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino: "The performance was very good. I'm happy with three points. The first half was fantastic.
"Dele felt unwell, but he's OK now.
"Harry is still very young and has big potential to improve."
Norwich face what you can call a relegation six-pointer against Villa at home on Saturday. Spurs are at home to Watford on the same day.
