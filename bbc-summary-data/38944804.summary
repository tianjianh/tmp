The diversion followed a "security threat onboard".
The guests, baggage and aircraft crews went through additional security screening which took several hours, according to the airline.
The majority of transferring guests were re-booked on flights on Saturday morning and were offered overnight accommodation in Abu Dhabi.
Etihad Airways has apologised for the inconvenience caused.
In a statement the airline said "the safety and security of our guests and crew is our top priority.
"The crew completed all necessary in-flight checks as per procedure, with no abnormalities found, then followed the authorities' instructions to undergo further security checks at the air base."
