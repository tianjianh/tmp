[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners in Argentina have identified another child abducted from left-wing political prisoners during military rule between 1976 and 1983.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo group says DNA tests confirm the woman, now in her thirties, was the daughter of communist activists seized in 1977.
Her mother gave birth in prison and both her biological parents were never seen again.
The organisation says there are still more than 400 others to be found.
Human rights groups say the kidnapping of babies was part of a systematic government plan.
The plan was to place the children of people the government thought of as subversive with military families and allies to avoid raising another generation of what the military rulers considered left-wing radicals.
In this case, the woman is the child of Walter Dominguez and Gladys Castro, who lived in the northern city of Mendoza and both belonged to the Argentine Communist Marxist Leninist party.
They were arrested in their home by what the neighbours thought were police and taken away.
Gladys Castro was six months pregnant at the time. She gave birth in 1978.
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo was founded in 1977 with the goal of finding the children stolen and illegally adopted during the military government.
