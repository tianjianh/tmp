David Mundell said other parts of the UK could learn from the Our Islands Our Future campaign.
It was set up by the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland councils to secure a better deal for the islands.
During his trip on Thursday, Mr Mundell will meet leaders of each council as well as those involved in the campaign.
He will also visit local businesses including Harris Tweed and Hebridean Seaweed.
Mr Mundell said: "You can look at the track record of this government through the Northern Powerhouse, a devolution deal for Cornwall and our ongoing work with the Borderlands initiative as examples of our commitment to put power in the hands of communities and making sure opportunity and prosperity reaches every part of our country.
"I'm keen for the islands councils to play a full part in the ongoing debate on how the substantial powers in the Scotland Bill are used to directly benefit island communities.
"Over the past few years there has been a process of centralisation from the Scottish Government but I hope through opportunities such as the devolution of management over the Crown Estate, this imbalance can be redressed."
Islands Minister Derek Mackay said he was keen to work with the island councils to deliver many of the commitments proposed in the Scottish government's Empowering Scotland's Island Communities plan.
He added: "Later this summer we will be launching a consultation on a future Islands Bill to provide more power, equality and protection for the Islands to allow them to build a more prosperous and fairer future for their communities.
"As the first minister confirmed on her visit to Orkney earlier this year, there will be a full consultation across Scotland on the long term arrangements for managing Crown estate assets.
"People will gain a greater say in managing their local coastline - and communities will get a bigger benefit from the natural resources which are on their doorstep."
