Music stars and MPs have recorded the tribute to the member for Batley and Spen who was murdered in her constituency.
It is a cover version of the Rolling Stones classic, You Can't Always Get What You Want, to raise money for a charity set up in her name.
The Jo Cox Foundation supports a range of charities championed by the late MP.
The recording features musicians including Kaiser Chiefs' frontman Ricky Wilson, Cockney Rebel's Steve Harley, KT Tunstall and David Gray.
The government is to make a charitable donation equivalent to the VAT payable on the sales of the single to the foundation, the treasury has announced.
Chancellor Philip Hammond said: "I am pleased to confirm that every single penny of sales from this single will go towards the good causes the Jo Cox Foundation supports."
