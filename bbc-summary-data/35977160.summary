The Dáil meets in a second attempt to elect a taoiseach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Dáil meets later in what is expected to be an inconclusive attempt to elect a taoiseach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and his Fianna Fáil counterpart Micheál Martin are likely to meet later to discuss options for government.
Mr Kenny insisted at a party meeting last on Tuesday he would not consider a short-term deal.
Irish politicians have been attempting to form a workable coalition since February's general election.
The Dáil last met on 10 March, when TDs failed to elect a taoiseach to form a government..
It is expected that an inconclusive vote will pave the way for the meeting between Mr Kenny and Mr Martin.
Following the February election to the Dáil, Fine Gael has 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
