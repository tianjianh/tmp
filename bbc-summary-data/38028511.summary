"I told you I didn't vote," he told an audience in San Jose, California. "But I didn't tell you... if I would've voted, I would've voted on Trump."
Angry fans responded by booing the singer and throwing items on stage.
West said he had "loved the debates" between Trump and rival Hillary Clinton and that his "approach was absolutely genius because it... worked".

The performer also asked for people to "stop focusing on racism", saying: "This world is racist, okay. Let's stop being distracted to focus on that as much. We are in a racist country - period."
But he said his preference did not mean he was any less supportive of women's rights and the Black Lives Matter movement.
"That don't mean I don't believe in these things because that is the guy I would've voted for," he can be heard saying in footage uploaded on social media.
West was performing on Thursday as part of his Saint Pablo tour. His next concert will be held in Sacramento, also in California, on Saturday.
At last year's MTV Music Video Awards, the 39-year-old performer announced that he planned to run for president in 2020.
