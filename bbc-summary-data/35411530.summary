[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County's Jacob Butterfield says there were signs they were getting back to their best at Burnley and described the 4-1 loss as a "crazy night".

The Rams conceded three goals in 12 second-half minutes at Turf Moor and are now winless in five league games.
Butterfield, whose volley levelled the scores at 1-1, told BBC Radio Derby: "In the first half we were the better team and played some brilliant stuff.
"Before we knew it, we were 3-1 down in a game we have dominated."
The Rams have slipped to fifth in the Championship table and are now six points adrift of the automatic promotion spots, having played a game more than second-placed Middlesbrough.
Midfielder Butterfield, who has scored seven goals for the Rams this season, added: "It was one of those crazy nights. We will have to get it out of our system and move on.
"We were unlucky to go in at 1-1, we should have been 2-1 or 3-1 up. It looked like it was going to be a good night. It's hard to explain.

"But when you are in a bit of bad form these things happen. You can't legislate for individual mistakes. They always happen and unfortunately we have had a couple and it has cost us.
"That will not happen every game - it's a one off. We have had a bad night but we will try to be positive about it."
Derby are in FA Cup action on Friday, 29 January when Premier League side Manchester United visit the iPro Stadium.
The next league fixture is also at home, against Preston North End on Tuesday, 2 January.
"It was only a few weeks ago we were four points clear," said the 25-year-old. "All the top teams have to still play each other.
"I still believe it is in our hands. We showed signs we can put it right. We still have time on our side and we are confident we can win a lot of matches and get right up there again."
