Generation 2015 brings young voices to election debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Generation 2015 addresses fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Why do so few people aged 18 to 24 turn out to vote?
Is there a 'disconnect' between the younger UK electorate and the political classes?
If so, why?
And, how might it skew politicians' decision-making, if they know the young are far less likely than older people to punish or reward them at the ballot box?
It's thought just 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds had their say at the 2010 general election, compared with 75% of those over 55.
What causes this low turnout among the young?
Apathy? Indifference? Or mistrust?
A recent BBC Newsbeat survey found that large numbers of young people do care about politics.
However, research also indicates that many are turned off democracy specifically by the behaviour and attitude of politicians and political parties.
In the run-up to a general election, and in the wake of a recession that many say has disproportionately impacted young people, there is no better time to discuss these issues.
The 200 members of Generation 2015 have been hand-picked to represent the broadest possible cross-section of young UK, and to get involved in debates and discussions as part of the wider BBC family.
We have voices drawn from a range of diverse backgrounds and communities.
They represent the whole of the UK, from Shetland to Southampton, and from Norfolk to County Fermanagh.
They'll appear across a range of BBC output, discussing the issues above, or talking more broadly about life as a young person today.
Their lives are also being captured to film, in innovative BBC projects like #inmyshoes.
BBC Generation 2015 are delighted to be able to bring these young voices to the heart of UK debate.
