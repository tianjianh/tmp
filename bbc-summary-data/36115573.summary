Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says Divock Origi could play again this season despite suffering a "serious injury" against Everton.

The 21-year-old Belgium striker was substituted in the second half of Wednesday's 4-0 win at Anfield after a challenge by Ramiro Funes Mori, who was then sent off.
Liverpool, in seventh, trail fifth-place Manchester United by five points with five games remaining.
"We'll try everything," said Klopp.
Origi had to be taken off on a stretcher but it was confirmed shortly after the game that he had not broken his ankle.
"The season is not over," added Klopp. "We are all different. We don't have to make any general comments. We only have to work with him and see what happens.
"Why should we say the season is over now when it is still a few games away?"
