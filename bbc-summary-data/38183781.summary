A photograph of a boy and his dog on the Solway Coast has been chosen from thousands of images on Instagram as "encapsulating Scotland".

It was shortlisted by renowned Scots photographer Harry Benson before being voted overall winner in the Scottish Parliament's #SeeingScotland contest.
The picture was taken by Lorna Young, from Dumfries, of her son Alexander and dog Neo at Mersehead nature reserve.
It will now be added to the parliament's art collection.
More than 5,000 people took part in the competition, which asked people to share the photos they thought encapsulated life in Scotland, what Scotland meant to them or that celebrated Scotland.
Ms Young, who will be presented with a signed Harry Benson book at the Scottish Parliament and be given a guided tour of the building, said she was "gobsmacked".
She said: "I'm thrilled and genuinely gobsmacked to have won.
"Harry Benson's work is iconic, so to know that he's seen my photo, never mind selected it as one of his favourites from this competition, is incredible."
Harry Benson CBE said he preferred photographs that "cannot happen again, that would be difficult to set up and do it over again, a good picture is basically a glimpse and gone forever."
He added: "The photograph of the boy and his dog on the Solway Coast is very interesting and evokes the loneliness of a boy and his dog alone. The quietness of the early morning light casts its glow on the water and sand. The photographer has a regard for beauty."
Ms Young said the image was taken at the end of February and was the family puppy's first day at the beach.
She said: "I snapped the photo while neither of them were aware, so while the rest of our photos that day are full of action and posing and nonsense, this quiet moment, when they were simply enjoying each other's company, is my favourite."
Also singled out for recognition was a photograph of three-year-old Skyla Trick, taken by her mother, Kristina.
The image shows the youngster on the beach at Rhu, near Helensburgh wearing a tartan coat.
A photograph by Glasgow-based artist Natalya Vahey featuring a pub crowd watching the football in a Byres Road bar in the city's west end came third in the contest.
