[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An extra £92m has been awarded to Kent County Council (KCC) to help it meet the need for more school places over the next three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money from the Department for Education is in addition to £27m already allocated for 2015-17.
The council has seen a "significant increase" in the demand for primary school places.
About 15,000 extra primary school places will be needed over the next five years, the council said.
Conservative councillor Roger Gough, KCC's cabinet member for education, said: "For the next few years the pressure will be predominantly for primary school places, but the need for extra secondary school places will then start to come through."
Seven new primary schools are being built at Knights Park in Tunbridge Wells, Kings Hill, Leybourne Chase and Holborough Quarry  - all in Tonbridge and Malling; and East Folkestone Primary in Shepway, and Thistle Hill Primary, in Swale.
Tunstall Primary, in Swale, is being relocated and expanded.
