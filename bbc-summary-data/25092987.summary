Ms Couric, a popular broadcaster who formerly hosted the CBS Evening News and co-hosted NBC's Today show, will be a "global anchor", beginning next year.
She will cover stories and be the "face of Yahoo News", Marissa Mayer said.
Yahoo's growing news operation has hired several high-profile journalists in recent months, including Matt Bai and David Pogue of the New York Times.
Ms Mayer said in a statement she was "incredibly excited" to welcome Ms Couric, 56, to Yahoo.
"I've always respected Katie for her thoughtful, charismatic approach to journalism," she wrote.
"[Ms Couric] will lead a growing team of correspondents at Yahoo News who will cover the world's most interesting stories and newsmakers."
Mr Pogue was a technology correspondent for the Times, and Mr Bai was chief political correspondent for the New York Times Magazine.
Yahoo also recently hired New York Times deputy news editor Megan Liberman.
In the quarter ended 30 September, Yahoo's revenue was down 5.2% from the previous year as it struggled to compete with Google and Facebook.
