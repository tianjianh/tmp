[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A total of 341 schools across Wales are set to get superfast broadband, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has announced.

The £5m project is being funded by the Welsh Government.
Orders for the new service are being placed, with the first delivery expected later this year.
Ms Williams said "I am committed to making sure all our schools have the infrastructure needed to prepare pupils for the modern world."
The new service should provide an immediate increase in speed.
Minimum broadband connections are currently of 10Mbps for primary schools in Wales and 100Mbps for secondary schools but some are not able to upgrade the speed of their services because of technical limitations.
"Superfast" is defined as providing download speeds of more than 24Mbps.
Ms Williams added: "Making sure every school, no matter where they are based, has access to superfast broadband remains a priority for me.
"It is simply unacceptable for a school to be at a significant disadvantage due to poor internet speeds."
