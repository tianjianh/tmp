The actor played James Bond in seven films in the franchise, including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill.
Other stars to pay tribute to Sir Roger included Russell Crowe, Mia Farrow and Sir Michael Caine, who said: "I am truly sad and think I will be in tears if I talk about him. Roger was the perfect gentlemen, adored by all his friends."
"Dear Sir Roger Moore, it is indeed with a heavy heart that I hear the news of your passing this morning.
"You were a big part of my life, from The Saint to James Bond... you were a magnificent James Bond and one that led the way for me.
"The world will miss you and your unique sense of humour for years to come. My sincerest condolences to your family and children. RIP.
