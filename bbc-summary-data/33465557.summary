More than 900 jobs are under threat at two seafood factories in Fraserburgh and Grantown on Spey.

Young's Seafood said it was looking to restructure after the loss of a major contract to supply salmon to supermarket chain Sainsbury's.
It is entering into a formal consultation with staff that would see the two bases close. The vast majority of the jobs are in Fraserburgh.
It would consolidate processing at other plants.
Young's is one of the biggest employers in Fraserburgh.
Chief executive Pete Ward said: "Today's announcement does not reflect on the skilled teams at Young's Fraserburgh and Spey Valley, who are committed, dedicated and continue to work hard through this time.
"This process will not be easy, but we have to face some tough decisions and we believe the proposals, outlined today, could deliver a significantly more sustainable manufacturing footprint than other potential consolidation options.
"As we move forward, we continue to be focused on providing our customers and consumers with high quality, good value, fish and seafood and we will talk, in detail, with employees about options for the future."
Young's said the proposal could also result in the transfer or creation of about 200 jobs across other sites in Grimsby, Livingston and Annan.
Fraserburgh's MSP Stewart Stevenson said the news "could not be more devastating".
He told BBC Scotland: "It's always been a factory where there's been considerable interest from elsewhere. We will want to explore every option for alternative uses."
Aberdeenshire Council's head of economic development, Belinda Miller, said: "This is obviously a significant blow to the area's economy and the ongoing regeneration of Fraserburgh.
"It is disappointing that one contract relating to salmon can have such an impact on the UK's largest white fish processing region and a significant section of its skilled workforce.
"Although the decision by Young's is hugely disappointing and unfortunate, we will continue to work with the firm where possible to investigate the options available."
