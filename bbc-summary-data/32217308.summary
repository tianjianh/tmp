The 26-year-old winger, who is 6ft 4ins, will join the club in the summer ahead of the 2015-16 season.
"I am really looking forward to joining Warriors and linking up with my new teammates in England," said Heem.
"I am excited about the prospect of joining a club which is progressing and look forward to playing a role in the long-term success."
Heem was a member of the New Zealand Sevens team between 2011 and 2014 during which he won a silver medal at last summer's Commonwealth Games.
The winger began his career at hometown club Auckland, and had a spell at Cambridge Blues before moving on to Tasman and then the Chiefs.
"Bryce has demonstrated his talents in a number of competitions," said Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan.
"He is now hungry to realise his potential at a club which has significantly changed its direction over the last 18 months.
"His season in Super Rugby has been a successful one and his presence at Sixways will give this squad another lift as we continue our progress."
Warriors, who recently won the British and Irish Cup, are chasing promotion back to the Premiership for next season and are currently second in the Championship, behind Bristol, having already secured their play-off place.
Worcester will also lose Argentina international captain Agustin Creevy at the end of the season as he joins up with the Argentina Rugby Federation for their inaugural Super Rugby season.
"I have immensely enjoyed my time at Sixways and I must say a huge thank you to Dean Ryan and all the backroom staff at the club for their support," said Creevy.
"It was an extremely tough decision to leave a club which is progressing so rapidly but I could not turn down the opportunity to return to Argentina ahead of the Rugby World Cup.
"As Argentina captain, Gus felt the opportunity to return to his home country was one he needed to take and we wish him every success in the future."
