Belfast barber retires from styling the stars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From toupees and bomb scares to giving Van Morrison a trim and chatting about jazz, Belfast Barber Frank Thompson has seen it all.

After nearly 60 years Frank, who owns a salon in Belfast city centre, is setting down his scissors.
His clients have included the poet, John Hewitt, and John de Chastelain who helped de-commission paramilitary arms in Northern Ireland.
Frank went into the business as a boy sweeping the salon floor.
Over the decades his family have dressed the heads of top politicians, actors, poets and pop stars.
Of the many famous follicles Frank has trimmed, some characters stand out.
"Van Morrison and me, we're roughly the same age and Van came in when I was about 18 or 19 and he actually taught me the love of jazz.
"He would always give me a couple of records."
Several generations of Frank's family have been barbers, with his great, great grandmother being the "first lady barber in Belfast".
The retiring barber said: "I'm a people person, I like to talk to people and also listen to people, you do an awful lot of listening.
"Sometimes it gets very deep if people are a bit depressed, but normally it's people who talk about football, and boxing and politics.
"But we never allow anyone to have an opinion on politics because you couldn't win in Northern Ireland, you would lose customers from both sides."
Another anecdote that Frank remembers typifies the black humour of Northern Ireland folk.
"There used to be a very famous newsreader over in England, I don't want to say a name, but he was the first one that wore a toupee on TV," he told the BBC.
"He was over here doing a story on Northern Ireland and we were the first barbers to do toupees.
"So, we're doing his toupee and there was a bomb scare and he wouldn't leave without it. We had his toupee off cleaning it.
"I had to literally grab him by the arm and push him down the stairs with the toupee and he's running up Castle Street with all the water round his face trying to get this toupee on in the middle of a bomb scare."
As Frank prepares for a life of leisure, he says he will miss the chat with his regulars.
"I often say to my wife, I think we're the poor man's psychiatrist," he said.
