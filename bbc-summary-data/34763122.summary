He was pronounced dead at 15:06 GMT on Thursday after officers had been called to Watling Gardens, in Shoot-Up Hill, Kilburn.
All three accused will appear at Hendon Magistrates' Court on Monday, police said.
The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, will appear alongside Ahmed El-Sayed, 20, from Kilburn, and Imaan Farjani, 18, from Willesden, the Met added.
