His assistant, Michael Brown, has been placed in temporary charge with the club 17th in the table and just six points above the relegation zone following a six-game winless run.
Ribeiro, 41, became Vale's first foreign boss when he took over in June.
But the Portuguese said the "project" was not working and he felt he had "let the club down".
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation," Ribeiro told the club website.
Vale managed just seven wins and only scored 26 goals in their 23 league matches since Ribeiro succeeded Rob Page as boss.
Chairman Norman Smurthwaite added: "Sadly the project that we undertook is not working and that is demonstrated by Monday's result.
"I have accepted Bruno's resignation, which highlights his humility and professionalism and I would like to thank him for his service and wish him all the best for the future."
Assistant boss Brown had earlier told BBC Radio Stoke that Ribeiro would be "hurting".
"He's got big pride and he'll be disappointed," said Brown.
"He's not the biggest of talkers to come out and express his feelings, but he certainly does inside. Knowing what he's like, he'll be on the laptop now working towards improving the squad and looking at how himself and his staff can improve."
