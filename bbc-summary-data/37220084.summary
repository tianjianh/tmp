Thieves have stripped the doors and bonnet off a marked Land Rover outside a police station.

The on-loan vehicle - part of an initiative to cut rural crime - was found damaged early on 26 August in Shenton Lane, Market Bosworth.
The model involved, a Defender, has become increasingly desirable since production stopped earlier this year.
Leicestershire Police confirmed the station, much of which was sold off in 2014, was not open at the time.
Enthusiast Tony Sinclair, who runs a Land Rover garage, said: "They are like big Meccano kits, they bolt together and come apart very easily.
"Doors and bonnets, along with seats, are very desirable because they can fit onto earlier models and make them look new.
"As the spares become more expensive, people start to look to cheaper places and the police colours will come off fairly easily."
Land Rover Defender
After initial examination, the four wheel drive vehicle was loaded on to a recovery truck and taken away.
Officers said they believed the theft had taken place between 23:00 BST on 25 August and 05:45 the following day.
Police said the station was not open 24 hours and was used as a "base" for patrols in the area.
An appeal for information has been issued.
