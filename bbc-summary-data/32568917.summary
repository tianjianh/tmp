Bakary Sako: Kenny Jackett expects Wolves winger to leave

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett is resigned to losing star winger Bakary Sako in the wake of the Championship club's failure to win promotion.

Sako, 27, is approaching the end of the three-year contract he signed when he joined from St Etienne in August 2012.
And Jackett accepts that the French-born Mali international will move on.
"It's certainly a possibility, with us staying in the Championship and him having offers to go elsewhere," he told BBC WM after a 4-2 win over Millwall.
"I feel that the board have done well to hold him this long. It would have been quite an easy decision to sell him a year ago and, by the looks of it now, he will move on as a free transfer.
"That's a big commitment by the board to keep him here and let him see out his contract, for which they need commending."
After scoring his 15th goal of the season in injury time to seal victory over Jackett's former club, Sako stayed on the pitch to say his farewells and was in tears as he threw his shirt into the Molineux crowd.
"I felt that it would be a big finish for him," said Jackett. "I could sense that that there would be some goals and a big effort. He is a fine all-round footballer who has been a good player for me.
"He knows that we would like to keep him, but to be honest it does look unrealistic. It does look like he will have offers from both home and abroad that will tempt him. I do fear that could be his last game."
Sako was part of the Wolves side relegated from the second tier in 2012-13, but scored 13 goals last term as Wanderers won the League One title.
He was named in this season's PFA Championship Team of the Year, although his performances were not enough to secure a second successive promotion as Wolves finished seventh in the table, missing out on the play-offs on goal difference.
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett was speaking to BBC WM's Mike Taylor.
