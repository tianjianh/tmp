Hinterland director calls for Welsh dramas to be bilingual

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More Welsh dramas should become bilingual, the director of Hinterland has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ed Thomas has encouraged more programmes to use both Welsh and English to reflect life across Wales.
Hinterland will broadcast its third bilingual season on 5 April, after the Welsh-language version Y Gwyll was shown on S4C last year.
He said the use of both languages in Hinterland represented the "Wales that we are familiar with".
The award-winning drama, filmed in Ceredigion, was originally an experiment to test programmes featuring both Welsh and English.
He said: "It's really worked and I think more people will do that this year - which is a good thing."
"There is definitely a place for showing and dramatising the reality of how we speak in Wales," he added.
"We have a fragile identity here in this old country of Wales, so if bilingualism makes that last longer, [it is a] good thing."
