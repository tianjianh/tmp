[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old, younger brother of Manchester United and England captain Wayne, will be with the Lions for the rest of the season.
He is a familiar figure to Guiseley, having netted twice against them in Wrexham's 3-2 win on 4 February.
Rooney has received international clearance in time to face Sutton United on Tuesday.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates had held talks with their top scorer as he was one start away from triggering a clause in his contract which would keep him at the Racecourse Ground next season.
A former Everton youngster like his elder brother, Rooney has also had spells at Macclesfield Town, Barnsley, Bury and Chester.
