A 63-year-old man facing rape and kidnap charges dating back to 1992 has pleaded not guilty at Nottingham Crown Court.

Christopher Scott, from Billesden Drive, in Heathfield, Nottingham, is charged with two counts of rape, one of kidnap and one of robbery.
He was bailed and must obey a curfew from 22:00 BST until 07:00 every day and attend a police station daily.
He will appear in court again on 4 November.
He is accused of dragging an 18-year-old woman standing at a bus stop in Mansfield Road, Nottingham, down an alleyway and forcing her into a car where she was sexually assaulted.
