Becky and Tim Morgan, who adopted a five-year-old boy, made the comments in support of the Too Old at 4? campaign to mark National Adoption Week.
The National Adoption Service for Wales (NAS) said it took about 15 months to place children aged four and over - double the time to place those younger.
"For us it has been a joy," said Mrs Morgan, 39.
"We were lucky enough to raise our two children from birth. We wanted to give a child who needed a family what our children had."
She added: "I think people assume if you adopt a baby or toddler it's going to be easier to bond or they will come with less problems.
"An older child might have had a traumatic background but you shouldn't assume it is going to be harder or have a less positive outcome for the child because that's not always the case."
The NAS, which was set up last year and is by local government, published figures in July which showed in 2014/15 it took on average 16.5 months to place a child for adoption in Wales, down from 26 months the previous year.
Operations director Suzanne Griffiths said: "We know that the average wait for children to be adopted in Wales has fallen, but it still takes longer to place older children."
A series of events are being held across Wales this week.
