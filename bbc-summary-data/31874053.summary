Plan for up to 117 new homes in Carrbridge turned down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan for up to 117 new homes on a site at Carrbridge in the Cairngorms National Park has been turned down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The park authority's planning committee said the land involved was earmarked for housing.
However, it added that the developer's three planning applications for the project were "not deemed to meet with a range of other planning policies".
Aviemore and Highland Developments Ltd, part of the Tulloch Homes Group, had sought approval for the scheme.
The housing project has been going through the planning process for more than 10 years.
Among the planning committee's reasons for refusal were that environmental impacts had not been fully assessed.
Rare red squirrels, capercaillie and wood ants had been recorded in the area.
Committee members were also told the village's Carr Road was unsuitable as an access for the majority of houses proposed.
Carrbridge, known for its 18th century packhorse bridge, has a population of about 700 people.
