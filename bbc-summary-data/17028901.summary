How insects see flowers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Have you ever wondered what a flower looks like to an insect?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The answer is that insects see things very differently from what us humans see.
An ultra-violet camera is being used to show the markings on flowers that attract pollinating insects.
A flower that might look plain to us looks completely different to an insect's eye. Check out the video above to have a look.
