A ballroom and sports facility on the former Greenham Common airbase has hosted its last event after the owners called time on the venue.

The former airbase buildings, now known as the Liberty Ballroom, are said to have hosted stars like Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash.
The Ceroc Black and White Ball was the final ever event held on Sunday.
The owner says no final decision has been made on the venue's future but it can no longer subsidise the operation.
Julian May, spokesman for Greenham Common Trust, said: "We understand that many residents, and particularly the dancing community in Newbury and surrounding areas, feel deeply attached to the building.
"A conservative estimate to repair the ballroom roof and building could be approaching £500,000 to £750,000, along with significant annual maintenance costs.
"It would be wrong of us to pour money into one amenity that needs a great deal of work and is sadly beyond its economic life, when that same amount could be used to help many other local charitable causes."
Harry Cobb, director of Liberty Newbury, which leases the ballroom from the trust, said: "On a monthly basis, when there are a lot of good events, we can get upwards of 2,000 people through the doors, if not 3,000.
"We have tried our best and we have invested significant amounts but, without the help and support of the trust, it's just not feasible for us as a limited company to invest those sums in the premises."
Steph Guyatt, who met her husband Steve at the venue on 24 December five years ago, said: "We are genuinely devastated, not just for ourselves... it's a place where you have an age range of 20s through to their 80s - you wouldn't get that in the pubs or the restaurant culture in Newbury.
"There are a lot of elderly people who come and dance with us who wouldn't go out normally. We feel if that's lost to them they'll end up back in their homes and isolated the same as so many other people and that's what we're trying to avoid as a society."
The complex of buildings, which first sprang up on the former airbase in the late 1950s and early 1960s, has evolved over the years and includes a sports hall and a competition-grade maple-sprung dancefloor.
It was reopened as the Liberty Ballroom in 1994, two years after the military left the site, and taken over by Liberty Newbury in 2013.
Trevor Banning remembers the venue during the days of the military.
He said: "I was a Greenham boy. I grew up at Greenham and my mum met her second husband at the Liberty Ballroom - or The Bar as it was at the time - in 1981. As a result, I spent a lot of my youth, particularly from the age of 13 to 15, in and around that building."
Ballroom regular Mo Stoner said: "It was handed back from the US to the Ministry of Defence in 1993 and since then it's been once of those venues you always go to - it's got an amazing floor - it's just once of those venues you can't replace.
"It's just a shame because there are 700, maybe 900 members but you just get 100 people turning up on a regular basis.
"Until you've lost it, you don't know what you've lost."
