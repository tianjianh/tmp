The event, organised by Hindus in Leicester, took place at a farm in Groby, created on land donated by a Hare Krishna temple.
Home-made jaggery sweets and organic vegetables were offered to cows at the farm in thanks for the milk they produce.
Officials said the idea was to offer "love and respect" to the animals.
Pradyumna Das, temple president of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Leicester, said: "Cows are especially revered by Hindus all over the world, and on this day we offer them thanks, love, and respect for what they offer to us."
The ceremony was part of Diwali festivities in Leicester, one of the largest events of its kind held outside of India.
Hindus regard cows as sacred and milk production at the farm follows the teaching of Ahimsa, which is often translated as non-violence.
In conventional farms, male calves born to dairy cows are normally killed or sold for meat, while female cows are killed when they get older and cannot produce as much milk.
The Ahimsa Dairy Foundation said cows could live up to the age of 20.
The foundation said its mantra was that "no cow, calf or bull in our herd will ever be killed and are allowed to live out their lives in their entirety".
