Arsenal, who will play in a record 29th FA Cup semi-final, face Manchester City in the other last-four tie.
Both semi-finals will be played at Wembley on the weekend of 22 and 23 April.
Chelsea knocked out holders Manchester United in a hard-fought 1-0 win on Monday, with Spurs thrashing League One side Millwall on Sunday.
Arsenal, who lifted the trophy in 2014 and 2015, proved too good for non-league Lincoln City in a 5-0 home win on Saturday.
Manchester City are playing in the semi-finals for the first time in four seasons after beating Middlesbrough in a 2-0 away win.

"Tottenham have given Chelsea problems this season and it is a London derby too so gives it an edge," said former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard, speaking as a BBC Match of the Day pundit after the Blues' quarter-final win.
"They are two very form teams but I think Chelsea are slight favourites as it stands."
Former England striker Alan Shearer added: "When the big boys joined in the FA Cup it got off to a slow start with teams resting players.
"But now there are four big hitters left and they are two semi-finals to look forward to."
