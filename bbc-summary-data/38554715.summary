[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bagpipe-playing busker who duped people into thinking he was collecting for a Hillsborough charity has been jailed for four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angus Carpenter, 62, from Liverpool, was found guilty of fraud after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court in December.
He played with a Hillsborough Justice Campaign banner on his bagpipes on 14 April 2015, the day before the 26th anniversary of the disaster.
The judge said it was "a careful calculation" on the charity and date.
Recorder Michael Smith said it was a "mean-spirited offence" where Carpenter, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, deliberately misled the public.
During the trial, Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he gave Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice.
Carpenter, who denied the charge and was cleared of two others, maintained he was busker and the banner was simply a tribute.
On sentencing, the judge told him: "While you might think you have done nothing wrong, the people of Liverpool might think differently."
Ninety-six people died following a crush at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.
In April, an inquest jury concluded the fans were unlawfully killed.
