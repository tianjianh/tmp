A water company has apologised to customers who complained their kettles were "popping" when boiling water.

People in West Cumbria reported concerns about the noise.
United Utilities said the sound was caused by a change in the water supply which blended soft water from Ennerdale with harder water from boreholes near Egremont.
Joyce from Cleator Moor, said: "I did get a shock. I thought my kettle was going to blow up."
She said she was "a bit frightened to put it on" for fear of an explosion.
"But as long as it's safe we're fine. I was going to go and buy a new one, but there you go, we're fine," Joyce added.
The company said the popping noise was due to tiny bubbles forming and collapsing as the water boils and caused by the slightly harder water.
A spokesman said the water supply "meets all water quality standards" and apologised if it had "caused concern".
Areas affected are Workington, Whitehaven, Disington, Cleator Moor, Moresby, Egremont, Frizington, Seascale, Gosforth, Bootle, St Bees and Ennerdale Bridge.
Abstracting water from Ennerdale will cease once the new Â£300m pipeline linking West Cumbria to Thirlmere Reservoir is complete, United Utilities said.
The work is expected to be completed in 2022.
