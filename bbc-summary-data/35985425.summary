[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Salt, 22, who has been described as being in a fragile mental state, was dropped off in Portsmouth on Monday.
He said he was going to visit a friend but failed to return home the next day.
Brittany Ferries have confirmed he travelled to the port of St Malo. His mother, who is now in France, called his actions "totally out of character".
Mr Salt had his passport and Â£25 in cash but did not take his wallet or mobile phone when he boarded the ferry.
Relatives said they have no idea why he has travelled to the country but said he may be in a vulnerable state.
Hampshire Police have sent a missing person's report to their French counterparts and the British Embassy has been informed.
French police have confirmed they are investigating the matter.
Mr Salt's mother, who lives in Widley in Portsmouth, has travelled to St Malo with his grandmother, in an attempt to find him.
