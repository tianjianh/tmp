The retailer's site at Tinsley employs 72 people and is to close in October, a statement has confirmed.
The company is to create 50 new jobs at an existing site in Logic Park, Leeds, which opened last year and already has 65 staff.
It said it hoped partners at the Tinsley site would apply for these roles or others within the business.
The John Lewis store in Sheffield is unaffected by this announcement and will remain open.
