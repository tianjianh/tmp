Berry steered in George Maris' cross to put the U's ahead inside five minutes.
The midfielder doubled the advantage from the penalty spot after he was hauled down in the box, before slotting in his third shortly after.
The 24-year-old tapped in late on to complete the scoring, as Coventry slumped to a fourth straight defeat.
The Sky Blues, who won the FA Cup in 1987, have now been knocked out of the competition by a team from a lower division in each of the past three seasons.
Former Barnsley midfielder Berry was the hero for Cambridge, wrapping up his hat-trick inside 38 minutes and then adding his 12th goal of the season after the break.
