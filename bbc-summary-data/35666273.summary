More than 90 men had stormed the main gate on Thursday and overwhelmed prison guards at Buimo jail in Lae, the second-biggest city.
Most are still on the run and the authorities are warning of a rise in criminal activity in the coming weeks.
The jail break is the second in as many years at Buimo. Last year more than 50 escaped in a similar incident.
Lae Metropolitan Superintendent Anthony Wagambie told local media that besides those shot dead, at least another 17 prisoners were wounded and recaptured on Friday.
"I am warning the general public to be cautious on their movements and take necessary precautions. I am anticipating a rise in criminal activities in the city with the large number of escapees on the run," he told reporters.
The impoverished nation of Papua New Guinea continues to struggle with lawlessness, which the World Bank says has hampered its development.
