"We can confirm that we are beginning preparations for the production of The Great British Bake Off Series eight," said a spokesman for Love Productions.
"The precursor to every series is to find the next batch of wonderful bakers," the show's makers continued.
Paul Hollywood is the only celebrity participant who has agreed to stay with  follow the show from the BBC to its new home.
Fellow judge Mary Berry and hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins left the show after the BBC lost the rights to broadcast it.
Berry, though, is maintaining her connection to Love Productions by appearing in Bake Off's US sister programme, The Great American Baking Show.
Amateur bakers who are "crazy about croissants" and "passionate about pies" have been invited to apply through Love Productions' website.
The closing date for applications is 8 January.
The Great British Bake Off will make its final appearance on BBC One this month in a Christmas edition featuring bakers from previous series.
