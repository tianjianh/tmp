Cameron: Holyrood can become a powerhouse parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The prime minister has said that Holyrood can become a ''powerhouse parliament'' but the SNP must spell out how it plans to use its new powers.

David Cameron said the UK government had delivered on the so-called ''Vow'' and was now moving ahead with the Scotland Bill at Westminster.
Speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the Conservative conference, he said the SNP had to stop arguing about process.
He said: "The SNP cannot point to a part of the Vow that hasn't been kept."
Mr Cameron said the tangible benefits of last year's referendum and the vote against independence were that the UK was ''stronger together'' and that Scotland was benefitting from a growing economy.
He said 175,000 jobs had been created in Scotland over the past five years.
"There was clear result in the referendum but as we said during that campaign, people in Scotland would get the best of both worlds - part of the United Kingdom but with a powerhouse parliament in Edinburgh", he said.
"That is what we are delivering, and the Scotland Bill as promised has been making its way very, very swiftly through parliament to fulfil all those pledges in full."
Ahead of his party's conference, which begins in Manchester this weekend, Mr Cameron said it was "crucial" that the Scottish Parliament took up the powers it will get in April and when the Scotland Bill gets through.
He said: "I think what we now need to hear from the Scottish National Party is how they intend to use the powers.
"I get frustrated sometimes that the debate is always about the process. We have delivered on every aspect of the process, the SNP cannot point to a part of the Vow that hasn't been kept.
"We promised there would be power to have welfare powers - it is there.
"We promised there would be power to have tax powers - they are there.
"The Vow has been delivered. Now we need to hear from Scotland's politicians - well, how do you use these powers? What sort of different taxes, different welfare arrangements do people want to put in place?
"It is the outcome that matters rather than the process."
The prime minister also defended plans to curtail the voting rights of Scottish MPs at Westminster, so-called English votes for English laws, saying it was a matter of fairness.
He said: "What we are planning to do is just have a fair system where, when it is English issues, that the English MPs have the decisive say.
"I think it is only fair in a devolved system where you have a powerhouse parliament in Scotland where quite rightly on Scottish housing, on Scottish health, Scottish education, English and Welsh MPs have no say whatsoever."
Mr Cameron re-affirmed that the UK government would go ahead with a ''like-for-like'' replacement for Trident with four new nuclear submarines.
The submarine fleet and missles are based at Faslane on the Clyde.
He said it was  the ''only way for a credible deterrent''.
Mr Cameron said what Labour and the SNP did was up to them, but he described new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's stance as ''complete and utter chaos''.
He said: "Britain's  national secuirty would be at complete risk if Labour got anywhere near government."
