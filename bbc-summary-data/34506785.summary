Plans for Cardiff transport overhaul considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Major overhauls to transport routes in Cardiff are being considered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is consulting on plans to introduce a cycle lane on Pontcanna's Cathedral Road, make some streets one-way and removing a traffic island.
It comes as part of the 2015-16 local transport plan, which proposes new cycle lanes across the city, 20mph speed restrictions, crossings and park and ride improvements.
The council aims for 50% of trips to be made by sustainable modes by 2026.
The Cathedral Road project is part of a wider north west Cardiff bus corridor scheme, to improve journey time and reliability so more people are encouraged to use buses.
The council estimates Cardiff's population will increase by nearly a quarter over 25 years, resulting in a 32% increase in traffic and 20% increase in commuters.
The plans include measures to re-allocate space on the roads to cyclists and remove on-street parking on the approach to junctions. There are also plans to add bus lanes and improve signage.
