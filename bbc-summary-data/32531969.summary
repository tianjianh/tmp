And it is almost 20 years since the most famous of them all - ex-Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan's "love it" outburst directed at then Manchester United manager Ferguson.
Here are some of the best boss rants, but be warned, they contain language which may be considered offensive.
Newcastle led the Premier League by 12 points at one stage in the 1995-96 season but lost the title to Manchester United.
As the Red Devils pulled their way back into the title hunt, Ferguson questioned how motivated the Magpies' opponents were.
Keegan responded with this  outburst on live television: "I've kept really quiet but I'll tell you something, he went down in my estimations when he said that. We have not resorted to that. You can tell him now, we're still fighting for this title and he's got to go to Middlesbrough and get something.
"And I'll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it."
In the 2008-09 season Liverpool were leading the league when Benitez launched a  furious attack on Manchester United counterpart Ferguson.
Benitez claimed Ferguson received preferential treatment from the football authorities.
"I want to talk about facts," said Benitez. "All managers need to know is that only Mr Ferguson can talk about the fixtures, can talk about referees - and nothing happens."
Liverpool ended up losing the league to United and Benitez left Anfield within 14 months.
Joe Kinnear launched into an explicit rant after just four days in charge as Newcastle manager.
Kinnear, walking into a news conference: "Which one is Simon Bird?"
Bird, a Daily Mirror journalist: "Me."
Kinnear: "You're a ****."
Bird: "Thank you."
Kinnear: Which one is [Niall] Hickman [Daily Express]? You are out of order. Absolutely ******* out of order. If you do it again, I am telling you you can **** off and go to another ground. I will not come and stand for that ****** ****. No ****** way, lies. **** you're saying I turned up and they ****** off.

Redknapp: "I am not making my name as a wheeler ******* dealer, don't say that I'm a ******* football manager."

Sitton was co-manager of Second Division strugglers Leyton Orient in 1994-95. A documentary crew were following the team during the campaign and were in the dressing room at half-time of a game at Blackpool when Sitton unleashed this diatribe at two players:
"You, you little ****, when I tell you to do something - and you, you ******* big **** - when I tell you to do something, do it," he said.
"And if you come back at me we can have a right sort out in here, all right? And yer can pair up if yer like, and you can ******* pick someone to help yer, and yer can bring yer dinner n' all. Cos by the time I've finished with yer, you'll ******* need it.
"Do you ******* hear what I'm saying or not?"
Atkinson went on the warpath when Sky interviewers Richard Keys and Andy Gray suggested he could not save Coventry from relegation following a 1-0 defeat at Southampton.
"You can sit there and play with all your silly machines. If the boys play badly I'll whip 'em, but I ain't whipping them for that. Thanks lads, goodnight."

Clough: "As a critic I'm far more qualified than you or any of your colleagues, I suggest you shut up and show more football."
The former Italy international, then manager of Greek club OFI Crete, swore at journalists following criticism of his side.
"OFI is not Real Madrid, is not Barcelona. It's a small team with many problems. I want my players to play with balls, with heart," he said.
"I no like the excuse that maybe the players don't play with heart because [the club] no pay salary. **** off - this not true."
The then Crystal Palace manager lost his cool about other clubs being linked with a move for winger Wilfried Zaha.
"I'm sick and fed up of reading about him, get a job, get a life," he said.
Redknapp lost the plot when he was hit by a stray ball from one of his players in training while being interviewed on television.
"Why the **** did you kick that over here? You tried to kick it in the goal and you hit me? Get some ******* brains, will you? [To reporter] It's no wonder he's in the ******* reserves."
Ferguson attempted to ban a journalist who asked him about Ryan Giggs at Manchester United's pre-Champions League final news conference in 2011.
His whispered conversation with the United press officer was picked up on the microphones.
Ferguson: "The guy that asked the question about Giggsy... the press conference."
Press officer: "Which one?"
Ferguson: "Him that asked the question... who?"
Press officer: "Oh yeah. I'll tell you later."
Ferguson: "Is he coming on Friday?"
Press officer: "The guy with the laptop?"
Ferguson: "Aye. Then we'll get him. Ban him on Friday."

Journalist: "I will turn it off in a minute, thought I'd let it ring out."

That was the fate suffered by BBC Scotland's John Barnes in 2000 when he asked legendary former Dundee United manager - then chairman - Jim McLean about the future of boss Alex Smith.
McLean didn't like the question so stepped menacingly towards Barnes and, out of shot, he is then said to have struck Barnes on the face with his fist, leaving the reporter bleeding from a cut lip.
