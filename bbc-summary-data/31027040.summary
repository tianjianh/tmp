[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teen guilty of burglary of pensioner, 90, who later died

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A schoolboy has been found guilty of burgling the home of a 90-year-old widow who suffered a stroke within hours and later died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old, who cannot be named, had downed a litre of vodka when he called at the Swansea home of Jean Thyer on 28 September last year.
He admitted stealing the pensioner's purse but had denied burglary during his trial at Swansea Crown Court.
Sentencing was adjourned until 13 February for reports to be prepared.
During the trial, the court heard Mrs Thyer was found collapsed at her home in Killay, Swansea, the morning after the teenager's late evening visit.
The regular church-goer, who had lived at her address for over 50 years, died in hospital within a few days.
Jurors heard the teenager, who was 15 at the time, claimed he called at the victim's home because he was lost, and had no intention of burglary.
He claimed he stole her purse "on the spur of the moment," running off as the widow was on the phone calling a neighbour for help.
But a jury took just four hours to reject that version of events and unanimously found him guilty.
