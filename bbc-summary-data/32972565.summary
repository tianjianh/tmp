[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 32-year-old barman has appeared in court in County Armagh charged with the murder of professional boxer Eamonn Magee Jr.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orhan Koca, who is Turkish and whose address was given as no fixed abode, denied stabbing the 22 year old to death.
Mr Magee was visiting a friend in Summerhill Park, Twinbrook, on Saturday.
He had stepped out to check on a pizza delivery  when he was attacked.
Mr Magee was the son of former WBU welterweight champion Eamonn Magee Sr.
He had followed his father into the boxing ring and had a promising career ahead of him. He was also studying engineering at university.
Eamonn Magee Sr was at Craigavon Magistrates Court on Tuesday and was supported by friends and relatives.
The court was told Mr Koca, a father of three young children, had consistently denied murder from the moment of his arrest and throughout 19 police interviews.
A defence solicitor said he intended to apply for bail in four weeks' time.
"There is a full acknowledgement that this was a truly horrific crime. To have a child taken away in such brutal circumstances is the worst thing that can happen to a parent," the solicitor said.
Mr Koca, who was dressed in a grey tracksuit, sat in the dock with his arms folded and was flanked by two prison guards. At times, he looked towards Mr Magee Snr.
He answered loudly and clearly "Yes" when asked by the court clerk to confirm his identity.
A prosecuting lawyer said bail would be opposed in all circumstances.
A detective inspector told the court he believed he could connect Mr Koca to the charges.
He also said further forensic tests would be carried out on the suspected murder weapon that police believe they recovered in searches in and around the Twinbrook area.
Mr Koca was remanded in custody until 29 June.
