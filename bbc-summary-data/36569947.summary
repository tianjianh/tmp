Roy Hodgson: England manager's contract depends on Euro 2016 success - Greg Dyke

Manager Roy Hodgson's contract will be renewed if England "do well" and "play well" at Euro 2016, says Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.

England face Slovakia at 20:00 BST on Monday knowing victory will secure a place in the last 16 in France.
Hodgson's deal expires at the end of the tournament, and the 68-year-old has indicated he would like to remain in charge for the World Cup in 2018.
"Clearly if you get to semi-finals, that's success," Dyke told Sportsweek.

"If we've played well and unfortunately lost against a good team or on penalties [in the quarter-finals] then that's a discussion that will go on."
Dyke, 69, said the FA had been clear with Hodgson that a decision would not be made until the end of the tournament.
Dyke, who will leave his post this month, reiterated his belief England should aim to win the 2022 World Cup.
"2022 is a realistic objective. We have a very young side now. If we can hold the younger players together and bring in some others," he added.
Hodgson was relaxed when asked about his future at a news conference on Sunday afternoon following Dyke's comments.
"It's been raised many times before. It doesn't make any difference one way or another," said Hodgson, who was appointed in May 2012, shortly before the European Championships.
"My contract runs out after this tournament - that's a fact everyone has known about for the last two years. On a regular basis it gets brought up. Should I stay? Do I want to stay? What should the FA do?
"Nothing changes in that respect. For myself and the players there is only one thing on our minds and that's to win the next game and see how far we can go.
"One day, after our stay here ends, the FA will need to make a decision with what they want to do in regards to the future."
Dyke is concerned that the increasingly "international" nature of the Premier League has led to a lack of home-grown players and managers.
He cited 18-year-old striker Marcus Rashford's rise from Manchester United academy prospect to the England senior squad as an example.
"Rashford came from nowhere," he said. "I suspect there are other Rashfords out there who never get a chance to play in the Premier League."
Of the 20 top-flight clubs, only five have an English manager, and Dyke said Hodgson's successor may be foreign.
"You will want someone who has managed in England and understands English football," he said. "That doesn't mean they have to be English."
The Football Union of Russia was fined 150,000 euros (Â£119,000) following violent scenes during the 1-1 draw against England in their Euro 2016 opener in Marseille.
Uefa warned both countries that any further trouble involving their supporters at matches will result in expulsion.
Groups of Russian fans have been deported from France following violent clashes police blamed on 150 "well-trained" hooligans.
Russia is set to host the World Cup in two years' time, and Dyke is confident the tournament will go ahead.
"You can't hold Russia to account because a bunch of organised thugs got together and caused mayhem in a particular place," he said.
