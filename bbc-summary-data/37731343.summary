Andrew Broadhead, 42, and eight-year-old Kiera died in the blaze at their home in Ash Crescent, Stanley, Wakefield on Wednesday.
Police believe an "accelerant was poured through the letterbox".
In a statement, his wife Sara said he saved her life and rescued their eldest daughter before going back in.
Police think the arsonist may have been injured because the fire took hold so quickly and continue to appeal for anyone with information to come forward.
Mrs Broadhead, 35, thanked the local community for the "kindness and support" they have been shown.
She said: "Andy was a brave hero who managed to save the lives of his wife and eldest daughter.
"Unfortunately he couldn't save our youngest daughter Kiera and gave his own life trying to save hers.
"He was a very kind man and Kiera was a vibrant, independent loving girl. Our whole family are absolutely devastated by their loss."
Firefighters were called to the scene of the blaze at about 04:20 BST on Wednesday.
An online fundraising campaign to help support the family has raised more than Â£8,000.
