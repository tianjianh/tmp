[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mutual to run Flintshire leisure and library services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flintshire council is to change the way it delivers library and leisure services in a bid to save money and jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Its cabinet has backed plans to establish an employee-led mutual to deliver the services from 2017.
The suggested benefits include budget savings of up to 30%, while retaining the current range of facilities and services.
It is also hoped that any staff redundancies will be minimised.
The plans cover the community asset transfer of Connah's Quay Swimming Pool and Holywell Leisure Centre.
Cambrian Aquatics will take on Connah's Quay Swimming Pool from 30 May and plans are being developed by Holywell community for a similar transfer of the leisure centre.
Speaking after the meeting, councillor Cllr Kevin Jones, cabinet member for leisure, said the presentation of the employee-led mutual model was "very well received" by the cabinet, which recognised that staff are "fully engaged and confident" about it being the right way forward.
The plans will be brought back to cabinet before final approval.
