Home Office minister Lord Bates said the total cost to the end of June was £10.1 million, with another £2 million budgeted for the next year.
Madeleine was three when she went missing from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz eight years ago.
Last year Met Police officers went to Portugal to continue investigations.
Detectives observed Portuguese police questioning 11 "people of interest".
Lord Bates disclosed the full cost of the investigation in an answer to a written parliamentary question from Lord Black of Brentwood.
"The total cost of the investigation in to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (Operation Grange), up until end of June 2015, is £10.1m. The Home Office has budgeted £2m for the investigation in 2015/16," he said.
"The Home Office funds this work from the special grant budget.
"The level of funding provided to the Metropolitan Police in relation to this investigation is reviewed regularly and will continue to be monitored."
The Met's Operation Grange was set up in 2011 after Prime Minister David Cameron asked the force to "bring their expertise" to the inquiry following a request from Kate and Gerry McCann.
A spokesman for Madeleine McCann's parents, Kate and Gerry, said they were "incredibly grateful" to the police for their investigation, and to the prime minister and the Home Office for "making it possible".
