[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey 11 plus could be scrapped from 2019

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 11 plus exam could end in 2019 under an overhaul of Guernsey's secondary education system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals include replacing the college grants with bursaries and creating one States-run secondary school spread across four sites.
The department has dismissed suggestions of closing one of its four secondary schools and called for the rebuild of two schools to go ahead.
The selective system was criticised in two reviews released in 2012.
Education Department proposals
The review of secondary education found a lack of accountability and called for the creation of school governing bodies, while in the primary sector it found reading ability had declined.
Education Minister Robert Sillars said: "[The 11 plus] is not an appropriate way to determine the future of our children's secondary education.
"It fails to deliver equality of opportunity, fairness or the sort of social mobility that was originally intended."
The written exams assess academic potential and help decide which pupils are offered places at the Grammar School or the grant-supported colleges.
Deputy Sillars said: "We have designed our own solution for Guernsey. We do not have to slavishly follow what they do elsewhere.
"We are aiming to keep what is good about our education system but address some of the problems of inequality and fairness presented by our current selective process."
The Treasury and Resources Department has questioned the lack of costings in the report and suggests the costs of an executive head teacher and increased transport spending would see costs rise to Â£3.5m above current levels.
It said there was an "absence of compelling evidence" the proposals offer value to the Guernsey taxpayer.
The department has previously advocated the closure of one secondary school and increasing the size of the other three.
The proposals will be debated by the States in March.
