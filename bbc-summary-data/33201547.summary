The plane, which has two versions, was showcased for the first time at the Paris Air Show.
On Thursday, the CS300 arrived in Belfast from Paris and was greeted by a water canon salute at George Best Belfast City Airport.
Wings for the aircraft are manufactured in Belfast.
The CSeries jets will go into service with airlines next year.
Finance Minister Arlene Foster and Employment Minister Stephen Farry said it was a proud moment for Bombardier and its staff.
Around 800 jobs in Belfast will be supported when the CSeries goes into full production.
But orders stalled since last September and, to date, are short of company targets.
