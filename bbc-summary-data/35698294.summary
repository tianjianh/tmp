[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Irish hooker Tom Cruse has agreed a deal to join Premiership rivals Wasps at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cruse has made six appearances for Irish, having signed from Championship club Rotherham Titans in April 2015.
The 26-year-old started his career at Stockport and has also had spells with Macclesfield and Sale.
"Tom is a young, mobile hooker and we know there's plenty more to come from him as he's still maturing," Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said.
"Tom was the standout hooker in the Championship last season while playing for Rotherham Titans and he's also impressed every time he's put on the shirt for London Irish this season."
