Eilish McColgan focused on Rio as injury ruins 2015

Eilish McColgan says the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are "now more than ever" her goal after revealing she is unlikely to race again this year.

McColgan, 24, broke her ankle in January and has suffered a setback in her return from injury.
"Initially, we believed this injury would be a small blip in the road meaning six weeks off from running," McColgan wrote in a training blog.
"Sadly, the fracture has fully extended."
The Scot competed at London 2012 in the 3000m steeplechase, failing to make the final, and came sixth in the same event at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
She said: "There is nothing I can do except rest and attempt to let the bone heal as impacting the joint will continue to open the fracture.
"The healing becomes less likely as time goes on, so shortly I will find out whether I need to undergo surgery in order to force the bone to heal.
"Hopefully from September I can slowly build up my training again. A completely injury-free, illness-free, winter is going to be central to my preparation for 2016 and many athletes struggle to achieve that.
"Rio 2016 will come round before any of us realise and at the end of the day the Olympic Games is the pinnacle. All the hard work, dedication, and sacrifices are purely for the Olympics. Every athlete wants to be a part of it.
"My event choice is still under question - perhaps a move to the 5000m or 10,000m will be more feasible after foot surgery, rather than risking injury over the steeplechase in such an important year."
