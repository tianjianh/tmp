The Canada-based side will be coached by former Leigh boss Paul Rowley, while ex-Great Britain coach Brian Noble has been appointed as head of rugby.
On Monday, former Leeds Rhinos prop Jamie Peacock revealed he had nearly signed for the newly formed club.
They will be the second overseas team to play in League 1, along with French side Toulouse.
The Wolfpack will play home games in four-week or five-week blocks before heading over to Europe for a similar length of time for a series of away games.
Teams visiting Toronto's Lamport Stadium home, who will have their expenses covered by the Canadian side, will fly out on Thursday, play on Saturday and return home on Sunday.
"We have worked closely with the Canadian club's officials and investors in the last few years and have no doubts that Toronto Wolfpack will enhance a competition which has already established a reputation for welcoming new clubs," RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said.
"Rugby league has always had a pioneering philosophy throughout its history and this initiative offers further evidence of the sport's wide appeal and readiness to embrace innovation."
As well as looking to recruit experienced players currently playing in the third tier and the Championship, the Canadian team are participating in a reality TV series called "Last Tackle" to unearth players from North America.
Wolfpack chief executive Eric Perez added: "Sports fans have long waited for a trans-Atlantic major league team and we're proud to be the first with the launch of our club, the Toronto Wolfpack."
