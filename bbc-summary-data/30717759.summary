Celebrity Big Brother: Our Predictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fourteen celebrities have entered the Big Brother House, among them... glamour models, it-girls and a 90s pop star.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We all know anything can happen in Celeb Big Brother, but we've made some predictions for each of this year's contestants.
Here's what we think:
Camila "Cami Li" Figueras
Our money is firmly on Cami Li for this one and it's a no-brainer really.
The model and ex-fiance of Towie's Kirk Norcross (himself an ex-CBB contestant) admits: "I'll be like, 'I've arrived, look at me, look at these titties and this ass.'
"People are so conservative and when they look at me I'm like, 'I work out to look good naked.'
"I don't care what they say. You were born naked so why not?"
With that attitude, she's likely to fill the tabloids over the next few days or weeks, but we don't reckon we've got a winner on our hands.
Chloe Goodman
She may be a glamour model, but sorry to disappoint, Chloe Goodman is promising not to be "that girl".
The "Ex on the Beach" contestant, who was once linked to Towie's Mario Falcone, says getting naked on the show is "so obvious".
She says: "Shove a young girl in a bikini and just prance around. I'd like to think I've got a little bit more to myself than that.
"Obviously I will have to get in a bikini at least once because there is a hot tub, but I won't just do it for attention."
She's being dubbed the hottest contestant this year but reckons: "People will realise that I'm not the sexy one when I get comfortable.
"I'll have my hair up, no make-up on, sweats on. Probably burping."
Lovely.
Katie Hopkins
The ex-Apprentice candidate has been described as "the most hated woman in Britain". And she says she's not out to show viewers another side to her personality.
"I haven't got a thing to prove, I'm not trying to show people that I'm nice," she says. "I'm just going in to do 'Katie'."
The best she's hoping for?
"People might think that actually Katie isn't a bitch 100% of the time. I think there is a funnier side to me, but equally I may come out as the biggest bitch in Britain again and that is also totally acceptable."
She's sure to be the centre of many an argument inside the CBB house. And let's just hope she doesn't consider any of her housemates overweight as she warns: "I have no empathy for a fat person."
Alicia Douvall
The plastic surgery-loving model is hoping not to get into any "major arguments" but admit's she probably will, saying, "I love a good argument, I'm the first one there".
And with Katie Hopkins in the mix, the chances of Alicia getting into a barney are even bigger.
"I definitely do not want to be in a house with her," she says of her fellow contestant.
Uh oh, we see how this could end.
And there could be friction with her ex Calum Best who she'll be forced to spend time with in the house this year.
Alicia also claims "I don't cook and I don't clean". We all know where that attitude gets you in the Big Brother house.
Calum Best
Let's face it. He's a bit of a stud.
He's had a string of famous girlfriends and won Celebrity Love Island in 2006 (if you don't remember it, imagine CBB on an island where celebs are encouraged to hook up - a winning formula).
He's admitted he's open to the idea of hitting it off with someone in the CBB house, saying, "If there is a girl and something evolves organically then I like the idea of going in there and getting on with somebody, but it isn't a focus of mine.
"My focus is going in there and making some cool friends, having some banter and if something organically came about then let it be".
He could always rekindle the romance with ex Alicia Douvall, but our money is on Chloe Goodman.
Jeremy Jackson
The American actor played the part of David Hasslehoff's son in Baywatch in the 1990s, so look out for the red swimming trunks in the hot tub which he says he's got with him.
We reckon this guy's going to enjoy being in the Big Brother House.
He says: "I'm eager to go and live it. I like to have fun with everything I do. I was thinking maybe we should all write a song in there."
And why the devil not?
"I'm just going to go in, roll the dice and see what happens," he says.
Sounds like perfect housemate material.
Perez Hilton
Celebrity blogger, turned Celebrity Big Brother contestant Perez Hilton, is promising to bring not one, but two personalities into the house.
He says: "People will discover the difference between the persona and the character and the person."
He's even brought fun outfits "that Perez would wear but I wouldn't".
What's more, he could give Big Brother a run for his money, saying, "I see right through people who play games. I invented the game. I know how to bend the rules. I've already bent the rules".
We have no idea how, but we're eager to find out.
Anthony Kavanagh AKA Kavana
If you don't remember singing heart-throb Kavana from the 90s, you might remember him from reality show The Big Reunion last year.
These days though, he enjoys a more laid back lifestyle saying for him, "getting a good night's sleep is very important".
But that could be a bit of a challenge in the Big Brother bedroom.
"I'm quite a light sleeper and it worries me that with all those other people in one room there will be snoring, if I'm not asleep and someone starts then I'll be awake counting every snore," he says.
If he does get to sleep though, he admits he's likely to snore himself. Slightly hypocritical.
And when he's not snoring, he reckons he'll be embarrassing himself by singing in the shower.
Keith Chegwin
He has a reputation for being a nice guy, although he admits he does get angry sometimes (if you don't know who he is, ask your mum).
But Cheggers reckons the rage would only last a minute, saying, "I can't be bothered".
He's planning on well and truly keeping out of any rows.
"Let them fight," he says. "Mediation is fantastic but it's not my job to do it."
He's the favourite to win but isn't counting his chickens just yet.
"We all have preconceptions about who will win. Who would have thought Jim Davidson would win, or Gary Busey? You just don't know," he says. "The public will decide."
True that.
Patsy Kensit
She's been an actress, singer and model, but Patsy Kensit is probably best known as an It-girl and Liam Gallagher's ex.
But she's promising not to spill the beans about her celeb friends or the Oasis singer.
"It's like a doctor discussing their patient," she says.
"Maybe there is a time and a place to talk about things, but this is not really the right environment."
All she will say on Liam is: "We have got an amazing child and everything is cool. Our lives are all very separate. I've never said a bad word about either of my boys' dads because there is no reason to."
Very noble. But let's hope she gives us something interesting.
Alexander O'Neal
The American R&B star from the 80s and 90s describes himself as "a very private person" (has he ever seen Big Brother?).
He also claims he doesn't "hang out with people".
"I'm never around people. Not like this. When I'm on my own time it's just my wife and me. So this is going to be very different," he says.
He also says he's not a fan of "smelling people" (like the rest of us are?), so living this close to 13 other celebs may prove problematic.
"I don't want to smell their breath, I don't want to smell their feet, I don't want to smell their farts," he says.
Hmmm, meet Ken Morely....
Ken Morley
The actor and comedian is best known for playing Reg Holdsworth in Corrie in the 90s.
More recently, you might have spotted him trying to flog windows and doors during the TV ad break.
But we're a little worried about how he'll get on with the "smellophobic" Alexander O'Neal, because Ken admits his bad habit is "flatulence".
"It does annoy the wife," he says.
All we can say is... Alexander, keep your distance.
Nadia Sawalha
The ex-EastEnders actress and Loose Woman has form for winning reality TV as 2007's Celebrity Masterchef champ and she could be a contender to win CBB too.
She's surely one of the nicest people in the house.
"If somebody just really isn't a very nice person then I will have a rub up with them," she says.
On Katie Hopkins, she says: "I suspect she acts a lot of what she says because I don't think anyone could be that nasty."
Aw, what a sweet thought.
Michelle Visage
In preparation for the show, singer Michelle has spent a lot of time shopping.
She promises to "deliver fashion every day" saying "everybody is packing for a month hoping that they will stay to the end, but I've packed for four months".
"If I can dress in theme for whatever the day is then I will. If not, then I'll go for beauty," she says.
The actress, radio presenter and judge on cult show RuPaul's Drag Race adds: "I'm in there for the gay community. And not just the gays but for any kid who feels like they've never belonged to a group.
"All the freaks, all the weirdos, all the misfits who never felt like their life was worth it."
Our money is on Michelle to win.
