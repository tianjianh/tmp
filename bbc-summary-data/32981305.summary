[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pathologist has warned of the dangers of "sofa sharing" with babies after a 21-day-old died when his grandmother fell asleep with him in her arms.

George Charnock was found unresponsive by Eileen Charnock after she fell asleep on the sofa while winding him on her chest in Oldham in August.
Dr Naomi Carter said sharing a sofa with babies was "not a safe thing".
At Heywood Coroners' Court, an open verdict was recorded but the coroner could not rule out overlay.
The inquest heard Mrs Charnock, who has insomnia, had previously not slept for 68 hours and recalled waking up and finding George unresponsive at the bottom of the sofa while she was babysitting.
It was not disputed that she had drunk a couple of glasses of wine earlier in the evening, the hearing was told.
In a statement read to the inquest, George's young sister told police that she had tried to pull her baby brother from under her sleeping grandmother.
She said: "I fell asleep on the couch with Grandma and George. Grandma was laying over George. I said, 'Grandma, you're on George.' She said, 'Stop waking me up'."
Mrs Charnock was arrested on suspicion of causing death to a child by overlaying.
After a blood sample was taken, toxicology reports proved negative for alcohol and no further action was taken.
The inquest heard that Mrs Charnock suffered with insomnia due to shift work and would go without sleep for between 68 and 72 hours before falling into "a deep sleep".
She told the inquest that on the night of George's death, she felt "dozy" after taking him from his Moses basket.
She said: "At that point I had 68 hours of no sleep and I fell asleep. Once I go out, I go out. Nobody woke me up; it was just a reaction.
"I was lying lengthways. I woke up. Then I shot up; I saw George at the bottom lying there. I got hold of George. He wasn't responding."
Mrs Charnock said she started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while waiting for the emergency services to arrive.
She said: "I'm in my own hell. I live that day every day; part of me died that day he died. I just went out like a light. I just wish I could turn the clock back."
The inquest was told that George's mother Emily returned home the following afternoon to find a forensic team outside her house.
She said: "I saw them coming out with bags, I said 'What's going on?' George had died. I have been trying so hard to block it out."
She said of her son: "He was so beautiful; he was so angelic. He was just perfect."
Dr Carter, a Home Office pathologist who performed the post-mortem examination, concluded a negative autopsy.
She told the inquest "sofa-sharing" was a known factor of sudden unexpected death in children.
"The accidental obstruction of the air passages has got to be a real possibility," she said.
"I can't say it must be the cause of death; the cause of death here must be described as unascertained."
She added: "I emphasise that sharing a sofa with a baby is not a safe thing to do."
