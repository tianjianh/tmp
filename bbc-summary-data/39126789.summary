Trafford Council closed Bollin Primary School in Bowdon, Greater Manchester on Monday after concerns about a "reduced capacity of senior leadership".
The council said the school had appointed an interim head teacher and it would reopen for Key Stage 2 pupils on Thursday.
Other classes will return in the next few days, said the council.
It follows a strike by teachers on Thursday, supported by some parents who demonstrated outside school.
The school has appointed Kylie Spark as interim head teacher while Michelle Brindle was "not in school", the council said.
There are no details about how long Mrs Spark, of Sale's Tyntesfield Primary School, will be in post.
A number of staff have been neutrally suspended while investigations continue into a video purporting to show teaching staff at a party making comments about Ms Brindle.
Trafford Council added it has applied to the Department for Education for approval for an interim executive board consisting of experienced governors.
One parent of a pupil at the school, which was rated as "outstanding" in its last Ofsted inspection, said she was worried many of the teachers will not return.
Julie Saunders said: "That is massively disruptive and upsetting for the children.
"It is not just a building with a few supply teachers; a school is a community which knows and understands the kids."
Sean Anstee, leader of Trafford Council, said he understood parents' concerns and the council had been working with the governing body to resolve issues.
He added: "We are doing everything we can to reopen the school and return it to the wonderful school we know it to be."
Key Stage 1 pupils will be invited back into school on Friday and early years pupils will return on Monday.
A petition of no confidence in Ms Brindle has been signed by more than 900 people.
The head teacher told the BBC she did not want to comment.
The school teaches more than 200 pupils from the age of three to 11.
