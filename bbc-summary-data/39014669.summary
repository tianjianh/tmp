[SN]TITLE[SN]
School plan for former Derby Telegraph building

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been submitted to convert a former newspaper building into a school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northcliffe House, in Meadow Road, Derby, has been empty since the Derby Telegraph relocated to new premises nearer the city centre in 2014.
The application is by Al-Khair Foundation, a Muslim charity which already has a school in Croydon.
The plans, for a nursery, primary and secondary school, will now be considered by Derby City Council.
