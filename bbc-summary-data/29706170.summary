[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eight South Wales Police investigated over Lisa Moller death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight officers have been put under investigation as part of an inquiry into the death of a woman following reports of domestic abuse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has served six PCs with misconduct notices over their actions prior to 35-year-old Lisa Moller's death.
The supervision of the officers by two sergeants is also being investigated.
Her body was found at a house in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, on 31 August.
The night before her death, South Wales Police were called out twice by a neighbour to reports of domestic abuse at the house.
Officers attended again at about 09:30 BST but could not make contact with Ms Moller on any of the occasions.
Her body was discovered at 10:50 BST.
The IPCC launched its investigation in September following a referral from South Wales Police.
Investigators have completed house-to-house inquiries in Barry and identified witnesses. Call logs from 31 August and radio transcripts have also been examined.
IPCC Commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said: "We have kept Ms Moller's family updated and continue to have every sympathy for them at this difficult time."
The watchdog said serving a police office or staff member with a notice meant their conduct was subject to investigation but the move was not judgemental in any way.
Ms Moller's death is still being investigated by South Wales Police.
