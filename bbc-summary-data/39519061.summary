Former England boss Taylor, who had two spells at both clubs during a 31-year managerial career, died in January at the age of 72.
Watford plan to face one of Taylor's former clubs annually, competing for the Graham Taylor Trophy.
The match will take place at 15:00 BST on Saturday 29 July, with profits split between two charities.
The National Memorial Arboretum and the Watford FC Community Sports and Education Trust - two organisations with which Taylor had a close connection - will benefit from the fixture.
