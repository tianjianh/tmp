Amy Gough of Sandringham Road, Sandiacre, died on Sunday at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham after being taken to hospital from her home.
A Sandiacre man was arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday and released on bail on Thursday.
A post-mortem examination was carried out on Tuesday but the cause of death has not yet been released, police said.
Derbyshire Police said it was informed of her death on Monday.
Det Insp Graham Prince appealed for anyone who knew Ms Gough to contact him.
"I'd like to hear from anyone who saw Amy between Tuesday March 24 and Sunday March 29," he said.
"It's very important that we piece together her movements in and around Sandiacre and possibly in Derby in the days before her death."
