Future of Kingsmead Nursing Home in Kingswells to be discussed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future provision of services at an Aberdeen nursing home which has been criticised is to be discussed by councillors next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kingsmead Nursing Home in Kingswells was branded "unsatisfactory" in a report by the Care Home Inspectorate.
Aberdeen City Council then placed a new team of nurses, carers and managers into the home.
Members will discuss options for how services will be provided in the longer term.
Some staff were accused of not treating people with "dignity and respect".
