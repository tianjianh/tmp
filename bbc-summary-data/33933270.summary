David Cameron treated for ear infection on holiday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron has been treated for an ear infection which he picked up while surfing on holiday in Portugal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The prime minister had been suffering from a condition called otitis - also known as "swimmer's ear" - which causes inflammation of the ear canal.
Downing Street said he had now recovered and was enjoying the rest of his summer break with his family.
It is not the first time the PM has had an injury on holiday. He was stung by a jellyfish in Lanzarote last year.
Mr Cameron is in Alvor, Portugal with his wife Samantha and their three children this year.
According to the NHS, otitis causes redness and swelling of the external ear canal.
It is often referred to as "swimmer's ear" because repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation.
