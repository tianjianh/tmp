Aberdeen City Deal priorities are set out in new statement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Housing and better connectivity are two of the main priorities set out in proposals for an Aberdeen City Region Deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils have delivered a "statement of intent" to the UK and Scottish governments in a bid to secure Â£2.9bn.
The statement outlines what benefits the funding would bring to the city and surrounding area.
A full bid submission is due to be drawn up by the end of this year.
Items at the top of the local authorities' list include providing more affordable homes, better rail connectivity and improved links to Aberdeen's harbour and airport.
Research into renewable and hydrogen technologies and international trade have also been mentioned.
Jenny Laing, leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: "We believe that the commitments this statement of intent identifies can form the basis for a City Region Deal that will benefit not only the economy of the north east, but the rest of Scotland and the rest of the UK.
"The challenge is to work towards a deal that will maximise the benefits of coordinated new and accelerated investment in the Aberdeen city region.
"We believe this statement articulates the progress that has been made so far and that a deal between the two governments can be made."
Co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council, Martin Kitts-Hayes, added: "We will continue to engage and collaborate with the two governments to deliver a City Region Deal that will ultimately contribute to the economic vision for the north east of Scotland.
"This is a successful region which plays a significant role in contributing to the financial wellbeing of Scotland, the UK and globally.
"By even greater collaboration across industry and all layers of government, we can protect the competiveness of the oil and gas industry already firmly established here and help to power tomorrow's world."
