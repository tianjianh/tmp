Two men charged in connection with the terrorism-linked shooting of an Australian police worker have been remanded in custody by a Sydney court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raban Alou, 18, is charged with aiding and abetting the killing of police accountant Curtis Cheng, 58, on 2 October.
Talal Alameddine, 22, is accused of supplying the weapon used by Mr Cheng's killer, 15-year-old Farhad Jabar.
Neither appeared in court and no applications for bail were made.
Mr Alou's lawyer, Moustafa Kheir, told reporters outside the court that his client would be fighting the charges.
He said his client had been held for more than 200 hours "for the purpose of interrogation" and that the charges against him relied on circumstantial evidence.
Police have alleged that Mr Alou handed the gun to Jabar. They also allege Mr Alameddine supplied the gun to Mr Alou hours before the murder.
The case has been adjourned until 10 December.
Mr Cheng was killed outside police headquarters in the Parramatta area of Sydney and Jabar was then shot dead by police. Officials described it as a terror attack.
More than 200 officers later raided properties in the area.
Jabar, an Australian born in Iran and of Iraqi-Kurdish heritage, is reported to have shouted religious slogans as he killed Mr Cheng.
In the wake of the killing, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a meeting with security chiefs.
He warned that radicalisation was spreading among the young.
"We are dealing with an evolving threat," he said.
"The shocking murder of Curtis Cheng, the shocking act of terrorism perpetrated by a 15-year-old boy reminds us yet again that radicalisation, extremism can be seen in the very young."
Australia's police chief had earlier warned that the terror threat facing the country was getting worse.
