[SN]TITLE[SN]
Missing postcard arrives in Swansea 29 years late

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swansea man has been left scratching his head after receiving a postcard from Spain 29 years after it was sent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The card, dated September 25 1986, dropped through the letterbox of Gethin Davies from Bonymaen.
Bearing two 1980s Spanish stamps and a British second-class stamp, it was sent by someone called Phyl, to a Mrs E Leon.
Mr Davies now hopes to reunite it with the person it was intended for.
In his postcard, Phyl writes that the weather is nice, he has a self-catering apartment near a pond, but complains about the "expensive" cost of Spanish bread at Â£1 a loaf.
Although it was delivered to the right address on the card, Mr Davies said he has no clue who either Phyl or Mrs Leon could be.
"I've been baffled by it really," he said.
"I suppose Mrs Leon once lived in my flat, but I've asked around neighbours who have lived here 20 or 30 years, and none of them have ever heard of her.
"The Post Office say they have no idea what could have happened to the postcard for 29 years, may be it got stuck in a sorting machine, may be given that it's got both British and Spanish stamps on it, someone found it and posted it on.
"Really I'd just like to find out who either Phyl or Mrs Leon are, so I could finally give it to them after all this time."
