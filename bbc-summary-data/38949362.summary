Kareena Hayes of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, needs to raise Â£30,000 for an operation and physiotherapy to treat complications caused by cerebral palsy.
She said the thief was "horrible", adding: "I hope they are sorry for what they've done."
The charity box was stolen from a cafÃ© in Borrowash several days ago.
Her father Craig Hammond, who is her full-time carer, said the operation was her only chance to ever walk unaided again.
"I just don't understand how anyone could do that. They are just the lowest of the low."
He said the operation, which cannot be provided on the NHS, at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre would be "hugely life changing for her ... it would improve her mobility and hopefully she would walk much better".
The family's appeal had already been boosted by a donation from the charity Caudwell Children, which helps transform the lives of disabled children across the UK.
Kareena, who uses a walker to get around, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was two years old.
The family was advised that an operation called selective dorsal rhizotomy would improve her mobility.
The treatment involves cutting some of the nerves in the lower spinal column an requires "extensive physiotherapy lasting several months", an NHS website said.
The operation only became available in the UK 18 months ago, but is not yet offered free of charge by the NHS.
Mr Hammond said Derbyshire Police were investigating the theft of the collection box.
