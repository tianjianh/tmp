Migrant crisis: Calais mayor seeks tunnel penalties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mayor of Calais has proposed tough new penalties for migrants who break into the Channel Tunnel in France.

If Natacha Bouchart's suggestions are approved, offenders could be jailed for up to 10 years and face fines of 150 000 euros (Â£111,100).
She wants breaches of security at the tunnel in Coquelles to be dealt with as "attacks on national infrastructure".
At least 13 migrants have been killed trying to get into Britain since late June, mainly around the tunnel area.
Ms Bouchart's proposal has been passed by the Senate in Paris but still has to go to the National Assembly to become law.
"The adoption of a legal amendment is a reaction to the lax penalties currently faced by migrants," she has said.
Ms Bouchart's demand comes after repeated breaches of the tunnel site by migrants in recent months.
Last week more than 120 migrants broke into the tunnel, causing long delays to passenger and freight services to the UK.
