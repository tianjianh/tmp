[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for the death of a cycling safety campaigner who was knocked off his bike in a road rage incident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Radford, 70, was left in a coma after the dispute near Holmfirth in 2013. He died 16 months later.
Michael Gledhill, 24, of Bramble Bank, Holmfirth, was found guilty of dangerous driving in 2014.
He later admitted causing death by dangerous driving after Mr Radford died, Leeds Crown Court heard.
Gledhill, a former soldier, was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison, with judge Christopher Batty telling him he had deliberately driven his car towards his victim in a fit of temper - an act motivated by "rage".
The court previously heard how words were exchanged between Mr Radford and Gledhill through the driver's side window as they travelled on the A616 Huddersfield Road in New Mill on 31 July 2013.
When Gledhill's car collided with the bike, Mr Radford fell into the road and sustained brain damage.
Mr Radford was the chairman of Huddersfield and District Cyclists and had been promoting a campaign calling for better investigation of road accidents.
In a statement, his family said: "Dad's death was unnecessary and today's outcome doesn't change anything for us as a family.
"As a family we have had to watch dad struggle and suffer on a journey that ended with the worst possible outcome."
The court heard Gledhill had served in Afghanistan and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time of the collision.
