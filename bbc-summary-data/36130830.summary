Keepers noticed that 24 year old Shinda was getting bigger, but they thought she was just overweight and never realised that she was in fact pregnant.
The new baby appeared on Saturday, and although it surprised the staff, Shinda is taking motherhood in her stride.
Visitors at the zoo had their first glimpse of the pair on Sunday, and mum and baby are both doing well.
