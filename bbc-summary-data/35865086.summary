Katie Clark and Olivia Federici won the "duet free" second round at the Olympic qualification tournament in Brazil.
It earned them a quota place, which has now been confirmed by the international federation Fina.
Clark and Federici will be in the mix for the two team places alongside Genevieve Randall and Jodie Cowie.
Clark, 21 and Federici, 26, retired after the 2013 World Championships, only to return to the sport last year.
Their retirement - along with five other Olympians in late 2013 - led to UK Sport ending funding support for the British set-up.
Synchronised swimming lead Karen Thorpe, said: "Achieving the Olympic quota place is a real testament to the hard work that has been done not only by Katie and Olivia but also Genevieve and Jodie.
"Our national coach Katie Chapman has worked tirelessly to make sure the athletes were in the best position to secure that vital quota place for the Games.
"We have had some ups and downs since London 2012 but this has to be a highlight for the sport. Over the last two years the synchro community has really united to help progress the sport, and in many ways it is stronger than ever. We now have four months that will be spent working hard to ensure we are at our best in Rio.
"I'm proud of the progress that Katie and Olivia have made since returning last year and I know that alongside Genevieve and Jodie we will be able to select a strong duet for Rio."
