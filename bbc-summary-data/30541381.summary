[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Armed police and specialist officers were called to a flat in Alexandra Road, Blackpool at about 15:20 GMT following reports a man had a weapon.
A woman was taken to hospital with a minor head injury.
The man left the flat voluntarily and is being held in custody for questioning.
A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said: "Specialist officers negotiated with a 43-year old-man in a flat for around five hours before he voluntarily left the flat.
"A weapon has been recovered."
A cordon had been placed on either side of Alexandra Road while negotiations took place.
Neighbours reported a heavy police presence, saying the road was cordoned off but that some residents were later escorted back to their homes.
Ann-Marie Farren, from Alexandra Road, said: "I was driving home from work and saw dozens of police cars."
