The multi-million pound project will include a new stand, changing rooms and a new playing surface.
Since its inception, the project has been beset by a number of delays and was recently criticised by Derry City Football Club's chairman.
The contract for regeneration works is due to be announced within a fortnight.
The announcement was made at a full council meeting on Thursday evening.
SDLP councillor Brian Tierney welcomed the update as a "very positive step".
"It will come as great news to all users of the stadium, we've all seen the results that Derry City have been getting on the field.
"They deserve a stadium, the Brandywell area deserves a good stadium and we're delighted to see the council officers come back and say they have identified a contractor and I hope to see work start before the end of November.
"I would be very disappointed if that didn't happen, but this is a very, very positive step and everyone wants to see the project move on.
"Hopefully we'll be able to see diggers on the ground and put everyone at ease," he said.
Mr Tierney added that a date for the work to be completed was not yet set in stone as it was dependent on a number of other factors, including the weather.
