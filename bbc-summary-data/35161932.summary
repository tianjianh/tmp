Luke Durbin: Appeal for car information draws a blank

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal for information about a car which could be linked to a missing teenager has drawn a blank.

Photos of a Volvo 440 were released by police investigating the disappearance of Luke Durbin, who was last seen in Ipswich on 12 May 2006.
Police wanted to trace the owner of a car which was captured on CCTV nearby.
Det Supt John Brocklebank said: "We had six calls, a number suggesting what could have happened to Luke, but nothing regarding this car."
Mr Durbin, of Hollesley, was 19-years-old when he failed to return home from a night out.
Police said there was a Volvo 440 in the Ipswich area with the number plate M206 LYE at the time, but it was registered under a false name and address.
"We can't categorically say that is the car we see in the image," Mr Brocklebank said.
He said the fact that the vehicle was not properly registered could have played a part in the silent response to the appeal.
"Not registering a vehicle is an offence, but here we've got a young man who has been missing for nine years," he said. "You've got a family who have been waiting that long, just to try and understand why he disappeared and where he is.
"I urge anybody to come forward and allow me to either eliminate that vehicle or give us information in connection with its use."
Mr Brocklebank said police were following up the other phone calls, some of which gave "vague locations" for where Mr Durbin's body could be found.
"Clearly, the people of Suffolk want to find out what happened to Luke Durbin," he said. "They want to understand how a young man can just disappear off the street."
