Simpson was with the Robins from the age of six, but did not make a first-team appearance.
The 18-year-old is Forest Green's 10th signing since winning promotion from the National League.
"He's box to box, he's good on the ball, so he should be a good addition to the squad," Rovers boss Mark Cooper told the club website.
