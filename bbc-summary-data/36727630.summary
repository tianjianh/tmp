Perry, 29, helped Brighton to promotion to WSL 2 last season via the Premier League Championship play-off final.
The Republic of Ireland international was also an FA Cup finalist with Chelsea in 2012.
"Sophie is an experienced defender and has proven herself both in the WSL1 and at international level," Reading manager Kelly Chambers said.
