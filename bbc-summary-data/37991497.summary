The BBC's annual Price of Football study returns for a sixth year on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This season is the first of a record Â£5.316bn TV rights deal for Premier League clubs, and we will show you the impact of that windfall on prices.
The 2016 Price of Football data will feature on the BBC Sport website and across the BBC from 22:00 GMT, when BBC Radio 5 live will host a special programme discussing the cost of watching football.
The most comprehensive study of its kind in Europe, it has analysed more than 1,500 different prices at 223 clubs across England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Europe.
This year, more than 1,000 tickets in six categories have been looked at - the cheapest and dearest matchday, cheapest and dearest season tickets and cheapest and dearest away tickets.
The study also looks at the price of pies, teas, programmes and replica shirts.
And you will be able to investigate your club's prices and work out your own price of football in our special interactive calculator on the BBC Sport website.
Last year's study found the cost of watching football in the UK had dropped or remained the same for the majority of fans.
Full figures will be available on the BBC Sport website from 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, 16 November.
