[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plaid at one on Brexit stance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Speak to Plaid members in Llangollen at their autumn conference about the departure of the former leader Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas and Plaid Labour relations at the assembly and you are likely to get different views.

Mention Brexit, and the party has the luxury of being entirely at one.
I say luxury because, having been to both the UK Conservative and Labour conferences, harmony on a Brexit policy can be difficult to come by.
The message time and again from the conference floor has been to warn of the dangers for the Welsh economy of leaving the single market.
Their health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth had a particularly snappy line when he said the people of Wales voted to leave, but they didn't vote to take leave of their senses.
He said the hard Brexiteers should not be allowed to have the last laugh on Wales' future, while the Arfon MP Hywel Williams accused the hard Brexiteers - by which I'm assuming he means those who want to leave the single market - of being unpatriotic.
All strong stuff.
One of the key points about retaining membership of the single market is that it would make it more difficult to bring in controls over EU migration.
In a way it has become the policy embodiment of those who believe trade with the rest of the EU should have a higher priority than control of borders.
Plaid's stance puts it at odds with Theresa May and First Minister Carwyn Jones who believe the referendum result was, above all, a message to politicians that something needs to be done about immigration.
Leanne Wood and others are trying to change that narrative by saying the referendum campaign was about immigration, but it was about many other things as well such as austerity, and false claims about extra spending on the NHS.
The big challenge for the party is that so many people in Wales voted to leave the EU, and they must have done so knowing full well that it would have entailed leaving the single market.
Plaid insists strongly that it is not in denial about the result, but it is an accusation that is going to come its way over its position on Brexit.
