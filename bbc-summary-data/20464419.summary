Harry Harper died in hospital after emergency crews were called to what is believed to be his grandparents' house in Ketley, Telford, on Tuesday morning.
The dog which bit Harry, a Jack Russell, has been destroyed.
West Mercia Police said its investigation was likely to continue for some time.
Supt Nav Malik said the death was being investigated as a "tragic accident" involving the family's pet dog.
He said: "Further detailed tests are still to be carried out and therefore at the present time no further information can be released."
The Telford and Wrekin coroner's office said an inquest into Harry's death would be opened on Monday.
A statement from his family, issued the day after his death, said there were "no words to describe the loss we have suffered".
They said they were "absolutely devastated" and asked to be "left in peace to grieve and deal with our loss".
