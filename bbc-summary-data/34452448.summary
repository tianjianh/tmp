The family of a missing Bristol DJ have found a map in his home which they hope may provide a breakthrough in the inquiry into his disappearance.

Before going missing on 11 July Derek Serpell-Morris, 73, known as DJ Derek, made several return trips by bus to Thornbury, Travel Card data confirmed.
His family now believe he caught a second bus to Dursley after finding the map with a ring around the hospital.
They have asked for checks to be made to see if there is a connection.
Derek's great niece, Jennifer Griffiths, said she and her mother and father, Paula and Stuart Marks, went into his flat on Friday.
"He kept maps with pink and yellow markers (to gig venues) and all the bus numbers highlighted and all alphabetised," said Ms Griffiths.
"My dad spent hours at the weekend going through them but there was only one placed marked on the Dursley map and that was around an H with the name of the road highlighted."
The family has already walked around some of the fields surrounding the hospital but has found no trace of Mr Serpell-Morris.
Ms Griffiths said she and her parents had asked the hospital authorities to see if he was an outpatient there or if he was a visitor.
"This could be really significant," she said.
