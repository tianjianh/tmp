The 25-year-old Londoner got two number ones last year as a guest vocalist on Clean Bandit's Rather Be and Route 94's My Love.
"To get a number one in my own name is one of the most insane feelings," she said.
The singer outsold her nearest rival, James Bay's Hold Back the River, by 40,000 copies.
Former number one King, by Years & Years, fell one place to three, with Rihanna, Kanye West and Sir Paul McCartney collaboration FourFiveSeconds at four.
Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do remained at five.
Last week's number one - Sam Smith and John Legend's version of Lay Me Down, made for Comic Relief - fell to six.
Although Bay missed out on topping the singles chart, his debut record - Chaos And The Calm - went straight in at number one on the album chart.
The Official Charts Company said the album had combined sales of more than 64,000 and was streamed some 2,500 times over the past week.
Sam Smith's In The Lonely Hour remained at two, with Ed Sheeran's X climbing one place to three - its 40th consecutive week in the top 10.
Seasick Steve's was a new entry at four with Sonic Soul Surfer.
Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly dropped four places from last week's number one to number five.
There were two other new entries in the top 10 - Laura Marling's Short Movie at seven and Cribs' For All My Sisters at nine.
