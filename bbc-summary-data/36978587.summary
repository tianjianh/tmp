[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife at her West Lothian home while their two children slept upstairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Erhan Havaleoglu, 36, killed Leighanne Cameron, 29, by strangling and stabbing her at the house in Mid Calder on 28 October 2015.
He was found guilty of murder by majority at the High Court in Paisley after denying the charge.
Havaleoglu was remanded in custody. He is due to be sentenced on 13 September.
Havaleoglu fled the scene and left his wife dying while their four-year-old daughter, Erin, and 18-month-old son, Jamie, were sleeping upstairs.
He then drove to Edinburgh via a back road where police believe he ditched the murder weapon and clothes he was wearing - which have never been found.
But a speck of Ms Cameron's blood was found on his shoes and some was found on the front door of his flat - where Ms Cameron had never been.
Her body was found by her boyfriend Philip Kilkenny who, the court heard, she had been cheating on Havaleoglu with for six months before their split.
Kilkenny, 42, found Leighanne's body and called the police, telling them Havaleoglu had "told her she'd never get to love another man".
Havaleoglu denied murdering his estranged wife five months after they split up, blaming the killing on Kilkenny.
Temporary judge Johanna Johnston told Havaleoglu: "You have been convicted by a jury of murder - the most serious crime under our law.
"This was a brutal and sustained attack, during which you inflicted the most savage injuries to the deceased.
"You left her dying in her own home with her children asleep upstairs.
"Had it not been for Mr Kilkenny attending at the house, which was unknown to you, the children could have discovered the ghastly scene of their mother's murder.
"You have left a family devastated by the loss of a much-loved mother, daughter and sister and you have robbed a young woman of her future with her family.
"There is only one punishment for murder and that is life in prison."
Det Chf Insp Raymond Brown, of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, said: "Leighanne's death has been absolutely devastating for her family and those close to her.
"Her five-year-old daughter and two-year-old son have been robbed of their loving mum in the most horrific of circumstances.
"Havaleoglu has callously refused to admit responsibility for Leighanne's murder ever since, despite extensive evidence against him, and we welcome today's decision.
"Unfortunately, nothing can undo his actions that day but hopefully this verdict brings some sense of closure to all who knew and loved Leighanne."
