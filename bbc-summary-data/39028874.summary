[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Helena Happell, 41, and her co-accused Mary Hawthorn, 32, allegedly attempted to kill Lorretta Happell on Friday.
The incident is said to have taken place at a property on Great Western Road, Glasgow.
Both women appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court where they made no plea or declaration and were remanded in custody.
Ms Happell is also charged with sending text messages that were "grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character" to the 58-year-old between 15 October 2016 and 27 October 2016.
Prosecutors claim that on 17 February 2017 Ms Happell and Ms Hawthorn repeatedly hit Mrs Happell with "a knife or similar instrument" then wrapped a wire around her neck and attempted to strangle her.
Both women will appear for a full committal hearing next week.
