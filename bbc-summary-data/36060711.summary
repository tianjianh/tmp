Barry Bannan, who was named in the Championship team of the season this week, scored with a superb strike from 30 yards to put the Owls in front.
Veteran Bent levelled just a minute after coming on when he headed home from Johnny Russell's cross.
The Rams had already confirmed their play-off place while the Owls are now four points clear of Cardiff.
Derby v Sheffield Wednesday as it happened
If Wednesday avoid defeat by the Bluebirds next week then they will be in the Championship play-offs for the first time since they were relegated from the Premier League in 2000.
A closely-fought game came to life in the 69th minute when Bannan exchanged passes with striker Gary Hooper and hit a wonderful dipping shot that caught keeper Scott Carson out and went in off the underside of the crossbar.
Fernando Forestieri nearly sealed victory for the Owls with a curling free-kick that hit the top of the bar on its way over before Bent scored just his third goal of the season with a backpost header after excellent work from Russell.
Derby pushed for a late winner but were unable to make it five successive victories while Carlos Carvalhal's side, who host Cardiff next week, have now drawn their last three games.
Derby head coach Darren Wassall:
"It was a really good advert for the top half of the Championship. Both teams were at it, with both teams in their own way having a lot to play for.
"We wanted to remain unbeaten until the end of the season and continue our excellent form and I thought we played very well. We went behind against the run of play but what pleased me most was the resilience and character we showed to come back into the game.
"Credit to all the players and we said before the game that if you can't win don't lose, and that's what happened today and we remain unbeaten in five.
"We are delighted to have Will (Hughes) back and I thought he handled the occasion very well and played that holding role like he'd been playing it for 10 years.
"His out-of-possession stuff was good as well, he put some great tackles in and ran around and did himself proud, he's a good player to get back.
"I think Will is capable of playing in any of those three midfield positions and it's great that we showed the depth of our squad. At the end of this season it's great that our players, whether they are starting 11 or squad players, are firing on all cylinders."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"If you look at the point as part of a marathon then I would say I'm happy with it. I am happy but also a little disappointed because we know if we win we achieve something important.
"During the 90 minutes it was a good balanced game with two good teams. We did well and played good football and I'm happy with the performance.
"It was an amazing goal from Barry but it is not the first time he's scored a goal like that."
