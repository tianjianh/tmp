Carroll, who will be 40 in September, is coming to the end of his first season with the Belfast club.
The veteran keeper's form has been important in Linfield's attempt to land the league and cup double.
Linfield are one point behind leaders Crusaders with four games left and have qualified for the Irish Cup final.
"Roy is an inspirational leader who sets the right example to all around him," said Linfield manager David Healy, who played with Carroll for Northern Ireland.
"His performances in goal for us have been exceptional, none more so than the crucial late match-winning saves in recent games against Dungannon Swifts and Crusaders."
Carroll's former clubs also include Wigan Athletic, Derby County, Danish side Odense and Olympiakos of Greece.
