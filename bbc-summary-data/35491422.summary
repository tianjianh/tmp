Bird 'photobombs' railway webcam at Abergynolwyn, Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This is the moment a bird "photobombed" a web camera mounted at a railway station in north west Wales.

It looked into the lens at Abergynolwyn Station, in Gwynedd, on the Talyllyn Railway.
The image shows the feathered friend peering into shot.
It's not the first animal to jump in on a picture!
