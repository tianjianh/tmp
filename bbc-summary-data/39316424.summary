"I have been training so hard for the last eight weeks.
"I sensed something was up in the weigh in yesterday. I saw it in his eyes. In the back of my mind I knew something was up.
"I'd come back from having a coffee this morning and my manager was in my room. I knew then he'd pulled out."
"Some people are built for this game, In my opinion he didn't look like he wanted to fight me.
"It's up to UFC now to see what will happen. This has never happened to my in my career."
UFC said in a statement: "Following a trip to the hospital earlier in the day, bantamweight contender Ian Entwistle has been removed from tonight's scheduled bout against Brett Johns per doctors recommendations. "
