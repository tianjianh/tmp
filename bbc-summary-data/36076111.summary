[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thurso, Helmsdale and Inverness to show unfinished film

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unfinished documentary about Highland communities in the 1950s is to be shown at venues in Thurso, Helmsdale and Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lost Treasure was recently rediscovered by the Moving Image Archive at National Library of Scotland and was shown at Glasgow Short Film Festival in March.
The film was made in 1956 by Glasgow socialist collective, the Dawn Cine Group, in Caithness and Sutherland.
It was unable to complete the project after running out of funds.
Screenings, which will be accompanied by live music, will be held at Merlin Cinema in Thurso on 21 April, Timespan in Helmsdale on 22 April and Eden Court in Inverness on 23 April.
Lost Treasure is being shown as part of the CineScore Live tour.
