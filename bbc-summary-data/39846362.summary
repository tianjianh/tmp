Andy Farrant walked past the scene after the man had been freed from the car.
He said: "There were about 25 to 30 members of the emergency services - ambulance, fire brigade, volunteers from the coastguard, a couple of inshore lifeboats - the air ambulance landed on the nearby cove.
"The patient was on the beach of the nearby cove and has been put in the air ambulance.
"The tide was coming in and there's quite a light breeze but the sea conditions were calm."
