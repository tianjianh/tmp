Scrum-half Nic Groom says the mood in the Northampton changing room was 'bleak' after their 18-14 loss to Bath.

The South African debutant scored two late tries after coming on as a 66th-minute substitute.
George Ford scored all of Bath's 18 points in Todd Blackadder's first league match in charge of the club.
"It was the first run out at the Gardens in front of our fans, who were spectacular like always, so we let them down," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"And 100 games for Luther Burrell, it was big for us to put in a big performance for him and unfortunately we just came short, so very bleak."
The rain-soaked match was a different experience for Groom, who has previously played in Super Rugby and South African domestic competitions.
"It's going to take a little getting used to, but that's part of the reason I came, to improve myself as a player and experience a different style of playing," he added.
"In a game like this with the weather playing a huge role its the small margins which make a big difference."
