[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of a Denbighshire town's chamber of trade have been banned from an indoor market in a row over the products being sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ruthin Chamber of Trade claim products sold in the market are similar to those being sold by shops on the high street.
It wrote to market bosses and asked if the issue should be considered when stalls were let.
But it sparked an angry response and committee members have been banned due to the "audacious interference".
The website of the chamber of trade, which is made up of local business people who pay an annual Â£15 subscription, says the group was set up to "create a spirit of goodwill, friendship, and unity amongst the business community".
The letter said: "All the traders in the shops and in the market are finding it difficult enough without the added challenge of direct competition in a small town," the letter said.
"The chamber would appreciate your consideration in this matter."
Market managers Tony and Sue Shaw, in their reply to the chamber, said competition was good for customers and that they were "appalled" by the attempt to interfere with the running of the market.
"We have been in business for over 40 years and need neither advice nor help from you or your committee to run our thriving business," they said.
"Due to your audacious interference and to underline our strength of feeling at your interjection, we have no alternative but to bar you and your committee members from Ruthin Indoor Market with immediate effect."
