Emily Platt, from Bispham, will leave Blackpool's Montgomery High School with an unblemished record, racking up a total of 2,280 school days.
The 16-year-old, who spent her primary years at Westcliff Academy, has recently completed her GCSEs.
"I'm not special," she said. "I just wake up and go out to school every day. I've done it all my life."
"There are some days that are a bit harder when you have to force your way out of bed but once I'm there you just wake up," she added.
The student has a keen passion for graphics and music and hopes to be able to study A-Levels in the subjects at a local sixth-form college.
Tim Burns, from Montgomery High School, said Emily was "an absolute inspiration".
