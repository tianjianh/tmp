[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists are being warned of significant travel delays as nine months of roadworks begin on the main route into Bournemouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 40-year-old A338 Bournemouth Spur Road needs to be rebuilt as its foundations are crumbling.
Lane closures and a reduced speed limit will be in place during the works, which start at 20:00 BST.
Drivers have been advised to plan their journeys and, if possible, use alternative routes.
A series of overnight road closures are also planned as the dual carriageway, which normally carries about 59,000 vehicles a day, is prepared for construction work.
The first full closure takes place on the northbound carriageway from 20:00 BST to 06:00 on Monday.
Dates for further overnight closures can be seen on the Dorset councils website.
Passengers for Bournemouth Airport and patients due at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital are being advised to allow extra time for their journeys
The hospital said if patients were late for appointments due to the traffic delays they faced having their appointment postponed.
The work will be carried out on the dual carriageway 24 hours a day, six days a week, Dorset County Council said.
The new road will be given a new surface layer in an attempt to reduce traffic noise.
A 1m (3ft) hard strip to give extra space for cars to move over for emergency vehicles or in case of breakdowns will also be added.
The Â£22m scheme, which is due to finish by 31 May 2016, has been funded by the Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership.
