[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for 18 years following a "traumatising hour-long attack" on a teenage girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Avan Mogridge, 32, of Church Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, raped and threatened to kill the 18 year old in a wooded area off Parkway, Guildford, on 22 October 2016.
Jurors convicted him at Guilford Crown Court of two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one threat to kill.
He will be listed on the sex offenders register for life.
The victim had been on her way to work at the time of the attack.
She was dragged into a wooded area next to the pavement at 06:15 GMT, held to the ground and threatened before being raped and seriously sexually assaulted.
Mogridge was caught in the act by two passers-by, who intervened and called the police.
In a statement read out in court, the victim said: "I used to be a bubbly and confident girl and enthusiastic about life and living it. I had dreams for my future. I am now traumatised, scared, drained and frightened.
"One day in October, because of one person, my life turned upside down and my dreams disappeared."
DC Tim Faltermeyer of Surrey Police said: "This was a horrifying and traumatising hour-long attack on an innocent young woman and I would like to commend her for the sheer bravery she has shown throughout the court process.
"I would like to thank the couple who intervened and called police that morning, without them who knows how long the attack could have lasted.
"I hope this reassures anybody who may have been a victim of sexual assault or rape, we take reports extremely seriously and specialist officers will always investigate fully and sensitively."
Mogridge was sentenced to serve 14 years in custody and four on licence.
