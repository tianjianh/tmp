Manchester-based executive Katy Jones, who previously worked on Jimmy McGovern's ITV drama about the 1989 football disaster, died on Friday aged 51.
She also worked for ITV's World in Action programme and, in recent years, produced education content for the BBC.
Sinead Rocks, head of BBC Learning, said she was "hugely talented".
"She was passionate about education and learning and her enthusiasm, energy and determination knew no bounds. Our thoughts are with her family at this very sad time."
Peter Salmon, director of BBC England, added: "Katy brought huge energy and commitment to everything she worked on. We will miss her enormously at MediaCityUK."
She was on the Hillsborough Independent Panel which, in 2012, released its report into the disaster.
Mrs Jones was also a producer on Jimmy McGovern's Sunday - about the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland - Bafta-award winning drama Mark of Cain and the 9/11 film Yasmin.
She also founded the education company Child's Eye Media in 2005 before joining the BBC when it moved to Salford in 2011.
The mother-of-two was married to Mike Spencer, who worked with her at ITV Granada.
