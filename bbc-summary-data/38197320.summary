[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County manager Graham Westley was involved in an extraordinary post-match press conference following his side's 0-0 draw at Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup.

He was asked to leave after listening in to opposition manager Derek Adams' conference.
Westley initially refused before Adams cut short his briefing and left.
"The press officer asked me to leave, I was a bit confused and bemused by it," Westley said.
"But I then left the room. He [Adams] stormed out. His choice, let's move on.
"I was asked to come and speak to the press. So I walked into the press room, the other manager was speaking.
"He's welcome to come and listen to me. I've got nothing to say that I'm scared of him hearing. I stood on the side of the room politely."
Newport secured an FA Cup second round replay against League Two rivals Plymouth after playing nearly an hour of the game with ten men after Sean Rigg's first half dismissal.
During the week Westley defended his conduct after a row that saw club secretary Graham Bean leave after just three weeks.
Bean said he quit the club because of a rift with Westley, who was appointed in October, but the manager said Bean was dismissed.
The club confirmed Bean's departure but said they were not investigating Westley, despite reports to the contrary.
