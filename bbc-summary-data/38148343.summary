Further delays to opening of £48.5m Wick Joint Campus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £48.5m school campus in the Highlands is now not expected to open to pupils as planned because of fresh delays in completing the project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At a turf cutting ceremony in 2014 marking the start of construction on the Wick Joint Campus it was said the site would open this summer.
But since then the council's contractor has on several occasions had to push back the completion date.
Highland Council is now awaiting a new date for next year.
The local authority said it was "deeply disappointed by this further delay" to the handover of the campus from the contractor.
Hub North Scotland is overseeing the construction of the campus by contractor Morrison Construction.
The campus is being constructed to replace Wick High School and Pulteneytown and South primaries.
It will also have community facilities which will be available to the public.
