The DJ, the first contestant to be voted out of this year's series, will take part in the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special alongside five other former contestants.
The Christmas Day broadcast will be the final time Len Goodman will be seen on the judging panel.
He announced in July that this series of Strictly would be his last.
The festival episode will be hosted by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, with regular judges Craig Revel Horwood, Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli also on hand to critique the performances.
The radio and TV host will be competing for the Christmas Silver Star trophy alongside Olympian Denise Lewis, Saturdays singer Frankie Bridge and writer Pamela Stephenson.
Celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott, who competed in the 2015 series, and TV presenter Gethin Jones complete the line-up.
Their professional dance partners - and the theme of the show - are yet to be announced. The show will also feature a musical performance.
Odoom was pitted against singer Anastacia in the first dance off - but she was unable to dance again after tearing scar tissue from a double mastectomy.
He was automatically sent home as he had the fewest votes from viewers.
