Bicester college plan to build on playing field opposed by Sport England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a new college on a playing field at an Oxfordshire school have been opposed by Sport England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Activate Learning want to build a three-storey technical facility offering vocational-based education for about 300 14 to 19-year-olds.
It plans to use 0.29 hectares (0.71 acres) of sports field at Bicester Community College.
Sport England objected to the "net loss" of outdoor recreational space for the school and community.
The sports body said no land was offered as a replacement.
It said if the plan is approved, it will refer the decision to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.
A report by Cherwell District Council said the council's own local plan highlighted a "shortfall of sports and recreational facilities in Bicester".
But it said in balance, the loss of land was "comparatively small" and represented a "relatively under-used corner" of the playing field, while the new college brought benefits to the town.
The technical college will employ up to 30 people and will be operated by Activate Learning, who will also oversee Bicester Community College which is converting to an academy.
Bicester Town Council "strongly supports" the application.
Concerns have also been raised about increased traffic.
Cherwell councillors are due to decide on the planning application, which has been recommended for approval by officers, on 3 September.
