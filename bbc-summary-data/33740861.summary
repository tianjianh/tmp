Ashes 2015: Things to do in the West Midlands after the Edgbaston test

England have stormed to victory in the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston, but with play having finished in just three days, where can cricket fans in Birmingham go now?

West Midlands fans have assured their Aussie rivals they will be given a warm welcome in the area.  Indeed, Twitter is packed with suggestions of places where Australian fans can go to commiserate.
Rikhi suggests they drown their sorrows by doing the Harborne Mile pub run in Birmingham - soaking in the sun in the bucolic beer gardens of Edgbaston and Harborne.
"Drink, drink, drink - that's about it," said one Australian fan, outlining his future plans.
Of course, there are few bars more Australian than Walkabout on Broad Street in the city centre, but that does have a controversial past - it was the scene where Australia's David Warner was "involved in an alleged physical altercation" with England's Joe Root in 2013.
So, if not bars, what about another traditional Australian pastime - a barbecue?
The Butchers Social is a pop-up eatery in Harborne, which has barbecue in its beer garden on Saturday.
"It's not very Australian," said Mike Bullard, who runs it. "It's more of an English barbecue."
Nor will they encounter any undue levels of smugness, he said.
"I love cricket but the Ashes could go either way yet," he said. "I tend to sit on the fence until that little trophy is in our hands."
Food-loving Australians may also enjoy the street food festival in Kings Heath on Sunday.
Fans seeking to stick with a sporting theme for their weekend will not be disappointed.
Tom King suggests fans could watch Birmingham City versus Leicester City in a pre season friendly at St Andrew's on Saturday.
Alternatively, Rick Crawley tweeted: "Told there's a match tomorrow at Harborne Cricket Club. Wonder if they fancy a full house."
Birmingham city centre is currently hosting The Big Hoot - a street exhibition of 89 giant owl sculptures.
And culture fans could look further afield for their kicks.
In Stratford-upon-Avon, in Warwickshire, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is in the middle of a production of Othello.
"We are very happy to see Australian fans if they want to come to this show," said an RSC representative.
Does he not think Australians might have witnessed enough tragic spectacle for one week?
"Not at all - the sun is shining here and they will be so impressed by Stratford, they will forget all their woes," he said.
If fans want to travel out of Birmingham in the other direction, they will come across the Black Country Living Museum, in Dudley.
"I'm afraid we don't have any specific connections with Australia," said Abby Bird, marketing co-ordinator.
"However, they might want to drown their sorrows with a pint and a bag of our famous beef and dripping fish and chips."
The first Edgbaston Ashes Test in six years was expected to generate Â£25m for the local economy.
Neil Rami, from Marketing Birmingham, believes the early finish may not be all bad news.
"Economically, it's still very significant for Birmingham. People have booked their hotels and this is a great showcase for the city," he said.
