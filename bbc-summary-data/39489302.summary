Members of Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union were due to walkout for 24 hours on Saturday in a row over jobs.
Workers were due to protest at Night Tube drivers being "blocked" from applying for full-time roles.
Aslef said both unions had suspended their actions after "clarification" from London Underground (LU) of a proposal to end the dispute.
Aslef's Finn Brennan said: "Our aim has always been to make sure that Night Tube drivers were not forced to remain in the role indefinitely, while new recruits took up full-time positions.
"The new proposal means that LU will fill full-time vacancies from waiting lists in-line with agreements and Night Tube drivers will not be 'jumped' by new recruits."
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the action had "forced London Underground to see sense and stop discriminating against Night Tube drivers over their career progression".
LU's operations director Peter McNaught said: "When we introduced the service we promised to provide career progression for Night Tube train drivers and we remain committed to doing so."
The proposals will be put to a ballot of Aslef members with a recommendation to accept.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was "pleased" unnecessary strike disruption for Londoners had been avoided.
