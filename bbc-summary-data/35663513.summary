Fifa reforms more vital than new president - Greg Dyke

Reforming Fifa into a better-run organisation is more important than who is elected as its new president on Friday, says Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.

Football's world governing body is meeting in Zurich, Switzerland to decide who succeeds Sepp Blatter.
However, there will also be a vote on a reform programme aimed at making it more democratic and accountable.
"I think there is an opportunity for Fifa to start again," said Dyke.

The FA is one of 207 member associations who will vote on the package of measures - which Fifa hopes will move it on from a corruption crisis.
Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials and disclose their salaries, as well as creating a new Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women - before choosing a new president.
The FA has backed Swiss Gianni Infantino, Uefa's general secretary. He is up against Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne.
"Hopefully we pass the reform programme, we elect a new president and Fifa goes back to some sort of normality," said Dyke.
"The reforms are more important than who is the president. The reforms are about the way Fifa conducts its business and I think there is an overwhelming majority of people that want to support those.
"What matters is tracing the money in and tracing the money out. What matters is making sure decision making is done properly and democratically.
"If all of those things come out of this then I think Fifa has a better chance in the future."

Fifa has been dogged by widespread allegations of corruption, the arrest of leading officials and the banning of Blatter, its president of 18 years.
The 79-year-old Swiss was found guilty of ethics code breaches over a $2m (Â£1.3m) "disloyal payment" to Michel Platini, the head of European football's governing body Uefa, who was also suspended.
They both deny any wrongdoing and have said they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Numerous Fifa officials have been indicted in the United States, while Swiss authorities are also investigating the organisation.
Asked if it was really a new era for FIfa, Dyke replied: "I think it could be.
"What is also needed is a stronger chief executive to run the organisation. If all of those things come out of this then I think Fifa has a better chance in the future."
