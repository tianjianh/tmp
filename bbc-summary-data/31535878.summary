The 32-year-old, who can play at fly-half, full-back or centre, will join in the summer on a three-year contract.
His previous clubs include Super Rugby outfits Highlanders and Chiefs.
"Mike's a high quality player. We had a good look at him and his style of play and ability to control a game will fit very well with what we're doing here," said director of rugby Dean Richards.
Delany won his only international cap against Italy on the Kiwis' tour of Europe and Asia in 2009, though he did make another appearance in a game against the Barbarians.
"He's pretty low mileage, in good shape and brings some valuable experience from Top 14, Super Rugby and the All Blacks set-up."
