[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planned 48-hour strike by train drivers around Wales due to start on Thursday has been suspended, the RMT union has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The strike would have seen 1,000 Arriva Trains Wales services cancelled and affected around 60,000 people.
The operator said it would aim to provide a normal service on all routes but there might be "some minor service recovery issues" on Thursday.
The announcement followed last minute talks with unions RMT and Aslef.
An RMT spokesman said members had been instructed to work normally.
The unions had argued for better working practices for their drivers, describing conditions for them as "almost Dickensian" in some aspects.
They also said drivers in Wales were paid less than in other parts of the country and called for parity with counterparts over the border.
If last-minute talks had failed, all Arriva Trains Wales services would have been cancelled from 00:01 GMT on Thursday, with no replacement bus services.
People travelling to the Wales v Netherlands football international at Cardiff City stadium on Friday evening, may have been affected.
