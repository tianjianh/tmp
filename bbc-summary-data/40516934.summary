Eight-year-old Saffie Roussos from Leyland, Lancashire was among 22 people killed at the pop star's concert on 22 May.
A day after what would have been her ninth birthday, Grande tweeted: "Saffie, we're [thinking] of you baby" alongside a birthday cake emoji.
Hundreds of people gathered in Saffie's hometown on Tuesday to mark the day.
Balloons were released in her memory, with family friend Tess Watson saying the event was "the party she deserves".
In his first interview since the explosion, Saffie's father Andrew told the BBC earlier that day his daughter was "everything you could wish for in a little girl".
Her older sister, Ashlee Bromwich, spoke of Saffie's excitement as she watched her idol on perform on 22 May.
"She was Ariana Grande-obsessed. She was so happy, she was elated all night, grinning," she said.
The US singer made the tribute to Saffie after performing a concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Grande is in line to be the first recipient of an honorary citizenship of Manchester for organising the One Love Manchester concert in aid of victims of the bomb attack under plans put forward by the city council.
Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer at the end of Grande's concert.
