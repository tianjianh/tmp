Move over Kim Kardashian, there is a new social media star in town - or two, to be precise.

Their names rhyme, their clothes match - Japanese couple Bon and Pon are putting a smile on the social media world with their perfectly co-ordinated chic outfits and silver hair.
In an Instagram account that screams #lifegoals, the couple, 60 and 61, post demure photos of their everyday life in amazing matching outfits.
Bon and Pon, married for 37 years, created their account just three months ago, but they are already Instagram celebrities - @bonpon511 has an enviable 89,000 followers (and counting).
Not many couples could get away with matching tartan, but Bon and Pon can.
It's not only their devotion to co-ordination that makes them so appealing.
They also have impeccable taste - wearing minimalist colours, tailored cuts and smart shoes.

They post with hashtags #whitehair, #silverhair and #over60 - reminding us all that fashion has no age limit.
But why do they co-ordinate their look? "It's fun to wear matching clothes," says Bon.
Bon told the BBC they particularly liked to match outfits on holiday.
Even their children are in on it. Here they are in a gift from their daughter - matching scarves.
Sometimes they wear the same outfit twice - so there is hope for the rest of us.
In one photo, Pon appears alone. But that's OK, she's paying tribute to David Bowie in Tokyo.
