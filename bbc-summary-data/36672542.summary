Women's Super League side Notts County have signed England internationals Jade Moore, Jo Potter and Lizzie Durack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moore, 25, and 31-year-old Potter, who both featured for England at last year's World Cup, have signed six-month deals after the pair bought out their contracts with Birmingham City.
Moore joined Birmingham in 2011, while Potter was in her third spell with Blues after rejoining in 2009.
Once-capped England goalkeeper Durack, 22, last played in the WSL for Everton.
Durack, whose contract length has not been disclosed, returns to the English game from Harvard University, where she studies human development regenerative biology.
The Australian-born stopper's only game for England's senior side came at the Cyprus Cup in 2014.
Potter and Moore, who have won 21 and 16 caps respectively, are reunited with three of their World Cup bronze-medal winning team-mates at Meadow Lane - Notts captain Laura Bassett, goalkeeper Carly Telford and striker Ellen White.
