Bachchan said he was "honoured" to be asked to carry the flame and that it was "a proud moment for me and the country".
The actor was part of a relay team carrying the torch.
The 69-year-old star has acted in more than 180 films and remains India's most popular actor.
"Honoured to be asked to carry the Olympic torch in London at Southwark around 10:30 BST," Bachchan tweeted on Wednesday evening.
The star is not the only Indian celebrity to be associated with the London Olympics.
Oscar-winning music composer AR Rahman has teamed up with Danny Boyle, artistic director of the opening ceremony, to compose a track for the pageant, reports say.
Rahman has written on his Facebook page that he has composed a "track in Punjabi celebrating the Indian influence in the UK".
"It's a part of a medley in the Olympic opening ceremony, according to Danny Boyle's creative wishes", he wrote.
