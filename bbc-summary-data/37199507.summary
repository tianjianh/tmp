[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Wishart 39, fired the weapon towards one officer as another hid behind a car for safety outside a bar in Leven.
CS spray was used to try and stop Wishart, who at one point jumped into the driver's seat of the police car.
He was eventually detained by the officers. The incident happened in May.
Wishart pled guilty to four charges - including assault and possessing the stun gun - at the High Court in Glasgow.
After being arrested, police also discovered Wishart was in possession of two knives.
Lord Boyd told Wishart: "Police officers who serve the community are entitled to the protection of the courts.
"You tried to threaten or intimidate them in a bid to prevent them carrying out their duty.
"I accept you did not intend to do any harm with the Taser - you were intent on using it to escape from the police."
