'Panini Cheapskates' Ronaldo moth work ends Euro 2016 sticker challenge

A couple whose "cack-handed" copies of football stickers became an unlikely hit has recreated the moment a moth landed on Cristiano Ronaldo's head in their uniquely "shoddy" fashion.

"Panini Cheapskates" Alex and Sian Pratchett hand-drew their own versions of the official Euro 2016 stickers.
And when a moth landed on Ronaldo's head during the final, the pair created a tribute in Microsoft Paint.
The result was "a good indication of the quality of the game", they said.
Internet users' imaginations were captured when the insect landed on top of the injured Portugal skipper's head during Sunday's "unspectacular" victory over France.
Swarms of moths plagued the Stade de France - after workers reportedly left lights switched on overnight.
The Pratchetts' take on the moment was captioned "Big Moth strikes again," in reference to a Smiths song of a similar name.
Earlier, the couple, from Oxford, completed their quest to draw 800 stickers before the final kicked off at 20:00 BST.
Their final portrait, Belgian winger Nacer Chadli, was finished with 13 minutes to spare.
They said: "We're tired - insanely, immeasurably tired - but we staggered over the line this afternoon in a blaze of shoddy pencil work and cack-handed colouring-in."
This year, the couple began their "Euro quest "on the opening day of the Euro 2016 games and have been posting images of their drawings on a blog.
The couple said more than Â£3,000 had been raised for charity in the process.
Mr Pratchett admitted the couple, who "have actual jobs and, in many ways, actual lives" had not got any better at drawing since 2014, describing their attempts as "uniformly awful".
As well as creating all 800 players, Mr and Mrs Pratchett have also pledged to sketch personalised pictures of the top 100 donors.
In 2014, Mr and Mrs Pratchett created all 639 stickers of the World Cup Panini album, while in 2015 the duo turned their hands to politics, sketching party leaders ahead of May's election.
