Former children's doctor Colin Ferrie pleads guilty to cocaine charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former children's doctor has been given a 12-month conditional discharge after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Ferrie, 52, of Waters Walk, Apperley Bridge, Bradford, previously worked at Leeds General Infirmary.
Co-accused, Scott Pendlebury, 26, of Daisy Fields, Bradford, also pleaded guilty to cocaine possession and was fined Â£230 at Leeds Magistrates' court.
The charges followed claims made in the Mail on Sunday newspaper last year.
Ferrie was a consultant paediatric neurologist, specialising in epilepsy, and worked for the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust at the time.
He has since left his post.
The General Medical Council said it did not comment on its own investigations which were ongoing but confirmed Dr Ferrie was "interim suspended".
Charges of possessing a Class C drug, denied by both men, were dismissed.
