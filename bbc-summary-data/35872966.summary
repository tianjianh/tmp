Midfielder Jeff Hendrick has been ruled out because of a shoulder problem and has returned to his club Derby County.
Harry Arter will miss the Dublin games because of an Achilles injury.
The Bournemouth player, who has only one Republic cap, has returned to his club for treatment.
Stoke City forward Walters sat out training sessions in Dublin over recent days.
"Jeff has got a shoulder injury that he has had to deal with for quite a number of weeks now so we thought it best going back and getting is sorted a club level," said Republic manager Martin O'Neill.
"Jon, I think he will be fit for Tuesday, he just thought he might be best to go home for a day or two. He should be back on Friday night to watch the game. He will definitely play on Tuesday.
"Robbie Keane sat out training again on Wednesday but there is no real problem. He will be okay and will be available for any of the two games."
