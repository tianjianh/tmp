[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a Grade II-listed library in Sheffield will become a cafe bar under plans approved by the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Walkley Library building, on the corner of South Road, will continue to house a library.
But True North Brew Company, which owns several pubs in the city including the York in Broomhill, plans to renovate and extend the 1904 building to accommodate a bar.
The plans were passed by Sheffield City Council on Monday.
Chris Reece, chair of the Walkley Carnegie Library charity, said it had been run by volunteers since November 2014.
He said the decision would allow the group "to concentrate on maintaining the service".
True North Brew Company plans to build a two storey rear extension with a mezzanine floor.
Mr Reece said although the library area would be reduced, increased opening hours and more events in the building would make it "vibrant".
True North Brew Company will address maintenance issues and implement health and safety legislation, such as creating level access to the building.
The front, currently the children's library, will remain a library while the cafe bar will be situated at the back in the new extension.
In July 2014 Walkley was one of 10 "associate" libraries to which the council committed to provide financial support.
He said: "The new arrangement means the library can finally receive the attention that this Grade II-listed building deserves."
Community groups objected to initial plans to create a bar in the library but Walkley Carnegie Group said it was the most sustainable way to keep the library.
