Muslim father loses circumcision court battle over sons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Muslim father has failed to persuade a judge to rule his sons should be circumcised.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man argued that circumcision would be in accordance with his religious beliefs.
But the boys' mother, who is separated from their father, disagreed.
At a Family Court hearing in Exeter, Mrs Justice Roberts said the boys, who are six and four, should first reach an age where they can make the decision for themselves.
The man had argued that it would be "in the children's best interests to allow them to be circumcised" in accordance with his "Muslim practice and religious beliefs".
His former partner "opposes that course until such time as the children have reached an age where they are competent to give consent to such a procedure," the judge added.
"There is no guarantee that these boys will wish to continue to observe the Muslim faith with the devotion demonstrated by their father, although that may very well be their choice.
"They are still very young and there is no way of anticipating at this stage how the different influences in their respective parental homes will shape and guide their development over the coming years."
Mrs Justice Roberts said she was deferring that decision "to the point where each of the boys themselves will make their individual choices once they have the maturity and insight to appreciate the consequences and longer-term effects of the decisions which they reach."
