[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 5-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Vaughan scored four goals in 20 minutes as Bury ended their winless run with victory against Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Nichols tapped Posh into a fourth-minute lead, only for Vaughan to level three minutes later.
The Shakers striker then fired in three more, becoming the first Bury player to score four in a game since Phil Stant in October 1995.
Substitute George Miller completed the scoring in the 71st minute as Bury romped to their first win in 21 games.
That looked unlikely when Rob Lainton parried a Gwion Edwards shot for Nichols to convert the rebound on four minutes. But Bury hit straight back when Vaughan fired into the top corner from a Scott Burgess pass.
Edwards and Paul Taylor then tested Lainton before Vaughan stooped to head home from Jacob Mellis' 16th-minute corner.
The former Everton, Huddersfield and Birmingham striker claimed his hat-trick after 24 minutes, firing home at the second attempt from Tom Pope's cross.
Yet Vaughan was not done there as, just three minutes later, he swept in Taylor Moore's low cross for his 14th of the season.
He even went close to a fifth goal either side of the break, while Posh substitutes Lee Angol and Marcus Madison struck the Bury bar.
The fifth goal arrived when visiting keeper Luke McGee came out to clear, only to kick the ball against Miler, who rolled it into the empty net.
