The PGA of America is ending its Grand Slam of Golf, the annual tournament featuring the year's major champions.

The organisation said the 36-hole event, which started in 1979, no longer "fits with today's golf landscape".
Last year's event was due to take place at a Donald Trump-owned course but cancelled following disparaging comments the US presidential candidate made about Mexican immigrants.
A PGA statement said: "The timing is right to discontinue the event."
It added: "When the PGA Grand Slam of Golf was launched in 1979, the golf world was much different than it is today. The PGA Tour's wrap-around schedule, the European Tour's Race to Dubai, plus other important international events, make the fall schedule very busy and hectic for the top players in the world.
"It had also become challenging to attract fans, television viewership and media interest."
The last Grand Slam of Golf, in October 2014, was won by that year's US Open champion, Germany's Martin Kaymer, in Bermuda. It also featured Masters winner Bubba Watson of the United States and Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy. McIlroy won both The Open and PGA Championship in 2014, which led to American Jim Furyk being invited to play.
