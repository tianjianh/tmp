An international women's ice hockey competition held at the Ice Bowl in Dumfries has been hailed for bringing an economic boost to the local area.

The Division 2A women's world championships event was the fourth International Ice Hockey Federation tournament to be held in the town.
It had previously staged Under 18 events for both men and women and an Under 20 championship.
The latest event was believed to have generated about £150,000.
The tournament started last week and finished on Sunday and saw Great Britain go up against Kazakhstan, Korea, Poland, New Zealand and Croatia.
Team GB lost its final match against Kazakhstan 2-0 after winning all four of its previous games.
Colin Smyth, of Dumfries and Galloway Council, said the event had attracted investment, including £35,000 from the local authority.
He added: "In return we have brought a wonderful week of world class ice hockey to Dumfries which will inspire more young people and women to take up the sport, thus boosting Dumfries' reputation even further as a hot spot for ice hockey.
"Our £35,000 contribution to the tournament costs resulted in a minimum economic impact of £150,000 plus to the regional economy."
