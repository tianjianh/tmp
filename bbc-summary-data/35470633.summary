The 99-year-old was unable to travel from her home in France to collect her Oldie of the Year award in person at Tuesday's ceremony in London.
But in a recorded message she said she was "utterly delighted" the judges deemed there was "sufficient snap in my celery" to win the accolade.
Other award recipients included Aung San Suu Kyi and Germaine Greer.
Suu Kyi, who leads Myanmar's National League for Democracy party and spent 15 years under house arrest, also accepted in absentia.
In a signed letter she wrote: "I must admit that I have not had much time recently to reflect on what it means to be old. I was fortunate to have been able to enjoy a retirement experience somewhat earlier than most."
The tongue-in cheek awards are given out annually by The Oldie, set up by former Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams to take an irreverent stand against ageism.
Previous winners include Sir Roger Bannister (2015), Mary Berry (2014), Joanna Lumley (2010) and the Queen Mother (2001).
De Havilland said:  "It is deeply gratifying to thus find myself in the company of the Queen Mother, whose record I have long wanted to match as well as that of so many other distinguished recipients."
She shared her Oldie of the Year award with 101-year-old former barrister and member of the House of Lords, Jeremy Hutchinson.
This year's judges included broadcasters and writers Gyles Brandreth and Libby Purves and TV producer John Lloyd.
De Havilland, who will turn 100 in July, is the oldest living Oscar winner.
She earned the first of her five Oscar nominations for her role as Melanie Hamilton in Gone with the Wind.  She won best actress Academy awards for 1946's To Each His Own and 1949's The Heiress during a film career that spanned 53 years.
Her sister was the Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine, who died in 2013.
