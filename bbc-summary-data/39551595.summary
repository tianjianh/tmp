Officers have logged more than 150 incidents since a pilot scheme in June.
It is hoped the scheme will help them understand patterns of violence and how to best to support victims.
Police have had extra training to increase their understanding of the different needs of people who find themselves in abusive situations.
Det Ch Insp Myra Ball said: "It means where there are same-sex domestic abuse situations or the sexuality of a person has caused a domestic abuse incident, we can say we've got somebody from a specialist service who will understand the complexities around any LGBT matters and be able to support that victim."
Lucy Lamb from the LGBT Foundation in Manchester said domestic abuse could happen "in any relationship" and "a lot of people are missing out on vital support that they might need".
"It's really difficult for us to get a clear picture of how many lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people are experiencing domestic abuse," she added.
"It's about giving us some clear statistics, giving us some data, so that services can then be developed and tailored to the needs of people in those communities."
