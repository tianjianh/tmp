The cost of attending Premier League football has come down in the first season of a record £8bn global TV rights deal, a BBC study has found.

The Price of Football, the biggest study of its kind in Europe, looked at prices at 223 clubs.
More than two thirds of ticket prices across the UK have been either cut or frozen for the 2016-17 season.
However, an away ticket in the Championship can now be more expensive than for a Premier League match.
This is because top-flight clubs have capped prices for visiting fans at £30.

Malcolm Clarke, chairman of the Football Supporters' Federation, said: "On their current £8.3bn deal, the Premier League could afford to let every single fan in free for every game and still have as much money as they had under the previous deal.
"That gives you an idea of the scale of the amount of money they have got."
The Premier League said in a statement: "Clubs are listening to their fans and working hard to make sure that Premier League football is accessible as well as competitive and compelling."
The study also found replica shirt prices have increased year-on-year and half of top-flight clubs put up the price of their junior shirts.
For the first time, we asked clubs for the percentage of male and female season-ticket holders. In the Premier League, 14 clubs responded, with Southampton revealing one in five of their season-ticket holders are women, while at Liverpool the figure is 11%.
Other findings include:
With the bumper 2016-2019 Premier League TV rights deal coming into effect - which includes £5bn for domestic rights and another £3bn globally - top-flight clubs will each benefit by a minimum of £100m.
In this year's study, we contacted 223 clubs across 23 leagues in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and the continent.
We have analysed ticket prices in six categories - cheapest matchday, dearest matchday, cheapest away ticket, dearest away ticket, cheapest and dearest season tickets - as well as teas, pies, programmes and junior and adult shirt prices.
The rate of inflation over the past year, as measured by the Consumer Price index, is 0.9%, and over the six years of study it is 15.65%.

English Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey:
"It's clear to see from the recent research that EFL clubs are working very hard to ensure home and away ticket pricing continues to be as competitive and affordable as possible.
"In addition to the BBC's findings, we know from our own analysis that EFL clubs have reached a significant landmark this season, in attracting over 500,000 season-ticket holders across the three divisions for the first time.
"Quite rightly, clubs make the final decisions on pricing models and we will continue to work with them to ensure the positive trends highlighted are maintained and that football attendances across the three divisions of the EFL continue to thrive."
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster:
"All 42 SPFL clubs work tirelessly to ensure they have a pricing structure which provides as much value for money as possible, especially for families to help attract the next generation of supporters.
"We know that while much progress has been made in three years there is much more that can and needs to be done to help make Scottish football as attractive as it can be to existing and potential customers."
Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke:
"We believe it's a positive thing that almost three quarters of ticket prices have been reduced or frozen. That's thanks in no small part to pressure from football supporters up and down the country.
"There is no room for complacency, however, with some Premier League clubs charging far too much for their season tickets and away ticket prices in the Championship being the most expensive in the country. We will remain vigilant and continue our campaigning to make football affordable for this generation of supporters and the next."
The Premier League:
"Clubs value their fans and appreciate their support. Full and vibrant grounds are a significant part of what makes the Premier League a great football competition.
"Research we published only last week, using club data and analysis by leading professional services company EY, detailed not only the price of tickets, but the number purchased at each price. The research also found that four million tickets are discounted from the publicly listed price through early-bird renewals and concessions.
"The data demonstrated the real prices being paid by fans and what volume of tickets are being sold at what levels, finding that 56% of fans in Premier League stadiums this season will pay £30 or less per game with the average price paid being £31."
Burnley chief executive David Baldwin:
"What's very evident about Burnley as a town is that it is very much a one-club town. You very rarely see other club colours being worn around the town. It is very much claret and blue.
"We don't take that for granted because what we have to be conscious of is what is affordable to people. You don't want them to fall out of the love of football.
"We've established this year a fans' forum so fans can discuss ticket prices for next year and we already have a number of supporter consultant groups that we discuss our pricing policy with before it goes forward for a recommendation."
Shadow Sports Minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan:
"Football should be accessible to everyone, from Sunday League to Premier League.
"I am pleased to see the average cost of Premier League tickets come down this year, but with the amount of television and sponsorship money being pumped into football - more needs to be done.
"Despite the small reduction in ticket prices, the vast majority of fans are priced out of football. Children look up to these players, they are role models for millions - yet it costs £40 for a child to wear the same shirt."
