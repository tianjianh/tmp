Dungannon company Dunbia sees rise in pre-tax profits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pre tax profit at the County Tyrone-based meat group Dunbia rose by 40% to £6.6m in the year to March 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turnover at the group was up by 8%, from £764m to £827m.
A note in the accounts said the "encouraging" growth in turnover was driven by the full year impact of new facilities.
Dunbia has plants across Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland as well as Northern Ireland.
During the year staff numbers increased from 3,256 to 3,605.
The Dungannon group, which is among Northern Ireland's largest food businesses, is owned by brothers Jim and Jack Dobson.
They have recently begun a process that could lead to the sale of the business after receiving "several serious expressions of interest from would-be investors over the past two years".
The company said it remains business as usual while options are explored.
A note in the accounts said "the strategy for the coming period will continue to be that of product development and volume growth".
