[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Doig's Swamped was one of a number of works sold at Christie's auction house in New York.
Doig, who now lives in Trinidad, broke a personal record with his 1990 painting featuring vivid reds and yellows in a reflection on a lake.
The previous record for a Doig piece had been $18m (£11.5m).
On the same evening, Alberto Giacometti's life-size Pointing Man set the record for most expensive sculpture, fetching $141.3m (£90.7m).
The buyers of Giacometti's piece and Pablo Picasso's Women of Algiers (Version O) have chosen to remain anonymous.
The Picasso set a new world record for the most expensive artwork to be sold at auction after reaching $179m (£115m).
Also at Christie's a painting of the Houses of Parliament at sunset, by Monet at the turn of the 20th Century, sold for $40.5m (£26m).
Doig studied in London during the 1980s and won the Whitechapel Artist award in 1991. Three years later he was nominated for the Turner Prize.
Having returned to Trinidad in 2000, after spending part of his childhood there, he said his paintings had become "more decorative" and "more open".
