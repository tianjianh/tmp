[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Namibian boxer has been arrested by Brazilian police on suspicion of attempting to sexually assault a maid in the Rio de Janeiro Olympic village.

She alleged Jonas Junius, 22, had grabbed her and tried to kiss her. She also accused him of offering her money to have sex.
Junius is competing in the light-welterweight division.
Last week, a Moroccan boxer was arrested by police after allegedly assaulting two female cleaners.
A Brazilian judge has ordered Hassan Saada to be detained for 15 days, pending an investigation, media reports said.
This could mean Saada is unable to take part in the Games.
Junius, Namibia's flag-bearer in the opening ceremony last Friday, is scheduled to fight French boxer Hassan Anzille on 11 August.
But that could also be in doubt if he has to remain in custody.
Athletes from 206 nations and a refugee team are in Brazil to compete in 28 sports. They will be watched by a global audience of billions.
The build-up has been dominated by a Russian doping scandal, the Zika virus and issues with the city's security, infrastructure and venues.
