[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gretna woman banned after cross-border police chase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gretna woman who led police on a cross-border chase hitting up to 80mph in a 30mph limit has been banned from driving for five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Williams, 43, admitted a charge of driving dangerously on various roads.
A court heard how the police chase started at Rigg in Dumfries and Galloway and ended up outside Carlisle.
In addition to her ban, Williams was also ordered to carry out 300 hours' unpaid work.
She was put under supervision for 12 months and ordered to resit her test before she can regain her driving licence.
At Dumfries Sheriff Court, she admitted driving dangerously on various roads north of the border and also on the M6 and at Junction 44 near Carlisle in February.
The chase by an unmarked police car began in Scotland where Williams hit 51mph in the 30mph zone at Rigg on the Annan to Gretna road.
She then reached 80mph in the 30mph limit at Gretna, took a roundabout in the wrong direction and travelled at up to 80mph in a section of roadworks on the M6.
Williams also repeatedly failed to stop at red traffic lights and hit a crash barrier before the chase came to an end outside Carlisle.
A solicitor said she had not been concentrating and was initially unaware the police were pursuing her.
The court was told she had also been caught driving while disqualified after her initial court appearance, prompting a warning from Sheriff George Jamieson.
"If you dare to drive again while under a ban you will be sent straight to prison," he told her.
"Your behaviour was appalling, putting people in the road at danger," he added.
