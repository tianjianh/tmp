After sticking to the strategy of doing one thing well for a long time, Twitter is announcing changes to its service thick and fast.

The latest features to be announced by the social network are group messaging and video.
As promised in November, Twitter is now allowing users to direct message up to 20 people at once.
Users will also be able to film, edit and share video clips of up to 30 seconds in length.
The announcement will be seen as an attempt to boost the amount of time people spend on Twitter.
Group chat and video sharing are services which have proved hugely popular on instant messaging platforms such as Facebook-owned WhatsApp.
Snapchat has also capitalized on short-form video-sharing, boasting 700 million photos and videos sent daily.
As competition grows from other social networks, Twitter is clearly keen to keep its users engaged.
Announcing the news in a blog post, Twitter said group messages would provide "more options for how and with whom you communicate on Twitter".
Twitter will now allow Android and iOS users to record clips up to 30 seconds long.
The feature is in addition to Twitter's own short-form video-sharing app Vine, featuring videos up to six seconds in length.
Twitter's user numbers have grown steadily, with 284 million users now logging on at least once a day.
The company still needs to convince investors it can grow further, as its share price has fallen by around a third over the last year.
