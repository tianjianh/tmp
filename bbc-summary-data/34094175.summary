[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rangers 5-0 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers stretched their lead at the top of the Championship with a performance that demoralised Raith Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Wallace established an early advantage from a well-worked free-kick, with James Tavernier adding a second just before half-time when he latched onto Nathan Oduwa's flick.
The comprehensive victory was secured through Barrie McKay's effort from close range.
And Martyn Waghorn increased the advantage with two penalties.
Raith were starved of possession and hope as Rangers attacked with relentless intent.
The visitors to Ibrox could not cope with the extent and variety of the home side's passing and movement, spending most of the game camped around their own penalty area and defending desperately.
The breadth of Rangers' attacking options left Raith Rovers diminished, although particular features were evident, such as central players looking to switch the ball to either flank and swift, one-touch passing in the final third.
Wallace and Tavernier were marauding figures on the flanks and it was no coincidence that both struck in the opening half.
They regularly overlapped and added dimension to attacks, with Wallace opening the scoring with a curling right-foot shot after a free-kick routine ended with Waghorn slipping the ball to the left-back.
Raith were hemmed in, and Wallace and Waghorn both came close to extending the lead.
Further goals were inevitable, though, and Tavernier obliged with his sixth of the season, after playing a one-two with Oduwa - whose return pass was superbly crafted - then finishing coolly inside the area.
It has been a feature of Rangers' play this season that the team refuses to ease off.
Oduwa's eye-catching individual skills became more prominent after the break, with a slaloming run from deep inside the Raith half taking out a succession of defenders before he squared the ball for Waghorn inside the six-yard box.
The ball scuttled around the area after it was blocked, but then ran to the increasingly impressive McKay, who slid to turn it over the line from only a yard out.
Waghorn might have been frustrated by the spurned opportunity to join the scorers, and he took matters into his own hands.
After surging into the penalty area, he leaned into the Raith defender Lewis Toshney and fell to the ground, with the referee Brian Colvin pointing to the spot. The award was generous, but Waghorn was ruthless as he converted it deftly.
Five minutes later, another Oduwa run bewildered the Raith defenders, and Toshney clattered him to the ground. Waghorn tucked away a second penalty to secure a 5-0 victory - the fourth time Rangers have scored five times this season.
Raith managed one shot on target, early in the second half, with Wes Foderingham tipping James Craigen's effort over the bar.
Otherwise, though, the visitors were marginalised by Rangers' dominance of the ball, their attacking ambition and the fluidity of their movement.
Already, Mark Warburton's side has established an authority over the rest of the Championship, winning each of their opening games.
