Andy Murray wristband auctioned by Duchess of Cornwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wristband thrown into the crowd at Wimbledon by Andy Murray, which ended up in the hands of the Duchess of Cornwall, is being sold for charity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The duchess was watching the Scot's second-round straight-set victory over Dutchman Robin Haase on Wimbledon's Court One on 2 July.
One of the wristbands was caught by All England Club chairman Philip Brook, who was next to her.
All proceeds will go to the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust.
The duchess has been its patron for the past 10 years.
The wristband, which is signed by Murray, is being auctioned online and is being "safely kept at Clarence House" until it has a new owner.
Speaking after the match, Murray said he had met the duchess shortly afterwards.
"[She] opened up her bag and my wristband was in there, so [Philip Brook] obviously had passed it over to her. It was very sweaty."
The auction post says the duchess has decided to put it up for auction for "fans all over the world in the hope that it will raise money for charity".
It adds: "This year marks the 10th anniversary of Her Royal Highness's patronage of the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust and the charity was personally selected by Andy Murray to benefit from this auction."
The charity aims to improve animal health, welfare and care.
The autographed wristband comes with a certificate of authenticity from Richard Lewis, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and Croquet Club.
It also includes a framed photograph of the moment it was thrown into the crowd of spectators.
