Labour calls for United Nations safe zones in Syria

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour is to call for the United Nations to set up safe havens in Syria that could be maintained by no-fly zones and peacekeeping troops.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Party sources, though, insist that no British troops would be involved.
Sources near shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn say they are not ruling out backing an extension of UK air strikes against Islamic State to Syria.
Leader Jeremy Corbyn is opposed to such action, but some Labour MPs have told the BBC they would defy him in a vote.
The government is expected to draw up proposals within the next few weeks for missile attacks in Syria.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said parliament needs to "rethink the absurdity" of RAF jets being able to bomb IS targets in Iraq but not Syria.
In July, acting Labour leader Harriet said Islamic State had to be "stopped" and Labour would look "very seriously" at any proposals brought forward by the government.
She said the situation was different from that in 2013, when Labour voted against air strikes against the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, because IS was a terrorist organisation.
New leader and veteran anti-war campaigner Mr Corbyn has made clear his opposition to the move - but the BBC understands the party has not changed its position since his election.
Sources close to Mr Benn say they will examine any proposals from the government that have a clear legal basis and objectives.
More than 200,000 Syrians have been killed since civil war broke out in 2011. The conflict between rebel forces and the Assad government has been compounded by the rise of terror group Islamic State, which took control of swathes of the country in 2014.
Millions of people have been displaced - some are living as refugees in the region, while many others are attempting to reach Europe.
Prime Minister David Cameron is meeting world leaders at the UN in New York to discuss the Syrian crisis.
The BBC understands that on Monday, Mr Benn and Mr Corbyn will urge him to push for a UN Chapter 7 Resolution.
That could see Western troops on the ground in Syria but only in a peacekeeping capacity.
The plan is similar to an idea put forward by the Conservative former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, and backed by Boris Johnson last week.
Mr Mitchell told the BBC that creating "humanitarian safe enclaves" was the best way to protect the Syrian people and stop the refugee crisis that stemmed from the conflict there.
He said "ideally" Britain would not be required to put troops on the ground, and instead personnel from the UN, EU, Arab League and others should be involved.
Mr Cameron is expected to call for a renewed diplomatic drive to end Syria's civil war during his UN meetings.
UK officials have signalled that he will drop his opposition to Mr Assad playing a role in any transitional government, but the prime minister has insisted Syria's president "can't be part of Syria's future".
Meanwhile, France has carried out its first air strikes against IS militants in Syria.
