Jason Buchan, 35, and David Stead, 47, have been missing for a week after their boat capsized close to the village of East Wemyss.
A third man, Birrell Stewart, 30, was pronounced dead after being picked up from the water on 10 August.
Police said forensic examinations were under way after the remains were found on beaches at St Andrews.
Ch Insp Adrian Annandale said the first discovery was made by a member of the public at about 11:30 on Sunday. The second was found at East Sands at 10:00 on Monday.
He said that family liaison officers had informed the relatives of the two missing fishermen and would continue to maintain contact with them throughout the investigation.
Police have been continuing to carry out searches and specialist divers from the force's marine unit were deployed to the East Wemyss area over the weekend.
