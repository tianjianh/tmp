Speaking to Paul O'Grady on his Radio 2 show, the veteran singer said he "still wonders if anybody's going to show up".
"When you start your career you have no concept about longevity, for me you don't know what's going to happen, so how it's gone on I've no idea."
The star's 75th Birthday Tour starts in Killarney, Ireland, on 26 September and ends in London on 18 October.
One of his concerts at the Royal Albert Hall will take place on his birthday on 14 October.
"I'm just going to work on my birthday and normally I try not to do a concert actually on my birthday but this time I thought what the heck, you know, I'm 75 and so I'll do my birthday night there.
"I've never tried to hide my age anyway and this year, apart from telling everybody I'm 75, you know I've got an album coming out and it's called 75 At 75 because they're putting 75 tracks on this record package."
The interview was aired almost exactly a year after the BBC broadcast a police raid at Sir Cliff's home in Berkshire in relation to an alleged sexual assault of a boy under 16 in the 1980s.
Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged and said the claims against him were "absurd and untrue" and he had "never, in my life, assaulted anyone".
The singer also spoke to O'Grady about his shock after the death of his friend Cilla Black.
"Everybody I've talked to seems to be absolutely gobsmacked. And I still can't get my head around the fact that Cilla's not with us. Well I think she'll always be with us, but you know what I mean.
"There are just some people, and Cilla's certainly one of them, where you thought she's just going to be around here all the time."
