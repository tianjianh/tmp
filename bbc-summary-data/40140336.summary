[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Godleman's third century of the season earned Derbyshire a healthy first-innings lead over Division Two leaders Notts at Trent Bridge.

Resuming on 52-2, the Derbyshire skipper added 112 for the third wicket with Wayne Madsen (56).
Luke Wood removed Godleman (121), but Daryn Smit (32) and Tom Taylor (32) helped the visitors to 363 all out.
Smit's stunning catch removed India Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara to leave Notts 67-2, still 67 adrift at stumps.
Nottinghamshire assistant head coach Paul Franks told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"We are behind the game, let's not kid ourselves. I think Derbyshire have played better cricket than would belie their position in the table and we've not been at our best. Let's not hide from that.
"We didn't do enough yesterday with the bat to get into a position where we could then capitalise with the ball.
"We created a chance to dismiss Billy Godleman last night and didn't take it and he made us pay with a hundred, so credit to them for building a very good first innings score and they are now putting us under pressure."
Wayne Madsen told BBC Radio Derby:
"We've competed well yesterday and today. We are happy that we are now in a position where going forward we have a decent chance in this game if we play some good cricket tomorrow and on Monday.
"We knew we wanted to start well and get as close to their score as possible, but if we could get through the first hour with no damage, then good; and that's what we did.
"Our partnership set us up for the day and we were able to take it past them."
