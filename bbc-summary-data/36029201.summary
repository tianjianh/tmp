Leighanne Mouser, 27, of Spondon, Derbyshire, who became trapped behind the barriers, was only able to escape when a CCTV operator spotted her and activated the barrier.
Mouser pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Derby Magistrate's Court.
In addition to the two-year ban, she was ordered to pay Â£85 in court costs.
Following the sentencing, a spokesman for British Transport Police said her actions had been "unbelievable".
"She was extremely lucky that a train was not coming at the time or the outcome would have been unthinkable," he said.
"Most accidents are as a result of impatience - not being prepared to wait and trying to beat the train. For the sake of 60 seconds, a little patience can prevent lives being ruined."
Mouser was also ordered to take "an extended retest".
