An appeal for birthday cards for a 99-year-old Sheffield woman who has no surviving family has gone viral.

A BBC Radio Sheffield Facebook post about Winnie Blagden, who is 100 on 31 May, has been seen by millions.
Thousands of people have responded, pledging everything from a fish and chip supper to 100 pink roses.
A cabaret entertainer said he would attend Mrs Blagden's party and a beauty salon has offered a pamper package.
Mrs Blagden, who never had children, has no family following the death of her husband George and has little contact with the outside world apart from her carers.
She has lived in Sheffield her entire life, working at a city department store when she was younger.
An accessories company has promised to send a vintage china teacup and saucer for a birthday cuppa and cards are being posted from as far afield as the US.
A pizza company has offered to feed Mrs Blagden and her friends on the big day and Jameson's Cafe & Tea Rooms in Sheffield said they would make a birthday cake.
Serenta HomeCare, which looks after Mrs Blagden, said: "She calls us her little family; we are absolutely overwhelmed by your kindness.
"She truly is a very special lady and you will all help to make her day as special as she is."
Radio Sheffield plans to present her with the cards and gifts on 28 May.
Cards can be dropped into the BBC Sheffield offices in person, or posted to BBC Radio Sheffield, 54 Shoreham Street, Sheffield, S1 4RS.
