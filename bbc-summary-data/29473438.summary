Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck has hit back at the critics who have questioned his goalscoring record.

The 23-year-old has fired four goals in his last three games for Arsenal, after his Â£16m move from Manchester United.
It is the perfect riposte to those who have suggested the frontman isn't clinical enough, including United manager Louis van Gaal.

"If you are getting goals and a run of games in your preferred position, your confidence will grow," Welbeck said.
Asked to explain why he allowed Welbeck to join Premier League rivals Arsenal on transfer deadline day, Van Gaal had pointed to the striker's record in front of goal.
"He played three seasons for the first team, but he doesn't have the record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney, and that is the standard," the Dutchman said.
Welbeck netted 29 times in 142 United appearances, compared to Rooney's 217 goals in 445 matches and Van Persie's 48 in 78 games.
But the striker was used out of position for the majority of his time at Old Trafford, often playing on the wing.
At Arsenal, he is leading the line and says that has made all the difference.
"Obviously people can say I have not scored enough goals, but you stick the best strikers on the wing in a four-man midfield and see if they score," said Welbeck, who hit a Champions League hat-trick against Galatasaray on Wednesday.
"Nobody can really criticise my finishing because they don't really see me playing in a forward position too often.
"But now I am getting into these positions I want to be sticking the ball in the back of the net. I am sure it's the same with every other striker."
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he had been impressed with the manner in which Welbeck has started his Arsenal career.
"You can see that he's improving," said Wenger. "That is very positive and there's a lot more to come from him,"
Arsenal face Premier League leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, before Welbeck turns his attention to England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.
The striker led the line in England's opening qualifier last month in Switzerland and scored both goals in a 2-0 win.
