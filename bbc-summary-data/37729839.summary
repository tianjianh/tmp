Joe Reilly, 43, a father of one, was shot a number of times in the chest and died at the scene at Glenwood Court, Poleglass.
Two other people in the house at the time were told to lie on the kitchen floor while the shooting took place.
The shooting, reported to police at about 20:15 BST on Thursday, was the second in the area in less than a week.
Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery said:  "It's really difficult to know how to describe what happened last night, the adjectives brutal, senseless and barbaric are inadequate.
"This was a cold-blooded, summary execution of a man in his own house.
"At this early stage of my investigation I have no motive for Joe Reilly's murder and I will keep a completely open mind as to why has been killed."
Det Ch Inspt Montgomery confirmed Mr Reilly was known to police and had a criminal record.
He added he needed to speak to three children who were seen in the area as the gunmen ran away.
Neighbours of Mr Reilly rushed over to try to help on Thursday night.
They described the victim as a quiet man who rarely left his home.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said there were "distressing scenes" as his family members arrived at the police cordon on Thursday night.
She said: "This brutal killing has achieved nothing other than plunging another family into grief and despair.
"This is a good community and there's no support for this."
Speaking to Good Morning Ulster about the murder, SDLP MLA Alex Attwood, said: "A gunman or gunmen turned up at a house and at least two shots were fired.
"The result is that one man is dead. His family are in deep distress and the community is tangibly shocked and shaken."
He said those involved "brutally undermined the rule of law".
Alliance MLA Trevor Lunn said he "totally condemned" the murder.
He said: "This follows another shooting in the same area last week and has now left a family without a loved one through the evil actions of others.
"My deepest condolences go to the family and friends of this man. The local community will be rightly shocked by this murder."
People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said he was "deeply disturbed by this senseless and unjustifiable attack".
Last Sunday, another man was shot several times in the leg in a paramilitary-style attack in Glenwood Drive and on Wednesday a man was shot in the leg in Dungiven, County Londonderry.
