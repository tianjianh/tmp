Paramedics found the 17-year-old when they were called to High Street, Walthamstow, shortly after 23:30 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital but died. He is the ninth teenager to be fatally stabbed or shot in London this year.
The Met Police said the victim was walking along the road with friends when they were approached by two men on bikes at the junction of Buxton Road.
The teenager was stabbed during an altercation.
Det Ch Insp Matt Bonner added: "At this stage we are investigating whether the two suspects left the area on bicycles. If you were in the area last night and saw anything that may help us, or you have information that will assist, please get in touch."
Officers are awaiting formal identification, but next of kin have been informed. No arrests have been made.
The victim was the sixth teenager to have died this year from stab wounds, while the other three teenagers were shot.
BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said there had been 29 fatal stabbings in London this year, including the six teenagers, compared to 23 by this time in 2016.
The latest victim was the second to be fatally stabbed in the city in 48 hours, with the incident coming after the death of a 23-year-old man, who was found unconscious by police in Waterloo Road, Uxbridge, west London, early on Saturday.
Last week, the Met Police launched the latest phase in its campaign to crack down on knife crime.
During the week, 393 arrests were made as part of Operation Sceptre, including 73 for possession of an offensive weapon/knife and 144 stop and search arrests.
The Met Police said the taskforce had been created to tackle an increase in knife crime across London, with about 100 officers deployed to knife crime hotspots.
According to official statistics released last month, knife crime in London increased by 24% in the year up to April, with 12,074 recorded offences.
Knife crime that resulted in an injury also increased, with a rise of 21% to 4,415 recorded incidents.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, said carrying knives on London's streets would not be tolerated.
He said: "My message today is clear: if you carry a knife in London, we will catch you and arrest you."
