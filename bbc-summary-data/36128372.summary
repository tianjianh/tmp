Facebook tributes have described the deaths as "heartbreaking".
Friends have left messages on a Facebook page for the Hartlepool Billiards and Snooker group, of which Mr Crompton was a member.
Colin Harrison wrote: "Heartbreaking news about one of the league's top players.
"John Crompton and two of his children were tragically killed in a road accident in France.
"Thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. very talented and well liked man. RIP mate."
Brian Trueman added: "Tragic tragic news, a family ripped apart far too young. I'm deeply shocked."
The children's school issued a statement.
Lee Walker, headteacher at Hartlepool's Barnard Grove Primary, said the school was in "total shock" and that prayers and thoughts were with the family.
He added: "Morgan was a Year 4 pupil who was an extremely popular member of his class, as well as the school in general.
"His sense of humour, fun and positive attitude brought life and joy to all.
"Evie-Lily was in our nursery and was the most kind-hearted and caring girl you could ever wish to meet.
"The pupils and staff are heartbroken and we are all helping each other to come to terms with this devastating news."
An appeal fund has also been set up for the surviving family members by Laura Austwicke, who urged people to pray for their recovery.
She wrote: "We are aware that there is another GoFundMe page set up in euros; however we'd like to set up another page in the UK for those wanting to donate in GBP."
The family's Nissan may have lost control after the driver fell asleep or became distracted, investigators have said.
In an interview with the France3 TV channel, a member of the emergency services said two of the children were dead when they arrived and Mr Crompton was trapped.
He was said to have died from a heart attack minutes after he was released from the wreckage.
Cleveland Police said it was assisting the French authorities over the collision, and liaising with the Foreign Office.
