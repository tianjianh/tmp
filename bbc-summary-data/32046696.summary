Eight people have been arrested as part of an international investigation into the supply of 'skunk' cannabis into Northern Ireland.

Officers recovered £800,000 worth of the drug during 10 searches in Belfast, Greenisland, Bangor, Newtownards and Ballywalter. Six people were arrested.
Two people were also arrested in the Prato and Bologna areas of Italy.
Police said those arrested were believed to be "significant members" of a crime gang.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the gang had been involved in money laundering and drugs trafficking activities.
The six people arrested in Northern Ireland were four men and two women, with ages ranging from 26 years to 33 years old.
They are being questioned on suspicion of the importation of cannabis and conspiracy to supply cannabis and money laundering.
Three searches were carried out in the Prato and Bologna areas of Italy.
The PSNI is the lead investigator in the operation, which involved officers from the Italian Carabiniere and the National Crime Agency.
The officer leading the investigation, Det Insp Andy Dunlop from the PSNI's organised crime branch, said: "We believe we have established the source of a major supply of herbal cannabis trafficked into Northern Ireland.
"This is a substantial multi-agency international investigation which has involved various investigative tactics and methods - resulting in these searches, seizures and arrests.
"We have seized £800,000 of herbal cannabis but our enquiries lead us to believe that much more has already been sent from Italy to Northern Ireland.
"In recent months, officers in organised crime branch and local districts have seized £1.2m worth of herbal cannabis as part of this operation."
The senior officer said it was a "developing investigation".
"We are maintaining close contact with our colleagues in the Italian Carabiniere and the National Crime Agency as well as a number of other law enforcement agencies in the UK and Ireland," he added.
Police said the 'skunk' variety of cannabis could be "particularly dangerous" because it could significantly increase a user's likelihood of experiencing a psychotic episode.
