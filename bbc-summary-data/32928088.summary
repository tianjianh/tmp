Patricia Swiggs described the "absolutely terrible" moment when the girl's mother brought her into her home in Whitecross after she was hurt.
The girl, 4, is stable in hospital with "serious internal injuries".
Police have not commented on details, but a man, believed to be the girl's father, died at the scene on Thursday.
Mrs Swiggs said she was inside her house at the hamlet near Polruan when she heard cries for help and went outside to find the girls' mother with the child in her arms.
"She said 'Please help me, help me'.  She said 'Her father has stabbed her and I don't know what he's done to himself, he's in lying on the floor'," Mrs Swiggs explained.
She said she called an ambulance before attending to the girl in the kitchen.
"I had to get a tea towel, which was the quickest thing," she said.
"She was absolutely looking terrible."
"The ambulance came first, then two air ambulances came and loads and loads of police.
"They were everywhere. We had to move our kitchen table out on the patio to make room" she said.
Mrs Swiggs' husband Edgar added they "hadn't slept for the night" afterwards.
Devon and Cornwall Police would not comment on how the girl was injured, but a spokesman confirmed they were not looking for anyone else following the incident, which is under investigation.
"The girl was airlifted to Derriford Hospital with serious internal injuries," he said.
"She's been operated on overnight so her condition is stable, we believe. The man was treated at the scene and unfortunately he died at the scene".
