Sherwood Forest fracking fears prompt protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have taken part in a protest against plans to survey Sherwood Forest for shale gas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chemicals giant Ineos wants to inspect part of the ancient Nottinghamshire forest to see if there is potential for fracking.
Protestors fear the surveys could lead to fracking in the forest or on on land in nearby Edwinstowe.
Thoresby Estate, which owns the site, had already said it will not agree to any shale gas well heads on its land.
What is fracking and why is it controversial?
The surveys came to light in Forestry Commission documents, which Friends of the Earth received under the Freedom of Information Act.
Pauline Meechan, from Frack Free Sherwood and Edwinstowe, said: "If there is enough awareness and understanding of the long term problems associated with this whole [shale gas] industry, then people may well start to put pressure on government to say 'we don't want you backing this'."
The government gave Ineos licences to explore for shale gas on a million acres of land across the UK.
As part of this, the company wants to carry out seismic imaging surveys at Sherwood Forest and other locations.
It said it was "exploring the viability" of shale gas across the country and its seismic imaging surveys "do not include fracking in any form".
The RSPB, which will manage the entire Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve from 2018, opposes fracking but does not object to seismic imaging surveys in principle.
The conservation charity said surveys must be done in a way that did not disturb breeding birds.
