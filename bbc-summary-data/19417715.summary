[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mexico judge orders arrest of ex-Governor Yarrington

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Mexican judge has issued an arrest warrant for a former state governor for allegedly fomenting drug trafficking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tomas Yarrington, who was the governor of the northern state of Tamaulipas from 1999 until 2005, is suspected of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from Mexican drug cartels.
Attorney-General Marisela Morales asked Interpol for help with his arrest.
Mr Yarrington's lawyer said his client was innocent and the charges were politically motivated.
The Mexican arrest warrant comes three months after two civil suits were filed against Mr Yarrington in the United States alleging that he had laundered money for Mexican drug cartels by investing in US property.
Mr Yarrington is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whose candidate Enrique Pena Nieto came first in the 1 July presidential election.
In May, Mr Yarrington was suspended by the PRI pending the outcome of the suits filed against him.
Ms Morales said the whereabouts of Mr Yarrington, who was last seen in public in May, were not currently known.
