The 29-year-old defender has not played since undergoing knee surgery last November and had hoped to be fit in time for the new campaign.
But after suffering discomfort and pain he required a further operation.
"There was some damage in the kneecap and a bit of bone had to be shaved off," said physio Tony Flynn.
