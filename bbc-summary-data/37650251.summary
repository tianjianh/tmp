Former Barcelona midfielder Xavi believes Pep Guardiola "can change the mentality of English football" during his time at Manchester City.

Xavi, 36, is currently playing for Al Sadd SC but won 14 major honours under Guardiola at Barcelona over four years.
He told BBC World Football: "If there is one person who can change the mentality of English players, of English football, it's Pep Guardiola.
"He is one of the best coaches. He could do a big revolution."

Guardiola won his first 10 games in charge of City before suffering a first defeat at Tottenham before the international break.
But Xavi - who left Barcelona in 2015 after winning his fourth Champions League title to play in Qatar - has seen enough from the club's early season form to suggest that Guardiola can make a big difference.
"If you see the games of Manchester City you can see his style," Xavi said.
"As a player he was a big reference for my career, and as a coach.
"We made history with him in Barcelona. Barcelona always have the best coaches but Guardiola made a revolution; not only at Barcelona but across the world.
"When you see him on the bench you can see his passion for football. I know him and I know he can do it."
