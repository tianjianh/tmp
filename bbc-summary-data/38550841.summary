The 20-year-old former Derry City player, who was captain at Institute, had been a target for Bannsiders manager Oran Kearney.
"I feel Ciaron has been with us for a long time because I've watched him that often," said Kearney.
"We are delighted to have him on board - he is a fit lad and he gets about the pitch."
"I went especially to the play-off game away at Ballinamallard in May and he was as good a player as there was on the pitch that night," Kearney told the Coleraine Times.
"That game at Ballinamallard was a big pressure game but the way he managed himself and the game was way beyond his years.
"He was captain of Institute which says a huge amount at the tender age of 20."
