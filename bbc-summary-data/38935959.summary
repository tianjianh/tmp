[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 21.9g rock of cocaine and 118 wraps were recovered in hospital from Ashley Duhaney, 30, after he was caught by police.
He had travelled from Manchester to stay with friends in Exeter, Devon ,when he was persuaded to take part in street dealing, the court heard.
Duhaney, of Lock Lane, Partington, was jailed for two years eight months.
He was caught after a foot chase by police in Northernhay Gardens, Exeter, in September last year after being spotted approaching a group of known drug users.
He admitted possession of a class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed by Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC at Exeter Crown Court.
Mr Peter Coombe, prosecuting, said: "This defendant was taken to the police station and strip searched.
"Police believed he had drugs secreted in his body and he was taken to hospital, where in due course he excreted three packages."
The total street value of all the drugs was put at £3,810.
No phone or cash was found, suggesting Duhaney was not acting alone, the court was told.
Miss Katie Churcher, defending, said Duhaney moved to Exeter and stayed with friends who involved him in drug dealing.
His partner is now pregnant with his child, and he plans to find an honest job so he can support his new family when he is released, the court was told.
