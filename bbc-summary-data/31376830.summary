More than 140 specialist developers and agents will arrive in Swansea to see a vision of the city centre's future.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea council is showcasing proposals for the civic centre and St David's shopping centre sites.
Under the plans, a retail and leisure complex would be built on the St David's site with a walkway over the main road leading to the current civic centre site.
That would have public spaces, tourist attractions and homes.
It follows a similar presentation in London's financial district last week.
