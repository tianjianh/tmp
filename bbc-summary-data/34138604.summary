Paul Clark, 51, of Surrey, was charged with conspiracy and serious organised crime. He made no plea or declaration and was released on bail.
Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte, ex-chief executive Charles Green and David Whitehouse, a joint administrator with Mr Clark, faced similar charges.

Rangers was sold to Craig Whyte by its former owner Sir David Murray in 2011 for a nominal sum of Â£1.
But the club entered administration in February 2012 after running out of cash.
Mr Whitehouse,  who worked at Duff and Phelps, was appointed as joint administrator along with colleague Mr Clark.
When an agreement with creditors could not be struck to allow the club to exit administration, a sale of Rangers' assets to a consortium led by Mr Green was concluded.
He was at the helm when Rangers were allowed to join the Third Division but stepped down in 2013 following allegations that he was working in conjunction with Mr Whyte, 44.
All four men were arrested earlier this week after a police investigation into the sale of Rangers' assets in 2012.
They have been charged under Section 28 of the Criminal Justice Licensing Act 2010, which covers serious organised crime offences. They have also been charged with conspiracy.
In addition Mr Green has been charged with fraud and also an offence under Section 190 of the Companies Act 2006.
