Hounslow Council has apologised for the administrative error which has affected about 3,000 voters in the Bedfont area.
A bus service is being run between the Southville Community and Children's Centre in Southville Road and Bedfont Library in Staines Road.
Red-faced council chiefs said they were "very sorry" for the inconvenience.
The council said it was alerted to the error at 07:00 BST.
Some residents due to vote at Bedfont Library had been incorrectly told to go to the Southville Community and Children's Centre on their polling card and some voters had been told to go to the community centre instead of the library, the council said.
A council spokesperson said: "We're very sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.
"Unfortunately due to an administrative error, some residents received polling cards with the incorrect polling station printed on them.
"As soon as the error came to light, we put information through the letterboxes of all affected residents informing of their correct polling station.
"We also made arrangements for a free bus shuttle service to take residents to the correct polling station to ensure they can vote easily."
The council said the free bus service would run until 22:00 BST for affected residents voting for the Feltham & Heston parliamentary seat.
