Yasmine Elder was allegedly able to overpower Darrius Ellis, 26, and force him on to his back before pouring the substance down his throat.
The incident occurred at 01:45 on Monday while the couple were arguing inside a parked van, say investigators.
Police officers found Mr Ellis lying in the street hours later.
He was brought to hospital where he died of "complications from forcible administration of a caustic substance", according to medical examiners.
Relatives told the Chicago Tribune that he has a five-year-old son.
Ms Elder was arrested on Monday evening.
