GB were denied a last eight place on goal difference in the event in Kosovo.
Britain beat Estonia and Albania in their group matches but lost to Cameroon, before winning all three placement matches to finish ninth.
Assistant coach Bobby White said: "With no senior GB activity since 2013 we never really had any expectations."
GB beat Albania 67-22, the team's biggest ever win, and Estonia 27-26, but lost 23-16 to Cameroon.
Estonia beat Cameroon, meaning those two teams finished on four points along with Great Britain.
And it was the latter who missed out on the last eight as they had an inferior goal difference of -6, with Estonia and Cameroon both progressing.
GB then beat Armenia, Australia and China to finish ninth overall.
