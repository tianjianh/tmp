The 31-year-old, who won the London Marathon in April, dominated over the closing stages to finish in two hours, eight minutes and 44 seconds.
Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia came in 70 seconds later to take the silver, with American Galen Rupp collecting bronze.
Britain's Callum Hawkins, 24, led midway through the race and the Scot finished ninth in a time of 2:11.52.
Hawkins' brother, Derek, finished 114th with a time of 2:29.24, while fellow Briton Tsegai Tewelde failed to finish.
"Top 10 was the big goal, that was what I was going for, so to get that at my first Olympics is really good," said Callum Hawkins, after only his third marathon.
"It was a bit annoying that it was my legs that were going. I think I need a couple more years at the marathon. My legs are all over the place now.
"Hopefully I can go a lot further but the marathon is such an unpredictable sport and you don't know when is going to be your last one.
"I'll take a break from marathons now because that's three in 10 months, which is quite a lot for a 24-year old."
Steve Cram on Hawkins: "What a run from him, he has run the race of his life. He's just setting off on his marathon career, which is surely full of marvellous prospects. A top-10 finish, nobody could have believed this."
Kipchoge has now won seven of the eight marathons he has entered, and he adds marathon gold to the 5,000m silver he won in 2008 and bronze in 2004.
"It was a bit slow so I decided to take over," said Kipchoge, who dropped a breakaway group as he powered to the finish.
"I was coming here for gold.
"It feels great. I felt I had a little bit in the tank and it was comfortable, it was very comfortable. This is the best win of my life."
