Barcelona: Jasper Cillessen joins from Ajax as Claudio Bravo's replacement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona have signed Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for £11.1m to replace Manchester City-bound Claudio Bravo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Netherlands international Cillessen, 27, has signed a five-year deal with the Spanish champions, who could pay another £1.7m in variables.
He started his career with NEC Nijmegen before joining Ajax in 2011.
Cillessen's move was confirmed hours before Chile international Bravo, 33, joined Pep Guardiola at City for an initial £15.4m.
Bravo made 70 La Liga appearances in two seasons for Barcelona but never featured for them in the Champions League, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen their first choice in cup competitions.
