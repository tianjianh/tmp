Lowestoft Brooke Peninsular housing development could face legal challenge

A waterfront housing development featuring homes on stilts has been approved, but could face a legal challenge, it is claimed.

Cardy Construction has granted outline planning permission for 850 homes on the Brooke Peninsula in Lowestoft.
But some opponents say they will contest Waveney District Council's decision to back the Â£150m scheme.
The Lowestoft Harbour Maritime Businesses Group (LHMBG) said the site should be used for industry.
Cardy's scheme for the former Brook Marine boatyard on Lake Lothing includes such facilities as a marina a primary school but would mean a smaller county wildlife site and the loss of a playing field.
The LHMBG said small businesses currently using the site were only being given short-term leases and they would have to move on.
John Wylson, chairman of the LHMBG, said: "Landowners have been holding out because it's more profitable to build housing than to rent to business and this is bad news for the town's future."
Mr Wylson said it was supporting a residents group which had informed the council of a possible legal challenge.
But Neil Connolly, a representative for Cardy, said: "The site has been in decline for a long time and there simply isn't demand from large businesses to move there.
"The stilts is an exciting way of bringing something innovative to a larger housing project, although the site has never flooded."
David Ritchie, Conservative cabinet member for planning at the council, said: "This development is one piece of a large jigsaw which should ensure industry and housing can thrive on Lake Lothing.
"There is scope for business use on neighbouring sites, such as the former Jeld Wenn factory.
"The wildlife site will be taken into proper management, while the playing field can be moved to the former Sanyo site."
Cardy Construction said it hoped the first phase of the 10-year development could begin within a year following a detailed planning application.
