Death of teenager down to 'natural causes,' coroner finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a teenager who fell ill at the 2013 Reading Festival was due to natural causes, an inquest has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Esme Blore-Rimmer, 17, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on August 25 and was discharged the same day.
The sickness continued the following day and she was taken to Northampton Hospital, where she died of a rare metabolic disorder.
Coroner Anne Pember recorded a narrative verdict.
Miss Blore-Rimmer, from Stevington in Bedfordshire, was seen by doctors before paediatricians took over her care.
The inquest heard doctors initially thought her condition was drug related, encephalitis or meningitis before the rare disorder, known as MCADD, was diagnosed.
Miss Blore-Rimmer suffered a cardiac arrest and died at 21.38 GMT on 26 August 2013.
Mrs Pember said she did not find fault with the hospital.
At the inquest at Northampton Borough Council headquarters, Mrs Pember said: "Esme sadly suffered from a previously unknown, unsuspected and very rare metabolic condition - particularly rare to present at her age of 17 years.
"I do not criticise Northampton Hospital for failing to reach a diagnosis of MCADD and on a balance of probabilities, even if a diagnosis of metabolic disorder was made I believe it unlikely that her derangement could have been reversed prior to her collapse and untimely death."
