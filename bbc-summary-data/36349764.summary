The Scottish Boat Race - one of the oldest such races in the world - has been held on the River Clyde in Glasgow.

The event pitched university teams from Glasgow and Edinburgh against each other.
Eight races took place, including beginners, alumni and senior men and women.
The first team men's and women's races were won by Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively.
But the University of Edinburgh came out as overall victors of the event, having won more points over the eight races.
The Clyde has hosted the race for 139 years - a length of time only predated by the Oxford and Cambridge boat race and the Yale-Harvard Regatta.
Calum Irvine, who captained the winning University of Edinburgh's men's team, said: "The Scottish boat race is a real hidden gem in Scotland's sporting calendar and the crowds are getting bigger and bigger each year.
"It's great to see so many new faces down at this year's race to make it the best yet.
"It was a hard fought race with Glasgow and a few blade clashes at the start which shows just how tough it was. It was the best Glasgow team we've come up against, a truly fantastic race."
Women's team winning captain, Claire Aitken of Glasgow, said: "We're absolutely ecstatic to have won. This year's was the best yet and the amazing atmosphere really helps to spur the crews on.
"The Edinburgh crew were extremely difficult to beat and the conditions were really choppy as we knew it would be, but we kept calm and it's great to come out on top."
