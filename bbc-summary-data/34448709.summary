[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Clarkson's final season on Top Gear could be in the running for a National Television Award after making the longlist for 2016's ceremony.

Clarkson was sacked from the show in March following a fracas with a producer and has signed to present a new car show on Amazon Prime.
His last series is nominated in the factual entertainment category, but faces competition from last year's winner Gogglebox and Big Blue Live.
Viewers have until 18 October to vote.
Several of the categories will then be shortlisted ahead of the ceremony on the 20 January 2016.
This year viewers are being asked to choose their TV moment of the year with suggestions on the NTA website including Poldark star Aidan Turner doing topless scything and the betrayal of Game Of Thrones' Jon Snow.
There are also four new categories, including best international, best new drama, live magazine show and a new TV presenter category in which presenters of factual shows are put up against those in the entertainment TV presenter category.
Several well known presenting duos are currently up against each other, including This Morning's Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby and Pointless hosts Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman.
Husband and wife presenters Vernon Kay and Tess Daly and Rochelle and Marvin Humes are also on the longlist.
Nominees in the international category include Amazon Prime's Transparent and Netflix's Orange Is The New Black and House Of Cards. They face competition from Channel 5's Gotham and Family Guy which airs on BBC Three.
In the new drama category, nominees range from costume drama Poldark, to Doctor Foster, starring Suranne Jones' and Channel 4's sci-fi Humans.
In the Challenge Show category Bear Grylls is nominated for both ITV's Mission Survive and Channel 4's The Island. He is up against The Great British Bake Off, The Apprentice and Master Chef.
The awards will be broadcast live on ITV from the O2 and will be hosted again by Dermot O'Leary, who is nominated in the TV presenter category.
