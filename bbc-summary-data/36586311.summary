He will leave the job in September next year, 15 years after he took up the post. The university will now begin the process of recruiting his successor.
Prof O'Shea said it had been "an honour and a privilege" to serve in the role.
"I am extremely proud of what we as an institution have achieved over recent years," he said.
He added: "The success and growth that we have enjoyed have only been possible thanks to our very gifted students and highly-talented staff, as well as the tremendous backing we've received from our alumni, supporters and friends across Scotland, the wider UK and the world.
"I have every confidence that the university will continue to go from strength to strength in the years to come."
The university said Prof O'Shea had presided over a significant period of expansion and internationalisation since he took up the post in 2002.
It said the institution was regularly ranked as one of the top 25 universities in the world and had cemented its place as one of the UK's foremost research hubs.
Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: "Under Sir Tim's leadership, the University of Edinburgh has built on its reputation as one of the world's great universities and is widely regarded as a powerhouse of ideas and innovation across the breadth of academic endeavour, bringing distinction and talent to Scotland."
