[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Wilson, 18, has not played for the Reds' first team, but was part of the senior squad on their pre-season tour of Asia and Australia this summer.
He has agreed a deal that will keep him at Gresty Road until January.
Scottish left-back Kingsley, 21, has joined the Alex on an emergency 93-day loan.
He began his career in Scotland with Falkirk before signing for the Swans in June 2014.
Kingsley played 12 times in League One for Yeovil Town in a three-month loan spell last season.
The pair's arrival brings the number of summer signings made by the Railwaymen to seven with both available to make their debuts in Saturday's League One game at Wigan.
