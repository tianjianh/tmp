Taylor Swift joins Jay Z's new streaming site TIDAL

The ink might not have dried on the deal, but it seems Jay Z's new streaming service has signed the star his rivals couldn't - Taylor Swift.

Her back catalogue has appeared on TIDAL, the Sweden-based company Jay Z dropped £37m for two weeks ago.
As any good Swiftie knows, Taylor had her differences with Spotify, and what it paid for her music.
She pulled her back catalogue saying there was an "inherent value placed on art" when it came to her work.
Now they appear to have re-emerged on TIDAL.
All of Taylor's tracks, including her albums Red, 1989, and Fearless can be found by searching her name.
The rapper's company, Project Panther, took over Sweden-based Aspiro for a reported $56m (£37m) on 13 March.
The firm owned WiMP - which rivals Spotify in some countries - and TIDAL (which streams music in HD).
If the rumours are true, Jay Z did his homework before he bought the service.
He apparently called a "summit" during Grammy week with some of the biggest names in music, including Chris Martin, Madonna, Nicki Minaj and, of course, Beyonce.
Lawyers and music execs were there too, to discuss streaming and, according to Forbes magazine, how to make it work better for artists.
The move will put Jay Z in competition with Beats Music, founded by Dr Dre and bought by Apple in 2014.
Tidal currently offers users access to 25 million tracks, in addition to 75,000 music videos and other content including artist interviews, for £19.99 per month.
That contrasts with Spotify's charge of £9.99 per month for 30 million tracks.
