David Haines was killed by so-called Islamic State fighters almost exactly one year ago, on 13 September 2014.
His brother Mike has been travelling the country spreading a message of religious tolerance and understanding.
He urged UK communities to "extend the hand of friendship" to those in need.
David Haines, who grew up in Perth, was abducted while working as an aid worker in Syria, and held hostage for 18 months before a video of his murder was posted online.
The 44-year-old father of two's brother Mike has since worked with charities, community groups and religious leaders across the country.
He said: "Right from the day David was taken, we were aware as a family that the chances of him coming out were not good.
"When he appeared in the video, we knew that it was going to end. I thought that day was the worst day of my life.
"It was devastating, it really was a terrible night.
"It's one of those things, you could either let it destroy you, or carry on."
Mr Haines has met the Pope and travelled to the Middle East as he continues his brother's work to spread messages of unity, tolerance and peace.
He said he had no hatred for young people radicalised by extremism, and said his brother's life "wasn't about hating".
He said: "Those poor youths, the girls and boys who get twisted into going out there and given a false reality, I have no hate for them.
"Those people who are behind it and planning it, it's a little bit different.
"There's a part of me, when I look back at the relationship that David and I had, that could hate.
"But my brother's life wasn't about hating. Rather than hate these people, let's bring love and compassion and tolerance and understanding to those people that they are affecting.
"They took my brother's life, but they are killing thousands of people in the most barbaric of ways. My brother is just one among many."
Mr Haines said the government and communities in the UK had a "duty" to extend the hand of friendship and help those in need in countries affected by extremism.
He said: "It is a measure of our humanity, how much humanity we show them. They are in real danger, and real need.
"For me, it's our duty that we do help. As communities, as cities, as councils, we all have a role to play.
"They will be coming into our communities, and what's more effective than what the British government does as an entity is the hand that we give to them in friendship."
Mr Haines is set to embark on a tour of Scotland as part of his campaign to counteract hatred and intolerance.
