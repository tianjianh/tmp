Ryan Flynn and Billy McKay were on target against League Two Rovers, who were always second best after naming a team with eight changes from their last league game.
Oldham wasted a glorious chance in the 15th minute as Lee Erwin missed the target from close range after being found by Ryan McLaughlin.
Rovers keeper Marko Marosi denied Erwin after 34 minutes, making a fine full-length save when the on-loan Leeds striker let fly from outside the box.
Oldham deservedly took the lead in first-half stoppage time as Peter Clarke headed down an Ollie Banks cross and Flynn produced a cool six-yard finish.
Doncaster's Matthieu Baudry was at fault for the second Latics goal as he lost possession on 53 minutes, allowing Flynn to break away and set up McKay to drill home from 12 yards.
Matty Blair and John Marquis could have pulled one back for Rovers, but it was almost 3-0 when Flynn fired wide.
Doncaster did score a consolation goal in injury time when Liam Mandeville converted a penalty after being pulled down by Cameron Burgess.
