The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence carried the Olympic flame on Monday as the relay travelled from  
          Lewisham to Wandsworth.

Doreen Lawrence took the torch to the centre she set up in the memory of her son, who was killed in 1993.
Footballer Michael Owen walked with the flame at Battersea Dogs home.
A volley of tennis stars were served up as Andy Murray, Venus Williams and Sue Barker took the torch and Tim Henman lit the cauldron in Tooting.
Mid-morning, sprinter Marlon Devonish ran a lap of Crystal Palace stadium with the flame.
The torch also appeared  
          live on the BBC's EastEnders
, carried through Albert Square by character Billy Mitchell.
Some 187 torchbearers carried the flame as it visited the boroughs of Lewisham, Bromley, Croydon, Sutton, Merton and Wandsworth on its third day in London and 66th day overall.
The day started at 07:21 BST outside the  
          Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance
, in Deptford, where Ceinwen Giles was the first torchbearer.
The 37-year-old was nominated for fighting cancer, diagnosed just weeks after giving birth to her daughter.
At 07:46 BST Doreen Lawrence took the flame and carried it to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust Centre, which she set up to offer a base for community learning and development.
Mrs Lawrence, who was awarded an OBE in 2003, campaigned for many years for justice for her son, sparking an inquiry which found the Metropolitan Police to be "institutionally racist" in the aftermath of the killing. In January 2012,  
          two men were found guilty of his murder
.
Mrs Lawrence handed the flame on to the Young Mayor of Lewisham, Kieran Lang, 16.

The relay then passed into the borough of Bromley, home of the Crystal Palace athletics stadium where 4x100m Athens Olympic gold medallist Devonish completed a lap of torchbearing honour.
After he crossed the finish line, he was surrounded by members of the Brazil Olympic team, who are training at the stadium.
"It's absolutely amazing. The crowd made it really special for me and everybody else," Devonish told the BBC. "I'm gutted I didn't make the [Olympic] team but this is a really happy second best."
The final torchbearer before the relay was beamed up for lunch in Croydon  
          was actor Sir Patrick Stewart
, renowned for playing Star Trek Captain Jean-Luc Picard and numerous Shakespearean roles.
Shortly afterwards, in a visit away from the relay, 50 canine residents of Battersea Dogs and Cats home were due to form a guard of honour for Michael Owen as he brought the flame to the famous rescue centre.
The former England footballer is the owner of the four rescued dogs and is a supporter of the home's work.
The day's other torchbearers included:
After lunch, tennis player turned BBC presenter Sue Barker took the flame to the Tooting and Mitcham Community Sports Club.
The tennis theme continued later in the afternoon as British number one Andy Murray carried the torch at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon.
He stepped on to Centre Court, where he lost in the final to Roger Federer, just 15 days ago.
Wimbledon is the venue for London 2012's tennis tournament and  
          Murray insists he is focused on winning Olympic gold
.
He passed the flame to a woman who has already done so: triple Olympic gold medallist Venus Williams.
Williams is set to compete with her sister Serena in the London 2012 doubles contest.
The day's relay was brought to a close by Tim Henman, who took doubles silver with partner Neil Broad at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
The former British number one, who retired in 2007 after helping GB to a Davis Cup victory over Croatia, lit the cauldron at Tooting Bec Common.
But after the relay ended, the Olympic flame had one more task -  
          to be carried by Billy Mitchell
, played by Perry Fenwick, in a special episode of EastEnders from 21:00 BST, in which a seven minute segment was broadcast live.
This is not the first time the Olympics and EastEnders have crossed paths. The Olympic Park has been given the same E20 postcode as fictional Walford in the soap.
The flame's circuit of the capital sees it pass through each of the city's 33 local authority areas and finish at the opening ceremony on 27 July.
