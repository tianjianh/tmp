Anglesey council wins battle over purchase of market hall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a historical market hall on Anglesey has been ordered to sell the building to the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anglesey council issued a compulsory purchase order (CPO) for the former Holyhead Market Hall after the owner failed to act on a repairs notice.
The owner challenged the CPO but, following a public consultation, the Welsh Government said the sale must go ahead.
The council plans to rehouse the town's library in the building.
Councillor Richard Dew said: "The Welsh Government's decision totally vindicates the great efforts made by the county council to protect this important historic building for future generations."
