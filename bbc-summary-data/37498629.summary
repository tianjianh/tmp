The New Zealander, who led Clermont Auvergne to the Top 14 title in 2010 during an eight-year spell at the club, will replace South African Jake White.
Cotter's spell as Scotland coach will end next June when Glasgow coach Gregor Townsend takes over the national job.
White's Montpellier contract expires at the same time, with the club confirming the change on their website.
"The arrival of Vern Cotter for the 2017-2018 season should help to write a new chapter in the history of MHR [Montpellier] and continue to make it grow," a statement said.
White led Montpellier to victory in the European Challenge Cup last season, and they are currently third in the Top 14.
Cotter, meanwhile is preparing for Scotland's autumn Tests against Australia, Argentina and Georgia.
It was announced in August that Townsend will replace Cotter as Scotland boss in June 2017.
