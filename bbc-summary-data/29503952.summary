Lynch tweeted a link to a teaser video along with the message: "Dear Twitter Friends... it is happening again."
The unsettling drama, which explored the murky goings-on in a US town after the murder of a teenage beauty queen, captivated viewers in 1990 and 1991.
The third series will comprise nine episodes and will be broadcast on the Showtime network in the US in 2016.
A statement accompanying the YouTube video said: "The groundbreaking television phenomenon, Golden Globe and Peabody Award-winner Twin Peaks will return as a new limited series on Showtime in 2016.
"Series creators and executive producers David Lynch and Mark Frost will write and produce all nine episodes of the limited series."
The show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for Kyle MacLachlan.
MacLachlan played Special Agent Dale Cooper, an FBI agent who got drawn into the seedy and surreal town of Twin Peaks as he investigated the mysterious death of Laura Palmer.
After two series on TV, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, in 1992.
