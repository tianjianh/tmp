It has sold four million copies since 1992, while Adele's 21 is at number two with 3.5m. Oasis album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? has sold 3.4m.
Gold's sales have been boosted by the musical Mamma Mia!, based on Abba's hits, which was also made into a hit film starring Meryl Streep.
It is 30 years since the CD format was launched.
Digital downloads account for greater than average sales of the rock, urban and dance genres, but the CD is today still the preferred music format for easy listening (79.7%), blues (78.2%) and classical (77.7%).
Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, which represents the British recorded music industry, said: "The CD represented a great leap forward in sound technology, becoming one of the most successful consumer products in history as music fans embraced its sound quality, durability, instant track access and ease of use.
