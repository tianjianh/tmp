Glasgow bin lorry killed six people in 19 seconds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six people were killed in just 19 seconds when a bin lorry careered into them on a busy Glasgow street, a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crash investigator Mark Hill told Glasgow Sheriff Court this was how long it took from when the lorry changed course until it crashed into the Millenium Hotel on 22 December 2014.
The inquiry is examining the lorry, its route and driver Harry Clarke's health.
The court previously heard that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the wheel.
The fourth day of the FAI earlier heard that Mr Clarke told a nurse who had gone to help in the aftermath of the crash that he had not blacked out.
Lauren Mykoliw was off duty at the time.
She told Glasgow Sheriff Court that the bin lorry driver, Harry Clarke, could not remember what had happened but said he had not blacked out.
She said she was shopping near George Square when she heard a loud bang and then saw that a bin lorry had crashed into the Millennium Hotel.
The witness said she went to assist the driver of a silver car, then, about five minutes after the crash, the lorry driver.
Ms Mykoliw said she climbed up into the lorry, via the passenger side, and started speaking to the driver, who was conscious and sitting upright, with his seatbelt on.
She asked him if he felt unwell and remembered what had happened, before adding "He asked me if he'd had a heart attack."
Ms Mykoliw said the driver told her he remembered sitting at traffic lights, then waking up where he was.
The witness described the driver as "pale" and "sweaty". She undid his belt and shirt as he was breathing heavily but in no pain.
Ms Mykoliw said she saw three beer bottles in the cab and asked the driver if he had been drinking. He said no.
She said she asked him if he had blacked out but he replied that he had not.
The nurse said that Mr Clarke "kept repeating himself" that he had not blacked out, but did not remember what had happened.
The FAI next heard from paramedic Ronald Hewitson who tended to Mr Clarke after the crash.
He said the driver was lying on the ground when he first saw him and "seemed confused, slightly pale".
Mr Hewitson said he examined Mr Clarke. This included taking blood pressure and an ECG test.
He said his blood pressure, blood sugar, pulse and oxygen saturation were all within normal levels.
The witness added: "He was alert. Everything seemed to be fine, he was slightly confused and didn't actually remember what had happened."
The paramedic said Mr Clarke asked him if he was having heart problems and confirmed that he was taking medication for gout.
Mr Hewitson told the driver he had no symptoms consistent with a heart attack.
The witness also said there was no smell of alcohol from the driver or lorry.
The inquiry later heard from Robert Soutar, manager of the Glasgow bin lorry depot in Anderston.
He explained that the two crew members worked under him at the depot, but the driver, Mr Clarke, was based elsewhere.
Mr Sourat told the FAI there was no training given about what to do if one of the crew was taken unwell.
The witness agreed that he signed off on the route risk assessment as "appropriate".
Under cross-examination, from Mark Stewart QC, for the bereaved McQuade and Sweeney families, Mr Soutar agreed that the route risk assessment detailed the dangers to pedestrians of a stationary vehicle but not one that was in transit.
Mr Stewart QC added: "There is nothing but complacency about the application of lessons that could be learned from a proper risk assessment by Glasgow City Council."
When cross-examined by the council's QC, Peter Gray, Mr Soutar confirmed that control measures were in place included in-house training, safety devices such as seatbelts and extensions, driver monitoring and inspections, along with quarterly driving licence checks.
Asked if he felt the measures in place amounted to a "lazy, casual approach to safety", the witness replied "no."
Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the incident in the city's Queen Street and George Square.
Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.
A further 15 people were injured.
The Crown Office has already concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution over the crash, with senior lawyers deeming it a "tragic accident".
