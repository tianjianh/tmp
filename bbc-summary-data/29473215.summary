House prices in some national parks can be up to double what they are in the surrounding area, said a report from Lloyds Bank.
It found that buyers in England and Wales pay an average £125,796 extra for living in a national park.
Homes in the New Forest had the highest premium, and were the most expensive.
Houses there cost on average £259,066, more than double the cost of homes outside the park boundary.
However anyone in search of spectacular countryside might find better value in the mountains of Snowdonia in North Wales.
Homes there cost an average of £173,779, just 5% more than other properties nearby.
Over the past ten years, prices have risen fastest on Exmoor, which straddles Devon and Somerset, with a 47% increase between 2004 and 2014.
Lloyds Bank said one reason for the price rises was the fact that many homes in national parks are purchased as second homes - or holiday properties.
"The disadvantage is that the resulting high property prices have made it very difficult for many of those living and working in such locations to afford to buy their own home, said Marc Page, Lloyds Bank mortgages director.
"This situation has deteriorated in recent years, as prices have risen more rapidly than earnings," he said.
A recent survey by the National Housing Federation (NHF) found that many rural areas were relatively more expensive than London, once the level of local earnings was taken into consideration.
Northumberland National Park was excluded from the report, because of the low number of house sales.
