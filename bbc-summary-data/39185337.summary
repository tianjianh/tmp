[SN]TITLE[SN]
Affordable housing plan for former Earlston High School site.

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are being advised to back plans for a major affordable housing project on a former high school site in the Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A feasibility study has found the land at the old Earlston High School could host 55 new homes.
Scottish Borders Council is being advised to allow the Eildon Housing Association to redevelop the site.
Council leader David Parker said the project could make a contribution towards affordable housing targets.
The market value of the site has been estimated at £700,000.
However, the council is being recommended to dispose of it for the affordable housing valuation of £450,000.
If it agrees to do so, the local authority has been advised to transfer £250,000 from its affordable housing budget to its capital budget to make up the shortfall.
