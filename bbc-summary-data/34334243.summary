[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Nouth' not north: Spelling error on Staffordshire road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A misspelt road marking was the result of "a contractor having a bad day", a council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paintwork directed motorists in Stafford to take the A34 (M6) "nouth" rather than north.
Staffordshire County Council said the mistake happened when a utility company resurfaced and repainted the road.
The authority, which became aware of the blunder on Tuesday, said: "It's got nothing to do with us, but it is being corrected by the contractor".
