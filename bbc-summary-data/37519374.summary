A fourth person has been arrested after effigies of Rangers fans were hung from the stands during the recent Glasgow derby at Celtic Park.

The mock hangings involved two blow-up dolls, one with a Rangers scarf, the other with an Orange sash.
A 17-year-old man has been arrested over the incident and is due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court later.
Two men aged 27 and a 22-year-old man were previously held over the display at the game, which Celtic won 5-1.
During the match, toilets in the away end of the ground were vandalised and both clubs later released statements over fan behaviour.
Police have appealed for pictures and video evidence of vandalism and disorder to be sent to a dedicated email address which was set up last week.
