[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has been charged with using abusive language about an opponent's race, ethnicity or nationality.

The incident occurred in the 87th minute of Newcastle's 2-0 Championship defeat against Wolves on 17 September.
The Football Association says the misdemeanour was an "aggravated breach" of rules, and if found guilty the 24-year-old faces a minimum five-game ban.
He has until 16 November to respond.
Newcastle had Netherlands midfielder Vurnon Anita sent off in the same minute of the game.
If found guilty Shelvey will miss, at a minimum, a trip to Leeds on 20 November, a home match with Blackburn, the EFL Cup trip to Hull City, an away fixture at Nottingham Forest and Birmingham City's visit to St James' Park on 10 December.
In May 2013, the FA introduced new guidelines stating that any player found guilty of racially abusing an opponent or discriminating on religion, sexuality or disability, would be banned for at least five games.
Chelsea's John Terry was handed a four-match ban and a £220,000 fine for racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, while Liverpool's Luis Suarez received an eight-match suspension and a £40,000 fine for his abuse of Manchester United's Patrice Evra - both in 2011.
Newcastle sit top of the Championship, three points clear of Brighton, and Shelvey has been one of their stand-out performers, as well as contributing three goals in 16 league appearances.
Shelvey, who has won six caps for England, joined Newcastle from Swansea in January, but could not prevent the club's relegation to the Championship.
