Alastair Cook: England captain available for Essex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England captain Alastair Cook has been named in Essex's 14-man squad for their final County Championship game of 2015 against already-promoted Lancashire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old skippered England to a 3-2 Ashes win over Australia this summer, but has not played since the final Test at The Oval in mid-August.
England will soon travel to the UAE for a three-match Test series against Pakistan, starting on 13 October.
Ian Bell is in Warwickshire's squad but Joe Root will not play for Yorkshire.
Root, England's leading run-scorer during their Ashes win, was rested for the limited-overs series against Australia and will not play for Yorkshire against Sussex.
But Jonny Bairstow and Adil Rashid, who both appeared in the shorter-form series, are included in the champions' squad.
Fast bowler Stuart Broad, meanwhile, is set to make his first Championship appearance for Notts since June in their game against Hampshire.
And new-ball partner James Anderson will continue his comeback from a side strain in Lancashire's game at Essex.
However, Worcestershire's Moeen Ali and Middlesex's Steven Finn will not play in the Division One match between their respective sides at New Road.
The final County Championship fixtures start on Tuesday.
