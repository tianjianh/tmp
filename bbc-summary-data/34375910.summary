The Hollywood A-lister plays the title role in the new film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy which is out in cinemas next week.
He stopped to talk to fans, sign autographs and pose for selfies as he made his way to the screening at the Festival Theatre.
Marion Cotillard, who plays Lady Macbeth, was not on the red carpet.
But David Thewlis, who takes on the role of King Duncan, and Paddy Considine, playing Banquo, were in attendance.
Fassbender said: "It is great being in Edinburgh, it's exciting to have the premiere here in Scotland.
"We were lucky enough to film a bit up here and I was here in 2006 doing a play at the Fringe Festival so I love being back.
"I love the city - its architecture and the really great people."
David Thewlis said: "It's called the Scottish play and Scotland is undoubtedly one of the stars of the movie. The reason it is so beautiful is because it's so damn beautiful up here. I'm glad to be here - I've not been up for six years and I always love being here. I could honestly live up here - I love it."
The movie, directed by Australian director Kurzel, features the landscape of the Isle of Skye and tourism bosses have hailed its potential to attract thousands more visitors to Scotland.
Tourism body VisitScotland has already produced a new online Macbeth locations guide highlighting places on Skye where filming took place as well as places associated with the play.
