An independent TD (member of the Irish parliament) has denied there is a human impact on climate change.

Speaking in the Dail (Irish parliament), on Wednesday, Danny Healy-Rae said "God above" controlled the weather.
During a debate on the issue, he denied the burning of fossil fuel was the main cause of global warming.
Scientists believe gases released from industry and agriculture are adding to the climate change.
Human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in the last 800,000.
Mr Healy-Rae said: "I don't agree with all this stuff about climate change at all.
"There have been patterns of climate change going back over the years before there was ever a combustible engine."
He said paying carbon tax was "hurting the young fella going to work in the morning, the lorry on the road and the tractors in the field."
