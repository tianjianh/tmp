The 30-year-old victim and her Jack Russell were attacked on a path near Knowe Road in the Gallowhill area at about 09:10 on Friday 4 November.
The suspects dragged her to the ground, kicked and punched her and tried to injure the dog before stealing personal items.
The woman was not seriously injured.
Det Con Raymond Brownlow said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim, who was thankfully not seriously injured, but still left badly shaken as a result of this incident. Her dog also escaped with only a minor injury.
"It is crucial that we trace these cowardly individuals as soon as possible and I am appealing for any witnesses to come forward.
"I would like to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened or a man and woman matching the above description acting suspiciously around the area at the time of this attack."
The man involved in the attack is described as of medium height and slim build, aged 35 to 40 years old.
He had unkempt brown hair, a gaunt appearance and a distinctive scar which runs from his left ear to his mouth, and scarring around his mouth. At the time of the attack he was wearing a dark grey zipper.
The woman is described as having unkempt brown shoulder-length hair. At the time of the incident she was carrying a cream handbag.
