Mrs Deakin, from Udimore, East Sussex, was in the coffee shop with her eldest daughter and her best friend.
She was thrown from her seat by the window, across the coffee shop and into the wall on the far side.
Mrs Deakin's family said that they believed the crash was entirely avoidable and should not have happened.
The court was told Lord had written a letter to Mrs Deakin's family to apologise.
A further two men and two women were seriously hurt in the crash.
Another woman was treated for minor injuries.
