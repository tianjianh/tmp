Kenugen Saththiyanathan, Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sriskantharaja and Gurushanth Srithavarajah got into difficulties in the water at the East Sussex resort.
Nearly 2,000 people joined the Hindu ceremony at Winn's Common.
Mourners lined up to lay petals on coffins carried into marquee tents.
Sai Yoghananthan, a friend of the group, said their deaths had hit the community hard.

"They were known by many many people. They had their own circle of friends, and their families are very close-knit. It has just touched all of our hearts."
Navi Ananth, a friend of Nitharsan Ravi, said he "was one of those lovely kind of personalities".
"I think it's kind of unbelievable to think that he's not going to be here anymore," she said.
Krishna Suresh, a former mayor of Harrow, said the deaths were "a big tragedy for the Tamil community".
Following the ceremony, the coffins were taken by horse drawn carriages for a private cremation at Hither Green Cemetery in Lewisham.
Jaffna 11 football group, where the victims played, and Lewisham Sivan temple organised the funeral along with the families.
More than Â£9,000 was raised through a JustGiving page for the service.

Speaking at the service, MP for Eltham Clive Efford said: "Questions need to be asked about how we arrange safety on our beaches."
The men who died at the beach were:
