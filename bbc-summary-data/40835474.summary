[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 3-0 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow moved above opponents Woking in the National League table following a victory at Holker Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides went close in a frantic start as Barrow's Adi Yussuf missed a gilt-edged chance in the area, while Woking's Joe Ward was denied by a good save from Stuart Moore.
It was the hosts who took the lead as Yussuf bent an effort over Woking goalkeeper Nathan Baxter and into the net from 25 yards.
The lead was doubled shortly after the break when Jordan White latched on to a long throw from Dan Jones to tap into the Woking net and he should have added a third minutes later but nodded just wide of the target.
The striker made amends for his miss seven minutes from time as he found the net with a header from a corner to wrap up a comfortable victory for the Bluebirds.
