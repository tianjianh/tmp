Hey, Gmail me that cash you owe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's the social situation we all try to avoid; forgetting to pay someone back because we don't have any cash, or that card reader thingie, to do it online.

Well Google are having a go at making debt settling easier, by allowing users to transfer funds on email.
It's coming in over the next few weeks for all Gmail users who are over 18 in the UK.
Users will have to click the "Â£" icon which will soon appear on emails, and enter the amount they wish to send.
Google made the announcement on an official blog post and says the service will be free.
If you're really desperate for that score to be settled, you can even send requests for how much money you'd like to receive.
Users without a Gmail account will also be able to be sent cash - everyone will have to set up a Google wallet balance, and link it to their debit card or bank account.
