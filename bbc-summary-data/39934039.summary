Labour manifesto vision: More spending, more tax, more borrowing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This is not an election where voters can say, with justification, "they are all the same".
The just-launched Labour manifesto shows, in black and white, why that is simply not the case.
The party is including Â£48.6bn of extra tax rises, and the same in extra spending commitments.
In the coming hours, the details will be pored over at length; they matter enormously.
But the big picture is clear.
Jeremy Corbyn is taking the Labour Party in this election to  a very different place - away from the recent consensus that the UK should be moving to lower borrowing, and lower taxation.
The manifesto spells out a vision, for good or for ill, of more spending, more tax, and more borrowing.
And in a big way.
