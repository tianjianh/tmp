[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roma thrashed bottom side Pescara 4-1 to move back to within eight points Serie A leaders Juventus.

Three goals in five minutes either side of half-time ensured the points went back to Rome.
The win keeps Roma's slim hopes of denying Juve a sixth straight Serie A title alive.
There are five games left in the Italian league season, with Roma - who still have to play Lazio and AC Milan - hosting their Turin rivals on May 14.
Kevin Strootman broke the deadlock in the 44th minute as he fired home from a central position and before Pescara could gather themselves, Radja Nainggolan doubled the lead on the stroke of half-time.
Three minutes into the second half, Mohamed Salah's shot from outside the area found the bottom left corner of Vincenzo Fiorillo's net and it was the Egyptian again to score Roma's fourth on the hour mark.
Roma passed up a series of chances to add to their lead and instead it was Pescara who had the final word, with Ahmad Benali turning in Ledian Memushaj's cross with seven minutes left.
The result means Pescara are relegated to Serie B.
