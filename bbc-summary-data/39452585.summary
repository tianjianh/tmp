The BBC Two programme's anonymous "tame racing driver" got behind the wheel of the 1960s dodgem at Bentwaters Airfield, near Woodbridge.
The small fairground vehicle had been restored and modified by YouTube star and stunt man Colin Furze.
Guinness World Records said it was a "hugely impressive" feat.

Official adjudicator Lucia Sinigagliesi, who witnessed the record-setting drive, said: "We're all used to seeing The Stig driving at high speeds - but he's usually in a sports car and usually on a race track.
"To see him hurtle past in a classic bumper car at 100mph was surreal, but hugely impressive."
The average speed of a dodgem is about 5mph (8kph) but Mr Furze had souped up the model by installing a 100 horsepower 600cc Honda motorbike engine.
He completed the modifications within three weeks.
The Stig set a new land-speed world record of 100.3mph.
Guinness World Records said it was a brand new record. It had set a benchmark of 62mph (100kph).
