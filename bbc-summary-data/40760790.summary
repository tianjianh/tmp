[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers 2-0 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conor Washington scored twice as QPR opened the season with victory over last season's beaten play-off finalists Reading, who finished with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northern Ireland's Washington headed in from Pawel Wszolek's far-post cross to give the hosts the lead at half-time.
Reading's Tiago Ilori was sent off for a professional foul on Wszolek and Washington beat debutant keeper Vito Mannone with the resulting penalty.
That left the Royals with one win from their past 13 opening day away games.
Former Sunderland keeper Mannone was one of three debutants to start for Jaap Stam's side, along with striker Jon Dadi Bodvarsson and midfielder Pelle Clement, who was replaced by another summer signing - winger Modou Barrow - after half-time.
But QPR - who lost seven of their final eight matches of last season - were the better team, as they extended boss Ian Holloway's record of never losing an opening game of the season with Rangers.
Reading finished 32 points and 15 places above QPR in May, but could have lost by more with Massimo Luongo striking the post for the hosts in the first half.
The main concern on an otherwise fine day for Holloway's side was seeing Washington replaced because of an apparent injury in the closing stages.
QPR manager Ian Holloway:
"We've been working on fitness and I thought today you could see that.
"They thought they could pass and move but we were co-ordinated in the running and the chasing and the working.
"Everyone of our lads had a really good game. You could argue we missed a few chances but we forced them into mistake after mistake."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"In this league every week you're going to be playing is going to be hard, especially in away games.
"You need to work hard, you need to give everything, you need to be very aggressive in what you do.
"Today was by far not good enough in what we needed to do. We were not aggressive enough, on the ball we were not good enough."
