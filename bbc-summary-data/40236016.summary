Kent v Durham: Hosts hold on for dramatic draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent dramatically held on with one wicket remaining to deny Durham a first win of the season and maintain own their unbeaten start.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham looked set for victory when Kent captain Sam Northeast (72) was out with 16 overs remaining, leaving the visitors needing just two more wickets.
Matt Coles (30) then put on 47 with Yasir Shah before becoming Matthew Potts' first Championship scalp.
But Shah and Mitchell Claydon survived the last 7.4 overs to earn a draw.
Chasing a nominal 484, Kent had looked comfortable in reaching 180-3 before Joe Weatherley, Darren Stevens and Will Gidman were dismissed within eight overs before tea.
Northeast then put up good resistance before becoming Chris Rushworth's third victim.
That meant it was left to the last three Kent batsmen to hold out and they did so with Yasir (39) and Claydon (21) not out at the close.
Durham remain without a win this season and are bottom of Division Two on -9 points, following their points deduction due to financial issues.
Kent are second, five points behind leaders Nottinghamshire, who complete their match against Gloucestershire on Monday.
