Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) has recorded a station message by Izzy, the daughter of a railway worker from Kent.
She tells travellers: "Please help ensure my mummy and daddy come home from work today safely."
GTR said: "It is more important than ever, after the atrocities in Belgium.. to keep a look-out for abandoned bags and suspicious behaviour."
Its head of security Stella Rogers said: "The announcements we make are so well known they just blend into the background noise of the station and are ignored."
She hoped Izzy's "childish voice" would make passengers take notice.
The message will be played at 236 stations on GTR's four routes: Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express.
GTR is currently looking for people from other walks of life to voice similar messages.
