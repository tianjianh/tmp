Effigies of Rangers fans were hung from the stands during the match.
Toilets in the away end of the ground were vandalised and both clubs later released statements over fan behaviour.
Four people have so far been arrested over the two blow-up effigies, one of which was draped with a Rangers scarf, the other with an Orange sash.
The match, which Celtic won 5-1, took place at Parkhead on 10 September.
Anyone with information about the people pictured has been asked to contact Shettleston police office or use the dedicated email address.
