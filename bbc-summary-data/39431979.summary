The Republic of Ireland international has made 102 appearances for the Bees since joining on an initial loan deal from Blackburn in January 2014.
However, the 28-year-old has not featured since April 2016 when he suffered a double fracture of his leg.
His previous deal was set to expire at the end of the current season.
"He is close to a full recovery from the terrible injury he suffered and we will certainly reap the benefits when he returns to the standards he was setting," manager Dean Smith told the club website.
"It is a great boost to the staff, the squad and supporters that his future remains at Brentford."
