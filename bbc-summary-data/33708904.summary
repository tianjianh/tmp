The airline did not confirm reports a "suspicious" package had been found but said flight BA0274 landed safely.
The Boeing 747 carrying 312 passengers arrived shortly before 06:00 local time after "the captain took the decision to divert... as a precaution", BA said.
BA flight information says the plane will now leave Montreal at 19:35 local time on Thursday.
It is due to arrive at Heathrow at 07:05 BST on Friday.
Police and a dog unit are carrying out a search of the aircraft at Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International airport.
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation footage shows passengers leaving the plane via boarding steps on to the tarmac.
BA said in a statement: "The safety and security of our customers, crew and aircraft are our highest priorities at all times.
"We are looking after the customers and will provide hotel rooms for them and will rebook them to other flights as soon as we can.
"We are working with the Canadian authorities and giving them our fullest support."
The flight left Las Vegas at 21:25 local time on Tuesday and had been due to arrive in London on Wednesday afternoon.
