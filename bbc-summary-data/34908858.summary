Paris attacks: Hollande and Obama to intensify anti-IS push

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) will dominate talks in Washington shortly between French President Francois Hollande and US President Barack Obama.

The Paris suicide attacks claimed by IS have prompted the US to issue a worldwide travel alert to its citizens.
President Hollande is meeting other world leaders this week, hoping to forge a stronger alliance against IS.
But Turkey's downing of a Russian jet has fuelled tension over the Syria war.
Russia says a Sukhoi Su-24 warplane was shot down over Syria on Tuesday by an air-to-air missile fired by a Turkish F-16 fighter. Turkey says the Russian jet had entered its airspace.
As Turkey is a Nato member the incident has put a new strain on Russian-Western efforts to neutralise the IS threat in Syria and Iraq.
The US is unlikely to support French efforts to build a Russian-Western military alliance against IS, correspondents say. But there is some military co-ordination with Russia.
France is now sending warplanes from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, off the Syrian coast, to pound IS targets.
Russia has also stepped up air raids against anti-government rebels in Syria, since a Russian airliner was blown up over Egypt by suspected IS-linked militants last month.
But Western leaders have urged Russia to focus its raids on IS, not on other groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
French police are examining what appears to be a suicide bomb belt dumped on a Paris street following the 13 November attacks that killed 130 people.
It is said to resemble belts used by the attackers and was found in a suburb which a suspect is thought to have passed through after the attacks.
The key suspect, Salah Abdeslam, remains at large and a massive manhunt for him continues.
After the attacks he fled to Belgium, where he and some of the other jihadists were based.
The Belgian capital Brussels remains on high alert, with schools and the metro closed, on the fourth day of an unprecedented lockdown.
They are due to reopen on Wednesday, but the highest alert level will continue for at least another week.
Authorities fear attacks like those in Paris may be carried out in Brussels. Prime Minister Charles Michel warned that the threat remained "imminent".

The suspected explosives belt was found in a dustbin on Monday by Paris street cleaners in the Montrouge district, police say.
According to AFP news agency, the device lacks a detonator.
It is one of two key pieces of evidence discovered by French police and publicly linked to Salah Abdeslam. His brother Brahim blew himself up during the attacks.
A mobile phone was previously found in an abandoned car he rented. Phone data suggest that on the night of the attacks, Salah Abdeslam was in the area where the belt was later found.
Meanwhile, police swooped on a small village in south-western France, Arigat, hunting for a preacher called imam Olivier Corel, nicknamed the "White Emir", suspected of inspiring jihadists.

Belgian police have charged a fourth suspect with terrorism offences related to the Paris attacks, the federal prosecutor said.
Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 20, have already been charged with aiding Salah Abdeslam. A third, unnamed suspect has also been charged.
