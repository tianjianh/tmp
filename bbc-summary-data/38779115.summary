[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Godden hit a dramatic stoppage-time winner as Stevenage came from behind to clinch victory at Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading scorer James Collins put Crawley on course for a fifth successive home win with a first-half penalty, his 14th league goal of the season.
But Godden levelled in the 76th minute and then pounced to settle the issue with his second goal in the fifth minute of added time.
Crawley, who have scored in every home game bar one this season, had an early let-off when goalkeeper Glenn Morris saved at the feet of the on-rushing Ben Kennedy.
The hosts broke the deadlock after 28 minutes when Collins scored for the sixth home game, converting from the penalty spot after being brought down by Luke Wilkinson.
Godden put the ball over from a good position for Stevenage before Dean Cox fired wide for the hosts, and Kennedy was again denied by Morris after Godden seized on a defensive lapse by Joe McNerney.
Crawley forward Enzio Boldewijn should have tested keeper Jamie Jones after 63 minutes but fired over following a cross from Cox.
Stevenage midfielder Tom Pett threatened to bring his side level following a strong run, but his low shot was parried by Morris.
Boro levelled through a close-range shot from Godden after a deflected effort by substitute Josh McQuoid, and his 13th league goal of the season snatched all three points.
