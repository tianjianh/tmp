[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southampton release Richard Chaplow and Vegard Forren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton have mutually terminated Richard Chaplow's contract and allowed Vegard Forren to return to Molde FK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Chaplow scored six goals in 80 games for Saints having made a loan spell from Preston permanent in early 2011, five years after a three-month stint whilst on the books of West Brom.
But the 28-year-old fell from favour last season, playing just five times before moving on loan to Millwall.
Norway defender Forren joined Saints in January but made no appearances.
