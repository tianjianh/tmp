Thames Valley Police sparked controversy when they said Brian would be given a more "godlike name" if he qualified for its mounted section.
The force backed down, but Brian failed to make the grade and has returned to his stables in Wilstead, Bedfordshire.
He is now up for sale, but owner Jo Samuel-Blackstock said he would keep his original name.
"Horses have passports with their name in and it is bad luck to change it," she said.
She said Brian would probably end up working in the countryside.
"He is a country boy and not a city boy," she said.
"He was taken to live in a concrete city and rode round Milton Keynes next to buses. It was completely different for him."
Brian is currently "knee deep in mud enjoying being a horse" at The Stables Equestrian Centre.
Miss Samuel-Blackstock said: "I have had emails saying I need Brian in my life, but I want him to go to a home that wants him as a horse."
Brian is likely to end up working in show jumping, cross country jumping or dressage.
Miss Samuel-Blackstock said police had been interested in Brian as the six-year-old cross breed is 17 hands two inches tall and has "quite a presence".
He had been considered for a name change more in keeping with police tradition, such as Hercules or Odin.
But there was a groundswell of support for the name from men called Brian, including Big Brother series eight winner Brian Belo.
The stables has now added the tagline "Home of Brian the Horse" to its website.
Asked if fame had gone to his head, his owner said: "It doesn't seem to. He is not sticking his mane up in the air at any of his old friends."
