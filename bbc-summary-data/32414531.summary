Pictures show the damage caused by burglars in order to get access to Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in central London.
In the vault, discarded safety deposit boxes, power tools, including an angle grinder, and concrete drills and crowbars can be seen
No arrests have been made.
The image shows the hole made using a heavy duty drill, model hilti DD350. It measured  50cm deep, 25cm high, 45cm wide and 89cm tall.

They forced open shutter doors into the basement and bored holes into the vault wall.
All but six of those thought to have been victims of the crime have been contacted, the force said.
It added an appeal will be broadcast on Crimewatch on BBC One on Thursday.
