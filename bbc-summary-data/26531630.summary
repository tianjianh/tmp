Gus and Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar is a "rare and intimate look" into his early years.
Richards was introduced to music by his grandfather, jazz musician Theodore Augustus Dupree.
It will be published as a hardback and ebook later this year.
"I have just become a grandfather for the fifth time, so I know what I'm talking about," said Richards.
"The bond, the special bond, between kids and grandparents is unique and should be treasured. This is a story of one of those magical moments. May I be as great a grandfather as Gus was to me."
Publishers Little, Brown confirmed Richards' "talented" daughter Theodora Dupree Richards will illustrate the "vivid and moving story", marking her book debut.
"To be able to explore my father's relationship with his grandfather was a gift in itself. The things that I've learnt during this whole process have just been life affirming," she said.
Richards' 2010 memoir Life was a best seller, shifting more than two million copies around the world.
"Who wouldn't welcome the opportunity to meet Keith Richards as a young boy?" said Little, Brown's Megan Tingley.
She continued: "Gus and Me invites readers to be in the room at the electrifying moment that Keith holds a guitar in his hands for the first time."
