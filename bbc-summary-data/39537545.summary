Video Assistant Referee: Australia's A-League uses system during trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia's A-League used the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system as it became the first domestic competition to trial the technology.

VAR was used in awarding Sydney FC a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Wellington Phoenix.
Bobo scored the spot-kick, which came about after the VAR official alerted the referee to a handball by centre-back Marco Rossi from a corner.
Phoenix claimed a foul on Rossi had led to the offence.
Wellington equalised late on through former Celtic striker Michael McGlinchey, who is a New Zealand international.
VAR was first in place for Melbourne City's 1-0 win over Adelaide United on Saturday, but was not needed.
The technology can only review incidents relating to goals, red cards, mistaken identities and penalties.
As part of Fifa's ongoing testing, VARs will be involved for the remaining two rounds of the regular Australian season plus the three weeks of finals.
World governing body Fifa's president Gianni Infantino is keen to employ the system during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
VAR technology was used to correct two decisions as Spain beat France in a friendly last month, previously having been used in France's 3-1 friendly win in Italy last September.
It could be used in English football as early as August, bringing forward the start of a planned trial by several months.
The Football Association had initially said the technology could be trialled in the FA Cup in January 2018, but could now begin in the EFL Cup first round.
