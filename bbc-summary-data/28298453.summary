Ex-Taliban captive Sgt Bergdahl to return to active military duty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sgt Bowe Bergdahl is set to return to active military duty at the end of his reintegration process following years of captivity in Afghanistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The soldier, who was held for five years by the Taliban, will take an administrative job on a Texas base.
Sgt Bergdahl was released in May in a swap for five Taliban commanders, a move some US politicians decried.
The army is investigating the circumstances of his capture, including whether he intended to desert.
He will take a job "commensurate to his rank" at US Army North at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston and live in officer quarters there, a base official told the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan.
Colleagues in his "duty section" will offer support, the official said.
Sgt Bergdahl has yet to speak publicly regarding his ordeal since his release on 31 May.
The move to release five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay after Sgt Bergdahl was transferred to US special forces sparked a heated political row in the US.
The US opened an investigation into his disappearance in 2009 but said investigators would not interview Sgt Bergdahl until he finished the reintegration process.
The US military has concluded he walked away from his base without authorisation before his capture but has stopped short of accusing him of desertion.
