Tahvon Campbell: Yeovil Town extend West Brom striker's loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil Town have extended Tahvon Campbell's loan from West Bromwich Albion until 3 March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old striker has made four appearances for the Glovers so far this season.
The youngster scored his first professional goal in Yeovil's 2-1 win over Crawley on Saturday.
That result means the Somerset side will travel to Wimbledon in League Two on Saturday in search of back-to-back victories.
