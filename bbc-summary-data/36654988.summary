The contest was triggered when Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would resign after the Brexit vote.
The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP could be the first candidate to officially declare.
Mr Crabb is expected to launch his bid with Business Secretary Sajid Javid as his number two on Wednesday.

Carole Walker, BBC political correspondent, said while his team acknowledge that he will be considered an outsider in the race, he will set out a plan for a route out of the EU and how he would unite the party and country.
A senior Welsh Conservative told BBC Wales: "Stephen Crabb is the future of the Conservative Party.
"He is a Conservative with a whole wealth of life experiences which put him completely in touch with the concerns of real people".
Cardiff North Tory MP Craig Williams said he would support Mr Crabb if he stood because he was the "embodiment of one nation Conservatism".
"Given his background, experience and qualifications, I believe he is the right man to bring the country together after what has been a divisive period."
On Monday Mr Crabb, who campaigned to keep the UK in the EU, said the party needed a leader who could unite the country following the referendum.
"What I want to see is a candidate emerge who understands the enormity of the situation we're in and who has got a clear plan to deliver on the expectations of the 17 million people who voted to come out last week," he said.
