The 68-year-old, who is originally from Glasgow, was attacked in HMP Edinburgh on Wednesday. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.
A 30-year-old man has been reported to the procurator fiscal.
Tobin is serving three life sentences for murdering Polish student Angelika Kluk, Scots schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton and Essex teenager Dinah McNicol.
A Police Scotland statement said: "Police Scotland can confirm that a 30-year-old man has been reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with a serious assault on a 68-year-old man at HMP Edinburgh."
The incident happened at about 12.30.
Tobin was convicted of murdering 23-year-old Ms Kluk at a church in Glasgow in 2006.
The following year, the bodies of 18-year-old Ms McNicol, from Essex, and Ms Hamilton, 15, from Redding in Falkirk, were found in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent.
In 2006, Strathclyde Police set up Operation Anagram to establish whether Tobin could be linked to or ruled out of other crimes.
