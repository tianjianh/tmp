The sport gems you missed - all in one handy newsletter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We have launched a newsletter which gives you a slightly different take on the world of sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rather than repeat the big headlines you will already be familiar with, we will dig deeper to give you our hidden gems from right across the BBC network.
It might be fascinating reads, surprising stats, compelling video, an iPlayer exclusive, an engrossing iWonder guide or the best from BBC Radio 5 live that you may have missed.
Some will make you think, some will make you smile, and some you can simply mark down as random.
One thing it will never be however, is predictable.
Interested in giving your inbox something fresh to digest? Then head here to sign up.
