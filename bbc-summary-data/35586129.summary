[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Q" Johnson, also known as Ricky or Jamie Sampson, and a man known as "Diego" are being sought over the attack on 26 December in Reading.
It happened close to the junction of Sidmouth Street and Queens Road.
The male victim was stabbed with a kitchen knife and treated for chest wounds and a punctured lung.
Detectives believe the stabbing was not a random attack and reminded the public that the "harbouring of these men" could be a crime.
Police said "Q" Johnson, 21, has links to Reading, Bedford and Wandsworth in London.
Both men are black, about 5ft 8ins and of medium build.
Det Con Ben Sherriff said: "If you are harbouring either of these men then you could be committing a crime, so it is vitally important that you contact us now."
