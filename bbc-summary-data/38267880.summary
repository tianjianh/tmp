A "drugs lord" who felt "untouchable" and two of his associates have been jailed for a cocaine conspiracy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian McGuigan, 39, of Ty Croes, Anglesey, was locked up for eight years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and a firearms offence.
Anthony Donovan, 33, and Brian Townsend, 36, both from Liverpool were jailed for four years and eight months for the drugs charge.
Caernarfon Crown Court heard it was an "unsophisticated" drugs enterprise.
On 5 September, McGuigan was filmed by police handing over more than Â£35,000 in cash to Donovan and Townsend, who officers described as "drug couriers".
North Wales Police said McGuigan was watched stashing cocaine in a field, which officers searched and found drugs worth up to Â£176,000.
Officers also found eight hollow point bullets "designed to expand on impact" in his car and a taser disguised as an iPhone in his home.
McGuigan was given a concurrent five year sentence for these offences.
Speaking after the case, Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney said: "Ian Paul McGuigan was considered by some as 'Anglesey's drug lord' where in fact he was a leech preying on the vulnerable in our towns and villages whilst portraying himself as a legitimate car dealer and horse breeder.
"Until his recent arrest he believed he was untouchable."
