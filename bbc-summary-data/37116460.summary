Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey looks likely to miss Wales' opening World Cup qualifier with Moldova on 5 September.

The 25-year-old international was taken off in the second half of Arsenal's opening Premier League defeat against Liverpool last weekend.
Ramsey will be sidelined for a further three weeks with a hamstring injury.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: "He should be back after the international break," ruling Ramsey out of league matches with Leicester and Watford.
Crystal Palace midfielder Jonny Williams, 22, will definitely miss Wales' opening three qualifiers with an ankle injury.
Williams was injured in a pre-season friendly against non-league Farnborough and is expected to be out for up to 10 weeks, making him a doubt for the games against Austria and Georgia in October.
He was part of the Wales squad for Euro 2016, starting the opening game against Slovakia.
Ramsey was regarded as the outstanding performer in Chris Coleman's squad during Wales' unprecedented success at Euro 2016.
He was named in Uefa's official team of the tournament after helping Wales reach their first semi-final.
But Ramsey missed the 2-0 semi-final loss to Portugal after picking up two yellow cards during the opening five games.
Another concern for manager Coleman is the fitness of striker Hal Robson Kanu, who is without a club after being released by Reading.
Kanu has not played since the Euro 2016 semi-final having scored twice in the tournament.
