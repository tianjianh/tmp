The Britpop veterans announced last month they were releasing their first album in more than a decade.
The band reunited in 2009 for a pair of shows at Hyde Park and a Sunday night headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival.
They join Sunday night Isle of Wight headliners Fleetwood Mac and Friday co-headliners The Prodigy and The Black Keys.
The 2015 line-up also includes US singer Pharrell Williams, Paolo Nutini, Groove Armada and The Charlatans.
The event will be held at Seaclose Park in Newport between 11 and 14 June.
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kings of Leon and Biffy Clyro topped the bill last year.
