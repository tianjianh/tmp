Kent struggle under the spotlight against Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent struggled to 237 all out on a very windy first day/night of their history-making County Championship clash with Glamorgan at Canterbury.

Glamorgan seamers John Glover (4-49) and Graham Wagg (3-52) starred as Kent were bowled out for 237 in the 89th over, Joe Denly top scoring with 69.
The visitors found it similarly hard work facing a pink ball on a slow pitch under the lights in the night air.
They reached 2-0 in the five overs before the scheduled close (2100 BST).
Kent and Glamorgan accepted the request by the England and Wales Cricket Board to play the match under the experimental arrangements as both sides are out of contention for promotion from Division Two of the County Championship - and there is nothing riding on the match.
BBC Radio Kent's Matt Cole:
"I almost got the feeling of the first day of the season here at the St Lawrence Ground, such was the hubbub created by the world's media descending on this humble second division County Championship match.
"The first tactical oddity we saw was the Glamorgan spinners being brought on as early as the seventh over, as the pink ball did absolutely nothing in the air or off the pitch.
"The match then settled into a sluggish rhythm, Kent scoring at barely more than two and a half an over on a slow wicket with an even more pedestrian outfield. It felt at times that batsmen were being dismissed by torpor rather than bowling technique.
"The predictions of night dew giving lethal assistance to the bowlers didn't come true on a windy evening.
"The one on-field problem for the players was the ball not being bright enough for wicketkeeper and fielders.
"Off the field, a winter coat and woolly muffler were de rigueur for supporters braced against the September chill."
