The migrants were on board a "highly overloaded inflatable vessel" which got into difficulty off the coast of Libya on Monday afternoon.
The rescuees included seven children, 26 women and 92 men.
They were helped on board the Irish ship, where they were given food, water and medical attention.
On Monday evening, the crew was redeployed to transfer a further 375 migrants from an Italian vessel to the nearest Italian port.
The operation was led by the Italian Marine Rescue Co-Ordination Centre (MRCC).
More than 2,000 migrants are said to have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe.
The LÉ Niamh is the second Irish naval vessel to be deployed to assist the international humanitarian rescue effort.
Its sister ship, the LÉ Eithne, brought more than 3,376 migrants to safety during its seven-week deployment that began on 16 May.
