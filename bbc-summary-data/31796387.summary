Basingstoke house fire death 'not suspicious' say police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "intense" house fire in which a woman died is not being treated as suspicious by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze, in Buckfast Close, Basingstoke, on Sunday morning led to the arrest of a 26-year-old man, but he was released with no further action.
Two people escaped the house and attempted to re-enter, but found it "impossible" due to the magnitude of the blaze, the fire service said.
Hampshire Constabulary said the woman has not yet been formally identified.
An investigation into the cause is still under way.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service received the first of seven calls about the fire in the ground floor of the end-terrace property shortly before 05:00 GMT on Sunday.
The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.
