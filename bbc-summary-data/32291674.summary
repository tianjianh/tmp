Marco Rubio launches 2016 White House run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Florida Senator Marco Rubio has urged Americans to look to the future as he launched his 2016 White House campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Rubio, 43, said in a Miami speech he would "lead the way toward a new American century".
He presented the presidential election as "a generational choice" and warned against going back to "the leaders and ideas of the past".
He is the third Republican to officially announce a candidacy after Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
It comes a day after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would stand for the Democratic nomination.
Referring to her but not by name, Mr Rubio said: "A leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday."
Mr Rubio, a Cuban-American, has been a harsh critic of President Barack Obama's policies, especially on immigration and the diplomatic thaw with Cuba.
He said in his speech that his poor Cuban parents had lived the American Dream but he questioned whether that dream was still possible due to the burden of taxes and regulation.
The Florida senator, who was first elected in 2010, holds conservative positions on government and military spending, abortion and negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.
He was previously criticised by some Republicans for initially supporting a bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill.
He has since said that border security must be strengthened before any change, criticising Mr Obama's executive actions on immigration.

There was a subtropical heat outside downtown Miami's Freedom Tower, the newspaper-building-turned-art-museum that served as a government processing facility for Cuban refugees in the 1960s.
The symbolism of this site for a presidential announcement for Florida Senator Marco Rubio is obvious.
The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio will make his "American Dream" success story - and Latino ancestry - a driving narrative of his campaign.
Mr Rubio will likely try to paint a sharp contrast with Mrs Clinton who could be his opponent next year - and convince Republicans he's their best hope for victory.
After all, it was another fresh-faced senator with a gift for rhetoric and a compelling personal narrative who beat Mrs Clinton when she ran for president in 2008.
Although Mr Rubio may shy from the comparison, the parallels are clear. Is Marco Rubio the next Barack Obama?
Mr Rubio would be the first Hispanic president if he won, as would Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
The field for the Republican nomination is likely to be crowded, with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker also expected to run.
Mrs Clinton, the first major candidate on the Democratic side to declare, is travelling to Iowa and other states, seeking to meet voters before a more formal rally in May.
