Tom Watson defends actions over Lord Brittan allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has insisted he had a "duty" to inform police of sex abuse allegations against former Home Secretary Leon Brittan.

Mr Watson has faced calls to apologise, from Lord Brittan's brother Sir Samuel Brittan, over "unfounded accusations" after police dropped a rape inquiry.
Mr Watson said he was sorry for distress caused to the Brittan family.
But, in a blog for The Huffington Post, the MP said he had wanted the claims "properly investigated".
Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January aged 75.
He had not been told there was no case for him to answer over an alleged rape in 1967.
Sir Samuel said Mr Watson "should apologise to my sister-in-law [Lady Brittan] for making unfounded accusations against my brother".
Responding, Mr Watson admitted he should not have repeated a claim that Lord Brittan was "close to evil".
He added: "I have said in the past that I am sorry for the distress Leon Brittan's family experienced as they grieved for him.  I still am."
But he said he had been told of "multiple allegations".
He admitted he "did not and could not know if they were true" but said he thought they should be "fully investigated".
"As the tributes flowed in from his lifelong friends, I felt for those people who claimed he abused them," he said.
"The choice facing anyone who is presented with testimony of this kind is whether to pass it on to the authorities and urge them to investigate or to ignore it.
"I chose the first option. I felt it was my duty to do so."
The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967.
Mr Watson later called for a full review of all abuse allegations made against the peer.
Officers subsequently interviewed Lord Brittan, who had terminal cancer at the time, but no charges were brought.
Police have since said they would not have taken further action over the rape claim.
London Mayor Boris Johnson has discussed the case with Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner.
Mr Johnson regards the delay in contacting Lord Brittan as "completely unacceptable".
Tory MP Nigel Evans, himself cleared of sexual abuse, earlier told the BBC that Mr Watson had "set himself up as judge and jury".
"Even when Leon had died, Tom Watson decided to repeat the allegations," Mr Evans said. "It is totally unfounded."
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont said police investigations into historical abuse risked becoming a "witch-hunt".
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: "I visited Lord Brittan several times in his last days and saw the suffering of a man under the shadow of the vilest accusations. This was an extremely painful time for his wife."
Earlier this week, a vulnerable man who made sex abuse allegations against high-profile figures, including Lord Brittan, told the BBC he may have been led into making the claims by campaigners.
