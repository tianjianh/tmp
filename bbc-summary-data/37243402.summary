The facility, built on the site of the Graves Tennis and Leisure Centre in Norton, includes swimming pools, tennis courts and fitness studios.
The centre, run by Places for People Leisure, also houses one of three hubs of the UK's National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine.
Physiotherapists and doctors will be based in its consultation and treatment rooms.
A gymnastics and trampolining centre at the site, re-named the Graves Health and Sports Centre, remains under construction.
Councillor Mary Lea, Sheffield City Council's cabinet member for culture, parks and leisure, said the site would put "public health and sport together".
"It's a massive building with fantastic facilities - it's everything the local community and Sheffield needs," she said.
