Brighton have broken their transfer record for the third time this summer by signing Colombian international Jose Izquierdo from Club Brugge.

The Premier League newcomers announced the reported £13.5m deal for the winger last week but he had to apply for work permit clearance in order to secure a UK work visa.
Izquierdo has now signed a contract until June 2021.
The 25-year-old scored 15 goals in the Belgian Pro League last term.
Boss Chris Hughton described Izquierdo as "one of the standout players" in Belgium over the past three years.
"This has been a very complex deal, but I am absolutely delighted we are finally in a position to confirm it is completed," he said.
"He's a very exciting player to watch, and along with that excitement, he will bring pace and creativity to the team; he also has an excellent goalscoring record."
Izquierdo won the Belgian Cup during his first season with Brugge in 2014-15, followed by the Belgian League title a year later - when he was named Belgium's player of the year.
His two international caps came in friendly matches against Cameroon and Spain in June.
Hughton's side broke their transfer record last Monday when they signed Dutch midfielder Davy Propper from PSV Eindhoven for around £6m.
They had already paid a reported £5m in June for Valencia's Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Brighton have also signed Soufyan Ahannach from Almere City this summer.
The 21-year-old winger joins from the Dutch second-tier club on a five-year deal, having scored 18 goals and provided 15 assists in 42 games last season.

Albion's spending before their Premier League bow has been gradual and measured across the summer. Having secured the services of dependable Pascal Gross and Markus Suttner from the Bundesliga, chairman Tony Bloom is starting to back Chris Hughton with real cash.
Australia international Mathew Ryan fills a huge void after the departure of goalkeeper David Stockdale, Izzy Brown provides flexibility in attack after agreeing a season-long loan from Chelsea and now Davy Propper has been joined by Colombian international winger Jose Izquierdo.
That transfer record for Izquierdo could still be broken with the arrival of a much-needed striker, or the club could opt for a high-profile loan signing.
