T in the Park is being held at Strathallan Castle for the first time.
Organisers said the three-day event was running well so far.
About 60,000 revellers are camping at the site, with more than 80,000 music fans expected to attend the festival over the weekend.
Police Scotland said they had made 12 arrests and recorded 83 crimes, however they stressed that number was on a par with last year.
The event was moved across Perthshire to Strathallan after concerns were raised about an oil pipeline running under the festival's long-time home at Balado.
After a lengthy planning battle, organisers DF Concerts won permission to host T in the Park at the estate for the next three summers.
On Friday, Sam Smith, Kasabian and David Guetta performed helping raise the curtain on this year's event.
Festival director Geoff Ellis said there was "an incredible atmosphere onsite" and urged fans to "have a brilliant weekend and show everyone why T in the Parkers are always named the best audience in the world".
Selfie sticks, flagpoles and nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, have been  banned from the festival site.
On Sunday, the event will be closed by Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds after performances by Stereophonics and The Prodigy.
