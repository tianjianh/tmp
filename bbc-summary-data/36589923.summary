Garden Within A Garden, by Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi, has been painted in Lister Park and City Park, Bradford.
More than one million Muslim, Sikh and Hindu soldiers fought for Britain between 1914 and 1918.
The work, inspired by Pakistani and Indian miniature painting, uses acrylics straight on the city's paving.
Qureshi lives in Lahore, in modern-day Pakistan, but that area as part of British India enlisted a large number of soldiers to fight for Britain.
"War is already about horrific images of blood and lost lives, so I came up with the idea of a garden in a garden", he said.
Councillor Sarah Ferriby said: " It is an opportune moment for us to reflect on the experiences of people from across the world who fought on the side of the Allies in the First World War and the invaluable contribution they made to the war efforts."
India gained independence from the British in August 1947 and split into two separate countries - the secular state of India dominated by Hindus and Muslim Pakistan.
Garden Within A Garden will be on display in Bradford until September.
It has been co-commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK's arts programme for the World War One centenary, Bradford Council and Yorkshire Festival 2016.
