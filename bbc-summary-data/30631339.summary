New Year Honours: Hillsborough campaigners appointed CBE

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Hillsborough campaigners have been appointed CBE in the New Year Honours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Margaret Aspinall and Trevor Hicks campaigned for more than 20 years to secure fresh inquests into the deaths of 96 people in the disaster.
Mr Hicks' daughters Sarah, 19, and Victoria, 15, and Mrs Aspinall's son James, 18, were among those who died at the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989.
Mrs Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said she would accept it on behalf of the families.
A jury is currently hearing the new inquests in Warrington before coroner Lord Justice Goldring.
Mrs Aspinall said: "It's not just about Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall, it's about everybody involved in this. It's all about the people who stood by us.
"From the beginning, when you are fighting against everything, nearly 26 years ago, you had this stigma against you all the time, fighting against that, I feel we have turned it all around now and the stigma is going away.
"People are seeing now, the real people, what the genuine people are like, and the people who stood by the families and stayed with them all these years, so it's for them as well."
Mr Hicks, president of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: "On a personal level, obviously I'm very flattered. I know it's a bit cheesy but I'm also a bit humbled as well.
"It's not just for me. As it says in the citation, it's for services to the bereaved families.
"It's been a hard slog. We've been accused many times of being vindictive - and lots worse than that. But we've always tried, as a family support group, to play fair."
Fellow campaigner Anne Williams, who died in April 2013, was honoured with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Ceremony in 2013.
Ms Williams, 60, fought for a new inquest into her son Kevin's death.
Two investigations are being carried out into the aftermath of the disaster - one led by police and one headed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Other Merseyside & Cheshire honours include:
CBE
OBE
MBE
