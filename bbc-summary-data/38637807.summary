Peter Toulson, 53, sold the magazine from a pitch outside a department store in York's Parliament Street. He died in November.
A friend of Mr Toulson set up an appeal to raise £3,000 to pay for a funeral. The fund raised more than £5,000.
The funeral took place at Lawnswood Crematorium in Leeds and a memorial service is due to be held in York in February.

Organiser John McGall said: "We did not want a pauper's funeral. We wanted a good send off for Pete and it was the least I could do for a friend.
"It is very sad but Pete would be overwhelmed by the generosity of the people of York and from all over the world."
Mr McGall said the remaining money raised would go to homeless charities.
