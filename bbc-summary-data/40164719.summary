Paul Clarke, from Middlesbrough, was in a restaurant with his wife and two children when the trio burst in on Saturday night.
Mr Clarke said one of the knife-wielding attackers looked directly at him before carrying out the attack.
He said the "horrible" images were still "playing around in his head".
Mr Clarke, his wife Wendy and 14-year-old son Miles were meeting their daughter and her fiancÃ© in the Black and Blue Steakhouse in Borough Market, London.
The family escaped injury but were near the spot where  police shot and killed the three suspects.
Mr Clarke said one of the attackers pinned a member of the restaurant staff to the ground.
"He stood there and looked at me. He had a long weapon in his hand and had a guy on the floor who was in his kitchen whites," he added.

Mrs Clarke said they were alerted by screams coming from outside the restaurant and someone shouting "they've got knives and they're killing people".
"I just kept thinking that we wouldn't get out of this alive," she added.
The couple's daughter and her fiancÃ© remained inside the restaurant hiding under a table during the attack. The family were reunited several hours later.
Mr Clarke said his daughter told him she had witnessed two further stabbings.
He added: "I'm still feeling emotionally up and down."
