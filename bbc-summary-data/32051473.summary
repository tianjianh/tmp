KFC promises 'hedgehog-friendly packaging'

Fast food giant KFC has announced it is to change its packaging after reports its lids were endangering hedgehogs.

It follows pressure from the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS).
The Shropshire-based charity said the large holes in the lids of dumped Krushems milkshake cups meant hedgehogs were getting stuck.
KFC said it planned to introduce a lid with a smaller hole, which would be stocked by all its restaurants.
"From today, KFC in the UK and Ireland will cease production of the current lid for the Krushems cup," a spokesperson for the firm said.
In 2006, the BHPS won a six-year battle against McDonalds over a similar issue with its McFlurry packaging.
Fay Vass, chief executive of the society, said she was delighted by KFC's decision.
She said the BHPS had been in discussions with KFC over the last eight to nine months, after seeing a video of a hedgehog stuck in one of its lids.
Ms Vass said litter generally was having a "devastating" impact on wildlife.
