[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton roundabout fence will 'reduce crashes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fence blocking drivers' views as they approach a roundabout will help prevent accidents, a council has claimed.

Northamptonshire County Council installed the "visibility screen" at the Danes Camp Way roundabout, in the hope it would slow down vehicles.
Some people told BBC Northampton's Facebook page it was "dangerous" while others backed the move.
Motoring group the AA said, drivers would have to be "pretty stupid" not to slow down at the roundabout.
But Paul Watters, head of road policing at the AA, said alternative options may have been better.
"It's a compromise solution," he said.
"Traffic lights or realigning the approach roads to make the traffic slower would be other, more expensive, options."
The council said it installed the fence after residents expressed concerns about the safety of the roundabout.
"Accident data showed that many collisions in the locality were caused by speeding vehicles and we worked with the police and residents to achieve a solution," a spokesman for the council said.
"Visibility screens have worked well elsewhere in the country and we are monitoring the effect of this one by comparing speed data before the measure against data to be collected now it has been established."
The fence prompted a large reaction on Facebook, where Simon Lambert said: "It's absolutely awful I felt like I was entirely blind - doesn't the highway code tell you to make 'proper observation' when approaching a roundabout - How can you??"
Emma Gosling disagreed: "It slows traffic enough to create gaps for others to get onto the roundabout and since this has been installed I haven't had to wait 10 mins for a gap in the traffic so it's absolutely doing it's job."
