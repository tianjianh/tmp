Mr Megraw was abducted from his home in the Twinbrook area of west Belfast in April, 1978, and murdered by the IRA.
His remains were found in bogland in County Meath in September 2014.
The Irish state pathologist told Thursday's inquest that 22-year-old Mr Megraw had been shot in the forehead and possibly a second time in the arm.
Dr Marie Cassidy said she also observed an exit wound on the back of the neck.
She said that Mr Megraw's remains were found bent over and his ankles were crossed.
She concluded that it was most likely that he died as a result of a gunshot injury to the head.
The Disappeared were people abducted, murdered and secretly buried, mainly by the IRA, in the 1970s.
Six victims are still to be found.
Marie Megraw, who married Brendan in 1977, told the inquest that she had no idea why her husband was taken.
She said a gang of nine men forced their way into their home on the morning of 8 April 1978.
Mrs Megraw said the men pushed past her and knocked her over and asked where her husband was.
Mr Megraw was out shopping with his mother at the time.
Marie Megraw, who was pregnant at the time, said she asked why they wanted him and was told he had stolen a TV and a cassette player.
Mrs Megraw told the inquest that she was then tied up in the bedroom and injected with a substance the men told her would "calm her down".
She said when her husband returned home the men took him.
Ms Megraw said she was warned there would be serious consequences if she went to the police.
SeÃ¡n Megraw, Brendan 's eldest brother, told the inquest that the murder had a had a traumatic effect on the family.
He said his mother, Bridget, had died not knowing what had happened to her son.
However he said his brother is no longer resting in a cold bog grave.
"We now have a grave to visit", he said.
