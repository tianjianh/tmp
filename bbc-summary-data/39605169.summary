James Norwood and Connor Jennings both struck twice as Tranmere guaranteed the runners-up spot in the National League with a routine victory over relegated Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lincoln's win earlier in the day meant Rovers could not catch them in the race for the title, but it failed to curb their effort.
Rovers had a handful of chances before they took a deserved 25th-minute lead, Michael Ihiekwe providing the through ball for Norwood to fire the ball past goalkeeper Chris Cheetham.
The home side wrapped it up at the start of the second half with two quick-fire goals, Norwood doubling his tally with a delightful lob inside the first minute for his 14th goal of the season, before Jennings curled a third into the top corner in the 50th minute.
Rovers defender Lee Vaughan was withdrawn injured on a stretcher following a challenge by Spencer Myers, who reduced the arrears in the 61st minute after a neat knock-down by Andrai Jones.
But, the hosts restored their three-goal advantage 10 minutes later when James Wallace provided the pass for Jennings to slide the ball under Cheetham.
