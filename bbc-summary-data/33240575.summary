Karl Robinson: MK Dons have 'bottom-three budget'

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson says he feels he can get the players he needs despite having one of the lowest budgets in the Championship in 2015-16.

The Dons were promoted to the second tier for the first time last season.
"We have a wage cap and have always had one. I can well assure you our budget will be in the bottom three next year," Robinson told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"The chairman's trying to build a sustainable club and the way he's doing it has been sensational."
Robinson, whose only signing so far this summer has been Joe Walsh from Crawley, added: "We've been criticised for not spending a great deal but we've managed to achieve our goal of reaching the Championship.
"We know next year is going to be even harder - we believe that we can recruit the players we need but we'll never spend the money other Championship teams are doing."
Robinson's side are being linked with re-signing former loanees Will Grigg from Brentford and Chelsea's Lewis Baker, but the 34-year-old says the decision over the players' future is not theirs.
"We'd like Will Grigg, but what we want and what we can get are two different arguments. We know we're going to be bringing in strikers - we've already earmarked one or two.
"We'd love Lewis Baker. But he's not our player, so wherever he goes next season, we hope it's us, but it's out of our hands.
"I think we need six or seven - I'd like to sign some of my own. I'd like to bring in players who are 21, 22, 23 and bring them on, some experienced players and then add some young loans."
Goalkeeper David Martin, who made 47 appearances for MK Dons last season, is out of contract this summer, but his manager believes he will sign a new contract at Stadium:MK.
"I'm very confident we'll get Dave done. He got married two weeks ago and is away on his honeymoon," Robinson added.
"He had a tremendous season last season, kept an enormous amount of clean sheets and will have to do that again, even more so, in the Championship. Once we sit down and have a conversation, I'll be very surprised if we don't get that done."
Robinson was also quick to play down any heightening of expectations next season, adding staying up would be classed as successful.
"People are liking us to Wolves and Bournemouth - we're not on the same hemisphere as these teams," he said. "We can't do what these teams have done.
"We're going into a Championship with a different way of doing it, but we'll do it our way. Our way is a way our fans know, and hopefully the football club can again turn one or two heads."
