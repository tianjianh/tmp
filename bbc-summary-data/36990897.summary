Tom Colwyn Price, 22, of Rumney, Cardiff, John Henry Janes, 25, of Trowbridge, Cardiff, and Simon Patrick Dooley, 27, from Almondsbury, Bristol, took gold jewellery.
Pleading guilty at Cardiff Crown Court, they were given sentences from eight years three months to three years.
They targeted homes in Pontprennau and Rumney in February.
The court heard they were caught after a woman returned home to Pontprennau and was threatened by Price and Dooley who were armed with screwdrivers as Janes waited in a car outside.
When police arrived, the two men tried to escape by smashing through glass patio doors.
But all three were arrested and the stolen jewellery found.
Det Insp Dan Michel described it as "a terrifying experience" for the homeowner.
"The willingness of Price and Dooley to use violence stood out and something we had not encountered in previous burglary investigations," added the South Wales Police officer.
For the Pontprennau incident, Price and Dooley pleaded guilty to robbery while Janes admitted burglary.
Price and Dooley also pleaded guilty to a burglary in Greenway Road, Rumney, that happened earlier the same day.
Price was sentenced to a total of seven years, Dooley eight years three months and Janes to three years in prison.
