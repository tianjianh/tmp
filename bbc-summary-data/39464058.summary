Barrow managed to earn a 2-2 draw with relegation-battling Woking despite playing the whole of the second half with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game burst into life on the stroke of half-time as Paul Turnbull was shown a straight red card for handling the ball in the area, allowing Woking's Jamie Lucas to fire his side in front from the spot.
Barrow were level seven minutes after half-time when Jordan Williams' sublime curling free-kick found the top corner of Michael Poke's goal.
Keiran Murtagh then put the visitors back in front in the 70th minute with a powerful finish.
But with 10 minutes remaining Richard Bennett managed to bundle the ball over the line after good work from Moussa Diarra.
The draw keeps Barrow three points adrift of the play-off spots, while Woking are out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
