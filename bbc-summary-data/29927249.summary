Caterham and Marussia on 2015 entry list despite administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caterham and Marussia have both been included on next year's entry list for the Formula 1 world championship despite going into administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caterham have re-entered under the company name of 1 Malaysia Racing Sdn Bhd, which owns the team's F1 rights.
Marussia have re-branded and will be known as Manor F1 Team if they return.
Both teams were given dispensation to miss last week's US Grand Prix and this weekend's Brazilian GP. The season ends in Abu Dhabi on 23 November.
Under the regulations of motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, entry fees to compete next year must be paid by 30 November.
Entering on the 2015 list, even provisionally, gives both teams a greater chance of securing a prospective buyer in the meantime.
Caterham's administrators, meanwhile, expect the team to be in a position to race in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
"I think I've got enough confidence now to say I'd be very surprised if we were not racing in Abu Dhabi," said Finbarr O'Connell, one of Caterham's co-administrators representing Smith & Williamson.
"I'm now really hopeful for the future of the team."
