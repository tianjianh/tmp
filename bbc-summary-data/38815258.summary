Bedeau joined the Shakers in summer after being released by League Two side Leyton Orient.
The 17-year-old made his professional debut in November and has since made a further six senior appearances.
"This is such a massive opportunity for me at such a young age," he told Championship club Villa's website.
"I'm looking forward to taking that opportunity and developing even more at such a big club."
