Kaleb Amponsah stabbed Ade Afariogun twice in the stomach in front of three of the victim's friends in Plaistow Park, Newham, on 29 January.
The 27-year-old was attacked after getting into a scuffle with Amponsah, the Old Bailey heard.
The 18-year-old, of Robertson Road, Canning Town, had claimed he acted in self-defence but was found guilty.
Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said Amponsah had "cycled past Ade Afariogun on several occasions and... stared angrily at him" before the pair got into an argument.
He then produced a large knife and stabbed Mr Afariogun in the stomach, leaving the victim with a 12cm (5in) wound in his abdomen.
The victim was taken to Royal London Hospital but died on 1 February.
Amponsah fled following the attack, leaving his bike and mobile phone in the park.
Police said the items were used to retrieve the teenager's DNA and he was arrested on 5 February.
A knife and the clothing worn by Amponsah during the attack were found in his bedroom.
Det Sgt Perry Benton said Mr Afariogun was "killed for reasons that we have been unable to ascertain".
"He was well loved by his family and friends, who miss him very much," he said.
