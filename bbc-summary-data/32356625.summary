Aberystwyth University researches bad tasting beer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Researchers at Aberystwyth University are attempting to solve the problem of bad tasting beer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yeast often suffers heat damage during brewing which can cause a bad taste.
The researchers are trying to understand why some yeast cells survive high temperatures and others do not.
Dr Hazel Davey said: "Our lab strain of yeast recovers well if provided with nutrients during the hot conditions, whereas the brewers' yeast shows better recovery in the absence of nutrients."
