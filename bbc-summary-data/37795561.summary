Brentford 0-2 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Sone Aluko and Tom Cairney gave Fulham a west London derby win over Brentford at Griffin Park.

Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley saved Aluko's initial shot but the winger followed up from close range to give Fulham a deserved half-time lead.
The Bees did not register a single shot on goal in the first period.
Ex-Brentford keeper David Button superbly saved Josh Clarke's effort before Cairney slotted in Fulham's second on the break in stoppage time.
A win for Dean Smith's Bees would have taken them into the play-off places before Saturday's Championship fixtures, but they failed to find the net for the fourth time in six league games.
Instead, they were leapfrogged by a Fulham side that is only outside the top six on goal difference.
Fulham, who had scored 11 times in their previous four Championship matches, should have been further ahead by the interval.
Full-backs Scott Malone and Ryan Fredericks were constant attacking threats but some wayward finishing let the visitors down, while Bentley rescued Brentford with saves from Stefan Johansen and Cairney.
Brentford struggled to seriously test Button too often on his return to Griffin Park following his summer move to Craven Cottage.
He made an excellent one-handed stop to deny Clarke an equaliser and Fulham survived a number of scrambles from set-pieces before Cairney's calmly-taken goal sealed victory.
Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London:
"We didn't perform well and didn't deserve to win. We knew they would come and press us but our use of the ball was not good enough.
"In the second half our midfielders had to get on the ball higher up the pitch and we were better.
"While not playing at our best, we showed some spirit and stayed in the game until the 93rd minute."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London:
"I am very happy. We showed another positive step and our progress. We tried to show our identity and our style and I am very satisfied for my lads and the Fulham fans.
"We didn't win in the last four games against Brentford and this is a nice present for people around us.
"We are in a learning process and want to be better."
