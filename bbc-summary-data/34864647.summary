Antrim Area Hospital nurses call off strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planned strike action by paediatric nurses at the Antrim Area Hospital on Thursday has been called off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unison, the health service union, said the walkout was suspended to allow more talks with the Northern Health Trust.
The dispute is over the rotation of nurses from the paediatric ward to the hospital's emergency department.
Unison's Brian Ferguson said the suspension would "allow for urgent meaningful negotiations to take place to try and resolve this trade dispute".
