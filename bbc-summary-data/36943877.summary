Brook says the bout in London will be "the biggest fight in world boxing" and that he has been "training like a wild horse".
The Briton is unbeaten in 36 fights, while undisputed world middleweight champion Golovkin, 34, has won all 35 of his professional bouts.
"I'm going to be so alive for that night," Brook said.
"No-one has ever got the best out of me. I want to test myself. I know we are going to see the best in me. I'm excited to see what I can do."
He added: "I'm the best welterweight on the planet and no-one seems to want to fight me. GGG is the same in the middleweight division."
