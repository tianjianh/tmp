William was on The Mall to praise the woman who was the focus of this celebration.
The future king's words were directed at his monarch and his grandmother.
The Queen travelled, with her husband, in an open-top car, while William, Kate and Harry were in the vehicle behind.
It presented an image of the present and the future of the monarchy.
It was a notable image with a notable absentee.
Prince Charles had chosen to miss the Patron's Lunch and instead attended a street party near his Highgrove home in Gloucestershire.
For a Queen, now 90, there will be ongoing adjustments made to her programme. Lifts will be used rather than flights of stairs; the length of visits will be not too long, and standing around will be kept to a minimum.
But, officials insist, Elizabeth remains this country's active and fully-engaged head of state.
