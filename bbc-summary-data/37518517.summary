Kvitova followed up wins over world number one Angelique Kerber and Britain's Johanna Konta with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of Romania's Halep.
The two-time Wimbledon champion needed just 67 minutes to win the semi-final.
Kvitova goes on to face Slovakian 10th seed Dominika Cibulkova, who beat Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6 6-3 6-4.
Cibulkova, who missed four months of the season in 2015 after having surgery on her left foot, is now close to qualifying for the eight-player WTA Finals in Singapore for the first time.
"I'm a good player," said the 27-year-old. "I can beat top players. But I was missing consistency in my game. This is the first year that I'm really consistent playing the whole year."
Kvitova, 26, hit 34 winners in a dominant display against Halep, overpowering the Romanian to reach her first final of 2015.
"It's amazing," said the two-time Wimbledon champion.
"I came to this tournament and really didn't expect this kind of performance. Physically I'm still so-so - I'm really happy that I'm not falling apart.
"But I played a really great match today in spite of everything, which really put the pressure on her."
