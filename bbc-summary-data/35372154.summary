Children forced into 'sexual activities' with animals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children were forced to engage in "sexual activities" with each other and animals at a hotel, a family court judge has concluded.

Social workers asked a judge to look into the case after allegations were made by a number of children.
Some of the abuse, which was videoed on occasion, allegedly took place at a Birmingham hotel.
Judge Hilary Watson concluded it was "highly probable" the children had been forced to perform sex acts on animals.
"Such suggestions might seem fantastical but become a grim reality when seen in the context of my findings that the children have been made to perform sexual activities with each other," she wrote in her judgement.
She made a series of findings of facts after analysing evidence at a family court hearing in Coventry.

Judge Watson said Coventry City Council was the local authority with responsibility for the children and that four children aged between eight and 14 were at the centre of the inquiries.
The claims had been made about a man they knew, who denied the allegations.
Det Ch Insp Ian Green, from West Midlands Police, said three people were arrested in May 2015 on suspicion of rape, but were told they would face no further action in July.
"The case is currently being reviewed and the evidence heard at a recent civil court hearing will feature in that review," he said.
Coventry City Council declined to comment.
