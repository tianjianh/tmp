Compatriot Callum Smith will fight Swede Erik Skoglund at the same weight in the $50m (Â£41m) tournament.
Chris Eubank Jr will also take part if he beats Arthur Abraham on 15 July. He would face Turkey's Avni Yildirim.
The knockout series features eight fighters at both super-middleweight and cruiserweight.
The winners of the tournament - which organisers say will "change the world of boxing" - will earn a share of the $50m prize and take the Muhammad Ali trophy.
If a world champion fights during the series, their belt will be on the line.
Groves, Smith and Eubank Jr picked their opponents at the draw in Monte Carlo as they were seeded. Eubank Jr was represented by his father.
Groves said choosing Cox was "strategic", adding: "It's a long tournament and you pick the easy guys first."
Smith, meanwhile, sacrificed a WBC world title shot against Anthony Dirrell to take part.
"I think stylistically, Erik is the best fight for me," he said.
