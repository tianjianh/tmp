Net income for the three months to September fell to 1.2tn won ($1.1bn; Â£713m), a drop of 25% compared with the same period last year.
That was lower than forecasts  - which were for around 1.5tn won.
Hyundai's numbers were hurt by a fall in sales in China and weaker than expected sales in the US - its two biggest markets.
The one bright spot was in India, where the firm reported a sales increase of 13.8%. However, overall the South Korean giant said global retail sales were down 0.9%.
Its South-Korean listed shares fell 1.8% on the news.
The car maker has blamed tough international competition and currency headwinds for is disappointing results this year. Sales in another major market - Russia -  were down close to 5% for the period as the falling value of the rouble hurt earnings.
Hyundai is the world's fifth largest automaker when combined with local affiliate Kia Motors.
