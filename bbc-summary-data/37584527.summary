Expat campaigner, 95, welcomes 'votes for life' proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has published details of plans to scrap the 15-year limit on expats' right to vote in UK general elections.

Constitution Minister Chris Skidmore said the "votes for life" would allow British citizens who have moved abroad to participate in British democracy.
It follows a long campaign waged by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler.
Mr Shindler, 95, told the BBC: "It seems the government are moving [on this] and that's good."
The government said the policy would need to work for five million overseas British citizens and should be in place in time for the next general election, due in 2020.
Its proposal, which was in the 2015 Conservative manifesto, would allow overseas British citizens who have been previously resident or registered to vote in the UK , to vote in future UK parliamentary elections.
They would not be allowed to vote in local elections, elections to the Welsh Assembly, Holyrood or Stormont.
Mr Shindler, who moved to Italy in 1982 and has not been able to vote in UK elections since 1997, told the BBC: "There's a letter on its way now - a short note to the prime minister saying 'well done for proposing this bill but let's have it in Parliament in this session'."
"And I would expect all MPs of all parties to accept the right of citizens to vote and not defeat this bill."
He added:"Now of course we will need to see exactly what the details are, but the fact that the government has published this is very welcome indeed."
The government document outlines how the government intends to check expats' identities and allow them to register. It anticipates that the change will cost less than Â£1m to implement.
Mr Skidmore said: "British citizens who move abroad remain a part of our democracy and it is important they have the ability to participate.
"Following the British people's decision to leave the EU, we now need to strengthen ties with countries around the world and show the UK is an outward-facing nation. Our expat community has an important role to play in helping Britain expand international trade, especially given two-thirds of expats live outside the EU."
"Expats retain strong links with the United Kingdom: they may have family here, and indeed they may plan to return here in the future. Modern technology and cheaper air travel has transformed the ability of expats to keep in touch with their home country."
Under UK law, expatriates who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote in British elections.
Mr Shindler first took the case to the ECHR in 2009, arguing that the rule effectively disenfranchised him and up to a million other Brits.
He highlights his family members in the UK, British bank account and being in receipt of a state pension as proof of his close links to the country.
Earlier this year Mr Shindler, and another expat campaigner Jacquelyn MacLennan, lost a Supreme Court battle over the right to vote in the EU referendum under the 15-year rule.
