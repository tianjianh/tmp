Birmingham's Great Charles Street affected by £500m revamp plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major road in Birmingham has been reduced to one lane amid a £500m redevelopment of the city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Great Charles Street northbound went down to one lane between Suffolk Street Queensway/Severn Street and Newhall Street in the early hours.
The city council urged drivers to leave extra time for journeys and to use public transport where possible.
The 10-year Paradise Circus scheme will see new offices, shops, restaurants and a hotel built.
Great Charles Street southbound will have single lane traffic between Newhall Street and Suffolk Street Queensway/Brunel Street from 2 August.
The restrictions will remain in place until next year.
Some overnight closures of the A38 tunnels and other restrictions may be needed, the council said.
