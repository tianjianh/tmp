Alex Gilbey saw red for a challenge on Ryan Leonard in the first half, but the visitors did a sterling defensive job until the closing stages.
Anthony Wordsworth broke the deadlock with a 20-yard effort against his old side, then captain Adam Barrett headed another from Jack Payne's corner.
On-loan striker Sam McQueen sealed it with an injury-time tap-in.
