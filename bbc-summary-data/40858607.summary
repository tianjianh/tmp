Dagenham & Redbridge 3-3 Ebbsfleet United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ebbsfleet produced a storming fightback to earn a point at Dagenham as their National League game ended 3-3.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides remain unbeaten after four games of the season, but Ebbsfleet finished the game the happier after coming from 2-0 and 3-1 adrift to share the spoils at the Chigwell Construction Stadium.
Corey Whitely swept a shot into the left corner to nudge Dagenham ahead in the 22nd minute, and the same player saw a penalty saved by Nathan Ashmore later in the first half before team-mate Kevin Lokko made it 2-0 just before the interval as Ebbsfleet failed to deal with a corner.
Jack Powell came off the bench and immediately cracked in a 58th-minute free-kick to give Ebbsfleet hope.
They slipped 3-1 behind after Morgan Ferrier curled in a super strike, but the gap was again cut when Luke Coulson found the target, and Danny Kedwell delighted the Ebbsfleet support with an 80th-minute headed leveller.
