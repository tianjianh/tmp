Malaysia's David beat the Englishwoman 15-13 11-5 11-3, hitting 30 winners in 39 minutes to claim the title.
"It was one of my best performances in quite a while," said David.
Despite defeat, US Open and Qatar Classic champion Massaro, 32, will replace Raneem El Welily as world number one in January.
"It was a high quality match and I tried to fight for every point but it was just too much in the end," said Massaro, who was aiming to win a third successive PSA World Series title.
"The first game was crucial and it could have been a different match if I'd taken that one but Nicol was playing at her best, and I was a little off my best, and that was ultimately the difference."
Massaro secured the number one ranking with her semi-final win in Hong Kong over Egypt's El Welily.
