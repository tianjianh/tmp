National League Barrow have signed midfielder Andy Parry on a deal until the end of the season following his release by Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parry, 24, has made two appearances for Barrow during a loan spell from the League Two club.
The former Southport and Telford player, who can also play in midfield, had a spell at league rivals Altrincham earlier in the season.
Bluebirds boss Paul Cox is hopeful of adding a further signing to his squad.
Meanwhile, Luton boss Nathan Jones says he "expects a quiet transfer deadline day", having already signed defender Alan Sheehan and forward Joe Pigott, while Luke Guttridge and Luke Wilkinson have left to join Dagenham and Stevenage respectively.
