Child protection body failed over paedophile reports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Information on 2,345 British paedophile suspects supplied by Canadian police was "poorly handled" by the body set up to protect children, a report has said.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission found the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) had not dealt with the material properly.
Toronto Police alerted Ceop to website users who had bought films thought to contain indecent images of children.
It was sent in July 2012, but had not been forwarded to police by late 2013.
It was only when Toronto Police again contacted Ceop in October that year for an update on progress that the oversight was found.
The intelligence from the operation, called Project Spade, has resulted in the jailing of Cambridge doctor Myles Bradbury, who abused young cancer patients, and Cardiff deputy head teacher Gareth Williams, who secretly filmed pupils.
Another person named was Essex deputy head teacher teacher Martin Goldberg, who was found dead a day after police questioned him.
A police officer, who had been seconded to Ceop at the time from a regional force, faced misconduct proceedings for allegedly failing in his duties and responsibilities.
At a meeting on Monday the allegations against him were found to be not proven.
In its report, released on Tuesday, the complaints watchdog said the initial handling of the material from the Canadian investigation had been appropriate.
But how it had been referred on afterwards was a concern.
It said: "There was evidence of a lack of a general understanding or agreement as to who had ownership of the issue for some time, disagreements as to which team within the organisation might have the capacity to take the lead and consider and process the information most appropriately."
At the time, Ceop was under the command of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The National Crime Agency (NCA) replaced Soca in October 2013.
An NCA spokesman said of the report findings: "No NCA officers faced any misconduct charges but one has received words of advice.
"As the IPCC has noted, the NCA commissioned two internal reviews to ensure that processes were improved.  All of the recommendations of these reviews were accepted and have been implemented."
He said the NCA's Ceop Command had "transformed significantly" during the last 18 months with the investment of Â£10m announced at the WeProtect summit in 2014.
And he added that in 2015 to 2016, 1,802 children were safeguarded or protected as a result of NCA activity.
