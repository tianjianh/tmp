A total of 300 temporary workers have been given permanent roles at Amazon's distribution centre in Fife, the company has announced.

The move brings the number of permanent staff at the Dunfermline centre to more than 640.
Amazon said it expected that number to rise to 750 as the facility continued to expand its operations.
The firm has committed to opening more UK warehouses over the next two years, creating another 2,000 permanent roles.
Amazon director of operations Catherine McDermott said: "We're delighted that so many of our top performing temporary associates have now joined us on a permanent basis.
"Amazon has invested over Â£1bn in its UK operations, including our fulfilment centre in Dunfermline where hundreds of employees focus every day on providing an exceptional experience for our customers all over the UK, Europe and the world."
Amazon opened its one million sq ft (92,000 sq m) centre in Dunfermline in late 2011, along with a customer services base at Waverley Gate in Edinburgh.
