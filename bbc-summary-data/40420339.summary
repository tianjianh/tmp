The victim has been named as Col Maxim Shapoval. His car was destroyed and two passers-by were slightly injured.
Officials said the incident was a "terrorist act".
No motive has been suggested but analysts say it may be connected to the Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
The explosion happened as the Mercedes was moving at around 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT), police said.
"At the present time the picture gathered of the crime suggests it was a planned terrorist act," Interior Ministry spokesman Artem Shevchenko said, without giving details of who they believed was behind the attack.
It is the latest in a series of attacks in Kiev. In March, former Russian MP Denis Voronenkov, a critic of President Vladimir Putin, was shot dead outside a hotel in the capital.
And last July, a prominent investigative Belarusian journalist and also a Kremlin critic, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by a bomb in his car in the capital.
