[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council tax to rise by 3% in Orkney

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Orkney have approved a 3% council tax rise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The increase will add £31 to bills for a Band D property.
Local authorities have been increasing the basic rate of council tax by up to 3% for the first time since 2007, however higher-band properties are paying more automatically after MSPs approved changes.
The 3% rise will see Band H properties in Orkney pay £542.60 more.
