Portsmouth manager Paul Cook has urged supporters to stay calm despite a poor start to the season.

Pompey are without a win in their opening three League Two matches.
Cook guided the club to a play-off place last season, and they have been tipped as favourites for an automatic promotion spot this term.
"It's important not to get too high and not to get too low," he said." If we'd won the first three games, I wouldn't be saying everything's great."
A 2-0 defeat by Morecambe on Tuesday saw Portsmouth fail to score for the second game in four days.
"Football's about goals," Cook told BBC Radio Solent. "We're not scoring first and we're conceding first.
"When we've got the calibre of players we have, we should be doing better. We know we need to improve, we're not stupid.
"As a manager, I've got to be strong and make sure that I will live and die by my results. That's the nature of being manager of this club.
"I've no problem with that. If I'm not successful, someone else will be having a go at it that's for sure."
