Euro 2016: Wales hope practice makes perfect penalties - Coleman

Wales have been practising penalties since arriving at Euro 2016, manager Chris Coleman says.

The Welsh have never been involved in a penalty shoot out, which could happen in Saturday's last 16 match in Paris.
Coleman admits it is impossible to replicate the anxiety of sudden death penalty shoot out.
''If it comes our way we will have to try and deal with it,'' said Coleman, who has a fully-fit squad after beating Russia 3-0 to top Group B.
Individual players have penalty experience, including top-scorer Gareth Bale who scored from the spot in Real Madrid's shoot-out win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final in May.
The current squad have been sharpening their spot kick skills in training, but Coleman recognises its limitations.
''I would say on three days out of five, the players naturally just gravitate after training to take penalties," he said.
''If it comes to that (on Saturday), again it is new territory for us.
''How do you recreate 50,000 people breathing down your neck;  or the eyes of the world upon you as you are stepping up to take the penalty and you need to put it in the back of the net. You cannot recreate that.''
Coleman reported no injury worries after clinching Group B top spot with Monday night's commanding win over Russia in Toulouse.
Eight Wales players started all three games in the opening stages of the competition and Coleman says he will not hesitate to alter the line up on Saturday, if required.
"'I would make changes if I think physically, they cannot do it," he added.
"But I would be surprised if any of them admit to me that they are a bit tired and may be they don't want to start.
"The guys who have not been on the grass or have not been starting are chomping at the bit. They are not very happy they have not been on the grass. That is a positive.
"But I can only pick 11 . . . I look at the opposition and I think if we can create a few problems with a different player in there, or in a different place I will do it.
"That does not mean the player who is being replaced in the last game has not done very well. It's just horses for courses."
