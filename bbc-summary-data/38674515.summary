Nick Blackwell: Trainer Liam Wilkins to appeal against losing licence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trainer Liam Wilkins will appeal against his licence being withdrawn for the sparring session in November that left retired fighter Nick Blackwell in a coma for the second time in a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Boxer Hasan Karkardi was banned for six months for taking part but will not appeal against his punishment.
Blackwell had retired after suffering a bleed on the skull in March and spending a week in an induced coma.
But he subsequently sparred with Karkadi and was again left in a coma.
The British Boxing Board of Control said Wilkins' conduct was "detrimental to the interests of boxing".
Wilkins and Karkadi were both set to appeal after releasing a joint statement on Thursday, before the latter changed his decision.
Blackwell was placed in an induced coma in March after losing his British middleweight title fight with Chris Eubank Jr.
Despite not having a licence to fight, and despite him being advised not to return to the ring, Blackwell sparred with Karkardi, 29, on 22 November at a boxing club in Devizes, Wiltshire.
It left Blackwell in a coma for the second time and requiring surgery to reduce swelling on his brain.
A family member has told BBC Sport that although Blackwell is out of the coma he is still unable to walk, and is a year away from making a full recovery.
