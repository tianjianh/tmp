[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Isles of Scilly plane 'to fill helicopter gap'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More aeroplane flights are to be made to the Isles of Scilly after helicopter services end in October, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm said it planned to buy another 19-seat aircraft to add to the six Skybus planes it runs to St Mary's.
A ferry would also travel from Penzance every day next summer, it added.
British International Helicopters is to stop its year-round service from Penzance on 31 October after running into financial problems.
The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company operates both the Skybus planes and Penzance ferry services.
The Scillonian ferry currently runs for only seven months a year and the Skybuses are weather dependent.
The company said it was planning to increase the size of its air passenger terminal at Land's End, and that a new control tower would make flights less weather dependent.
