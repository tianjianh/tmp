Oshaniwa desperate to break into Hearts first team

Nigeria international defender Juwon Oshaniwa says he is determined to fight for a place in the Hearts first team after falling out of favour at the Scottish Premiership side.

Oshaniwa, 26, signed a three-year contract when he arrived at Hearts in the summer of 2015, making 25 appearances in his first season.
But the left-back, who has 17 caps and played in all of the Super Eagles' matches at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has not featured for the club this season.
I can't give up. I know giving up is not an option so I'll keep up the fight
"Things change quickly in football and I can only keep on fighting to get my chance," Oshaniwa told BBC Sport.
"People have been asking me what's going on in Scotland, and the only explanation I can give is that - this is football.
"When I joined up with the Nigerian squad in England [last month] it's the same question but I believe with hard work I'll get another chance."
Oshaniwa and his compatriot, Celtic defender Efe Ambrose, won the 2013 African Cup of Nations with Nigeria in South Africa, but have both fallen off the international radar due to club inaction.
While Ambrose has dropped down a division to play on loan at Hibernian, Oshaniwa - who has a contract with Hearts until May 2018 - is still keen to prove himself at Tynecastle.
He added: "I can't give up. I know giving up is not an option so I'll keep up the fight.
"I still want to represent my country and its only regular football at my club that will earn me regular call-up."
