The body of Han Lam, also known as Hoang Trung, 17, of Vietnamese origin, was found at about 21:00 GMT near Heanor Memorial Park in Derbyshire.
Derbyshire Police said he had connections to Birmingham, but have so far not uncovered links with Heanor.
Det Sgt Adam Gascoigne said he wants to trace a dark grey Toyota Avensis which was seen in the area.
A post-mortem examination has not revealed the cause of death and further tests are due to be carried out.

Det Sgt Gascoigne said: "We know that the car was in the Heanor area between 11:00 GMT and midday on Christmas Day and I'm asking anyone who has CCTV or dashboard cameras to check their footage for that time.
"Mr Lam's death remains unexplained and we believe he may have died in a different place to where he was found."
Anyone who can help the investigation has been asked to contact the force.
