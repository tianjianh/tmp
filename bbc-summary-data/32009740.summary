More than half of kids don't eat a single portion of vegetables a day, according to Newsround's food survey.

The government recommends that everyone should have at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.
But the survey shows 52 in every 100 kids don't have any veg, and 44 in 100 have no fruit on a daily basis.
What we're eating is a big issue at the moment because one in three kids in the UK is obese or overweight.
That figure has trebled in the last 25 years.
The survey was of 1,432 boys and girls, aged 7 to 12, across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It also showed that lots of kids are trying to make positive changes to their diet.
It suggested that eight in 10 children have made changes like drinking more water and eating more fruit and vegetables in the last years.
All this week Newsround will be looking at what different types of food do to your body and how to eat a healthy diet.
We've also called in food expert Dr Radha Modgil to explain why certain things are good and bad for you.
Dr Radha says: "It's important for kids to have a balanced diet. No one is saying that you can't have sweets or chocolate every now and again but if you're having those things every day it is going to affect your body."
"The body needs all kinds of things when you're growing up and it's so important for kids not to overload on sugary, fatty snacks."
