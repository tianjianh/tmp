Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London:
"I thought it was very exciting. Obviously we're playing against one of the big spenders of the division, a club with massive tradition and history, a fantastic following home and away.
"And our team of free transfers, a humble, down-to-earth group of lads put in a proper team performance.
"I would say deserved (win), with fantastic spirit, determination, courage, and they've done our club proud tonight to beat a club like Portsmouth.
"I thought we were disciplined. Everyone stuck to their job within the team framework."
