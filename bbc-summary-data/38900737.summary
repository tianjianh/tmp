The 19-year-old former Chelsea trainee has also played in Toronto, Canada, earlier in his career as a student.
"Education is very important to Dapo and his family, which is the only reason why he's not already playing professionally," Solihull Moors boss Liam McDonald told the club website.
"We're excited as he'll add raw pace and he's technically very good."
