The 22-year-old was floored by a right hand from the Welshman at Birmingham's Barclaycard Arena.
Local favourite Eggington went back on the offensive and appeared close to stopping Evans in the 11th round.
Evans, 23, rocked him with a series of left hooks in the final round but Eggington won a unanimous decision.
The three three judges scored an enthralling contest 117-110, 117-110 and 116-110.
Evans stepped in 10 days ago when Eggington's original opponent, Frankie Gavin, pulled out after his foot was run over by a car.
Eggington, who lost on points to Evans in January 2013, gained revenge but the Welshman provided a stern test.
The champion's victory took his professional record to 17 wins and two defeats while Evans is now 10-3.
Three-time world title challenger Matthew Macklin edged a bruising contest against Jason Welborn to win the WBC international super-welterweight title.
The 33-year-old was given a unanimous 10-round points decision as he stepped down to fight at the division for the first time in nine years.
The victory took Macklin's record to 34 wins and six defeats.
Two judges scored it 96-94, with the other having it as 97-93.
Welborn was deducted a point for low blows in the fifth round, with Macklin twice forced to take breaks to recover from the illegal shots.
Macklin, who has unsuccessfully fought for the world middleweight crown against Felix Sturm, Sergio Martinez and Gennady Golovkin, had said he would retire if he lost to the 29-year-old.
He produced the better work throughout, but was frequently caught by fellow Birmingham boxer Welborn, who now has four losses in 21 fights.
"At times I let him get too much momentum - with my experience I shouldn't have allowed that as much as I did," Macklin told Sky Sports.
"I'm in the middle of adaptation and nowhere near where I should be but I am working on it."
Birmingham fighter Kal Yafai totally dominated Jason Cunningham to maintain his unbeaten record and win the British super-flyweight title.
Two judges gave him every round, while the other believed Doncaster-born Cunningham won one round.
Yafai, 26, was on top from the start and rocked the southpaw with two left hooks and a straight right in the fifth round.
Early in the sixth Cunningham went down after a left hand to the back of his head and was given a count, although he argued it should not have counted as a knockdown.
Former Commonwealth champion Yafai cruised to victory to extend his record to 17-0 as Cunningham (17-3) bravely kept going for the 12 rounds.
