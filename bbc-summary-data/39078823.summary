The chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) is to meet community leaders to discuss ambulance provision in the west Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pauline Howie is to travel to Lochinver in Sutherland for the meeting later on Monday.
Local residents and Assynt Community Council have concerns about patient transport to hospital in Inverness.
They have said reaching the hospital by ambulance or public transport have become more difficult.
Labour MSP Rhoda Grant has been involved in arranging the meeting in Lochinver.
Patient transfers and emergency cover are to be discussed.
In March, SNP MSP Gail Ross is to meet Ms Howie to discuss ambulance cover in Caithness and Sutherland, including the role SAS plays in a new maternity unit set up at Caithness General in Wick.
The ambulance service said Ms Howie was looking forward to the discussions.
The meetings also follow concerns about a shortage of emergency cover in parts of the Highlands.
SAS said it worked closely with partners and communities to ensure it delivered a safe and effective service.
