Ryder Cup 2016: Davis Love III wants USA team to help with wildcard choices

United States captain Davis Love III will ask his team for advice about picking four wildcards for the 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, in Minnesota.

Love aims to avoid an unprecedented fourth straight American defeat when play begins on 27 September.
He will pick three wildcards to add to his eight automatic qualifiers on 12 September, with a fourth selection five days before the competition starts.
"It's time for these eight to take ownership of this team," Love said.
"If they go in there believing in what we are telling them, that they have the best team, and that they are ready to go, then they are going to play well."
Patrick Reed's victory in The Barclays on Sunday secured his automatic place on the team alongside Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker and Zach Johnson.
Two-time Masters winner Bubba Watson is one of the wildcard contenders, along with 2015 Scottish Open champion Rickie Fowler.
Love was the American captain when Europe achieved their biggest final-day comeback to secure a 14½-13½ win at Medinah in 2012.
The American team struggled after defeat in 2014, with Phil Mickelson criticising the captaincy of Tom Watson, who later accused him of "sour grapes".
"Golf is different than other sports. [The] mental side of it is huge," Love added.
European captain Darren Clarke will confirm his three captain's wildcard picks on Tuesday, with Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell vying for places.
