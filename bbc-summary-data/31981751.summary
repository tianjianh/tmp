A video has emerged of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson saying he expects to be "sacked" by the BBC.

The host was speaking at a charity event in London, where he was auctioning what he described as his "last lap" on the Top Gear race track.
"I don't know when I did my last ever lap of the track, before the BBC sacks me," he said.
An investigation into Clarkson's current suspension following a "fracas" with a producer is still ongoing.
A report over the incident is due to be handed to director general Tony Hall next week, who will consider the evidence and "set out any further steps".
The Roundhouse Gala on Thursday saw Clarkson offer to drive someone round the Top Gear track as part of an experience offered during the auction.
"I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap," he said.
"I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the [BBC] sack me.
"And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of when I'm sacked, so it's probably an Austin Maestro."
The presenter gave an expletive-filled description of BBC bosses, adding Top Gear had been "a great show" but it had been ruined by the corporation.
The BBC said it would "not be offering further commentary" on any issues involving Clarkson until the current investigation was concluded.
The presenter was suspended from Top Gear on 10 March, following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon.
All remaining shows in the current series of Top Gear were pulled following the incident.
An online petition calling for the star's reinstatement - set up by political blogger Guido Fawkes - has accrued almost one million signatures since the presenter's suspension.
It was delivered to New Broadcasting House on Friday.
The petition was delivered by a man dressed as Top Gear test driver "The Stig" who arrived at the BBC's London HQ in an armoured vehicle bearing the words "Bring Back Clarkson".
Clarkson publicly thanked his supporters on Twitter following the petition's delivery.
He said: "Many many thanks to all of the people who have called for my reinstatement. I'm very touched. We shall all learn next week what will happen."
