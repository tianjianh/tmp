Munir opened the scoring after Lionel Messi's pass before the latter set up Luis Suarez to stab home from inside the area in Stockholm's Friends Arena.
Munir added a third before substitute Musa's solo goal reduced the deficit.
Musa rifled home a second for Leicester but 17-year-old substitute Rafa Mujica scored a late fourth for Barcelona.
"Last season Leicester was one of the great surprises in European football, and is what makes everyone love the game," said Barcelona boss Luis Enrique afterwards.
Striker Jamie Vardy, who signed an extended four-year contract in June, and Riyad Mahrez, who has been linked with Arsenal, both started for Leicester, who face  Manchester United in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.
As well as Messi and former Liverpool striker Suarez, Barcelona started with Javier Mascherano and Sergio Busquets.
Despite the result, Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri will have been impressed with the way Nigeria international Musa, who joined from CSKA Moscow in July, took his goals after coming on as a substitute at the start of the second half.
Leicester start their Premier League title defence at Hull City on 13 August.
