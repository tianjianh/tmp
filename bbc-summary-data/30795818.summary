According to the Manx constabulary, 11 break-ins and attempted break-ins were reported last weekend, the majority around the Douglas area.
Det Insp David Dobbie said: "This is alarming and unprecedented - officers are working longer shifts and extra patrols are being deployed."
Police said homeowners should remain vigilant and secure their properties.
There have been 22 domestic burglaries on unsecured properties since September.
