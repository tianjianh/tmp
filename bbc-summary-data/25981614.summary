Alan Trethewey, 67, of Watford, died falling from the Bucknalls Lane bridge, near Watford, on Thursday.
After stopping to help him, Spencer Bell, 71, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was struck by a passing vehicle.
In a statement, Mr Bell's family paid tribute to "the most loving, funny and generous person".
It added: "Everyone who knew him loved his quick wit and kindness.
"We cannot imagine life without him. He always had a smile on his face and loved life.
"Knowing he died in such a selfless way is no comfort. But we would not have expected anything else of him."
The statement added Mr Bell was "loved dearly" by his wife Wendy, his three children, sons-in-laws, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Mr Trethewey fell from the bridge at about 10:45 GMT on Thursday.
His family said in a statement he was a "much loved husband of 40 years, dad to two and granddad to three grandchildren, who all adored him."
It added: "He was a caring family man who lovingly gave support, time and a warm stable home to his wife, son and daughter.
"He had been ill for a period of time and sadly died following a bout of depression. We will miss him."
Mr Bell was one of several motorists who stopped to help Mr Trethewey.
Both men died at the scene and the road was closed for six hours.
