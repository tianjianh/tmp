[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a hit in Lagos - and now it has come to London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wakaa The Musical follows the fate of a group of young graduates as they begin to find their way in the world.
The show aims to give audiences a taste of modern day Nigeria. It is the first Nigerian-produced musical to be performed at a London theatre.
I went to meet those behind the show as it opened in the West End.
