Aisling Brady McCarthy: Irish nanny arrives back in Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irishwoman Aisling Brady McCarthy, who spent over two years in jail in the US before a murder charge against her was dropped, has returned to Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former nanny had been accused of killing one-year-old Rehma Sabir while the child was in her care in 2013.
The prosecution was dropped after a Massachusetts state medical examiner reversed a finding that the death was murder caused by shaken baby syndrome.
Ms Brady McCarthy's deportation was fast-tracked by the US authorities.
The 37-year-old is originally from County Cavan but had been living illegally in the US for 13 years.
Hours after the prosecution was halted, she flew from Boston to Shannon Airport in County Clare and arrived shortly after 06:00 local time on Wednesday.
Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ reported that she travelled on the flight with her sister and that the pair were accompanied through the arrivals hall by Shannon Airport police.
Ms Brady McCarthy declined to make any comment to waiting media.
