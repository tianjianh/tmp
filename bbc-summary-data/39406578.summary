Fleetwood Town manager Uwe Rosler is confident his side will be a "different proposition" with returning players.

The promotion hopefuls, who are without captain Nathan Pond and strikers Devante Cole and Wes Burns, have drawn their last two League One matches 0-0.
Town, in third place, have slipped six points off the automatic promotion spots but Rosler thinks they will improve when his players recover.
"What makes me optimistic is the players coming back," he said.
Pond has not played since mid-January but was on the bench for Saturday's draw with Bury and will be available for Swindon's visit to Highbury on Saturday.
Burns, who joined the club from Bristol City in January, is back in training after damaging his ankle ligaments, while Cole should return from a groin injury before the end of the campaign.
Fleetwood have 69 points with seven games remaining and Rosler has given his players a target of 74 points to secure a top-six finish.
He is sure the bolstering of his squad from the physio room will help for the likely eventuality of the play-offs, telling BBC Radio Lancashire: "When your players have been out for two or three months and they're coming in at the final stages of the season, they have a lot of energy.
"They may not be 100% in terms of match sharpness, but what they do have is a willingness to show themselves. I think that can play in our favour.
"We will get our players back and then we will be a different proposition."
