[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport street monkey found in 'appalling state'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A marmoset monkey had to be put down after it was found in an "appalling condition" on a street in Newport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A member of the public came across it on James Street on Sunday and reported it to the RSPCA.
A vet found the monkey to be very thin with a fractured pelvis and wounds on its tail.
The RSPCA has already called on the Welsh Government for a ban on keeping primates as pets.
Annie James, an animal collection officer with the charity, said: "It broke my heart to see him in such a sad state."
No licence is required to keep a marmoset, but the RSPCA said the animals' complex needs were almost impossible to meet in a domestic environment.
In 2015, the charity received more calls about primates being traded or kept as pets in Wales than in any of the previous 11 years.
