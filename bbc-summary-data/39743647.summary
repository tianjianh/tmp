Pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year jumped to £1.682bn, from £793m a year earlier.
But analysts were disappointed by the performance of Barclays' investment bank, and the shares fell 5%.
The FTSE 100 index closed almost 0.5% lower at 7,203.
Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland rose 4.7%, after it reported its first quarterly profit since third quarter of 2015.
RBS posted profits of £259m in the first three months of 2017, compared with a £968m loss a year earlier.
Rising copper prices boosted shares in mining companies, with Antofagasta closing 2.4% higher and BHP Billiton adding 1.9%.
In the FTSE 250, shares in transport group Stagecoach fell 2.7% after HSBC cut its rating on the company to "reduce" from "hold".
On the currency markets, the pound shrugged off weaker-than-forecast UK growth data. The UK grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, according to an initial estimate, a sharper-than-expected slowdown from the 0.7% rate seen at the end of 2016.
The pound rallied against the US dollar, trading 0.3% higher in late London trading at $1.2945.
Sterling was flat against the euro at 1.1876 euros.
The euro was helped by the latest set of eurozone inflation figures, which indicated that inflation in the 19-nation bloc rose to 1.9% in April.
