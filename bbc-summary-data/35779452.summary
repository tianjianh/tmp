The Bees have lost five of their last six league games and are currently eight points above the bottom three.
"We are in a position now where we are getting drawn into a relegation fight," the left-back told BBC Radio London.
"There is no point dressing it up. If we don't start performing quickly we are going to be in trouble."
The Griffin Park side have won just five of their 17 Championship matches since Dean Smith was appointed head coach at the end of November, and Bidwell says the Bees have "massively underachieved" recent weeks.
"We have lost to two teams in the bottom three," the 22-year-old added.
"We have shown this season that once we perform [to the levels] we are capable of then we are a match for anyone.
"We have got to go out there knowing and believing how good we are.
"There are 11 games left now. It has been an up-and-down season but we want to finish it on a high."
