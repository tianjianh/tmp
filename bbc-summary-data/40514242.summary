Burnley have signed Charlie Taylor from Leeds, after agreeing a deal with Stoke City for Jon Walters.

Taylor, 23, joins the Clarets on a four-year contract.
The full-back turned down an offer to stay at Leeds, where he was out of contract, but Burnley will still have to pay a fee as he is under 24.
Republic of Ireland forward Walters, 33, is also heading for Turf Moor after Burnley agreed a fee with Stoke that could reach £3m.
Taylor, who made 104 appearances for Leeds, said: "I've been there since I was nine and I knew it was the right time. There were so many things that attracted me to Burnley; it ticks every box and it was a no-brainer really.
"That's the huge attraction of the Premier League, just everything about it. Week in, week out, you are playing teams like Chelsea and Manchester United, so I just can't wait to get started."
Burnley have so far been unable to agree a fee with Leeds for Taylor, and the matter is likely to be settled by a tribunal.
Walters has spent seven years at Stoke, scoring 43 goals in 226 Premier League appearances, and is thought to be keen to link up with Burnley manager Sean Dyche.
Clarets striker Andre Gray, who has reportedly rejected a new contract, has been linked with a £15m move to fellow Premier League side West Ham.
