[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry suffered a second-half collapse to pile more pressure on manager Tony Mowbray as they were beaten 2-0 by high-flying Fleetwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In spite of their poor start Coventry bossed much of the opening spell, but Mowbray's men struggled to turn pressure and possession into meaningful chances.
Devante Cole might have opened the scoring within 10 minutes, David Ball picking out his run and the former Manchester City youngster firing straight at Reice Charles-Cook.
The hosts went close again after the 15-minute mark when Ball looked to benefit from a collision between keeper and defender, his lob looking goalbound until on-loan Newcastle defender Jamie Sterry intervened by clearing off the line.
It took Coventry until the last five minutes of the half to carve out a real opening, Vladimir Gadzhev's free kick almost beating Chris Neal and substitute Marcus Tudgay unable to turn home at the back post.
The Sky Blues continued to press from the restart but were caught on the break for Fleetwood's opener.
Kyle Dempsey, on loan from Huddersfield, launched a delightful diagonal pass to pick out the run of Chris Long, the on-loan Burnley striker showing a cool head and clever feet in the box before slotting low under Charles-Cook.
The hosts did not take long to double their lead, Ball mopping up a loose pass 25 yards out and releasing sub Martyn Woolford, who took a touch before blasting low inside the near post to seal the win.
