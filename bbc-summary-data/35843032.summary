The 20-year-old played under Latics manager John Sheridan during a loan spell at Plymouth last season, having previously had a stint at Oxford.
He has made 11 appearances for the Addicks this term and is available for Saturday's derby against Rochdale.
"I really like him as a player and he did really well for me at Plymouth," Sheridan told the club website.
"He is a young, very energetic and I just felt we needed a bit of strengthening down the left side."
