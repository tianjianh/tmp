[SN]TITLE[SN]
Church votes to allow gay ministers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has voted to allow congregations to ordain gay ministers who are in same sex civil partnerships.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delegates voted 309 in favour and 183 against.
The vote followed a church-wide debate and consultations with all 45 presbyteries, which voted 31 to 14 in favour of change.
A further vote will be held this week on whether or not to extend ordination to ministers in same sex marriages.
Supporters said it was time for the church to be inclusive and recognise the "mixed economy" of modern Scotland.
Opponent warned that the move was contrary to God's law, would prove divisive and lead to resignations.
