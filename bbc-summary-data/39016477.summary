Wits, who are challenging for the Premier League title in South Africa, scored first after 27 minutes from a Daine Klate free-kick to level the aggregate score.
Sifiso Myeni then made it 2-0 on the day, 3-2 overall with a second goal for Wits a minute after half-time, although a goal from Saint-Louisienne's Philean 12 minutes from time gave the visitors hopes of pulling off a shock victory.
Cuthbert Malajila proved to be Wits' hero, scoring a decisive goal with four minutes remaining to seal a victory for the hosts, and earn them a tie against Egypt's Al Ahly in the round of 32.
In the pick of the other second leg results on Saturday, Tanzania's Young Africans also progressed, despite being held to a 1-1 draw by Ngaya Club of Comoros. The Tanzanians had done enough in the first leg to go through 6-2 on aggregate.
Zanaco of Zambia were 1-0 winners at APR of Rwanda to secure their place in the next round after their home leg had ended 0-0.
