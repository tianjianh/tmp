Gizmo was found by her owner covered in blood after the attack in Treharris, Merthyr Tydfil, on Monday.
An x-ray showed she had a pellet in her skull and she underwent a procedure to remove it.
Gizmo is now home recovering and the RSCPA and South Wales Police appealed for information.
Owner Helen Turburville said she was left "shocked and angry", and had initially thought her pet had been hit by a car.
