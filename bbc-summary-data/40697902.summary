T53 wheelchair racer Kinghorn, 21, added the 100m title to her 200m gold and 400m bronze.
The Scot can claim a fourth medal in the 800m later on Sunday.
There were also British silver medals for Polly Maton in the T47 long jump, Jordan Howe in the T35 100m and Mickey Bushell in the T53 100m.
The hosts have now collected 39 medals, eight more than their total in Doha two years ago.
Kinghorn, who is paralysed from the waist down after an accident at her home in 2010, has announced herself in London as the top T53 sprinter in the world and clinched 100m gold in a time of 16.65 seconds ahead of Australia's Angela Ballard.
After missing out on medals at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, she is now a two-time world champion and will be among the favourites for the 800m at 18:51 BST.
"I literally had no idea where I finished. I was staring straight across the line. I heard the roar so I thought I must have medalled but had no idea where. I can't believe it," she told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I felt like halfway down I panicked a bit and I have some scrapes on my arm from slipping slightly.
"You don't know where you'll come in the 800m because it's tactical, so I'll get myself in a good position and hope for a sprint finish."
