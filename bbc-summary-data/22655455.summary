Lydon will leave his role as head of rugby at the Welsh Rugby Union to take up his new post.
The WRU has already started the search to find his successor.
"I am sad to be leaving Wales, but the challenge of playing such a pivotal role in the development of English rugby at this time is one I had to take up," said Lydon.
"Welsh rugby is in great shape and I leave behind a team of people more than capable of achieving the goals we have set.
"The experience I have gained across the past five years with the WRU will set me in great stead for the exciting new challenge ahead."
Lydon arrived in Wales with a rugby CV that included 32 Great Britain rugby league caps, experience as technical director of the Rugby Football League and as a rugby union coach with the England Sevens and the senior England team.
He was appointed by the WRU in November 2008 to be responsible for the development programmes across all tiers of Welsh rugby for players, coaches and match officials.
Lydon's new role in English rugby will see him report to England head coach Stuart Lancaster in the new international performance department at Twickenham.
"This is a significant appointment for the future of England Rugby, made following a rigorous selection process," said Lancaster.
"Joe has a huge amount of experience as a player, coach and head of a successful performance and development structure in Wales and I am looking forward to working with him.
"He will be responsible for developing and managing a world class system of international player development for all our teams.
"We would like to build on the current system of talent identification, development and selection process that ensures that we have continual supply of high quality international players for England."
Lydon's remit will include Saxons, U20s, U18s, Sevens, and the Women's senior, Sevens and U20 teams.
