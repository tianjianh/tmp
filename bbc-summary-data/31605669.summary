Animal experts say the creatures, who look like giant seals and are known as sea cows, went into the pipe seeking warmth before getting trapped.
The rescue operation took the whole of Monday night.
All mammals, including a mother and her baby calf were eventually pulled from the pipe and are safe and well.
