Manning, who led the Broncos to a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers, had hinted at retirement but the 39-year-old is yet to decide his future.
Boiman said Manning is "one of the best players ever to play the game" but felt his "skills have slipped a little bit".
"To come back next year aged 40 would be a lot to ask," he added.
"I want him to go out on top with his second Super Bowl win."
Former linebacker Boiman played alongside Manning as they helped the Indianapolis Colts defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.
Manning is the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards as well as touchdown passes.
It was rumoured Super Bowl 50 would be his last NFL game, but he said afterwards he would "take time to reflect".
"It's been an emotional week and it's an emotional night," he added.
