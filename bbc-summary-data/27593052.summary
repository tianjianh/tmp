The Glasgow-based company said sales leapt by Â£14m (29%) in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year.
Between January and March, bookings for long-haul destinations grew by 40% while cruise bookings also rose sharply.
Barrhead said travellers had been keen to put the winter behind them.
Chief executive Sharon Munro said: "Scottish holidaymakers have been flocking in their droves to book a summer getaway following the poor weather over the winter months.
"January to March is always a busy time for us, however, this year we've enjoyed an exceptional response from travellers looking to jet off to foreign shores.
"Our Barrhead Travel BA charter flights have been a huge success since we launched them four years ago and as a result we've expanded the routes every year since.
"Through the direct flights we've been able to offer new links to popular cruise departure points like Majorca and Venice - which we doubled this year."
She added: "Long-haul bookings are also always popular and this year, with increased capacity through our suppliers, we've been able to offer new routes through Glasgow and Edinburgh - giving travellers more options than ever."
