The two men, both from Sheffield, were charged under Section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, following the protest against plans to cut down the tree in Marden Road, Nether Edge.
The tree was cut down as part of a Â£2bn scheme to improve streets and get rid of diseased, damaging or dangerous trees.
As a result of the ongoing campaign to protect many of the city's trees, the council set up an independent panel to advise on proposed tree works which attract a certain level of opposition.
