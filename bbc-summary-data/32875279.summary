The black and tan male collie cross was picked up at the summit of Scafell Pike in the Lake District on 16 May by a couple of Scottish holidaymakers.
Staff at the Scottish SPCA in Glasgow nicknamed the dog Scafell and launched an appeal to locate the owner.
A Cumbrian sheep farmer has now come forward to claim the dog, who is actually named Sid.
Katrina Cavanagh of the Scottish SPCA, said: "The couple who found Sid told us he was petrified and they brought him home because they couldn't get help locally.
"Unfortunately, Sid wasn't microchipped so we couldn't contact his owner directly. Thankfully, he came forward following our appeal and arranged for Sid to be collected as he wasn't able to travel to Glasgow.
"The owner is a local sheep farmer and Sid is one of his working dogs. He believes Sid took off after a bitch in season and had been looking for him.
"While he was surprised when he found out Sid was in Scotland, he was also very relieved he was safe.
"He's a lovely dog and we wouldn't have had any trouble finding him a home if we'd needed to as we had lots of offers.
"This is another example of why it's important for pets to be microchipped."
At 978m (3,209ft), Scafell Pike is the highest peak in England.
