Merseyside Police received reports that a person had been seen with a firearm in Beech Rise, Kirkby, in the early hours of Saturday.
A boy, aged 17, was also released over the firearm inquiry but was charged with burglary and kept in custody.
Police said a 38-year-old man from Litherland was released after he was held on suspicion of drug offences.
The arrests were part of a police operation targeted at organised crime groups after about 80 shootings in Merseyside since April - 39 of which have led to people being injured.
Five men have also died following various gun attacks, including 18-year-old Yusuf Sonko in Toxteth on 2 June.
