[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League Two: East Fife 1-1 East Stirlingshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish League Two champions East Fife were held to a surprise draw at home by bottom side East Stirlingshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A shock looked to be on the cards when Michael McMullin fired in an excellent free-kick after 51 minutes.
Kevin Smith capitalised on some sloppy defending to restore parity two minutes later for the side who already had the title sewn up.
The home side's late pressure did not yield a winner and Shire can take confidence ahead of their play-off.
They will need to defeat Edinburgh City over two legs to retain their place in the Scottish Professional Football League after the Lowland League champions defeated Highland League winners Cove Rangers 4-1 on aggregate.
