West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS) was inundated with more than 1,000 flood-related calls when the deluge started shortly after 18:00 BST on Thursday.
It said 1,000 homes in Birmingham either flooded or were at risk of flooding.
Worst affected areas were Selly Park, Harborne and Woodgate Valley.
The radiotherapy section of the former Queen Elizabeth Hospital also had to be cleared of 5,000 litres of water.
Latest Birmingham and Black Country flooding updates
It is the latest bout of flash flooding to hit the region in the last few days, with Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital declaring a major incident when its accident and emergency department was hit.
In the latest deluge, firefighters evacuated a children's home and helped eight youngsters into alternative accommodation.
Residents in Sir John's Road, Selly Park, had to move upstairs when 100 homes were flooded. The nearby Selly Park Tavern was also forced to close when water poured into its cellar.
Train services were cancelled and delayed through Lye in Stourbridge because of significant flooding on the track. Bournville railway station was also badly affected.
Network Rail said the lines had now been cleared, although passengers have been warned to expect some delays on services.
Fire crews warned drivers to stay away from roads around the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Dudley after roads became impassable.
A number of Birmingham schools are closed today, including Moor Green Primary School in Moseley, Oaks Primary School in Druids Heath and St Mary's Primary School in Selly Oak.
The Environment Agency has 10 flood warnings in place. More rain is expected later today but forecasters say it should then begin to clear.
WMFS area commander Ben Brook said: "Although we believe that the worst of the weather has now passed, we are still asking people to be vigilant and to beware of the likelihood of intense rain with little notice.
"There is also likely to be a lot of standing water on roads, and we would remind people not to enter floor water either in vehicles or on foot. There will also be debris and waste on some roads, so drivers should be alert."
