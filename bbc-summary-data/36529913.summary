Brian McKandie was found beaten to death with a "heavy weapon" in his home in Rothienorman on 12 March.
Police believe he may have known his killer. Two men were seen speaking to him the day before, and a burgundy or maroon car was also seen at the time.
Crimestoppers has offered the reward of up to £10,000 for information that leads to conviction in the case.
The murder was featured on BBC One's Crimewatch Roadshow  on Wednesday morning.
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith, of Police Scotland,  told the programme it was a "brutal" and "senseless" crime.
Angela Parker, the Crimestoppers national manager for Scotland, said: "Brian was a quiet and gentle man who was well-known in the local community.
"His family is understandably devastated and keen to find out what happened to Brian and for those responsible for his death to face justice.
"We are offering a substantial reward and are urging anyone with information to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.
"We don't ask for any personal details, you won't have to speak to the police, and you won't have to go to court. Just tell us what you know, not who you are."
The charity stressed the reward would only be paid if information was passed to Crimestoppers directly.
One of the men police want to trace is described as possibly 30 to 50 years old and of heavy build. The other was possibly 20 to 30 years old, and of a much thinner build.
The estate-type car may have had a rear passenger side panel of a different shade.
