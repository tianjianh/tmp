[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Referee Viktor Kassai stopped the game after being alerted to an incident by his assistant, then gave a penalty after viewing footage on a monitor.
Shoma Doi scored the spot-kick, which was awarded for an off-the-ball trip.
Kashima beat Atletico Nacional and are the first Asian team to make the final.
Yasushi Endo backheeled in the second, while Yuma Suzuki added a late third for the Antlers who will play Real Madrid or Club America in Sunday's final.
The Club World Cup features champion club sides from each of Fifa's six continental confederations.
South America's Atletico are from Colombia, where two weeks of mourning was observed before the tournament following an air crash that killed 71 people, including 19 players and staff of Brazilian team Chapecoense.
Chapecoense had been travelling to face Atletico in the final of the Copa Sudamericana.
Many Atletico fans in the Osaka crowd were waving and displaying banners paying tribute to the Brazilian club.
Video assistant referees have been able to assist officials during two international friendlies this year but the Club World Cup represents their first use in Fifa competition.
Previous usage has been in what Fifa call a "semi-live" scenario, where the referee was not able to review decisions on a pitch-side monitor.
Referee Viktor Kassai halted the game after listening to the video assistant referee.
Hungarian official Kassai went to the side of the pitch as he was given further instructions from the video assistant.
The Atletico Nacional players remonstrated after Kassai, who officiated the 2011 Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona, awarded the penalty.
