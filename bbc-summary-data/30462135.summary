Newtownabbey man accused of assaulting woman after break-in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of  sexually assaulting a woman after breaking into her Newtownabbey home has been refused bail at Belfast Magistrates Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In court was Stephen Brady, 46, from Uppertown Drive in Newtownabbey.
He is accused of  one count of attempted rape, two counts of sexual assault and a further charge of burglary.
Mr Brady spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.
The offences are alleged to have taken place on 5 December.
A detective told the court the woman, who is her 40s, fell asleep on the sofa in the living room of her home but was awoken at 04:30 GMT when a man grabbed her around the neck from behind, threatening that he had a knife and would kill her if she did not do as he ordered.
She said the woman struggled and tried to escape to the front door but was trailed back by the hair, held on the stairs and then ordered to go upstairs.
Mr Brady allegedly tried to rape his victim "on numerous occasions", before subjecting her instead to what the officer said was a "sustained sexual assault".
Throughout the the alleged attack, the court was told Mr Brady told the woman he had a knife "and that he would kill her".
The detective said the attacker eventually left saying that she was "lucky" and that it "could have been worse" but warned her that he would be "watching her and if she went to the police he would kill her".
However, the alleged victim went to police the following morning and underwent a full forensic medical examination with a DNA profile allegedly matching that of Mr Brady being uncovered on swabs taken from her.
He was arrested and interviewed on Thursday of this week and during police questioning, the officer told the court he "provided a very scant account" claiming that he was walking home when he saw the woman at her front door and that any sexual contact was by consent.
The detective said police were strongly objecting to Mr Brady being given bail and revealed that as a result of a previous conviction for indecent assault, the accused is on the police sex offenders register for an indefinite period and is subject to sex offender management.
The detective revealed that such is the level of the woman's fear she has not returned to her home since the alleged attack.
Mr Brady's solicitor said she was instructed that her client "would abide by any bail condition" set by the court.
Refusing the bail application, a judge remanded Mr Brady into custody until 9 January.
