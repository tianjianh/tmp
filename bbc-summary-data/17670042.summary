Montenegro profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five national daily newspapers, a public broadcaster and four national privately-owned TVs operate in a crowded media market. Many commercial outlets struggle to turn a profit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Montenegro is sometimes described as a media colony - outlets from neighbouring Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia operate in the country.
The last state-owned media outlet - Pobjeda daily newspaper - was privatised in November 2014.
Public service RTCG (Radio-TV Montenegro) has three TV channels and two radio networks.
A key threat to media freedom is self-censorship. There have been attacks on journalists and media houses.
The 2015 Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index ranked Montenegro in 114th place out of 180 countries.
Internet penetration has grown steeply and stands at around 64 per cent. Facebook is the most popular social network.
