Seven-year-old Katie Rough was found fatally injured in Woodthorpe in January. A 15-year-old girl is due to stand trial for her murder in July.
Alison Rough said: "I cannot put into words how much we miss her, how absolutely devastated we are that she has gone".
She was speaking as a memorial bench was unveiled in the city.
"It is just not fair, so unfair. We just miss her every second of every day and night," she said.

Mrs Rough said the family were trying to do positive things, including charity fundraising.
"We need something to focus on, if we didn't have something we wouldn't cope at all I don't think."
Katie's father, Paul, and other family members plan to take part in the Great North Run in September in aid of the charity Compassion.
"The money will go to a girl in Uganda to get her into education," Mrs Rough said.
"I know it is something Katie would have been really proud of. The girl is a similar age to Katie - just at the beginning of her life."
Mrs Rough said the charity was a thank you to the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who was born in Uganda.
"He still is and always has been a huge help to us. He is such a good man."
Two other charities, Get Kids Going and Children North East, will also benefit.
Katie's family unveiled the memorial bench in the city's Museum Gardens.
"It is in a beautiful spot in the edible gardens, it is really quiet, tranquil and peaceful. She absolutely loved it there.
"Its a place she felt very comfortable," Mrs Rough said.
