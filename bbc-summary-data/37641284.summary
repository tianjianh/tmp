[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A window cleaner with alleged links to paramilitaries who is accused of murdering a man in Coleraine acted in self defence, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Dalzell, 35, of Whinpark Road, Newtownards, was charged at Ballymena Magistrates Court.
He is accused of murdering 54-year-old Mark Lamont, who died after being attacked last month.
Mr Lamont was critically injured outside a house on the Ballycastle Road. He died in hospital on Tuesday.
There was a large police presence as the accused was brought to court.
A police officer told the court that Mr Dalzell has links to paramilitary organisations in Newtownards and has been involved in loan sharking, supplying controlled drugs and money laundering.
The judge, who described Mr Lamont's death as "tragic and difficult", denied the accused bail because of potential interference in the case.
A defence lawyer said Mr Dalzell did not deny that he had fought with Mr Lamont but that it was a case of self defence.
The court heard Mr Dalzell had been drinking in the Forge Bar in Coleraine with a woman on 26 September, when he had an altercation with three men.
He reportedly took his shirt off in the bar, was doing press ups and throwing fake punches.
Mr Dalzell then left the bar and went to the woman's house on Ballycastle Road.
En route, he was described as agitated and punched a shop shutter.
Later, three men, one of whom was Mr Lamont, entered the property with their faces hidden by hoodies.
The court heard that there was a minor altercation and the three men left.
Mr Lamont then returned to the property and there was a fight between him and Mr Dalzell.
A police officer told the court that Mr Dalzell "jumped up and down on Mr Lamont's head".
The victim suffered face and skull fractures.
Mr Dalzell left the scene in his car but later handed himself into police. The court heard that the accused told police "it was a fight, I won".
The defendant was initially charged with attempted murder and released on police bail, but was rearrested and charged with murder after Mr Lamont died.
The two other men who entered house have been charged with aggravated burglary.
The court was also told that a pair of shoes worn by Mr Dalzell on the night of the fight are also missing and need to be recovered.
Mr Dalzell's case will be heard again in Coleraine on 31 October.
