Ulster: McCall suffers 'significant' hamstring injury with Browne also ruled out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster have suffered two blows with prop Kyle McCall said to have sustained a "significant" hamstring injury while Peter Browne will miss Friday's game against Connacht because of concussion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both injuries were sustained in Sunday's European Champions Cup defeat by Clermont Auvergne.
Emerging prop McCall will see a surgeon in London this week to explore possible surgical options.
On the plus side, wing Andrew Trimble will be available for Friday's game.
Trimble has been out of action for three weeks after being forced off at half-time in Ireland's win over Australia because of a foot injury.
The absence of McCall and lock Browne adds to an already lengthy Ulster injury list.
Browne's absence further reduces Ulster's second-row options with Robbie Diack and Alan O'Connor also currently out and Dan Tuohy no longer available following his move to Bristol.
Director of rugby Les Kiss does have the option of moving Iain Henderson from the back row to the lock position that he usually plays for Ireland.
The list of injured players also currently unavailable includes Jared Payne, Stuart Olding, Craig Gilroy, Ricky Lutton, Ross Kane, Peter Nelson and summer signing Marcell Coetzee.
