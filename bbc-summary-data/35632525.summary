The 16-year-old beat Anne Keothavong's record as the youngest British player to play in the Fed Cup in February.
Swan won her first two titles on the second-tier ITF tour in 2015, and made her WTA debut at Birmingham in June.
"There's a few big grass tournaments before Wimbledon so I'm hoping I get to play in some of them, whether it's qualifying or main draw," she said.
"There's a chance I might get a Wimbledon main draw wildcard, but I'm not sure about that yet.
"Definitely I'll keep working towards that and it'll be amazing if I can make my Grand Slam debut this year."
Swan also said she hopes to improve her results in Junior Grand Slam tournaments in 2016.
The Bristol-born player is ranked number 12 in the world at junior level, and reached the final of the Australian Open junior tournament in 2015.
"My goal this year in juniors is to try to do really well in the Grand Slams. I'd like to aim to win a Grand Slam, which would obviously be amazing for me," she continued.
"On the women's tour, I just want to keep working on my ranking and try to do the best I can in all those tournaments, and maybe be able to get into qualifying for the Australian Open next year."
