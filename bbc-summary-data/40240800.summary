World number ones South Africa, who are eliminated, suffered three run-outs in a collapse of eight wickets for 51 runs to be bowled out for 191.
Shikhar Dhawan made 78 and Virat Kohli 76 not out as India raced to their target with 12 overs to spare.
India join England and Bangladesh in the last four, with Sri Lanka meeting Pakistan on Monday for the final spot.
It would take a dramatic swing in net run-rate for India to be toppled as Group B leaders, so they are likely to play Bangladesh at Edgbaston on Thursday. England are already guaranteed to play in the first semi in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Though South Africa go out, they remain in England for three Twenty20 internationals, followed by a four-Test series.

Despite having four batsmen inside the top 10 of the world ODI rankings, South Africa could only muster 219-8 in their defeat by Pakistan last Wednesday. This, though, was a greater implosion - comical, calamitous and self-inflicted.
Firstly AB de Villiers failed to beat Hardik Pandya's throw from point to depart with a tournament total of 20 runs.
De Villiers was running with Faf du Plessis who, five balls later, was involved in a farcical mix-up with David Miller that ended with both men striving to make ground at the striker's end as the bails were removed at the non-striker's. The third umpire adjudged Miller as the man out.
Fittingly, a run-out completed the collapse. Imran Tahir and JP Duminy met in the middle of the pitch, with Tahir's turn and dive unable to save him.
India suffered a chastening defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka last Thursday as a chase of 322 was completed with six balls to spare. Here their bowlers impressed, albeit with some South African help.
In a soporific opening to the Proteas' innings, openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock were squeezed - the run-rate barely edged past four an over in an opening stand of 76.
Recalled off-spinner Ravinchandran Ashwin had Amla caught behind for 35 and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja had a sweeping De Kock lbw for 53. Then, after the run-outs, the pacemen got to work.
Hardik Pandya bowled Du Plessis with a slower ball, and Jasprit Bumrah had Chris Morris top edge to mid-wicket and Andile Phehlukwayo lbw to a full toss.
Runs dried up - only 60 came from the final 19 overs of an innings ended by two wickets in two balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar before Tahir's final, desperate run-out.
To defend such a meagre total, South Africa needed every half-chance to be held, but a Kohli hook off Morne Morkel fell short of Morris at fine leg before Amla put down a very tough chance off the same batsman at first slip off Phehlukwayo.
The India skipper arrived after Rohit Sharma played a needless waft at Morkel to be caught behind, but that never felt like the beginning of a South Africa fightback.
Left-hander Dhawan, the tournament's leading runscorer, sparkled square of the wicket, adding 121 with Kohli before he miscued Tahir to long-off.
Kohli played handsome drives on both sides, completing the job with Yuvraj Singh, who sealed the match with a six to the delight of a noisy and partisan crowd.
Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith on Test Match Special: "That run-out of AB de Villiers just sparked panic in the batting line-up. It's like they've never batted together before, like they've never heard the sound of a crowd.
"You have to laugh, otherwise you're going to cry. This performance doesn't bode well for South Africa's tour of England after this tournament."
India captain Virat Kohli: "It was a good toss to win; the wicket didn't change too much.
"Our bowlers bowled really well and the fielders backed it up. It was a complete performance in the field; we grabbed the chances that came our way."
South Africa captain AB de Villiers: "It's not an ideal way to finish the tournament. It's disappointing, but credit to them.
"We got something nice going until the run-outs, which cost us highly today. We just came unstuck against a better team today."
