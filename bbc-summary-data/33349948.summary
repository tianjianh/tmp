The Airports Commission has released details of one possible option, illustrated in this video with satellite images and Google Earth.
Planes typically approach Heathrow from the east, as shown here. This is sometimes reversed depending on prevailing wind conditions.
Both the commission and Heathrow itself stress that the final route over London would be subject to extensive consultation and may well differ from this version.
And the government has not yet decided whether to proceed with a third runway at Heathrow.
