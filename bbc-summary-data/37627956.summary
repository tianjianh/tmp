A 1970s private jet, which was once the height of luxury travel, is now offering visitors a "truly unique" place to stay in Pembrokeshire.

The Jet Star is the brainchild of Toby Rhys-Davies, who runs a campsite in Redberth, near Tenby.
It sleeps four people and includes all original features, plus wifi and a games console in the cockpit.
Mr Rhys-Davies said he wanted to have the "most unique campsite in the UK."
Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Rhys-Davies said he had bought the jet last summer, although he remained tight-lipped about where from, and did it up over the winter.
"It's perfect for a couple," he said, "with all the romance of first class travel.
"The reviews have been phenomenal."
Visitors have described their stay as "quirky", "fun" and a "truly amazing experience."
Mr Rhys-Davies has run his site for three years and began by offering Mongolian yurts, but as they increased in popularity, he realised he "had to think outside the box" to make his site unique.
The Jet Star was "a truly unique place to stay," he said.
He is currently working on a flying saucer for the campsite.
"By next year it will look incredible," he said.
