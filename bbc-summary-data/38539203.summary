Crewe Alexandra 1-2 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Jack Marriott and Jake Gray earned 10-man Luton a 2-1 comeback win at Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crewe raised the bar in front of their new manager David Artell, taking a first-half lead through skipper Ryan Lowe's ninth goal of the season.
Charlie Kirk should have done better when well placed on the left of the box early on, only to drag his finish past the far post, while Guthrie was also left to rue skying a close-range header over after getting on the end of a teasing free-kick from George Cooper.
Crewe took a deserved lead in the 28th minute when Lowe was slipped clear by Alex Kiwomya, the 38-year-old veteran finding the far corner as he scored in the league for the first time since also netting against Luton at Kenilworth Road in October.
But the impressive Marriott had Luton back on terms on the stroke of half-time, as the striker's shot from a tight angle managed to evade Garratt's clutches and slip in at the near post.
Nathan Jones' side looked to be up against it when they were reduced to 10 men eight minutes after the break after full-back Alan Sheehan caught Danny Hollands to earn his second booking.
But Crewe were undone when Marriott cut infield to force a save from Garratt and Danny Hylton kept the attack alive to pull the ball back from the by-line for Gray to sidefoot home the winner.
