[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland crushed Scotland by 70 points to emulate the men's team and secure the Women's Six Nations title on points difference from France.

Needing to win by at least 27 points, the Irish were 34 up by half-time.
They exploited their dominant pack to secure the victory, which delivered the Triple crown as well as the title.
Ireland, World Cup semi-finalists last year, scored 11 tries at Broadwood Stadium, with winger Alison Miller notching a hat-trick of touchdowns.
It is a second Six Nations success in three seasons for Ireland, who landed the Grand Slam when they first won the title in 2013.
Ireland finished with a points difference of 113 with France on 69, each side having won four of their five fixtures.
Any nerves Tom Tiernan's team may have had were quickly eased as Niamh Briggs, skipper on the occasion of her 50th cap, scored the opening try in the fourth minute after an exchange of passes with winger Hannah Tyrrell.
Scotland winger Nuala Deans and full-back Briggs traded penalties before the Irish forwards really took charge of proceedings.
In the 17th minute the visitors claimed line-out ball and mauled over for Claire Molloy to score.
Ireland's well controlled scrum told again as number eight Heather O'Brien got a touchdown at the rear.
When the Irish were then given a kickable penalty, they understandably opted to put it in the corner instead and Gillian Bourke finished off another solid line-out and maul sequence.
Winger Miller then broke through for a fine individual score to give Ireland a 37-3 interval advantage.
Miller pounced again early in the second half and the strong pack delivered the seventh try through Paula Fitzpatrick.
Second row Sophie Spence stretched the lead and Scotland must have been simply wishing the agony to end as replacement scrum-half Tania Rosser got the ninth try and Miller completed her hat-trick before centre Jenny Murphy rounded things off with the final try.
