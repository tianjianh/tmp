Twin B and Yasmin Evans announced on 1Xtra that the R&B singer, who's influenced the likes of Alicia Keys and Rihanna, will be playing at 1Xtra Live.
It's the seventh year the flagship gigs have taken place and this year it's all happening in Birmingham.
Mistajam and DJ Target will be hosting shows live from the National Indoor Arena (NIA) on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra on 15 November.
Mary J Blige has won multiple Grammy awards, was ranked ninth in music channel VH1's list of the 100 greatest women in music (Madonna was number one, if you're wondering) and has sold millions of records around the world.
Next month we'll get to hear some of her most famous songs live, including No More Drama, Family Affair, Real Love and I'm Going Down.
She joins a 1Xtra Live line-up that already includes Rick Ross, who'll be performing his first ever live show for the BBC.
Jess Glynne, Fuse ODG and Lethal Bizzle will also be on stage.
George Ergatoudis, Head of Music, Radio 1 and 1Xtra, said: "There are not many events in the world that can boast having both Mary J Blige and Rick Ross.
"For 1Xtra Live we've pulled together a bill featuring 1Xtra favourites from both the UK and abroad - Birmingham is in for an amazing night of live music."
Joining the stars at the NIA will be 1Xtra DJs like Trevor Nelson, Charlie Sloth and Sarah Jane Crawford.
There are 10,000 tickets available for the show.
Tickets will go on sale on a first come first serve basis at 18:00 BST on Thursday 23 October.
They'll cost Â£10 each plus handling fees and you have to be 16 or over to attend. Full terms and conditions are available on the 1Xtra website.
If you can't make it to the Midlands, the show will be available to watch on the Red Button and will be streamed on the 1Xtra website.
