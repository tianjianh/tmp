He was the first person to walk all the Munros, mountains of more than 3,000ft (914.4m), in a single trip.
Dr Brown's 112-day journey in 1974 involved 289 peaks and 1,639 miles, which he covered by walking, cycling and travelling on two ferries.
The 82-year-old, of Burntisland, Fife, will receive the award next month.
It will be presented during the Fort William Mountain Festival.
Mile Pescod, one of the festival's organisers, said: "Hamish embodies the passion and the excitement that exploring the wild Scottish landscape entails, and the great desire to share this sense of adventurous wonder with others.
"Not only has Hamish explored Scotland and many other mountain areas right across the globe but he has helped countless others do the same and find the same sense of satisfaction.
"Hamish is a true exponent of mountain culture."
