In 2012, property firm Allied London bought a 150-year-lease to Leeds Dock, then known as Clarence Dock, when most of the site's retail units were empty.
The company owns 161,845 sq ft of the site and has 16 tenants, the Yorkshire Evening Post first reported.
One of the largest tenants is Sky, which employs 650 staff in its digital and technology hub.
Leeds Dock is also home to one of Leeds' best-known attractions, the Royal Armouries museum.

The original Clarence Dock development, which opened in 2007, was created to transform the industrial riverside area into a fashionable urban village with upmarket shops and restaurants.
Businesses raised concerns the site wasn't attracting sufficient visitors, with the recession blamed as a contributing factor to the lack of trade.
Kevin Grady, a Leeds historian, said: "When Allied London took over the dock, their idea was to revitalise it with events and get new office uses - they gave up on the retail side and have done pretty well.
"Now is really a prime time to sell really because it's now a prime retail asset, there's a lot of development interest in this part of the city now."
Leeds Dock has more than 1,000 apartments and approximately 2,000 people working there.
James Vincent, managing director of Royal Armouries International, said: "It's a fantastic area now, right on the waterfront.
"Allied London have done a really good job of getting people in and involved at Leeds Dock."
Allied London have been approached by the BBC, but declined to comment.
