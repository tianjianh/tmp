Luke Davenport: Injured British Touring Car driver has 'unfinished business'

British Touring Car driver Luke Davenport has "unfinished business" in a racing car after a horrific collision which left him in an induced coma.

The 24-year-old from Cambridge was involved in an 11-car pile-up in June.
He was in a coma after breaking his left tibia, pelvis, collarbone and part of his pubic bone as well as puncturing both lungs and bending his ribs.
"I'm not trying to sound like a hero or anything but it was a very rare accident," he said.
"It was very odd conditions with rain and oil on the circuit. There's never been a situation before where so many cars have hit one point - a driver's door."
The incident on 10 June at the Croft Circuit in North Yorkshire occurred after Davenport aquaplaned off the track and ripped off part of the car's splitter, leaving cooling fluid across the track.
He was unable to restart the car as it had no water left in it, and with slippery fluid on the track, other drivers were unable to control their cars properly and ended up colliding with Davenport's driver's side door.
"I remember radioing into the team that I was off the track but the car feels really good," he told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"I thought we could get it back in, clear the grass out of the radiator and go again.
"Then I remember feeling the biggest hit, it sends a shockwave through the body and that we think is [Andrew] Jordan hitting me, then it all goes blank."
The pile-up also left drivers Jeff Smith, who had multiple chest injuries, and Aron Taylor-Smith, who fractured his leg, in hospital.
But Davenport said he was grateful to have had a modern seat put in, which was designed to move with impact and shifted closer to the centre of the car, away from the collision point, with every fresh hit.
He is now back in Cambridge at Addenbrooke's Hospital after spending 12 days in an induced coma and said he was grateful for all the support he received.
"The support has been amazing and the family have been brilliant, collecting all the support, writing it in books so that every time I was slowly coming round there was a positive message and then I'd drift back out of consciousness," he added.
"I caught pneumonia as well, but I had such a positive attitude because of all the messages from everyone. Just seeing these face and hearing the voices was so good."
