Nathan Beesley was in the Savage River mine in Tasmania when a rock fell "directly on top of him", his wife Katie said.
The 32-year-old from Devon had moved to Australia with his family last year to pursue a career with the Australian Defence Force.
Mrs Beesley said she was "utterly heartbroken" by his death.

She said: "I can't fathom how I will even come close to giving my children the future and opportunities they deserve now that Nathan is gone.
"He is my world. Always has been and always will be."
The company Mr Beesley was working for, SRG, described the incident as a "significant rock fall".
Grange Resources, who own the mine, have re-opened parts of it, but the section where the incident happened last Friday remains closed.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: "We are ready to support the family of a British man, who has sadly died in Australia, if requested to do so."
