The Royals lie 14th with six Championship games to play and away trips to Middlesbrough and Leeds ahead.
"We have to make sure we're playing with motivation and that the players are ready to play for the shirt," McDermott told BBC Radio Berkshire.
Defeat by Birmingham on Saturday was a first at home since December.

McDermott began a second spell as Reading manager before Christmas and, despite a run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, he has seen his side drift away from the Championship's top six.
The former Leeds manager will aim to watch the club's under-21 and under-18 sides as much as possible before the end of the season.
"I need to know who we've got," he said. "I've watched all the under-21 games since I came back. I need to know how they're doing, who's able to play in the first team and who isn't."
