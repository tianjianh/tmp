Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald has been ruled out of the running for the managerial vacancy at Shrewsbury Town.

The EFL League One strugglers have made an approach to the Firhill Park club, but Archibald says he has "unfinished business" with the Jags.
"The club mentioned the other day that there had been an approach, the clubs spoke and that's as far as it went.
"It's flattering that somebody was interested. For me, it's put to bed," added 38-year-old Archibald.
His withdrawal from the running for the Shrewsbury job has reduced their shortlist to three, all of whom are understood to be already in jobs.
Town chief executive Brian Caldwell says it is a close call between them, but that he still hopes to have their new man in position for Saturday's home game with Northampton Town.
"It's hard for everybody to be patient," he told BBC Radio Shropshire. "It would be ideal to get it over the line before the weekend. But the most important is that we make the right decision."
Accrington Stanley's John Coleman and the much-travelled Micky Adams are the latest two to rule themselves out.
Morecambe boss Jim Bentley says he has had no approach, while another Shrewsbury old boy Nigel Jemson, who is coaching at another of his former clubs, Nottingham Forest, and out of work managers Tony Mowbray and Steve Cotterill had also previously said they were not interested.
Stressing he would be in charge for Saturday's game with Ross County, Archibald said: "My full concentration is on Partick Thistle. I've got a good job and they've been good with me over the last few years."
Archibald, who has been in charge of Thistle since January 2013, winning promotion to the Premiership, and is under contract until 2019.
The former Thistle defender is still open to a move to English football at some point but, for now, he is happy in Glasgow.
"It interests me," he said. "I've said that before. It's something I want to do down the line but I still think I've got unfinished business here in keeping the team in the division. We've done it the last few seasons. Hopefully we can do it again.
"You've got to make sure it's right on all counts at the club and make sure you are going to a club that suits. You've got to take everything into consideration - who you're working with and the relationships you've got.
"It's not just about going to what might seem a bigger club, you've got to learn about the infrastructure and everything about it. I didn't get to speak to the club so I don't know anything about it."
