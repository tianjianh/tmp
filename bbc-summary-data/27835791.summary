[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One Leyton Orient have signed Derby County goalkeeper Adam Legzdins on a free transfer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old has been with the Rams for three years, but did not feature for the Championship side last season.
Legzdins, who began his career as a trainee at Birmingham and has had spells at Crewe and Burton, has signed a two-year deal with the O's.
Orient boss Russell Slade had been looking for a senior keeper after Jamie Jones joined Preston last week.
Legzdins made 37 appearances in total during his three-year spell with Derby, but is now hoping to establish himself in east London.
"I spoke to the manager and the goalkeeper coach and it became very clear the ambition of the club is to build on last year," Legzdins told the club website.
"It was important for me to join a team where I would play and I wanted one that would be challenging at the right end of the table
"Last year was disappointing for me for various reasons and I played fewer games than I'd hoped but the year before I played 33 games in the Championship.
"That's my ambition; to play games. I don't want to be number two goalkeeper."
