Queen's Birthday Honours list: DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson given knighthood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland MP Jeffrey Donaldson has been given a knighthood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Democratic Unionist is among 101 people from Northern Ireland to be recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours list published on Friday night.
Mr Donaldson said he was "delighted and humbled" by the honour.
He said: "I am absolutely delighted to have received this honour and indeed humbled that I would be considered worthy."
Mr Donaldson was the youngest person to take a seat in the Stormont Assembly at the age of 22 - and he has been elected to Westminster five times.
"I see this honour, not just as a recognition of the work that I have done in over 30 years in active politics in Northern Ireland, but also a tribute to the people I represent and who have put their faith in me in a number of elections," said Mr Donaldson.
"So, I dedicate this honour to them and also to my family who have stood by me through some very challenging times and also to my party.
"When I was told about it, you could have knocked me down with a feather. It came as a huge surprise but a very welcome one."
Despite the new title, Mr Donaldson, a married father of two daughters, has insisted he will not change.
"I'll always be plain Jeffrey to my friends and to the people that I represent," he said.
Alongside Mr Donaldson is businesswoman Rotha Johnston, who has been made a Dame for services to the local economy, and for her role in promoting female entrepreneurship through her participation in the Northern Ireland Women's Network.
Ms Johnston is also currently pro-chancellor at Queen's University, chair of Northern Ireland Screen, a non-executive director of Northern Ireland Electricity and an independent board member of the Department of Justice and Belfast Harbour Commissioners.
Dr Malcolm McKibbin, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, has been awarded a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for delivering major reform and for his part in negotiations which resulted in the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.
The oldest recipient from Northern Ireland is 92-year-old Stanley McIlroy, who has been given an MBE for his tireless fundraising.
The pensioner from Belfast has raised more than Â£800,000 for Cancer Research UK and continues to bring in an average of Â£10,000 a year.
Mr McIlroy credits medical research scientists for saving the life of his father as far back as the 1960s.
"My father was diagnosed in 1967 and I was told he had six months to live," he said.
"My father died in 1979 - not from cancer but from a stroke.  So it was through research, and research only I believe, that my father had an extra 12 years to live in this world."
At just 21 years old, plumbing apprentice Gary Doyle is the youngest person in the UK to receive an honour on this latest list.
In 2015, Mr Doyle, from Castlewellan in Co Down, won a gold medal for his plumbing and heating skills at the World Skills championships in Brazil.
Meanwhile, school lollipop lady Mary Stevenson has been given an MBE for services to education in north Belfast.
Ardoyne youth worker Owen Maguire is also among those to be given an MBE.
Married couple William and Elizabether McCay have each been awarded a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to music and the community after they set up a series of summer music recitals in Belfast city centre church to showcase new young talent.
Three Queen's Police Medals and one Queen's Ambulance Service Medal have also been received.
