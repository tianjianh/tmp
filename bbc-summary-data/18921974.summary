The Aberdeen-born former Manchester United star said it was an emotional moment as he revealed the statue.
It was inspired by him scoring for Scotland in a famous 3-2 victory against then world champion England in 1967 at Wembley.
He said: "My family and I are delighted with the sculpture - it looks fantastic."
The football legend added: "Despite having lived outside Aberdeen for most of my life I still have a strong connection to the city and am honoured to have a statue commemorated to me in my home town."
Denis Law Legacy Trust member Graham Thom said: "Denis is such an admired figure in Aberdeen.
"The 1967 goal represents such a positive time in Scottish footballing history and was an obvious choice as a moment to be captured forever.
"The Trust was set up not only to erect a permanent statue of Aberdeen's most famous sportsman, but to support the advancement of the arts, heritage and culture, as a long-term benefit to the people of Aberdeen."
In 2010, Denis Law was guest of honour at an event to mark the official opening of the Â£28m Aberdeen Sports Village.
He hailed it as a world class facility to inspire a new generation of sporting stars.
He said at the time: "I only wish that I'd had the benefit of such fantastic sporting facilities on my doorstep during my childhood days in Aberdeen."
