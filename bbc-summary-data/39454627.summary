A lost parrot has been returned to its home after a group of teenagers lured it with a chocolate biscuit in a supermarket car park.

Blue-fronted Amazon parrot Charlie went missing from the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife & Falconry Centre, near Sheffield, on Wednesday.
She was spotted by shoppers at Tesco in Dinnington, about two miles from home.
It is thought the wind blew her off course and she was unable to find her way home.
Abigail Carter, from the centre, said Charlie was found in a tree, covered in crumbs, and munching on the chocolate biscuit, given to her by a group of teenagers.
She said although chocolate was not good for parrots, she praised the actions of the youngsters for keeping Charlie occupied for long enough for them to get to her.

Charlie was found on Thursday after an appeal on social media.
Ms Carter also thanked everyone who had helped with the search for Charlie, who went missing during a flying display at the centre.
She said the response to the appeal had been fantastic.
To mark her return, Charlie, who is celebrating her 19th birthday, was treated to a special "non-chocolate" cake made from her usual diet of fruit, vegetables and mixed seeds.
