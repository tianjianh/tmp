Police Scotland criticised after crime reports not publicised in the media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police Scotland has been accused of throwing communications "out of the window" in Dumfries and Galloway.

It comes after a BBC Scotland Freedom of Information request found it had failed to reveal details of scores of crimes.
MSP Elaine Murray said she feared the incidents were not being made public as it was the "easiest thing to do".
Police said further work was being carried out to improve links between police officers and the media.
The crime reports coincided with three weeks leave booked by Police Scotland's Dumfries-based press officer.
In his absence, the force failed to publicise the crimes and many went unreported in the local media, including BBC Scotland.
More than 300 crimes were recorded by police in the south-west of Scotland between 26 August and 13 September.
Four rapes, 21 sex assaults and seven drug supply offences were among the incidents reported to the force.
The BBC in Dumfries received just one press release from Police Scotland during that time - on a fatal road accident at Gretna.
It is no secret that many of the crimes that make the headlines in Dumfries and Galloway rarely trouble even the inside pages of the national news media.
But it is important that Police Scotland maintains a year-round relationship with local newspapers, radio stations and websites.
Reports of road accidents, break-ins, and thefts are the backbone of the regional press.
As well as helping officers solve crime, they promote a relationship of trust between the police and public.
In the face of centralisation claims following the closure of the police control room in Dumfries, many believe that relationship should be their top priority.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said the sex crimes were "non-recent crimes" and they would not have been publicised in any event.
He added: "Likewise with the drugs figures, which were for minor possession charges, shopliftings and many of the common thefts, are ones where no media release would have been issued due to persons being arrested/reported at the time."
In a statement, he said arrangements had been made to circulate "incidents of note" and "public appeals" by local community officers with local press outlets.
He added: "Over the specified period a number of releases and appeals were made through these local contacts, however it is apparent that the local BBC office was not made aware.
"Further work to establish local direct links with community officers with all media outlets is being explored in order to provide resilience in the absence of the local communications officer for any reason.
"Local officers are encouraged to promote the work carried out in their community through local media."
Dumfriesshire MSP Elaine Murray said it was vital that channels of communication between police and public remain open.
She said: "Communication between Police Scotland and local people is not only an effective way to tackle and prevent crime, but also key for building trust.
"That's why I'm astonished that because of a lack of basic organisation, Police Scotland have thrown communication in the local area out of the window simply because it was the easiest thing to do.
"I hope they'll learn from these mistakes and implement more suitable procedures in the future."
