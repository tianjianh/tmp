Six out of 10 burglaries in north Wales are linked to drugs misuse, according to the area's deputy police and crime commissioner.

Julian Sandham also said a third of all violent crimes were alcohol-related.
He was speaking at the launch of the North Wales Criminal Justice Integrated Substance Misuse Service.
Mr Sandham said the figures were from research into local offenders, with drug addiction a key cause of burglary offences.
He said: "From a dip sample of local (burglary) offenders, over 60 per cent were believed to have current or past links to drugs and this rose to 90 per cent for repeat offenders.
"Analysis also shows that 31 per cent of all violent crimes are alcohol-related with either the victim or the offender, or both, being under the influence of alcohol."
The new service will see different organisations working together to help offenders recover and to challenge their behaviour.
