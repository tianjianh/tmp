Craig Dunstable applied for the role of Kingsley after the previous incumbent retired at the end of last season.
Now the 39-year-old architect has been "blown away" after landing the job of his team's cheerleader-in-chief.
The spiky sunburst character, designed by 2013 Turner Prize nominee David Shrigley, caused a global stir when unveiled as The Jags mascot last year.
He was likened to "a demented sun god" and described as "terrifying".
Club officials advertised for a replacement for Jay McGhee, who wore the costume previously, after the father-to-be stood down.
The job advertisement said employee benefits of the role included receiving a 2016/17 club season ticket, opportunities to travel the country and meeting celebrities like David Hasselhoff and Rachel Riley.
Father-of-four Mr Dunstable said he was overjoyed at being asked to take on the mascot role.
"I am absolutely blown away that I will now be donning the Kingsley suit during matches at Firhill," he said.
"I've had a lifelong love of Thistle thanks to my late grandfather, Bill.
"We'd take a game in every week come rain or shine. It was from this point that I fell in love with the team and always wanted to be involved in some way."
He added: "I didn't expect that I would one day be representing the club as the famous Kingsley and it's a role I'm ready and proud to take on."
Ian Maxwell, managing director of the Ladbrokes Premiership side, said Mr Dunstable "had that extra edge to him".
"I can't wait to see him on Saturday at the game," he said.
"He has bags of enthusiasm and, as a lifelong Jags fan, knows the importance of becoming the face of the club and ensuring an electric atmosphere at every game."
