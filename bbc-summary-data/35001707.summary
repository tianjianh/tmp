Mass sewage floods hit Devon homes as manholes overflow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sewage floods have affected properties in Devon more than 50 times in the past three years, according to residents.

Five households in Dawlish have complained of the "stench of fetid sewage" and debris being flung into gardens by passing traffic.
Roger Anderson said they were "fed-up" with the lack of action by South West Water, despite constant complaints.
South West Water said it was working to resolve the issues "urgently".
Resident Margaret Cloke said she arrived home to a pool of sewage in her garden and the smell made her feel "very nauseous".
She said: "We've had a lot of problems with sewerage. We've had sewage in the lane coming out of manholes, and people are walking through it and then obviously going back indoors, or going into the shops, and the stench is absolutely awful."
However, the company said there was no "quick fix" because the problems at Secmaton Lane and Secmaton Rise were complex and the site had seen "considerable new development".
