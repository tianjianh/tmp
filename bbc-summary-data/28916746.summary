[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Cliff Richard interviewed by police over assault claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Cliff Richard has been interviewed under caution in connection with an alleged historical sexual offence, South Yorkshire Police has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Cliff met officers by appointment and was not arrested or charged.
It comes after police searched his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on 14 August as part of their investigation.
The veteran pop star denies the alleged offence, saying the claim of an assault at a religious event in Sheffield in 1985 is "completely false".
South Yorkshire Police confirmed it had spoken to a 73-year-old man.
A police spokesman said: "The man was interviewed under caution but was not arrested. He entered South Yorkshire Police premises by arrangement."
A spokesman for Sir Cliff said: "Today Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged.
"He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him.
"Other than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he will continue to co-operate fully with the police, it would not be appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time."
The BBC has been criticised for its coverage of the search after it found out about the operation in advance and sent cameras to Sir Cliff's home when officers arrived.
The BBC has previously confirmed that its source relating to the police investigation was not the South Yorkshire force.
The BBC says its journalists "acted appropriately" in its coverage but police have accused the corporation of a "cover-up" afterwards over what it had known.
The bosses of both the BBC and the South Yorkshire Police have been summoned to appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee to explain how the broadcaster knew of the search in advance.
The allegation against Sir Cliff relates to an assault claim at an event featuring US preacher Billy Graham at the Bramall Lane stadium in Sheffield in 1985, the BBC understands.
