[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kent v Durham: Chris Rushworth stars with bat and ball but Kent mount late rally

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham enjoyed another decent day at Canterbury despite a late Kent rally led by captain Sam Northeast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 318-5, Durham captain Paul Collingwood hit 120 out of Durham's 448, aided by a 73-run stand from Chris Rushworth (57) and Barry McCarthy.
McCarthy (4-52) and Rushworth (3-61) then reduced their hosts to 123-8.
But a so far unbroken stand 88-run stand between Northeast (97*) and Yasir Shah has put Kent within reach of avoiding the follow-on, on 211-8.
Northeast, within three runs of an 18th first-class century, and Shah, on his debut, will start again in the morning needing 88 runs to avoid the threat of following on.
Earlier, Collingwood led his side to a fourth batting bonus point before being caught at slip, having completed his 34th first-class century.
He became the fifth wicket for Darren Stevens - the 17th time in the County Championship that he has collected a five-wicket haul for Kent - but his fifth this summer, one short of his 2014 best of six.
Pakistan international Yasir sent down 26 overs on his first Kent appearance, finally getting his first wicket by removing McCarthy for 24, to end his stand with Rushworth.
