Jamie Chapman created fake Facebook personas of teenage girls and used them to get boys to send him naked images.
They would be urged to engage in sex acts. If they refused, he threatened to send the images to friends or family.
Chapman, from Solihull, admitted rape and 21 offences of causing or inciting sexual activity with children.
The 28-year-old, who has also worked as a teaching assistant and sports coach, duped 18 victims in total, with the offences taking place between 2011 and 2016.

Birmingham Crown Court heard he broke down when he was caught by police, telling a colleague he was a "monster".
He was sentenced at a two-day hearing where he had also pleaded guilty to nine counts of taking, making and distributing indecent photos of children.
Judge Melbourne Inman QC said the offences represented a "disturbing catalogue of sexual corruption and deviancy".
It was "very difficult to imagine anything that can be a more extreme form of humiliation and degradation than was imposed" by Chapman on his rape victim, he added.
None of his victims were from the nursery he worked at, police said.
Prosecutor Matthew Brook said Chapman's aims were to get the boys to send him naked pictures so he could blackmail them, and then to encourage them to meet up with a boy and, ultimately, to meet up with himself.
One blackmail victim agreed to meet a boy who turned out to be Chapman, of Tamar Drive.
He raped him and filmed it on the boy's phone.
When he tried to meet up with him again, the victim pleaded with him saying what had happened had "already scarred me for life" and said that he might take his own life.
But Chapman replied: "I don't care."
Police traced Chapman through internet addresses he left behind when logging into his fake profiles.
