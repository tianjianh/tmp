River Thames boat owners in health and safety row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boat owners have criticised proposals to remove fire extinguishers and ladders from beside the River Thames following health and safety concerns.

The Environment Agency is reviewing the use of equipment kept by lock-keepers' offices that could endanger non-trained staff in emergencies.
Jonny Pleace, from the Thames River Users' Group, called the plans "absolutely ludicrous".
The agency said it was reviewing their use but had not made a final decision.
Lock keepers have access to the equipment, including ladders that have been in use for 40 years, in case people fall into the lock chamber.
However, some staff had raised health and safety issues about the heavy ladders, the Environment Agency said.
Donna Dowling, from the GMB union, which represents many of the lock keepers, said this was "absolutely, fundamentally, and categorically untrue".
"Lock keepers are vehemently opposed to it and actually want the lock ladders to remain in place," she said.
Mr Pleace said: "The Environment Agency through their wisdom and their health and safety audit, have decided the ladders are too heavy for people to lift, and the fire extinguishers are too dangerous to let off by the boats, so what they've decided is to do away with them.
"These ladders have been there foreverâ€¦ I think common sense has to prevail."
An Environment Agency spokesman said: "If a boat catches fire in a lock, our instruction to staff is to immediately call 999 and then provide assistance to get people away from the fire wherever it is safe to do so.
"We do not provide any training or equipment for them to use to put out boat fires, as this is not a requirement of their role."
He said other safety features were in place, including life rings, throw lines, egress steps, grab chains and pool hooks.
