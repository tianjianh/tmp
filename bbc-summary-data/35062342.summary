Dumfries and Galloway Council in budget cut warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council is facing the "single biggest cut in council funding in a generation", its leader has warned.

The local authority expects its funding settlement from the Scottish government to be slashed by £20m.
Leader Ronnie Nicholson said the council would be faced with "difficult decisions" and the move would lead to services being cut.
His stark warning came ahead of the Scottish government's budget next week.
In a statement, the council said it expected its grant from the government to be cut by 4-6%.
That would require the local authority to make savings of between £19.7m and £25.5m.
The council budget strategy for the next financial year was based on making savings of £12.5m.
Mr Nicholson said the new target would be "exceptionally challenging" for the council.
He added: "We have already identified £40m of savings over the past four years so the numbers of options are running out.
"The debate is now no longer about how you trim services and make them efficient. It is now about what services you simply have to stop providing.
"There is no doubt that difficult decisions lie ahead."
Councillors will be briefed on the financial settlement from the Scottish government at meeting on 17 December - the day after the budget.
Mr Nicholson said: "I know that local people understand that the cuts our council faces are not of our making and, as we take those tough budget decisions, it means that we won't be able to provide some of our council's existing services.
"But when we do make those decisions we will remain focused, as far as possible, on protecting the most vulnerable in our communities".
A Scottish government spokesman said: "Despite cuts of nearly 9% to the Scottish budget from the UK government, local government has been treated very fairly by the Scottish government and protected from the worst impact of UK cuts.
"Local government finance settlements have been maintained over the period 2012-16, with extra money for new responsibilities and, as a result, the total settlement in 2015-16 now amounts to over £10.85bn.
"All Scottish local authorities, including Dumfries and Galloway Council, are in receipt of their fair share of the total funding. For Dumfries and Galloway this share amounts to almost £317m this year."
