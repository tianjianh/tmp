One of the leading lawyers in the renewable power sector has criticised the UK and Welsh governments for their approaches to green energy.

Michelle Davies from law firm Eversheds echoed concerns of employers' group, the CBI that the UK government decision to cut subsidies for renewables will damage investment and jobs.
She said the Welsh government missed the boat by not doing enough when subsidies were in place.
Both government rejected the criticism.
The UK government cut subsidies because it is already meeting its renewable energy targets, but Ms Davies told BBC Radio Wales that was "not a sensible decision" because it made the UK a less attractive place to invest.
Ms Davies said Wales was not near where it should be on renewables, particularly when compared to Scotland's "strong leadership position".
"We didn't create that environment initially and we're paying the price for it now," she told the Wales at Work programme.
"Unfortunately there isn't a huge amount we can do about that now because the [UK] government sets the level of support that is provided," she said.
A Welsh government spokesman said it did not have the same energy powers as Scotland, and defended its green energy record.
The UK government said its priority was to move towards a low-carbon economy and ensure subsidies were used where they were needed most.
