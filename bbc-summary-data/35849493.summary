[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham Athletic moved to within a point of League One safety after edging a fiercely competitive draw with leaders Burton Albion.

Both sides hit the woodwork before the break, the Latics from a corner that bounced to safety off the far post and Albion through Tom Flanagan's header.
But chances were at a premium with just one shot on target throughout.
The Brewers, who are four points clear, would have restored a six-point lead over second-placed Wigan with a win.
But they remain seven points ahead of third-placed Walsall.
Mark Duffy did force Oldham keeper Joel Coleman to palm away a 20-yard free-kick in the second half.
But the visitors, who still have two games in hand on fifth from bottom Blackpool, were good value for a point.

"We probably had the best training session yesterday morning that we've had since we arrived, and that worried us because if you're that good on the Friday you're usually not that good on the Saturday.
"It just happens sometimes. You've seen the honesty of the players all season and they're as disappointed as anything.
"But, as I say, it just happens as a footballer sometimes."
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I think we definitely deserved something out of the game. We looked good.
"We knew the importance of trying to get something from the game so I'm pleased we've come out with something.
"I think a lot of people probably expected us to get beaten but I think we've shown we're a half-decent side."
