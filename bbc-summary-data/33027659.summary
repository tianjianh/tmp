BBC Music Day: Hadrian's Wall of Sound in pictures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The length of Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has become a stage for a huge live musical performance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundreds of musicians have travelled the wall's 73 miles (117km) using transport including a vintage bus, motorbikes, unicycles and a tractor, passing a baton from performer to performer.
Part of BBC Music Day, the Hadrian's Wall of Sound event began at daybreak in Bowness-on-Solway in West Cumbria and finished in Wallsend, North Tyneside 14 hours later.
BBC TV and radio networks have been broadcasting live across the day and there has been full online coverage.
Dawn on the west coast of England - at Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria - was serenaded by Carlisle saxophonist Roz Sluman.
A BBC Music Day vintage bus transported performers and the baton across Cumbria and into Northumberland. It appeared to be popular with the wildlife.
Durham-born opera singer Graeme Danby swapped red plush seats and beautiful auditoria for the even more spectacular Cawfield Crag and described himself as "a lucky man". BBC Newcastle sports presenter Simon Pryde - who was dressed for the terrain - took charge of the baton, which Mr Danby then passed to the Royal Northern Sinfonia Wind Quintet.
Good job there was a bus so Susan Lambert did not have to carry her clarsach - a Gaelic harp - up to Walltown Crags on Hadrian's Wall.
Carlisle bandstand was the marginally less al fresco venue for Lake District band mylittlebrother - as heard on BBC Introducing.
A cappella singer Anna Flannagan performed her own composition - The Gift - at Lanercost Priory, near Brampton in Cumbria.
Playing a piece called Secrets of the Night on the piano might not be unusual for Kate Bottomley, but doing it outside on the grass at Errington Hill Head Farm probably was.
The Dalston Male Voice Choir received the baton and performed inside St Michael's Church in Burgh by Sands.
Performing along Hadrian's Wall is not for the faint hearted. Marilyn Framrose and David Hutchinson hitched a ride from Lanercost Priory to Banks East Turret courtesy of Look North's Colin Briggs.
Riding along on the top of the vintage bus, Wallsend guitarist Tom Lapworth was the only musician to travel the entire length of the wall.
Fourteen hours after this musical relay began, the crowds waiting for the finale at the excavated Roman fort Segedunum in Wallsend made their feelings on Hadrian's Wall of Sound clear.
