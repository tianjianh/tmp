Tour de Romandie: Chris Froome fifth on stage one as Albasini wins sprint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome came fifth as Orica-Scott rider Michael Albasini won a sprint finish in heavy rain on stage one of the Tour de Romandie.

Two-time champion Froome remains 29 seconds behind prologue winner Fabio Felline, who retains the yellow jersey.
But Britain's Alex Dowsett, who was second, fell down the classifications in Switzerland after dropping away on the final climb to Champery.
Albasini crossed ahead of Diego Ulissi and Jesus Herrada on the 172km course.
Britain's Simon Yates finished in 28th place for Orica-Scott, leaving him 16th in the overall standings, 18 seconds off the pace.
The six-day five-stage race is an early indicator of form leading towards July's Tour de France, which Team Sky rider Froome will be bidding to win for a fourth time - and third in succession.
Thursday's second stage is a hilly 161.3km race from Champery to Bulle.
