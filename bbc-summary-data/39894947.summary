Firefighters tackled the blaze that broke out on moorland off Brushes Road in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, at about 18:15 BST on Thursday.
Witnesses reported seeing huge amounts of ash in the sky, as the fire spread across the grassland.
The fire service urged residents to keep their doors and windows closed and not to travel in the immediate area. The cause of the fire is not yet known.
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said the fire "measured at approximately 0.5km square [124 acres]".
"Before darkness fell crews kept the fire away from nearby properties.
"Residents are asked to keep their doors and windows closed to stop any smoke entering their houses and to not travel in the immediate area."
Fire crews managed to bring the blaze under control by about 09:00 on Friday.
