[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Wolves thrashed local rivals St Helens to remain second in Super League, two points behind Hull FC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Sandow's dummy set up Ben Currie to crash over, before Australian half-back Sandow touched down himself.
Currie's kick sent Ryan Atkins through for a try on his 300th career outing as Wolves led 16-0 at half-time.
Wolves continued their impressive play with Stefan Ratchford and Rhys Evans going over, with Saints full-back Jonny Lomax grabbing their only points.
Warrington host leaders Hull, who won a sixth game in a row against Widnes, on 10 June.
Saints, who won 25-22 at Warrington in April, have now lost six of their last eight games in all competitions at Langtree Park.
Keiron Cunningham's side are now six points off the top four places with six games until the start of the Super 8s.
There was a long stoppage in play in the second half when versatile Saints centre Jordan Turner received treatment and had to be carried off on a stretcher.
