Some residents of a housing estate in Londonderry have said urgent action is needed to tackle a rat infestation.

Residents in Strathfoyle believe the problem has been caused by waste left behind at the former Brickkiln site in Maydown.
The issue was raised at a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Thursday.
Brickkiln said they no longer have responsibility for the site and could not comment.
The administrator for the site, Keenan C F, has yet to respond to the claims.
Ralph Dixon has lived in Strathfoyle all his life.
"When I come up the back roads there you would see them running about down past Brickkiln," he said.
"There's hundreds of them, hundreds. The rubbish is a big cause of the problem and now that it's closed down it's going to make it even worse.
"Children as well, everybody is talking about it. It's a health hazard of course it is, vermin, it's a disgrace."
Another resident said some children are too scared to play outside because of the rats.
DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he had video evidence of the infestation.
"The residents are very upset, there's huge amounts of rubbish left there as a result of the closure of Brickkiln several months ago," he said.
"That rubbish has not been treated and obviously that has now resulted in a rat infestation which is causing a major health hazard.
"It is deeply concerning and it is a situation which is getting worse by the day. Nothing has been done about it, NIEA need to step up.
"The council have responsibility as well for ensuring that whoever looks after the city's waste look after it in a responsible manner."
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan, who lives in the area, said the scale of the problem was being exaggerated.
"I live in Strathfoyle and I think the media coverage of this to date has not been helpful or particularly accurate," he said.
"The estate or the village is not overrun with rats. There is a problem and I have taken action to resolve.
"As soon as this issue was brought to my attention on Wednesday we contacted the administrator of the site and they have now contacted a pest control company to deal with the problem."
