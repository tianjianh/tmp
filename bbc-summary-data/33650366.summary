Street artists in Bristol for live painting festival

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of international artists have been in Bristol to take part in an "urban paint festival".

Walls, hoardings, shop shutters and camper vans will be painted live by artists from South America and Europe throughout the weekend.
Upfest, which began in 2008, is centred on Bedminster's North Street.
Some murals will remain until the next Upfest, including huge paintings on the Tobacco Factory venue and the Red Point climbing centre.
Visitors to the festival were able to watch 275 artists from 25 countries painting during live shows over the weekend. Among those taking part are Inkie, My Dog Sighs, Gamma, Lonac and Dutch due Telmo Miel.
As well as walls and vehicles, Upfest has its own 14m (45ft) long version of a New York-style subway train, created in 2012, for artists to decorate.
At the Tobacco Factory Argentinian artist Martin Ron - known for huge surreal paintings in Buenos Aires - was painting a 2,025 sq ft (188 sq m) mural of his girlfriend.
Bristol, the birthplace of Banksy, has an international reputation for its street art.
Gallery owner Stephen Hayles founded Upfest in 2008. Initially held indoors, the next year it spilled out onto the streets with artists painting shutters, sides and end gables of shops and other buildings.
Many of the murals are painted on temporary hoardings but some remain year round and become local landmarks.
Mr Hayles said since Upfest began he has only had to remove two murals where artists "overstepped the mark".
"There was one opposite a school which was showing a bit too much cleavage," he said.
"It's just common sense really."
