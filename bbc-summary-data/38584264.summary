She was walking along Harcourt Hill, Botley between 19:45 and 20:10 GMT on Tuesday evening when she was approached from behind by an armed man.
He took her to Raleigh Park where he raped her, Thames Valley Police said.
A traffic collision involving a black VW Golf in Wytham shortly before 23:00 is being linked to the investigation.
A forensics tent has been put up in the park with a cordon surrounding it and police are combing the area, with increased foot patrols in place.
The offender is described as white, about 30 years old, muscular and just under 6ft. He was wearing dark black clothing, with a hood up and a balaclava covering the lower part of his face.
A 38-year-old man is currently in police custody.
Senior investigating officer Det Insp Jim Holmes said: "We are appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything unusual in the area to come forward.
"We are particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen a man matching the description running away from the Harcourt Hill area shortly after 20:25, or anyone who saw a man matching the description with a woman in that area last night.
"We are also interested in speaking to residents in Wytham... we are linking this road traffic collision to the rape."
An Oxford Brookes spokeswoman said the university was co-operating with inquiries.
