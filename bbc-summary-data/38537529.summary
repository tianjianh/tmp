Paul Halliday, who faces a party hearing on 28 January, said he is innocent and has not been made fully aware of what allegations he faces.
Mr Halliday stood for election in Newport East in the 2016 Senedd poll.
A party spokesman said: "He has been suspended and an internal investigation is under way."
Mr Halliday, who is also a former parliamentary candidate, told BBC Wales: "I've not been made fully aware of the allegations against me.
"I claim my innocence and I will prove my innocence at the hearing.
"The party is doing the right thing by following its procedures, by suspending me until an investigation is over.
"There is no allegation of illegality here," he added.
