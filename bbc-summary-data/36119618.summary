[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tayo Jones, 22, was serving a suspended sentence for drug offences when he struck the 25-year-old in Clifton, Bristol, last August.
Bristol Crown Court heard he was speeding and later left the scene.
Jones was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The court was told he was driving a Ford Fiesta when he hit Mr Hickey, from the Bishopston area of the city, on 29 August.
The Leicester University graduate died outside the Richmond pub in Gordon Road.
Jones, of Southville Road, Bristol had been doing 30 mph in 20 mph zone and was driving in the middle of the carriageway, the court heard.
He pleaded guilty on the eve of his trial to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, after earlier admitting a charge of driving without a licence or insurance.
The court heard that 15 days before crash, Jones had received a suspended prison sentence for possessing cannabis with intent to supply.
While on bail after being charged with causing death by dangerous driving, Jones committed a public order offence in a row with a member of railway staff at Bristol Temple Meads Station.
Judge Euan Ambrose said: "You were aware of the incident and you stopped your car but you didn't get out. You did not go and investigate who or what you had hit. You drove off.
"Your primary concern was damage to your vehicle and you didn't have a licence or insurance. In other words your first thought was to yourself."
