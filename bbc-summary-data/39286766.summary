It finished 0-11 apiece after normal time and the teams will meet again in Ballybofey next week.
Derry stunned holders Monaghan with a 3-10 to 1-11 victory at Iniskeen to take them into the semi-finals.
Cavan hammered Fermanagh 2-19 to 0-4 while Armagh defeated Down 2-13 to 0-12 in the Athletic Grounds.
Donegal were dominant in the first half but struggled to score while Tyrone were guilty of too many wayward passes.
Michael Langan's point deservedly nudged Donegal in front before the interval, although their poor shooting meant they only led 0-5 to 0-4.
Tyrone had their best spell in the third quarter with David Mulgrew pointing twice as they moved 0-9 to 0-7 ahead after 41 minutes.
Langan's quality frees brought Donegal back into it and Tyrone keeper Benny Gallon pulled off a superb save from Michael Carroll.
Donegal's total of 15 wides looked to have cost them when Fergal Meenagh bore down on goal, but the ball was somehow cleared.
It finished all-square after normal time with the excellent Langan nailing his fourth dead ball chance of the half.
Brennan had the final say in the extra-time, slotting over a 45 three minutes from the end.
Lanagan finished with a total of 0-6 while Mulgrew was Tyrone's top-scorer with four points from play.
Next week's winners will play Cavan in the semi-final on 29 March after the Breffni side crushed Fermanagh.
Cavan, who won four Ulster U21 titles in a row between 2011 and 2014, scored the opening seven points at Brewster Park.
Ryan Connolly hit four points as the visitors cruised to a 0-10 to 0-3 interval lead before Conor Smith and Peter Corrigan added second-half goals.
Derry pulled off the biggest shock of the night, beating defending champions Monaghan.
James Donaghy's 19th minute goal helped the Oak Leafers lead 1-5 to 0-5 at half time.
Barry Kerr was sent off for Monaghan and Tiernan Flanagan was among the Derry goalscorers in the second half.
David McAllister netted a late penalty for Monaghan but it was too little, too late.
In the semi-final Derry will play Armagh, who beat Down 2-13 to 0-12 in the Athletic Grounds.
Shea Loye starred with a personal haul of 2-7.
