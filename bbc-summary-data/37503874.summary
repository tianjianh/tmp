Donington Co-op 'destroyed' in botched ram-raid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ram-raid on a village Co-op store went so badly wrong it ended up knocking down most of the shop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The robbers fled empty-handed after the building collapsed on the tractor used to smash into the shop in Donington in Lincolnshire.
Neighbours were woken by the noise in the early hours, with one describing the scene as "total devastation".
Police, who appealed for witnesses, said the offenders fled in a flat bed vehicle and dark blue car.
Malcolm Mills, landlord of the nearby Black Bull Inn, said: "It is total devastation on the front. The window is out - there is a great big concrete beam that ran across the whole of the frontage lying on the floor.
"I was woken by a huge bang - so stuck my head out the window. I tried to take photos but they were rubbish as I was shaking at the time.
"I was also quite naked, so it was a bit cool."
He said the gang escaped after being disturbed by a passing lorry and other people coming out to see what was happening.
"It was all over in about four minutes," Mr Mills said.
He said one of the raiders had to come back because it looked like he had left something in the tractor.
