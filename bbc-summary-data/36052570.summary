Big oil producing nations meet this weekend in Qatar to discuss plans for a freeze in production levels.
But there is scepticism over whether such a deal would make much difference to the current oversupply of oil in the market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.97 points to 17,897.46.
The S&P 500 was down 2.05 points to 2,080.73. The technology focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 7.67 points to 4,938.22.
Stocks in the energy sectors fell as another US bank - Citigroup - reported it was setting cash aside to cover losses on loans to the energy industry.
Shares in banking giant Citigroup closed 0.13% down after trading mostly higher all day. It reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit, but that was not as bad as analysts had been expecting.
Shares of Marathon Petroleum were down 3.8%, Exxon Mobile fell 0.5% and Chevron was 0.75% lower.
Shares of Apple dropped 2% after a report suggested the company was cutting iPhone production in the April-June quarter due to weak sales.
Investors also had a gloomy economic report to chew over.
US industrial production fell 0.6% in March, which was a bigger drop than analysts were expecting, and followed a 0.6% decline in February.
