In pictures: Sacred geometries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A small group of photographers have turned their lenses on the urban landscape, seeking to capture the beauty of the architecture around us.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The images explore the idea of sacred geometries, the perfect mix of proportion and mathematical ratios that are pleasing to the eye and a reflection of those found in nature.
The pictures can be seen at the Anise Gallery in London until 15 April 2017.
