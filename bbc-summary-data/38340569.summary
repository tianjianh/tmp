High school's lifeline for Crickhowell town library

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Powys high school has offered to take over a town library to secure its future.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crickhowell High School approached Powys council offering to manage the town's library to benefit pupils and the community.
It would mean the service can meet its local savings target.
The library would stay in its Silver Street location, and the council said the handover would be seamless with no disruption to the public.
