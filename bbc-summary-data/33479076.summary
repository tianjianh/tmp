The man was disturbed as he attempted to rape the first woman while she slept alongside her young son at her Newton Heath home at about 04:40 BST.
The man then raped and attacked another mother who was with her baby at her Failsworth home at 07:00.
Trevor Lawler, 31, is wanted for questioning over both attacks.
The woman who was raped is currently in hospital where she is being treated for serious injuries. Her baby suffered no injuries.
A police spokeswoman said the man fled the first attack after he was disturbed by the victim's boyfriend.
Police believe the man was known to both women.
Det Insp Chris Flint, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "These are horrific incidents, during which the victims' children were present.
"I know people in the community will be upset this type of offence has taken place in their neighbourhood and I would like to reassure them that we have a team of experienced detectives working on the case and we are determined to catch the man responsible."
