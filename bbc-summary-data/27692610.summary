Mr Noonan said he had a sarcoma removed from his right shoulder last Wednesday.
It followed five weeks of radiotherapy in March and April at St Luke's Hospital in Dublin.
He said: "My medical team believe the treatment has gone very well and are upbeat about the prognosis. There is no damage to my shoulder muscle."
The 71-year-old said the "risk of recurrence is low".
The minister said he had first noticed a lump on his right arm in February.
Mr Noonan was discharged from the Cappagh Hospital on Saturday.
