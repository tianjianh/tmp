Global alert over 'diet drug' after Eloise Parry's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A global alert has been issued by Interpol over the "serious and imminent threat" of online diet pills which claimed the life of a Shropshire woman.

Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, took tablets which police believe included dinitrophenol, known as DNP.
The warning was initially prompted by France after a Frenchman was left critically ill having taken weight loss pills containing the toxic pesticide.
Interpol said the products were being made in "clandestine laboratories".
Miss Parry, who was a student at Glyndwr University, died at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital on 12 April and her mother, Fiona, has warned others to avoid the chemical.
Interpol has raised the alarm with forces in 190 countries after French authorities raised concerns about DNP last October and following an investigation by the World Anti-Doping Agency earlier this year.
In the Orange Notice, a public safety warning that Interpol issues, DNP was described as an "imminent threat" to consumers.
Online distributors have tried to mask its supply from customs and police officers by labelling it as the yellow spice turmeric because it looks similar, Interpol said.
A statement from the Interpol said: "Although usually sold in yellow powder or capsule form, DNP is also available as a cream.
"In addition to being produced in clandestine laboratories with no hygiene regulations, without specialist manufacturing knowledge the producers also expose consumers to an increased chance of overdose."
