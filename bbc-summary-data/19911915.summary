A 100-year-old Suffolk pier is to be demolished and rebuilt.

Suffolk Coastal District Council has approved plans from developers who want to build an entertainment and conference venue.
Restaurants, retail units and an observation tower will also feature on the pier and part of the nearby boating lake will be turned into a car park.
Designer Haydn Evans said the new-look pier could be open by as early as Easter 2014.
