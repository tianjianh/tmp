Rachel Dunn, 42, and Kevin Reynolds, 44, both from St Austell, Cornwall, and another man, died after being pulled from the sea at Mawgan Porth beach, near Newquay on Sunday.
The BBC understands the other victim was Stuart Calder, 52, from Leeds.
Witnesses said they went into the sea to help a group of young surfers in difficulty.
Four teenagers managed to get out of the water and survived.
It is believed they were caught in a rip current - a fierce stream of water rushing out to sea.
A spokesman from Mr Reynolds' employer, Prolift Access, an aerial platforms hire company, said they were "very shocked and saddened".
He said: "I offer our deepest condolences to all of Kevin's family and friends for their loss and our thoughts are with them at this most difficult time."
Eric Hanson paid tribute to his childhood friend Mr Calder, a 52-year-old knee surgeon.
He said: "He was very compassionate and very generous and a friend to all."
The beach is only patrolled by lifeguards during the summer so was not covered by any on Sunday.
Coastguards said they received "multiple 999 calls" at about 13:15 GMT and search was launched involving rescue teams from Newquay and Padstow Coastguard, RNLI lifeboats and a Royal Navy helicopter from RNAS Culdrose.
