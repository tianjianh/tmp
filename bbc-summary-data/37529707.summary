The man was driving a grey Nissan Qashqai on the A985 towards Kincardine when the bikers riding behind him started acting in a threatening manner.
The driver tried to get away from them by pulling off the main road - but the men followed him before assaulting him.
The attack took place on Toll Road in Kincardine between 14:30 and 15:00 on Thursday 22 September.
Police said the victim sustained minor injuries and it is understood that several members of the public came to his aid.
The first suspect is described as about 6ft 6in tall with a slim build. He was wearing black leathers and a full helmet with a distinctive alien design with red flashes.
The second male suspect was said to be in his 50s, about 5ft 10in tall and wearing a half helmet. He had a full beard with a grey moustache and wore small round dark glasses.
Det Sgt Kelly McEwan, based at Dunfermline CID, said: "Today I'm appealing for the assistance of the public in an effort to find these men as quickly as possible.
"This was a senseless attack that caused considerable alarm to the victim and we are determined to trace the two men responsible.
"If you were travelling in the area on Thursday, September 22nd and saw the suspects, or if you helped the victim moments after the attack, please contact police immediately."
