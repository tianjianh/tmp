[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton beat Championship strugglers Bolton Wanderers to record their fourth successive league victory.

Jamie Murphy's composed finished put Brighton in front before Emile Heskey equalised, but the Seagulls went in ahead at the break through Tomer Hemed.
Jay Spearing's low shot levelled the scores and, after Albion keeper David Stockdale made a crucial save, Beram Kayal restored Brighton's lead.
Brighton remain fourth while Bolton slip back to the bottom of the table.
Both sides wore black armbands in memory of Bolton chairman Phil Gartside, who died at the age of 63 on Wednesday, with a minute's applause from supporters in the 63rd minute.
Neil Lennon's Bolton side went into the match with the worst away record in the Championship, and are now without a win in 16 league matches on their travels this season.
The visitors had fewer clear-cut chances but Kayal's winner came moments after Stockdale had denied Wanderers winger Liam Feeney from a one-on-one.
After referee Robert Lewis was forced off with an injury, Bobby Zamora and Kayal had chances to wrap up the points before Brighton survived six minutes of second-half injury time.
Wanderers suffer a first defeat in four league games and drop a place to 24th after Charlton drew 0-0 at home to Cardiff.

"We are more or less where you`d want to be. Now we`ve got to try and win away from home.
"We are close to the top and if we have everybody fit we`ll have a fair shot at it.
"We looked as though we can score and that is very encouraging. I felt we always looked dangerous."
Bolton boss Neil Lennon:

"Against a good side like Brighton I can take a lot of good things from the performance.
"There is still a long way to go. We`ve been in decent form and we have got to put this one away.
"We`ve got some catching up to do but there`s 15 games to go; plenty of time. We must capitalise on good performances and we need to start grinding out results.
"I don`t think many would`ve given us a chance today and it gives me encouragement going forward."
