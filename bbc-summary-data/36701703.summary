Finding Dory held firm at the top of the US box office despite competition from The BFG and The Legend of Tarzan.

It is the third week in a row that Pixar's sequel to Finding Nemo has taken the number one spot.
The film took $41.9m (£31.5m) - narrowly beating its nearest competitor, The Legend of Tarzan, which took $38.1m (£28.7m).
In third place was sci-fi horror film The Purge: Election Year, which made $30.1m (£22.7m) in its opening weekend.
The estimated figures include predicted takings for Monday - a holiday in the US to mark Independence Day.
The BFG - Steven Spielberg's adaption of the Roald Dahl novel - debuted in fourth place after taking $19.6m (£14.8m).
Independence Day: Resurgence rounded off the top five, taking $16.5m (£12.4m) in its second week.
Some critics said the weekend's figures marked a disappointing start for the BFG, which stars Mark Rylance.
In an article examining why the film is not doing as well as expected, The Wrap said "Rylance is not a box office draw" despite his success at this year's Oscars.
It added: "Those huge ears, beady eyes and a wrinkled face - the BFG had to overcome its appearance to win over family audiences. Clearly the 'adoryble' baby Dory is more of a draw."
But other critics praised the film. The Wall Street Journal said: "Spielberg uses digital wizardry to throw dreams of friendship and adventure on the big screen, and what marvellous dreams they are - funny, grotesque and tender, as well as spectacular."
Finding Dory has received mostly positive reviews in the US.
Rolling Stone said: "If Finding Dory lacks the fresh surprise of its predecessor, it still brims with humour, heart and animation miracles."
