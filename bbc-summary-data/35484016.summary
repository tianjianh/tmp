It happened at St Joseph's on the Greystone Road some time between midnight and 02:00 GMT.
Roisin Tracey, the school's principal, said 50 iPads and about 30 laptops were stolen during the break-in.
She said the school was left with no option but to close for the day.
"One of the windows has been kind of ripped off and left on its hinges and another one in my office has just been completely destroyed," she said.
"We did have to close because the CSI police officers had to come in through the building and look for fingerprints and do all that kind of evidence search."
She said parents of pupils had offered to help with the clean-up of the school and it would reopen on Thursday.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the burglary to contact them.
