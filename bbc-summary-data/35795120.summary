Witness Justin Knock captured images of the base jump and said the "dangerous" move was "skilfully" done with the jumper landing on his feet.
The base jumper landed at St Thomas's Street at about 10:18 GMT, police said, adding that no-one has been arrested.
A spokesperson for The Shard said: "We are investigating an incident involving a member of the public this morning."
The 87-storey building at London Bridge stands at 1,016ft (310m).
Eyewitness Mr Knock, said: "I was buying some cheese from the store opposite St Thomas's Street and looked up and this guy was coming down with his parachute.
"It was obviously a dangerous thing to do but he pulled it off skilfully. He was coming down at speed and if he caught a draft and hit the building it would be game over really."
He and another man bundled up the parachute within seconds of landing and left the scene. Police and staff from the building arrived at the scene soon after, Mr Knock said.
