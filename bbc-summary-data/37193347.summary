A six-year-old boy was saved from drowning in a seafront lagoon by a stranger, police have said.

The child, who apparently could not swim, was paddling in The Lagoon on the Western Esplanade in Southend just before 18:00 BST on Wednesday.
He wandered into a 2m-deep section and struggled to keep afloat before disappearing under the water.
Essex Police has appealed for his rescuer, who jumped in fully clothed to pull him to safety, to come forward.
Sgt Ian Hughes said: "There is no doubt that he saved the boy from drowning and deserves to be recognised for his quick-thinking and bravery.
"Unfortunately he left the scene soon after the rescue because his own son wanted to go on a ride at Adventure Island. His clothes were soaking wet but he wanted to make sure his son had that ride."
The boy, from Peckham in south London, was checked by paramedics and was found to have made a full recovery.
