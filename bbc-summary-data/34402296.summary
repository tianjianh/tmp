The North West is set to benefit from a £45m investment in fields including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare technology.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fund - financed equally by private investors and the government - will be made available to help boost the growth of firms in the "life sciences" sector.
Cheshire's Alderley Park research hub, where drugs giant AstraZeneca cut 1,600 jobs in 2013, will host the fund.
Many firms with fewer than 250 staff will be eligible to apply for funding.
Since AstraZeneca's decision, Alderley Park has been designated a medicine research "catapult centre".
This has brought businesses, scientists and clinicians together to develop new medicines.
About 450 jobs have been created by 28 firms there.
The chief executive of Alderley Park's owners Manchester Science Partnerships, Rowena Burns, said: "Our goal is to work with our businesses to support their next stage in growth, by reducing their risks and accelerating successful innovation.
"This new fund is just part of our commitment to the region's wonderful life science entrepreneurs."
The funding will be available to life sciences firms with fewer than 250 employees and and turnover of less than €50m (£37m).
