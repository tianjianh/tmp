[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Avon and Somerset boss cleared of sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police boss has been cleared of five counts of sexual assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex chief superintendant Gary Davies was alleged to have assaulted three women in busy train carriages travelling between Taunton and Bristol between December 2015 and May 2016.
The 54-year-old left the Avon and Somerset force in 2012.
Mr Davies, of Shoreditch Road, Taunton, denied all charges and was cleared by a jury at Bristol Crown Court on Friday.
He argued the touching happened due to overcrowding on the trains.
