The 22-year-old, who reached 27th in the world rankings in July 2013, is fully fit after two injury-plagued seasons but is currently ranked 308th.
Other British players allocated wildcards are Liam Broady, Alex Ward, James Ward, Tara Moore and Katie Swan.
German Dustin Brown, who beat Rafael Nadal last year, is another wild card.
Swan, 17, qualified for the main draw at the Miami Open in March, while Hong Kong-born Moore, 23, reached the quarter-finals of the Nottingham Open at the weekend.
Daniela Hantuchova, the 33-year-old Slovakian who reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2005 but is now ranked 163, is another to receive an invitation to the Championships.
Also invited is 37-year-old Czech Radek Stepanek, a qualifier at the French Open who took Andy Murray to five sets at Roland Garros in the first round.
Six more wild cards will be announced in due course, three each in the men's and ladies' singles.
