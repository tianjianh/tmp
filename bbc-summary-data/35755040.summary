The scale of job cuts announced by Npower could help to create a "northern poorhouse", unions have said.

The energy firm earlier confirmed it is to lose 2,400 jobs in the UK by 2018.
Npower has several bases in the north, with 1,200 staff in West Yorkshire, 2,500 at Rainton Bridge near Sunderland and 500 in Peterlee, Co Durham.
It confirmed its site in Scarcroft, Leeds, which employs 672 people, would close by 2018, with plans to move staff to the nearby Limewood office.
The German-owned company has announced its Burton upon Trent site in Staffordshire is to close, with the loss of up to 200 jobs.
A spokesperson said it would reduce its current 26 sites and focus on "three regional hubs" in the North East, Yorkshire and the West Midlands.
"In terms of losses in specific sites, we are unable to give figures at this stage," the company added.
Leonie Sharp, from Unison in Yorkshire, said: "There's been no detail provided about where these 2,400 job losses will come from, who they will be, which sites will be targeted.
"It's creating awful uncertainty for our members, a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety."
The job losses come as Npower announced annual losses of €137m (£106m) compared with €227m profit in 2014.
It said the cuts would be among both its directly employed staff and contractors.
Tom Allison, regional organiser for the GMB union, said they currently had "very limited detail" on the affected areas and establishments.
He said: "The uncertainty isn't a good situation.
"We have a chancellor whose mantra is the Northern Powerhouse, I suggest the scale of these job cuts, if they do materialise in our region, this could be a northern poorhouse."
The energy firm, one of the UK's "big six" energy providers, currently employs 11,500 people in the UK, of which 6,668 are in full-time posts.
