Geraldine Newman, 51, daughter Shannon, 11 and son Shane, six, were found on Tuesday in Allerton Bywater.
The children's father, Paul Newman, 42, from Normanton, was found dead on cliffs on Anglesey the same day.
West Yorkshire Police said the case was "shocking" and are not looking for anyone else over the deaths.
A post-mortem examination found Mrs Newman died from head injuries, while the children died from stab wounds.
Det Ch Insp Warren Stevenson said: "While our investigation into the full circumstances surrounding the deaths is ongoing, we can say that this appears to have been a domestic-related incident and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with it.
"We have specially-trained officers supporting the families who are understandably distraught at the deaths of their loved ones. They have asked that they are allowed to grieve privately at what will clearly be a very difficult time for them."
The bodies were found at their home in Beeston Way shortly before 12:00 GMT.
Mrs Newman, a branch manager for Wilko in Castleford, was found downstairs while the two children were discovered upstairs.
Mr Newman was discovered on a cliff ledge at South Stack, a rocky island about 180 miles from Allerton Bywater.
Tributes have been paid to Mrs Newman and her children.
A spokesman for Wilko said the mother-of-two was a "loyal and enormously respected member of the team".
Head teachers at St Wilfrid's Catholic High School in Featherstone and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Castleford, described both children as "caring students" who would be missed by the whole community.
Friends and neighbours held a vigil outside the family home earlier and took part in a minute's silence.
More than 100 people attended the short service and said prayers and laid flowers at the scene.
