Andreas Christopheros, 29, is in a critical but stable condition after the attack at his Truro home, on Tuesday.
David Philips, 48, from Hastings in Sussex was charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and is due to appear at Truro Magistrates' Court on Monday.
A 16-year-old youth arrested on suspicion of attempted murder was released without charge.
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said Mr Christopheros was taken to Treliske Hospital with life-threatening facial injuries but has since been transferred to a specialist unit.
Mr Christopheros is listed as a director of nine companies and organises the Run To The Sun custom car event, which attracts about 100,000 car fans every year to Newquay.
He is also a director of Chase 3000, a car rally across Europe planned for 2015.
