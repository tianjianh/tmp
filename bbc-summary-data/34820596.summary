Police used tear gas and water cannon against demonstrators demanding the resignation of conservative President Park Geun-hye.
Tens of thousands of people of took part in the march, according to police.
It brought together various groups, including trade unions opposed to the president's business-friendly policies.
Others were protesting against plans to impose state-issued history schoolbooks, which they say whitewash South Korea's past dictatorships.
Many marchers chanted "Park Geun-hye, step down''. Security forces fired tear gas when some of them tried to break through police barricades as they moved towards the presidency.
Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, was elected two years ago.
She is pushing through controversial plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers.
