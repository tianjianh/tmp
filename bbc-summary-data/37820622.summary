Businesses should get ready now for the introduction of the new 12-sided pound coin, the Treasury has said.

A new website is urging firms to adapt their equipment and train their staff in preparation for the arrival of the new coin in March  2017.
All machines accepting cash, whether it's in exchange for a rail ticket or a chocolate bar, will have to be updated.
But for a six-month transitional period businesses will need to find ways to accept both the old and new coins.
After that the existing round pound coin will be phased out.
The website, hosted by the Royal Mint, suggests that businesses should check before March whether any of their cash handling equipment needs updating, and make sure machines that take payment in coins can handle both the old and the new versions.
They should also consider training their staff "on the features of the new £1 coin", it says.
The new coin is being introduced because approximately one in 30 pound coins currently in circulation is a fake, according to the Royal Mint and the new coins are designed to be harder to counterfeit.
"The new £1 coin will be the most secure of its kind in the world and its cutting-edge features will present a significant barrier to counterfeiters, reducing the cost to businesses and the taxpayer," said David Gauke, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
During the "co-circulation" period the website suggests firms should accept both coins and keep customers informed which coins their equipment can accept. Businesses may need to agree with their bank or cash in transit (CIT) provider how to return the current £1 coin and new £1 coin.
After Autumn 2017 businesses should no longer accept the existing round coin from customers and should no longer distribute it themselves. However it will still be possible to deposit the old coins at most High Street banks and the Post Office.
