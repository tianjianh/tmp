[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rachel Slater, 24, and Tim Newton, 27, from Bradford, have not been seen since setting out to climb Ben Nevis.
The couple were reported missing on Monday 15 February when they failed to return.
The search operation has been hampered by poor weather, however, Police Scotland said the current search was expected to last all day due to "very favourable conditions".
A total of 37 people are involved in the latest search which involves rescue teams from Lochaber, Oban, Dundonnel, Cairngorm and Skye as well as three search and rescue dogs with their handlers.
Climbers and walkers in the area have been asked to report any information to police.
