The 24-year-old back-rower, who signed from London Broncos in 2014 and went on to be an ever present last season, also has an option for a third year.
"George has been the model of consistency during his time at the club," said head coach Ian Watson.
"He was a key part of our squad last season and held the pack together alongside Craig Kopczak."
