[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Premiership leaders have announced pre-season dates with the Serie A team, Leicester City and Barcelona.
The match against Inter on 13 August will celebrate the 50th anniversary season of Celtic's 1967 European Cup triumph against the Italians.
The venue has yet to be confirmed, with Scottish sides having the right to opt out of early league fixtures.
Leicester, currently top of the English Premier League, will visit Celtic Park on 23 July, while the Barcelona game will take place in Dublin seven days later.
Should Celtic win a fifth successive title, they will feature in the second round of Champions League qualification, with the first leg scheduled for 12 or 13 July and second leg on the 19 or 20 July.
The first leg of the third round of qualifying would be on 26-27 July, with the play-off round beginning on 16-17 August.
