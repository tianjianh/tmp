[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council offer primary teaching tuition to staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council is offering to pay the tuition fees of staff who want to become primary school teachers in a bid to tackle a shortage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority has emailed all of its workers offering to pay their way through an 18-month diploma course at the University of Aberdeen.
They would do this while continuing in their existing job.
The council has a severe shortage of primary teachers, which has already seen it offer incentives in past years.
