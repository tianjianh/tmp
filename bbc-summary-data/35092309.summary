[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Adcock death: Doctor and nurse get suspended sentences for manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor and an agency nurse who "seriously neglected" a six-year-old boy who died in hospital have been sentenced for his manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock died of a cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary after he developed sepsis.
Doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba, 39, and nurse Isabel Amaro, 47, of Manchester, were both given a two-year term, suspended for two years.
The pair had denied manslaughter by gross negligence.
The two defendants "robbed" Jack of his chance of survival by failing to realise how seriously ill he was, prosecutors said.
Jack, who had Down's syndrome, was admitted to hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea in February 2011 but died about 11 hours later.
On the day of his death, Bawa-Garba, of Leicester, stopped performing CPR after wrongly assuming Jack was subject to a do-not-resuscitate order.

Portuguese-born Amaro, from Manchester, failed "woefully" to monitor Jack's treatment or alert colleagues when his condition deteriorated, the court heard during her trial.
Both were found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence at Nottingham Crown Court last month and both have already been suspended from their posts.
The judge told the pair that their medical careers "will come to an end".
Mr Justice Nichol told them: "Jack's life was cut short prematurely. That was a tragedy. No sentence that I pass on you will alter it.
"There was no evidence that either of you neglected Jack because you were lazy or behaved for other selfish reasons.
"You both had other patients to attend to. The problem was that neither of you gave Jack the priority which this very sick boy deserved."
Theresa Taylor, 55, another nurse involved in the boy's care, was cleared of the same charge.
In an impact statement, Jack's mother Nicky said: "Jack was neglected from the moment he entered the Leicester Royal Infirmary Children's Assessment Unit.
"I will never forgive myself for taking him there. I could have cared and looked after him better than they ever did.
"It makes me so angry to think that my son could still be here today if they had done their jobs right."
In a separate statement, Jack's father Vic said: "I wish I could forgive them but at the moment I can't and I don't know if I ever can.
"To hear their excuses has been so hard to bear. I had to watch my little man laid to rest."
Bawa-Garba said in her defence she had worked a 12-hour shift with no break and there was a lot of miscommunication in the ward.
Amaro accepted she had breached her duty of care but denied that any of her failings significantly contributed to the youngster's death.
The judge said Bawa-Garba's sentence was affected by the fact she was the sole carer for her five-year-old son, who has autism and behavioural problems.
He also said he recognised Amaro suffers from psychiatric problems that would be made worse in prison.
