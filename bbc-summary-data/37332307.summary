Fifty-five people have been arrested after an eight-hour armed protest at a temple in what is believed to be a row over mixed marriages.

Police said a group of men - some with bladed weapons - entered the Gurdwara Sahib in Leamington Spa at 06:45 BST.
A former treasurer at the Warwickshire temple said a marriage between a Sikh and non-Sikh was due to take place.
Jatinder Singh Birdi said mixed marriages had been a contentious issue in the local Sikh community.
Officers remain inside the temple on Tachbrook Drive and a police cordon is in place outside.
Supt David Gardner said the protest was being treated as "an aggravated trespass" from "the escalation of a local dispute". He said a "significant number of bladed weapons" were seized, but no injuries were reported.
"Over the coming days we will be working with the local Sikh community to address some of the ongoing issues that have culminated in today's events," he added.
Mr Birdi said: "There have been tensions that have been going on for a couple of years with some people objecting to mixed marriages in taking place in the gurdwara.
"The general consensus is people are respectful of mixed marriages if the traditions are respected.
"Nothing has happened on this level before.
"This is meant to be one of the happiest moments of somebody's life - it shows a lack of respect."
Mixed marriages taking place at Sikh temples in the UK have been disrupted by protestors.
The Sikh Council has argued the marriage ceremony, known as Anand Karaj, should be reserved only for Sikhs. Last year it also called for a halt to protests.
