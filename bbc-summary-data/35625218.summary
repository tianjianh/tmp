A campaign calling for a war memorial to be built in Bristol has been backed by the Sikh community.

An estimated 83,000 Sikhs lost their lives in World War One and about 109,000 were seriously wounded.
During World War One Sikhs made up 20% of the British Indian Army in action, despite being less than 2% of the Indian population at the time.
The mayor and the city council have been asked to support plans for a memorial commemorating their sacrifice.
Calls were originally led by Labour councillor Ron Stone, who died in December. Labour councillor Steve Pearce and Bristol's Sikh community have taken on the campaign.
Mr Pearce said: "The service and sacrifice Sikh soldiers made during the two world wars and past conflicts should never be forgotten."
Dilawer Singh, from the city's Sikh community, said: "Tens of thousands of Sikh troops lost their lives fighting for Britain in World War One and it is important that we as a city commemorate them."
Up to 10,000 Sikhs are believed to live in Bristol.
A national war memorial in honour of Sikh soldiers was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire last year.
