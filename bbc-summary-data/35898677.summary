Flares were set off before kick-off outside the club's Brunton Park stadium and later inside the ground, one of which was thrown into the crowd.
Cumbria Police said the two males were charged with a public order offence and bailed until 6 April.
The 31 January fourth round tie ended with a 3-0 win for Everton.
A force spokesman added that an 18-year-old man remained on bail in relation to alleged racist chanting at the same game.
