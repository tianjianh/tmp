Scotland's largest graffiti art project under way in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first stage of what will become Scotland's largest street art project has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 60 street and graffiti artists will team up at Edinburgh's New Waverley construction site to produce one of the largest public artworks of its kind in the UK.
It will combine permanent art with "an ever-changing tableau of graffiti art".
The Canongate Plot's first stage at The Arches is inspired by fireworks and Bonfire Night.
The artists began spraypainting on Sunday with the first stage due for completion on Monday.
The project is spearheaded by Work In Progress Edinburgh (WIPE), a community arts partnership made up of local residents and artists.
