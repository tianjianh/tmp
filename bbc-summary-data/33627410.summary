Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has released a 'dog walking code' to ensure owners show respect and consideration for the countryside and other people.
It includes keeping dogs under control, bagging and throwing away dog poo and not letting dogs chase wildlife.
Rhian Jardine of NRW said they hope dog owners will show "respect and sensitivity" towards places and people.
NRW says it has developed the new code in partnership with organisations such as the Kennel Club, Ramblers Cymru, the National Trust and farming unions.
Stephen Jenkinson, Kennel Club Access adviser, said: "We are so pleased Natural Resources Wales and partners recognise the many social and health benefits of dog walking, alongside the need to reduce any problems for farm animals, wildlife or other visitors.
"Off-lead exercise is vital for happy, healthy dogs, and this code really helps walkers when leads are essential, such as when they are around livestock."
