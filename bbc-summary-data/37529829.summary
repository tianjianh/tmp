Allardyce left his role after the Daily Telegraph claimed he told undercover reporters posing as businessmen how to "get around" player transfer rules.
Frenchman Arsene Wenger, who manages Arsenal, and Tottenham's Argentine boss Mauricio Pochettino have said they would be open to taking the job.
"We have to be managed by an English person," Shearer told Football Focus.
Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn has said he is not "wedded to the fact" Allardyce's replacement has to be English.
He added Wenger, 66, would "fit the criteria perfectly".

Shearer, who scored 30 goals in 63 appearances for England, believes the FA needs to better utilise players who have recently retired from international football.
The 46-year-old believes they can provide valuable guidance on "what has gone wrong in previous years".
"We've got to try and find ways to incentivise our former international players who are coming towards the end of their careers to stay in the game," he said.
"A lot of them now are multi-millionaires so there is no incentive for them to stay in the game.
"We've got to try to find a way to keep Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand in the game."
