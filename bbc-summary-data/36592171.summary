[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire are in line for their first Championship home win since 2014 after forcing Worcestershire to follow on.

Pacemen Ben Cotton (4-28) and Tony Palladino (4-30) shared most of the wickets as the visitors were bowled out for 164, before making 24-1 second time around for the loss of Daryl Mitchell.
Resuming on 319-3, Derbyshire finally declared on 467-5 after home skipper Billy Godleman's maiden double century.
His 204 was backed by New Zealand batsman Neil Broom, who made 93.
It was the second time in a month that Broom has been out in the nineties on this ground but, despite the loss of the entire first day, he and skipper Godleman have helped put Derbyshire in a potentially winning position.
The Derby wicket suddenly looked a different proposition when the visitors batted after lunch under the floodlights as they slumped to 18-5, Cotton taking 3-0 in six balls, before a stand of 66 between Ben Cox (40) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (29).
Ninth-wicket pair Matt Henry (31) and Ed Barnard (28) held up Worcestershire's expected follow-on with a stand of 55.
When they did bat again, Cotton quickly struck to remove out-of-form captain Mitchell for the second time in successive sessions, caught in the gully, as his side ended the day needing 279 runs to avoid a final-day innings defeat.
Derbyshire fast bowler Ben Cotton:
"It was great to see Billy get 200. We knew we had a good platform and it was our job to make early inroads.
"The early wickets set us up and we just kept going from there. We were relentless with the ball. There was just a fraction of movement off the wicket.
"When the lights are on the ball seems to go through a little bit more and that's why we got a little bit more bounce but we don't scientifically know why.
"That wicket before the close sets us up for tomorrow. We only have to take nine wickets to win the game."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We had one of those days where we didn't apply ourselves. If that happens, you lose your wickets.
"But I don't want to be too critical because they've played really well this year and scored plenty of runs and everyone is entitled to a bad day.
"When you have fielded for that length of time while you are probably not physically feeling tired you are mentally not as sharp as you could be. I call that batting tired.
"But take nothing away from the Derby bowlers. They bowled really well. They were nice and fresh and had a new ball in their hand and a big score under their belts so you tend to run in with a real zest."
