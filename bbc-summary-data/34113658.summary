Waiting time performance figures for Scotland's accident and emergency (A&E) departments in July were the best in two years, new figures show.

Official NHS statistics showed 95.8% of all patients were seen and either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.
This was the best monthly performance since the same period in 2013.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said the latest figures were "extremely promising".
But she warned that more would need to be done to achieve the target in the busier winter period.
The figures showed that activity at A&E departments was at its lowest level for July in the past five years, with staff dealing with 131,948 cases.
Ms Robison said: "NHS staff have been working extremely hard to cut waiting times and deliver a first-class service, and the figures published today are testament to this."
She added: "We want to see long-term, sustainable change put in place in order to maintain this high level of performance during peaks and troughs of demand."
