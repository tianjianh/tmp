Sheeran will be seen singing with children in Liberia in a film to be shown on the BBC charity fundraising programme on 24 March.
The chart-topper said: "I'll never forget the kids I met on this trip. When we sang together.
"They were in such high spirits despite everything they'd been through."
Many of the children Sheeran met at the Street Child Liberia project in the capital of Monrovia had been orphaned by the recent Ebola outbreak.
He added: "It was an incredibly eye-opening experience and I'm really proud to support Comic Relief and see what they are doing to help these children have a better future."
Professor Hawking will lend his voice to a digital comic strip game, alongside stars including Nick Grimshaw, Lenny Henry, Katie Price and Joe Sugg.
Professor Hawking said: "I'm a world-renowned scientist who has shaped our understanding of the universe and I am being asked to make snot jokes. I must really like this charity."
He will star as one of nine red noses becoming characters in the game, to be shown on rednoseday.com.
Comedians French and Saunders, Vic and Bob and Brendan O'Carroll (aka Mrs Brown) are among those also taking part.
Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins will host new show Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief as part of the Red Nose Day broadcast, which sees celebrities perform pop hits.
Red Nose Day raises money for the charity Comic Relief, which helps those in poverty both in the UK and across the world.
This year's Red Nose Day will take place on 24 March and will be broadcast live on the BBC.
