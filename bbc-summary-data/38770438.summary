Thanet Offshore Wind Farm extension 'will double electricity'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thirty-four giant wind turbines are being proposed for the Thanet Offshore Wind Farm, which would double the amount of power it produces.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The site currently has 100 turbines, and would be able to generate enough electricity to supply 430,000 homes.
The new, larger, turbines are planned for the edges of the existing farm.
Energy firm Vattenfall, which operates three offshore wind farms off the Kent coast, plans to apply for planning permission at the beginning of 2018.
The wind farm is located about  7.4 miles (12km) from the shore at Margate.

It has been operating for six years and has produced enough renewable energy to power around 220,000 UK homes per year.
The nearest turbine of the 34 planned will be situated about 4.9 miles (8km) from the coastline, but Vattenfall said there would be no noticeable difference from the shore.
Andy Paine, head of offshore UK wind development, said the additional ones would produce the same amount of electricity as those currently in use.
The company has been holding public information days, with the final one taking place at Cliffsend Village Hall on Saturday.
