Plans for 130 homes in Meliden set for go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Controversial plans for a development of 130 homes in Meliden, Denbighshire, look set to get the go-ahead despite objections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Penrhyn Homes want to build on land at Mindale Farm, off Ffordd Hendre after demolishing farm buildings.
Prestatyn Town Council is among the objectors, concerned local roads could not cope with extra traffic.
Denbighshire council's planning committee is recommended to approve the scheme at its meeting on Wednesday.
