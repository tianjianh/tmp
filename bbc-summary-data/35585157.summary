[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sale Sharks fly-half Danny Cipriani has agreed a deal to rejoin former club Wasps from next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cipriani, 28, will return to his first professional club after four seasons at fellow Premiership side Sale.
He has made 65 appearances for the Sharks - who currently lie seventh in the league - scoring 502 points.
Cipriani, who spent the 2011-12 season at Australian side Melbourne Rebels, has won 14 caps for England but missed out on the squad for the Six Nations.
Wasps, who have relocated to Coventry since Cipriani last played for them in 2010, are fourth in the Premiership.
Cipriani played 95 times for Wasps before leaving for the Rebels and says he returns a more mature individual.
"I'm excited about returning to Wasps next season. For me, it really does feel like coming home," Cipriani told the club's official website.
"I have such good memories of that period in my life, I feel much more equipped to handle and deal with the expectation that comes when you put on the black and gold jersey.
"'Once a Wasp, always a Wasp' is more than just a saying when you've been part of the club and I feel next season will be the right time for a new challenge, at a club which in my heart will always feel like a second home."
