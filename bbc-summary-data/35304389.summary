Arlene Arkinson: Former RUC detective Eric Anderson summonsed to hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former senior RUC detective is to be summonsed to appear at a preliminary hearing on the inquest into the death of Arlene Arkinson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-year-old from Castlederg disappeared after a night out in County Donegal in 1994.
Former Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson is to be asked to attend in what the coroner described as a "belt and braces" approach.
Arlene's body has never been found.
It is believed she was murdered by convicted child killer and rapist Robert Howard, who died in custody last year.
The inquest into her death has been delayed a number of times.
