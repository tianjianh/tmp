Cardiff Blues hope to have wing Alex Cuthbert back after injury for their Pro12 trip to Munster on Friday.

Cuthbert has not played since March because of heel and knee injuries, missing Wales' tour of New Zealand.
Wales captain Sam Warburton and forward Josh Turnbull return after sitting out the 34-16 win over Edinburgh and scrum-half Lloyd Williams may be involved.
"The players we have available next week shows what we are slowly building," coach Danny Wilson said.
Former Ulster number eight Nick Williams won the man of the match award against Edinburgh while Wales utility back Matthew Morgan made his debut off the bench.
Former Scarlets fly-half Steve Shingler scored a try in an impressive 15 point debut, while ex Scarlet colleagues George Earle and Kirby Myhill also started, though Myhill went off with a knee injury.
Head coach Danny Wilson welcomes the increased competition for early-season places.
"Sam Warburton will be available next week, it is a position of strength for us, Josh Turnbull will also be back for us," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"So we will have to select from Josh Navidi, Nick Williams, Ellis Jenkins, Sam Warburton and Josh Turnbull.
"If we can get that [squad depth] in all positions, fantastic, but in that one there is great competition which is good for us and Wales."
Fly-half Shingler moved from Parc y Scarlets as Blues man Rhys Patchell made the journey in the opposition direction.
He faces a battle for the number ten shirt with Gareth Anscombe and Wales under 20 cap Jarrod Evans, with Matthew Morgan also capable of playing there.
Shingler has welcomed the fresh start at the Arms Park and feels the region are on the up.
"I am enjoying every minute of the Blues so far, there are no negatives," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I think we are on the rise a little bit. It is a new lease of life for myself, Danny [Wilson] is very positive and it's a positive place to be.
"I am enjoying my time here."
