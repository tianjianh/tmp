County Championship: Leicestershire's Neil Dexter makes century at New Road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Dexter maintained his good form since moving to Leicestershire with a third County Championship century of the summer at New Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After being dismissed for just 43 when beaten on their own ground by Worcestershire in May, Dexter did most to ensure there would be no repeat.
He hit 109 out of his side's 299-7 after Leicestershire had chosen to bat, having won the toss.
He was well backed by Angus Robson (50) and Ned Eckersley, unbeaten on 40,
Former Middlesex batsman Dexter's century was his second in succession after making 136 against Gloucestershire last week.
Ed Barnard was Worcestershire's most successful bowler, taking 3-49, including an impressive first spell.
The hosts included Tom Fell for the first time since making 171 against Middlesex here last September, following the Worcestershire batsman's recovery from two forms of cancer.
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was an even day. We were a little bit disappointed with the first two sessions. We just couldn't seem to make any inroads.
"It was hard work for them to be fair, but it was quite a flat pitch. We thought it might have had a little bit more in it.
"But that last session showed we kept to our task and got some rewards.
Leicestershire batsman Neil Dexter told BBC Radio Leicester:
"Obviously I was delighted to get past three figures again. However, in saying that, I was disappointed that I got out when I did. I had done the hard work until then and things were just starting to get a little bit easier.
"Credit to them, they stuck at it well. It's always good to score three figures but I've been wanting to get that really big one. That made it disappointing to get out when I had that chance to go big.
"There haven't been too many demons in the pitch, maybe a few that have gone lower."
