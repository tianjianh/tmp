Carlisle United 3-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Late goals by Shaun Miller and Charlie Wyke earned Carlisle United a sensational 3-2 comeback win over Exeter City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Reuben Reid and Lee Holmes looked to have earned League Two strugglers Exeter the points after Wyke had equalised for Carlisle early on.
But substitute Miller finally got the home side back on level terms again with his 89th-minute strike before Wyke won it deep into added time.
There was a dramatic start to the game as Reid gave Exeter the lead after just 40 seconds, holding off Shaun Brisley inside the area to squeeze the ball past goalkeeper Mark Gillespie.
However it did not take Carlisle long to draw level, Wyke getting in at the near post in the 10th minute to power a header past Christy Pym from Danny Grainger's cross for his seventh goal of the season.
Carlisle were then caught napping by a ball from the right that ran across the six-yard line to Holmes who was on hand to slot the ball home and restore City's led in the 54th minute.
But the Cumbrians threw all their attacking options forward and Miller got on the end of a ball from Nicky Adams to head past Pym.
Wyke thrashed the ball home from close in to make it 3-2 in the seventh minute of added time - but there was still time for Jamie Devitt to be sent off for a foul, his second yellow card.
