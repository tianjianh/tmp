Alec Stewart says he has been approached by the England and Wales Cricket Board as part of its search for a new national director of cricket.

The former England captain, 52, told BBC Sport he had been sent a "skeleton job description" of the role.
Surrey director of cricket Stewart added: "It would be rude and wrong not to listen.
"Then you just sit back and see if you are the right person for the job and whether the ECB thinks you are."
The ECB created the new role leading the England team as part of a restructure which followed the departure in April of managing director Paul Downton.
Stewart's fellow former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss have also expressed an interest in the position.
Asked whether the job is appealing, Stewart said: "Potentially, if everything is flexible. But I am not going to sit here and say I want the job; I am going to do the job."
Stewart, who played a record 133 Tests for England, said the ECB "needs to decide what the job is going to look like".
He added: "They should then go to the person and say: 'We believe you are the right person for the job. Do you want it?'"
Job descriptions have been sent by the ECB to a number of candidates, with an appointment expected to be made by the end of the summer.
