Kelly Brewster, 32, from Sheffield, was among 22 people who died in the suicide bomb attack at a pop concert at Manchester Arena in May.
Hundreds of people attended the fund-raising event at the Sheffield Works Department Sports and Social Club.
Money raised is to go to the We Love Manchester appeal.
Ian Winslow, Kelly's partner, writing in the match programme, said: "Today is about remembering Kelly Brewster, such a caring, loving and beautiful young lady who had everything to live for."
The couple had recently put a deposit down on a new home and were planning to start a family.
Ms Brewster, a former City School pupil, who worked for Irwin Mitchell Solicitors and insurance company Aviva, had been to the Ariana Grande concert with her sister, Claire Booth, and her sister's 11-year-old daughter.
Her uncle Paul Dryhurst said she had "heroically shielded" her niece from the blast in the foyer.
Manchester City Council launched the We Love Manchester appeal in partnership with the British Red Cross to support those affected by the attack.
