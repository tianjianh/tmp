New Newport County manager Terry Butcher has made his first signings since taking over the Exiles.

Welsh goalkeeper Rhys Taylor, 25, and defender Scott Barrow, 26, have both signed from Macclesfield.
Striker Lenell John-Lewis, 26, joins County from Grimsby Town on a two-year deal.
"All three players have been excited by our plans, and about the type of players we are planning to bring in," said Butcher.
Fifteen players have left the club since Butcher took over as manager in April.
The former England captain says talks are "progressing to an advanced" with other targets and he hopes to announce a couple more additions next week.
John-Lewis scored 18 goals for Grimsby in 48 appearance in 2014-15, including the Mariners' goal in their Conference play-off final defeat against Bristol Rovers at Wembley.
Butcher told the County website: "I watched Lenell play [at Wembley]... he's a player who has been impressive all season, he's scored a good number of goals and has great energy levels.
"He works hard, is strong on the ball and can lead the line well. He gets goals and that's what we're after... and he makes goals for other players, I'm really excited by him."
Former Wales Under-21 Taylor, who started his career in Chelsea's youth side, kept 18 clean sheets in 46 matches for Macclesfield last season.
Butcher hopes the Neath-born goalkeeper will provide strong competition for former Peterborough shot stopper Joe Day.
"We have two quality keepers with Joe Day already here. There should be a really good contest between the two for the number one position," said the former Coventry and Sunderland manager.
"I always want excellent competition and camaraderie between the keepers. It means the keepers need to be on their toes all the time, they need to stay on their game all season, I have the feeling it will be a fascinating contest between the pair."
Fellow Welshman Barrow has also left the Silkmen for Newport.
"Scott is a very good defender who is comfortable on the ball," said Butcher.
"He's got a sweet left foot and scored a couple of great goals last season.
"He's a hard working lad who just wants to play."
