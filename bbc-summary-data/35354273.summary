Some images showing suspects allegedly stealing bikes and vandalising cars were recorded in Clifton, Nottingham, on residents' own CCTV cameras.
They claim they resorted to social media because police "aren't bothered".
Nottinghamshire Police warned if events escalated away from social media, people ran the risk of arrest.

There have been about a dozen posts from residents, detailing alleged shed break-ins, bag and bike thefts, as well as criminal damage.
Lucci Del-Gaudio is one of a number of people who has posted on the closed Clifton Community Group.
Mr Del-Gaudio uploaded CCTV images of people he believed stole two of his children's scooters, estimated to be worth Â£400.
"I had a full CCTV image of the guy's face and I took it to the police in Clifton that same evening but there was no officer to see me, " Mr Del-Gaudio said.
He said he posted the images on Facebook and within hours he had messages and the post was viewed 5,000 times.
"Every single day, for the last 14 to 15 days, something's been stolen in Clifton," he said.
"That's why the residents are doing this, because the police aren't getting their finger out."
Mr Del-Gaudio, who insists no posts have named would-be thieves, also said there was a lack of police patrols in the area.
A police spokesman said the force had "excellent community relations" in Clifton.
"If a crime is not reported, then we cannot respond," he said.
"If members of the public decide to take the law into their own hands then they risk the possibility of being arrested themselves."
