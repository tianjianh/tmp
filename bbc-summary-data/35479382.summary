In a tight contest, the Giants took the lead in the second period with a goal from Mike Wilson but it was soon cancelled out by Zack Fitzgerald.
The game's winning goal came with 54 seconds remaining in overtime when Jonathan Phillips beat Giants goalie Stephen Murphy.
The sides will meet again in the Elite League on Saturday night in Sheffield.
The Giants then travel to take on Cardiff on Sunday in the first leg of the Challenge Cup semi-final.
There were few chances in a scoreless first period in Tuesday's match as both sides, coming off two losses each at the weekend, were content to try an force the other into mistakes.
The deadlock was eventually broken with 8:43 remaining in the second period.
A solid fore checking shift by the Giants forced a Steelers turnover and a Colin Shields bullet pass through the slot picked out defenceman Wilson who had a open net to shoot at.
The home side weren't ahead for long, however.
Murphy had already made three big saves to deny the Steelers before Fitzgerald pinched in from the blue line and was picked out by Jason Hewitt's pass to tie the game at 1-1.
The game opened up in the final 20 minutes and both sides had periods of pressure and chances to edge ahead, but the game would head to five-minutes of sudden death overtime.
It was a mistake by the Giants defence behind their own net that resulted in a turnover by Levi Nelson and his pass found Phillips who scored from close-range.
