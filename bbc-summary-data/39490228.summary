Liverpool's Sadio Mane will miss Wednesday's match with Bournemouth, but Jurgen Klopp says it is "possible" the Senegal forward could be ruled out for the rest of the Premier League season.

Mane, 24, had to be taken off after suffering a knee injury in Saturday's 3-1 home victory over Everton.
There were reports that Mane, a Â£34m signing from Southampton last summer, might miss the rest of the campaign.
But manager Klopp said: "It is not 100% clear. We have to wait a bit."
When asked if the injury would be "season-ending", the German added: "Unfortunately it is possible. But why should I say that now?
"The only thing I can say for sure is he will not be available for tomorrow. The knee is swollen and we have to wait for the final assessment."
However, England striker Daniel Sturridge is available to play against the Cherries at Anfield.
The 27-year-old has not featured since 4 February, but Klopp said: "Sturridge is back in training and is a good option. Probably he can be in the squad."
Liverpool are already without attacking midfielder Adam Lallana, who was ruled out for up to a month after injuring a thigh on England duty in March.
