Bolt helped Jamaica land 4x100m relay gold, having already won the 100m and 200m individual titles, to match his feats at Beijing 2008 and London 2012.
British showjumper Nick Skelton, 58, and the women's hockey team added to GB's gold tally on day 14 of the Games.
Lutalo Muhammad also won a taekwondo silver, while there was a bronze for Britain's women's 4x100m relay team.
With two days of competition left, GB now have 60 medals in total, five short of the 65 won at the London Games in 2012.
Bolt, 29, has said the Rio Games will be his final Olympics as he plans to retire from the sport after the 2017 World Championships.
He signs off having won all nine Olympic finals in which he has appeared.
Bolt has claimed gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016.
"There you go, I'm the greatest," he said afterwards.
Former Olympic 1500m silver medallist Steve Cram, who was commentating for BBC Sport, agreed Bolt was the "greatest ever".
"We are all privileged to have been here throughout his career and watched his Olympic performances," added the the Briton.
Sprinter Allyson Felix also created history by becoming the first woman to collect five gold medals in athletics.
She was part of the USA's victorious 4x100m relay team after winning silver in the 400m earlier in the Games.
The 30-year-old can make it six golds in the 4x400m relay final on Saturday.
Earlier on Friday, Britain won a first women's hockey gold as 58-year-old show jumper Skelton became their oldest Olympic champion in 108 years.
The double success took Team GB's tally to 24 gold medals, consolidating second place in the table behind the United States but ahead of China.
Muhammad, 25, was unable to add a 25th after an agonising last-second defeat against Ivory Coast's Cheick Sallah Cisse.
The women's 4x100m relay team won GB's first medal in the event since 1984, claiming bronze as the United States retained their title.
Boxers Nicola Adams and Joe Joyce could add two more golds when they fight in their respective gold-medal bouts on the final weekend.
Athlete Mo Farah, who is already the 10,000m champion, runs in the 5,000m on Saturday, while diver Tom Daley competes in the men's 10m platform.
Britain's Olympic achievements are to be celebrated with events in Manchester and London, Prime Minister Theresa May has announced.

Team GB have now landed gold medals on 10 of the 14 days so far in Brazil following the success of Skelton and the women's hockey team.
Skelton is the oldest medallist at Rio 2016 - and the oldest ever in Olympic equestrian history - after winning the individual event in his seventh Games.
He had initially retired 16 years ago after breaking his neck in two places, only to change his mind and then win gold at London 2012 in the team event.
Skelton said winning gold had "capped" his career. "I always knew in the back of my mind that I could do it," he added.

Several hours after his victory, Britain's women added another gold by beating the Netherlands, the reigning world and Olympic champions.
The game finished 3-3 in normal time and went to a dramatic penalty shootout.
Britain won 2-0 to improve on their bronze medal at London 2012.
"This is what we dreamed of and now we've got it," said GB forward Nicola White. "No-one can ever take that away from us."
