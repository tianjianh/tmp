Garry Newlove killer's appeal dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who kicked to death a father-of-three outside his Warrington home has lost a bid to challenge his conviction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Cunliffe's application for permission to appeal was thrown out at the Court of Appeal.
The 18-year-old, who attended the proceedings, was one of three teenagers jailed for the murder of Garry Newlove.
He was told that no arguable grounds had been raised which could affect the safety of the verdict.
Mr Newlove, a 47-year-old salesman who had overcome stomach cancer, was beaten to death after confronting vandals outside his home in 2007.
He suffered massive head injuries in the attack, which was witnessed by his daughters, and died two days later in hospital.
Cunliffe, formerly of Warrington, was found guilty of murder by a jury at Chester Crown Court in January 2008.
He was 16 at the time of conviction and is serving a minimum term of 12 years.
Mr Newlove had left his home to remonstrate with the teenagers about vandalism to vehicles where he lived when he was set upon.
Ringleader Adam Swellings, of Crewe, Cheshire, lost an appeal in November 2008 against his conviction and his 17-year sentence.
Co-accused Stephen Sorton, of Warrington, appealed at the same time against his 15-year minimum term, which was reduced to 13 years.
Mr Newlove's murder sparked outrage and a national debate about Britain's yob culture.
His wife, Helen Newlove, has just recently been made a Conservative peer in the House of Lords for her campaigning to stop alcohol-fuelled violence.
