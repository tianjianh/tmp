Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte and ex-chief executive Charles Green have been arrested as part of an inquiry into the "alleged fraudulent acquisition" of the club in 2012.

Mr Green was charged after arriving at Livingston police station.
Mr Whyte later attended a police station in Glasgow and was detained in custody.
A third man, former Rangers co-administrator David Whitehouse, was earlier arrested in England.
All three men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sherriff Court on Wednesday.
Craig Whyte, 44, took over Rangers in May 2011. The club entered administration the following year.
Charles Green led the consortium which bought Rangers assets in 2012 following the club's liquidation.
But he stepped down from Rangers a year later following allegations that he was working in conjunction with Craig Whyte.
A police spokesman said: "Police Scotland can confirm a 44-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with an ongoing investigation into an alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers FC in 2012.
"A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal."
An earlier police statement said a 62-year-old man had been arrested and detained over the same investigation.
Arriving at the police station on Tuesday morning, Mr Green, 62, said: "I've been invited to attend an interview with Police Scotland. I have done that on a number of occasions in the past."
Asked why he was there, Mr Green replied: "Well, one of the difficulties with today is my legal people had asked Police Scotland to provide us information that we're likely to be questioned on and they wouldn't provide that so I'm at a loss really."
David Whitehouse, 50, who worked for administrators Duff and Phelps, had earlier been arrested in connection with the 2012 acquisition.
Police said in a statement: "Following a Police Scotland operation on Tuesday, a 50-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers FC in 2012.
"Around 6am officers from Police Scotland's economic crime unit, assisted by officers from Cheshire, attended at an address in England and detained the 50-year-old man.
"He has now been arrested and is presently detained in police custody."
