[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 4-1 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Hogan scored two first-half goals in Aston Villa's convincing EFL Cup second-round triumph against Wigan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hogan steered Albert Adomah's cross past Jamie Jones from close range to set Villa on their way, as both sides changed their entire starting XIs.
Adomah volleyed home to double the lead and though Ryan Colclough got Wigan on the scoresheet with a run and low shot, Hogan restored Villa's two-goal lead.
The hosts confirmed victory when Birkir Bjarnason converted from close range.
Defeat ended the Latics' 100% start to the season, which sees them top League One, while Steve Bruce's side have now scored four goals in consecutive matches.
