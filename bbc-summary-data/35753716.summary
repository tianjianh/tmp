[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McGuigan has been chairman of the Shrimps for 16 years, and oversaw the club's relocation from Christie Stadium to the Globe Arena in 2010.
Morecambe are 18th in League Two, 11 points clear of the relegation zone.
"I feel the time is right for a new owner to take the club forward and build on a strong platform that exists today," McGuigan said in a statement.
"At present we are looking for expressions of interests from individuals who have the financial ability to take this club further."
Morecambe, who McGuigan confirmed were "virtually debt-free", have been in League Two ever since they beat Exeter City at Wembley nine years ago to win promotion to the Football League.
