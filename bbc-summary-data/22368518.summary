The former England midfielder, 37, joined PSG in January until the end of the season and has played 12 matches.
Beckham's side are nine points clear at the top of Ligue 1 with four games left, and Clement praised his impact.
"He's been a breath of fresh air. The club have made it clear that they'd like him to stay," he said.
Beckham was sent off in PSG's 1-0 win over Evian at the weekend after only six minutes on the pitch.

But despite the red card, fellow Englishman Clement - who also worked under PSG coach Carlo Ancelloti at Chelsea - said Beckham had made a real impact during his time in the French capital.
"Everyone was excited when they knew he was coming because he had a fantastic rep as a pro and a man, and great quality on the field still," Clement told beIN Sport.
"He gets on with everyone - first out to training, the last one back in, a real enthusiasm for the game.
"You know after 20 years of playing at the top level, he still loves his football and hopefully he'll be able to continue for a little bit longer.
"He's made it clear that's he's going to have a think about it at the end of the season, talk to his family, see how his body feels.
"If he feels fresh I'm sure he'll continue."
