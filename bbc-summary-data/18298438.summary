Terror suspect first to be charged under new TPim law

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspected terrorist has been charged with breaching conditions imposed as part of the government's new terror monitoring powers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPim).
The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January.
The Home Office has refused to comment on the case.
TPims replaced control orders in January 2012.
The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March.
The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim.
The Home Office said: "We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable."
Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day.
Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad.
Labour has argued that TPims have "weakened" public protection against terrorism.
In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only.
The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order.
The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station.
BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons.
The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing.
The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim.
A trial date was not set.
