Captain Mark Cosgrove has also been banned for one game after the incident against Loughborough MCCU last month.
The points deduction and fine come after Leicestershire incurred a fifth fixed penalty in 12 months.
The club also have a further eight-point penalty suspended for 12 months.
Fast-medium pace bowler Shreck, 39, who has been suspended by Leicestershire for two games, was found guilty at a disciplinary hearing held at Grace Road on Friday for "using language that is obscene, offensive or insulting and/or making an obscene gesture".
Cosgrove, who was handed the one-match ban as he was captain of Leicestershire for each of the five incidents in the past year, is set to serve his suspension in the Championship match against Glamorgan, starting on 21 April.
The captain pleaded guilty to the charges.
"We've got to get better be be more disciplined - 16 points is a big deal to us. It's a game," Cosgrove told BBC Radio Leicester.
"Hopefully we can get some positive points on the board. This hurts the boys. We need to learn and get better.
"Charlie is very disappointed and very apologetic. He overstepped the mark. He knows he did the wrong thing.
"We've just got to take it and move on and get busy into the season."
In August 2015, Leicestershire were deducted 16 points and given a suspended fine for similar breaches.
In a statement from the cricket discipline commission on Friday, it was "noted that actions taken by the club since the previous disciplinary panel hearing have not been effective".
