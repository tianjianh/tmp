The 28-year-old was arrested following an investigation by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC).
Two other men and a woman were also charged with supplying cocaine for "personal use or to on-supply cocaine to friends and colleagues".
Hunt has played elite-level rugby league, Australian rules football (AFL) and rugby union.
Hunt - who is due to appear in Southport Magistrate Court on 5 March - was not named by the CCC but local media have named him as the 28-year old man arrested.
He was arrested on Thursday night, just days after playing for the Queensland Reds rugby team.
"The CCC will allege that during an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in South East Queensland, these four individuals were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine," a statement said.
It is alleged the offences occurred between June and December 2014 when Hunt was playing AFL for the Gold Coast Suns.
Hunt rose to prominence playing fullback for the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team in 2004, and was selected for Queensland State of Origin and Australian representative squads.
He made a code-switch to AFL with the Gold Coast Suns in 2009.
Hunt played with the team until 2014 when he made a switch to rugby union.
Facing charges with Hunt are a 24-year-old man from Burleigh Waters, a 27-year-old man from Mermaid Waters and a 22-year-old woman from Mermaid Waters.
