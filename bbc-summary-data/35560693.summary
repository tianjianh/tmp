[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Elder, 63, of Brodie in Moray, was accused of grabbing the woman's breast at Inverness Ice Centre.
It was claimed that he did this to distract the woman's husband from his last shot in a curling bonspiel.
He denied the assault, which happened last February, but was convicted after a trial at Inverness Sheriff Court.
Sentencing Elder, Sheriff Chris Dickson said: "This must have been an unpleasant and upsetting experience for your victim.
"But I am pleased to see from the background report that you have expressed regret.
"In view of the fact that it is unlikely you will re-offend, I can deal with it by a community payback order whereby you will remain under supervision to promote your rehabilitation."
