Odeon charges extra pound to see top films

Going to your local cinema is not a cheap night in 2014 - and the number of people paying out is falling.

Now, if you want to see the latest Hollywood blockbuster it's just got a little more expensive.
Odeon cinemas have begun charging you more to see high profile films.
A pound has been added to tickets for top releases. Currently Interstellar, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies carry the new price tag.
Odeon say it's all part of the firm's flexible pricing policy and that ticket prices vary on things like location, time of day and what film you want to see.
An Odeon spokesperson told Newsbeat:"We offer guests a wide choice of films and entertainment and a flexible pricing policy.
"This gives our guests plenty of choice and the opportunity to enjoy discounts during quieter periods, for example we offered 40% off to many guests during September and October, and all price options are clearly listed in our cinemas and online.''
The average cost of a cinema ticket in the UK is currently £6.54 - an increase of 18.5% compared to five years ago. But that sounds a bit cheap doesn't it?
That's because the figure is worked out by dividing box office profits by the number of tickets sold, so it includes special deals like buy-one-get-one-free and daytime discounts.
Latest figures from the British Film Institute show monthly cinema admissions are already down 10% in 2014 compared to last year.
Newsbeat called an Odeon in Derby. Watching J-Law in The Hunger Games there costs around £10, while one of this year's big Oscar contenders Mr Turner is a pound cheaper.
In Richmond, in south west London, a ticket for the Hunger Games would set you back £13.50 which is a pound more than The Imitation Game.
The claim is that by providing cheaper nights and buy-one-get-one-free offers, chains can keeps costs down.
Earlier this week one of the leading figures in the UK film industry called for cinemas to offer a greater variety of ticket prices.
Zygi Kamasa, head of Lionsgate UK, whose films include The Hunger Games and Postman Pat, said prices at the box office should reflect film budgets.
He suggested an independent British film should cost £4 and a Hollywood blockbuster £10.
