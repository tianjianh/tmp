[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 0-0 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trevor Carson pulled off a three superb saves to help Hartlepool thwart Portsmouth in a poor goalless draw at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Pompey shot stopper Carson brilliantly prevented Michael Smith's powerful header and Michael Doyle's 20-yard pile driver,
He then blocked a Conor Chaplin header in stoppage time as the hosts missed out on the opportunity to put more pressure on the top three.
Pompey, unchanged for a fourth successive game, looked the more likely to score throughout, Gary Roberts the first to put pressure on the Pools goal as he won the ball on the touchline before dragging wide on the edge of the box.
Winger Kyle Bennett was next in the queue to see a sight of Carson's goal, his give-and-go with Smith was excellent but he hooked his finish past the post, and then Gareth Evans and Roberts both had further first-half efforts.
Hartlepool had shipped 11 in their last three matches in all competitions and not scored in seven fixtures against Pompey, and hardly threatened on this occasion.
Carl Baker twisted and turned himself into a shooting position for the hosts after the break but his chance was deflected over, before substitute Chaplin air kicked at Kal Naismith's cross.
