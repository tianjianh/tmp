Peterborough United have turned down a £250,000 bid from another League One club for striker Ricky Miller, says Posh chairman Darragh MacAnthony.

Miller has yet to formally join Posh, after signing a three-year deal which begins when his Dover contract expires.
The 28-year-old scored 42 goals for the National League side this term.
"That could have been the easiest stock transaction of my life. We turned it down. He's a big part of my plans," MacAnthony said.
He told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "I want Ricky to win the golden boot possibly this year, in competition with any other strikers we bring in."
Peterborough-born Miller, who Posh also tried to sign in January, will link up with his new team-mates for pre-season training at the end of June.
