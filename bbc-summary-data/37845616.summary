Battle of Orgreave: Rudd urged to back Commons inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cross-party group of MPs has urged the home secretary to support a parliamentary inquiry into clashes at Orgreave.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amber Rudd ruled out a public inquiry into clashes between miners and police at the height of the miner's strike.
The group said a Commons committee inquiry would "minimise costs".
The Home Office denies claims Ms Rudd had committed to establishing an inquiry. The BBC understands Theresa May was also unlikely to back a review.

A letter to Ms Rudd was signed by senior Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh, as well as Labour MP Andy Burnham, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, Green co-leader Caroline Lucas, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan and Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry.
They urged the home secretary to order the Home Office to release all relevant police and government documents, and co-operate fully with any such probe.
"If you were able to give this commitment it would significantly enhance confidence that such an arrangement could work," they wrote.
A parliamentary inquiry would "minimise costs and administration", they argued.
Sir Edward raised proposals for a select committee inquiry in the Commons on Monday, when he said it would have the power "to interview all witnesses about matters - including advice to ministers".
In a letter to campaigners on Monday, Ms Rudd said policing had changed sufficiently in the years since Orgreave to mean an inquiry was not in the public interest.
She said "ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions" resulting from the conduct of South Yorkshire Police at the time.
Ms Rudd appeared to leave the committee inquiry route open when she described the suggestion as "interesting", but added it was a matter for MPs to decide.
On Tuesday, Orgreave Truth and Justice Committee announced they would not back down on calls for a public inquiry.
The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was understood that, prior to becoming prime minister, former Home Secretary Theresa May had come to the view that a full public inquiry was unlikely.
Whitehall sources insist, however, that the actual decision was taken by Ms Rudd, not Mrs May.
6,000 police officers from around the country attempted to prevent striking miners from blocking coke deliveries.
95 individuals were charged with riot and violent disorder, but cases collapsed and South Yorkshire Police were later required to pay compensation.
The "Battle of Orgreave" was the most violent day of the year-long 1984-85 miners' strike.
Huge lines of police clashed with striking miners as they tried to stop lorries carrying coke to fuel the Scunthorpe steel furnaces.
Violence erupted on both sides and at one stage police horses were sent to charge the crowd up the field as officers followed to make arrests.
