Tiger Woods: 14-time major winner ruled out for the rest of the season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the US PGA, meaning he will miss all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since his Masters debut in 1995.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
American Woods, 40, has not played tournament golf in almost a year and had two operations last autumn in an attempt to cure a back problem.
His agent has confirmed he will not play for the rest of this season as he is not ready for "competitive golf".
The 14-time major winner has dropped to a world ranking of 628.
