[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 2-1 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jacob Murphy scored twice to set Norwich on their way to a Championship win over Wigan at Carrow Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murphy seized on a poor touch from Latics goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to put the Canaries into an early lead.
The winger added a second by following up Wes Hoolahan's initial saved strike.
Jordi Gomez's low shot brought Wigan back into it, but Canaries goalkeeper Michael McGovern produced late saves from Will Grigg and Yanic Wildschut to earn his side a win.
Gary Caldwell's side looked much the better towards the end of the match, but the result leaves Wigan second from bottom in the Championship with only one win - over bottom side Blackburn.
The game had begun in terrible fashion for the visitors when Liverpool loanee Bogdan wanted too much time on the ball in his own box, allowing Murphy to quickly nick the ball away and tuck it into an empty net.
The Latics' start got even worse when Bogdan could only parry Hoolahan's shot and Murphy was on the line to nod it into the net and set up back-to-back victories for the hosts.
Gomez did slot in a long-range effort on his first start since returning to Wigan before hitting the side-netting with a free-kick.
Norwich were then indebted to Northern Ireland international McGovern at the end as he first denied Grigg's header from Wildschut's cross, before palming away another Wildschut delivery.
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"It wasn't a sigh of relief at the end because if anyone deserved to win it was us. But at the end I was thinking. 'I am glad that is over'.
"We needed to show our professionalism and we didn't do that as well as we can do at the end but what we did do was show a lot of heart and courage.
"I said to the boys we must target six points at the start of the week, we did that but there is still room for improvement and I am getting lads fitter all the time."
Wigan boss Gary Caldwell:
"The first goal I take responsibility for.
"I ask the lads to play like that - you are going to make mistakes at times and we got punished heavily for it.
"But the mentality we showed to dominate the game and take it to a Premier League-sized club, I was proud of them."
