Almost 500,000 people have visited the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh since it opened 10 major new galleries two months ago.

It is an increase of more than 30% on the same period last year.
The new galleries of design, fashion and science and technology opened on 8 July at the museum on Chambers Street.
The £14.1m redevelopment in the museum's 150th anniversary year is the latest phase in an £80m masterplan to transform the museum.
Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland said: "We have had a terrific summer at the National Museum of Scotland, since opening our 10 new galleries.
"They allow visitors to explore our internationally significant collections like never before, and the response to them has been overwhelmingly positive.
"I am delighted that just two months after unveiling the galleries we have welcomed nearly half a million visitors."
