Edinburgh Airport has pulled back on its expansion plans, saying there is no need to consider a second runway for another 20 years.

The airport's comments came as it unveiled its draft masterplan, which lays out development plans until 2040.
Airport owners BAA had expected to reach 13 million passengers per year by 2013, but does not now expect to reach that number before 2020.
However, BAA said new aircraft hangars and stands would soon be required.
In the shorter term, the masterplan forecasts passenger numbers will grow from nine million to 12.3 million per year until 2020, with aircraft movements increasing from 116,200 to 141,300.
New aircraft hangars and stands will be built to meet that demand, while transport facilities at the airport and to the site will be improved.
The airport said the projected developments would be largely within existing boundaries.
BAA has just completed a Â£40m expansion and upgrade of the airport, which is sufficient for up to 13 million passengers per year.
The masterplan estimates passenger numbers could increase to 20.5 million per year by 2040, with more than half travelling to and from international destinations. According to projections, aircraft movements could also increase to 200,600 per year.
Kevin Brown, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said the airport would be consulting as widely as possible on its masterplan over the next few months.
He added: "Ours is a sustainable and responsible plan, grounded in the reality of our post-recession economy and keen to capitalise on the opportunities that will arise when our economy begins to grow again.
"It is important for us therefore to test our plans and provide clarity, certainty and understanding to local communities, local authorities and wider business and tourism interests whose futures depend very much on a strong, successful and well-connected airport."
A 14-week public consultation exercise on the draft plans has been launched, after which a final masterplan will be drawn up.
