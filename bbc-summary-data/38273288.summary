Queen of the South 2-2 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stephen Dobbie struck late to secure Queen of the South an entertaining draw with Dunfermline Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Brownlie gave the hosts a 39th-minute lead, heading home from Mark Millar's corner.
Dunfermline drew level thanks to Jason Talbot's fantastic volley from the edge of the area and Kallum Higginbotham home from Joe Cardle's cross.
But, with 12 minutes left, Dobbie was allowed a tap-in after Sean Murdoch had failed to gather Derek Lyle's low pass.
His 16th goal of the season ensured that Queens remain sixth, one place and three points ahead of Dunfermline.
However, the Pars and Ayr United have been joined on the 17-point mark by Dumbarton after the Sons' win over Falkirk.
Match ends, Queen of the South 2, Dunfermline Athletic 2.
