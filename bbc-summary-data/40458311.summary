The 31-year-old Welshman had been the subject of interest from a number of other UCI pro teams, including UAE Team Emirates.
But he accepted the one-year option that was written into the deal he signed in May 2016.
Thomas joined Team Sky at its 2010 inception and starts his eighth Tour de France in Dusseldorf on Saturday.
Team leader Chris Froome also extended his contract on Friday, signing a new three-year contract to stay with Team Sky until the end of 2020.
