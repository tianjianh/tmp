[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pub in Lairg in Sutherland given as a gift to church

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a pub in the Highlands have given it as a gift to their local church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael and Kai Geldard had planned to sell the Crask Inn in Lairg, but have instead handed it over to their local Scottish Episcopal Church.
The couple are members of the church's congregation.
The inn, which has four bedrooms, is to continue to be run as a pub and as a bed and breakfast, but will also be used for religious services.
It is to be run by Douglas Campbell, a Eucharistic minister, and his GP wife Denise. They are planning to move from Hopeman in Moray in April.
Mr Campbell, who is personal assistant to the Right Reverend Mark Strange, the Episcopalian Bishop of the United Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness, said neither he or his wife had run a pub before but were looking forward to the new challenge.
