A businessman has launched a "warts-and-all" London mayoral campaign with a YouTube cartoon declaring: "I'm gay, I'm an ex-alcoholic, I'm dyslexic."

In the highly personal video, self-proclaimed Londoner Ivan Massow said he was adopted and not a "typical politician".
He hopes to replace Boris Johnson as the Conservative mayor in 2016.
Mr Massow, 47, has asked people to contact him on social media to tell him what they want from the next mayor.
Mr Johnson, who was elected as MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip South, said he would see out his term in office as London mayor until the elections in 2016.
Brighton-born Mr Massow moved to London 30 years ago, setting up a business to help people access insurance and financial products.
The video gave an "honest, warts-and-all" portrayal of him, he said.
In it, a cartoon version of Mr Massow says: "I'm Ivan and I want to be your mayor of London... I'm gay, I'm an ex-alcoholic, I'm dyslexic, I'm adopted, I'm an activist, I'm a businessman, I'm a disruptor, I'm a do-er.
"I'm not your typical 'politician' politician.
"I believe London needs someone who understands the issues normal people face - someone who takes the Tube, someone who hates sitting in traffic, someone who hates red tape, someone who hates politics as normal."
Other people who hope to be chosen as Conservative candidate for mayor include current deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh and London Assembly member Andrew Boff. Ex-England footballer Sol Campbell has also indicated he would like to stand.
Labour's Diane Abbott and Sadiq Khan have both declared their intention to be the party's candidate for the mayoral race, along with Tessa Jowell and Tottenham MP David Lammy.
