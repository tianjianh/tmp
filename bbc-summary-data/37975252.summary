Jimmy Thomson contributed about 700 drawings of celebrities, including Elton John and Freddie Mercury, to the publication over 14 years.
A selection of the original drawings will be auctioned following the exhibition at the McManus Galleries.
Mr Thomson began his career with Dundee publisher DC Thomson.
The auction will be in aid of McManus 168, the museum's supporters' group.
Its chairwoman, Sue Moody said: "This is the first time Dundee has hosted a civic exhibition of Jimmy's work.
"Thousands of people will remember his drawings, bringing back memories of the swinging Sixties and disco Seventies."
Other celebrity portraits featuring in the exhibition include President Richard Nixon, Ringo Starr and a cartoon of John Lennon, which featured on the cover of Melody Maker in 1973.
Mr Thomson said: "Funds raised will be used on a community project celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the McManus which is next year.
"I'm delighted that my drawings are linked in this way with Dundee's galleries, which have provided such a rich source of inspiration to me as an artist."
The exhibition runs until Saturday 26 November, with the auction taking place that evening.
