UTV in talks which could result in sale of TV business

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The media company UTV has confirmed it is in talks that could lead to the sale of its television business.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
UTV has operated a television station in Northern Ireland since 1959 and has other television and radio operations in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
UTV broadcasts many of Northern Ireland's most watched programmes.
Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt, a former news presenter at UTV, said the company's move had "the whiff of surrender".
The company expanded into television in the Republic of Ireland in January this year but it has struggled to find an audience.
UTV Ireland is expected to lose almost Â£12m this year.
As a result, UTV has been reviewing its options and it looks as though a radical plan is taking shape.
It is in talks about the sale of its television assets, most likely to ITV.
If that happens, it will mean UTV will become a radio-only business.
There are unlikely to be big on-air changes locally if the television business is sold, but it would raise questions about the future of UTV Ireland.
Mr Nesbitt said the company had switched its "focus from the viewer" to one of "satisfying the shareholder".
He added: "Having spent so many years making UTV stand out from ITV, the news that ITV is the most likely buyer has the whiff of surrender."
