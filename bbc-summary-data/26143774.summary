The package arrived in the post at the premises in St Mary's Butts, Reading, during the afternoon.
Another package was received at the Army and RAF Careers Office at Dock Road in Chatham, Kent, Thames Valley Police said. That has not been confirmed as a bomb.
The South East Counter Terrorism Unit is investigating whether there is a link between the two.
An MoD bomb disposal team was called to the office in Reading at about 14:00 GMT and the area around it was sealed off.
Officers on the scene confirmed it was a small but viable explosive device, which had been received in the post and had been made safe.
Kent Police said officers were called to the Chatham office at 10:45 GMT following a report of a suspicious package.
In a statement they said: "After the envelope that had been delivered to the building had been made safe the scene was stood down at about 5pm.
"Enquiries are now ongoing which will involve whether the incident in Chatham is linked to one in Reading."
