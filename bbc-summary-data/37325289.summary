Shrewsbury Town 0-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Mirfin's goal in first-half stoppage time secured victory for Scunthorpe at Shrewsbury and put them top of the League One table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Centre-half Mirfin headed home Josh Morris's free-kick in time added on at the end of the first half.
Shrewsbury made much of the early running with Jim O'Brien firing a free-kick from the edge of the penalty area just over the crossbar before Shaun Whalley's 20-yard drive was saved by Luke Daniels, diving low to his right.
Paddy Madden saw a shot comfortably stopped by Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler and Kevin van Veen then drilled a low effort from 20 yards wide of the near post.
Scunthorpe moved ahead deep into stoppage time at the end of the first half when an inswinging free-kick from Josh Morris from the right was glanced into the bottom corner by Mirfin.
The visitors should have doubled their lead 20 minutes from time but Madden fired wide from close range.
Shrewsbury found chances hard to come by at the other end with Scunthorpe goalkeeper Daniels never seriously extended.
Junior Brown bent a 25-yard free-kick just off target before a late effort from Louis Dodds was deflected wide as Shrewsbury slipped into the bottom four.
