It comes after a private fun day organised by an Islamic group, due to be held on Sunday, was cancelled due to threats from far-right groups.
Legoland said it received further threats and decided to close its hotel this weekend, saying the safety of guests and staff was its priority.
The theme park in Windsor, Berkshire, was already closed for the season. It reopens on 14 March.
Thames Valley Police said it is investigating offensive messages sent in connection with the event organised by the Muslim Research and Development Foundation.
Legoland was forced to shut down its Facebook page due to a number of abusive posts. It also received threats through phone calls and emails.
In a statement, Legoland said: "Sadly, a private event due to take place on Sunday has had to be cancelled due to threats from right-wing groups made against the resort.
"The whole resort, including the hotel, will be closed for the weekend.
"We are extremely sorry that we've had to cancel any hotel visits for guests booked in to stay over this weekend.
"We wholeheartedly understand families' disappointment that they will be unable to attend and appreciate that due to the dynamic nature of this situation we haven't been able to give them more notification."
Guests booked to stay at the resort this weekend have been handed a full refund while a number of people on Twitter have also told the BBC they have received a Â£10 voucher.
Sara Powell left a message on the BBC Berkshire Facebook page.
She said: "Extremely disappointed that our hotel trip has been cancelled at ridiculously short notice, and angry that this situation has been allowed to happen.
"Will be speaking to Legoland in the morning."
This article was amended to make it clear the theme park would have been shut to the public this weekend regardless of the decision to close the hotel.
