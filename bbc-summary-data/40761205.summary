[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 2-2 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Ginnelly earned Lincoln a point on their return to the Football League as the Imps came away from Wycombe with a draw on the opening day of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In their first match in League Two for six years, the Imps recovered admirably from conceding two soft goals and look well set to handle the step up.
Lincoln went ahead after 31 minutes as Wycombe failed to clear their lines, the ball broke to Nathan Arnold in the penalty area and he squared for Matt Green to tap in.
The visitors' lead lasted just six minutes however, as non-existent marking gave Luke O'Nien the easy task of nodding Joe Jacobson's set-piece into the top corner.
Three minutes later, the Chairboys led as Jacobson's low free-kick from 25 yards went through what was a flimsy Lincoln wall leaving keeper Paul Farman unsighted.
But the Imps squared it up again four minutes into the second half as Alex Woodyard played a superb through-ball to Ginnelly, who calmly finished beyond Scott Brown.
