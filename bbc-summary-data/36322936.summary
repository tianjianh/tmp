A set of red deer antlers found on a beach in Ceredigion date back to the Bronze Age, scientists have said.

The remains, discovered in Borth, have been confirmed as coming from a deer which died between 1200 and 1000 BC.
The skull and antlers were spotted in April and were initially believed to be about 4,000 years old.
Dr Ros Coard from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David said the deer was in the prime of its life when it died, showing full antler development.
The people who found the remains photographed the area rather than trying to remove them, and this was used by the team who manually searched the water at low tide until the skull was found under water.
Researchers said the remains were "considerably younger" than expected, which means flooding in the area was more recent than had previously been thought.
