The 46-year-old joined in the summer of 2014, just before their relegation from Super League, and leaves with the Bulls fourth in the Championship table.
"I have had to make this tough call for personal reasons and I request everyone respects that," he said in a statement.
The Bulls missed out on a Super League return when they lost to Wakefield in last season's Million Pound Game.
Lowes continued: "I would like to personally thank the players, directors, staff and especially all the supporters of this great club for my time here."
Assistant coach Matt Diskin, who was recently appointed Batley's head coach for next season, has been placed in temporary charge for Bradford's game against Workington on 24 April.
