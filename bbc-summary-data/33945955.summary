Some 230 bands from 16 nations such as Canada, the US, Oman, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, took part in The World Pipe Band Championships.
Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia were named world champions - the first Scottish winner since 2005.
The competition is the culmination of the week-long Piping Live festival.
Ian Embelton, chief executive of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, said: "It is always hard to imagine just how much better the bands and the event can get but this year's World Pipe Band Championships have been outstanding.
"Everyone who joined us at Glasgow Green has enjoyed performances from some of the most talented pipers and drummers in the world."
In second place overall was the St Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band from the Republic of Ireland, with Inverary and District Pipe Band in third.
Councillor Archie Graham, chieftain for the championships as well as being deputy leader of Glasgow City Council, said: "The World Pipe Band Championships have become firmly established in Glasgow's cultural events calendar and this year has shown once again the incredible talent of the musicians taking part.
"We look forward to hosting these world championships each year and to showing everyone who comes to Glasgow to take part or attend why the city has such a well-deserved global reputation for hosting events."
