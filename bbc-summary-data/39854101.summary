A detective constable said she could connect Timuras Kozlov from Derrychara Drive in the town to the charge.
The baby boy, who is thought to be about six months old, is in a stable condition at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

A defence solicitor told Omagh Magistrates' Court that his client had maintained that the incident was an accident during the course of four police interviews.
He said Mr Kozlov had cooperated fully with police and answered all their questions.
The solicitor added that he was employed locally and was not known to the police in Northern Ireland or in Lithuania.
Speaking through an interpreter, Mr Kozlov confirmed he understood the charges.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody to appear in court via video link on 22 May in Enniskillen.
