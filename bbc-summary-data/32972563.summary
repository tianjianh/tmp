[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ireland's richest man: Irish media 'free to report on Denis O'Brien'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high court judge in the Republic of Ireland has ruled that the media can report what was said in the Irish parliament under privilege about the country's richest man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denis O'Brien was granted a high court injunction in May to stop RTÉ reporting details of his personal finances.
TD Catherine Murphy later made comments regarding his finances under privilege in the Dáil (parliament).
Media organisations returned to court to seek clarity.
Ms Murphy told the Dáil that Mr O'Brien owed the former Anglo Irish Bank upwards of 500m euro (£362m).
Ms Murphy, an independent left-wing TD, said Mr O'Brien was attempting to pay loans back at an interest rate of just over 1%, when it was arguable that the correct rate should be over 7%.
But those comments went largely unreported in the Republic of Ireland because of the high court injunction restraining RTÉ from reporting on Mr O'Brien's personal finances and his relationship with the former Anglo Irish Bank, now the nationalised Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC).
On Tuesday, lawyers for several media organisations returned to the high court to hear judge Donald Binchy say that he never intended nor could he order any interference with what a TD may say under privilege in the Dáil.
He could not stop any media organisation from reporting those remarks, he said.
That clarification has been welcomed by the national broadcaster RTÉ and other media organisations, and by the National Union of Journalists.
