Woods, 40, who has had three operations to fix back problems and last played a tournament in August 2015, had registered to play at Oakmont.
But the 14-time major winner will now miss both the US Open and the Quicken Loans National at Congressional.
"I am making progress, but I'm not yet ready for tournament competition," Woods said on his official website.
Woods missed the Masters in April for only the second time since his debut in 1995.
