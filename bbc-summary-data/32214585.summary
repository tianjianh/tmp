The 22-year-old came on with 16 seconds remaining in the Kings' 116-111 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
The 7ft 5in Canada-born centre signed a 10-day contract to join the Kings' roster and said he hoped he could help grow the game in India.
"It was a great feeling and I'm happy to be kind of an ambassador," he said.
Bhullar added: "Hopefully more kids growing up will see there's a player of Indian descent on the court and we can get a couple more Indian NBA players."
