The blaze took hold in agricultural buildings at Mount Pleasant Farm in Goring Heath on Saturday morning.
Oxfordshire County Council's Fire and Rescue Service and Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue drenched the fire using eight fire engines.
They said the smoke had settled in residential areas and breathing had not been "pleasant".
Residents were advised to remain inside and shut windows and doors.
Crews from Goring, Didcot and Reading remained at the site throughout the day. No people or animals were hurt as a result of the fire.
An investigation into the cause is under way, but it is thought to have started in a barn and originated from an industrial generator, which then set fire to a forklift.
Group manager Jason Crapper, from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, attended the blaze and called it "very severe".
"Although it has caused considerable damage, the nearby buildings were protected which has saved both the buildings and the valuable plant and machinery they house," he said.
A spokesman added: "The first firefighters on the scene were met with a rapidly spreading fire which included a large tank of heating oil, and further fire engines were therefore sent along with water carriers from as far as Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to try to stop the fire from spreading further.
"Firefighters used a number of water jets from around the buildings to stop the fire spreading whilst also putting in place measures to protect local watercourses from the water run off which included oils from the fire."
