East Thurrock's Mitchell Gilbey hit the post before Franks' spectacular shot from 25-yards hit the back of the net.
Goalkeeper David Hughes made a number of outstanding saves from Marlon Harewood and Michael Duckworth to keep the Ryman Premier side in the match.
However, the part-time electrician let the ball slip through his hands to allow Franks to head in his second.
