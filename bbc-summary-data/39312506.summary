[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The damage was done in the first half when goals from Ian Henderson, Callum Camps and Jamie Allen put Rochdale in control and although Kristian Dennis replied early in the second, the visitors were never seriously threatened.
Nathaniel Mendez-Laing struck a post in the 14th minute before Keith Keane played Henderson through to finish with a chip over Thorsten Stuckmann.
Rochdale dominated and scored twice in the space of two minutes before the interval to send home fans heading for the exits.
Camps found the bottom corner from 25 yards when a corner was half-cleared in the 40th minute, before playing Allen in to score with a low shot across Stuckmann.
Chesterfield pulled one back through Dennis' long-range strike in the 51st minute, but the home side had David Faupala sent off in added time for a late challenge on Joseph Rafferty.
