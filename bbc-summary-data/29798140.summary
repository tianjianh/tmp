Hugh Jackman has had treatment for skin cancer for a third time.

His people confirmed to Newsbeat he was treated for Basal Cell Carcinoma after the Wolverine actor was recently pictured with another bandage on his nose.
But his representatives say he's "all good" after the procedure.
BCC is a slow-growing skin cancer and is linked to sun exposure. It accounts for about 75% of skin cancers but rarely kills.
Last night, the 46-year-old tweeted "Sunscreen" with a picture reference to Baz Luhrmann's 1998 song Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen.
Jackman first revealed he was diagnosed with BCC in November, when he posted a picture of himself online after a similar procedure.
At the time, he said his prognosis was good and pleaded with fans to stay protected from the sun.
He then had more cancerous cells removed in May.
He's recently said he believes he'll have many many more scares but claims it's the most "minor" of all the skin cancers.
His wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, first persuaded him to get the mark on his nose checked by a doctor.
Surgery is the main treatment for BCC. If left untreated, it doesn't usually spread to other parts of the body, but it can damage or disfigure surrounding tissue.
