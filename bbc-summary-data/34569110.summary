Emergency services are looking for the man at South Curl Curl beach in Sydney, where he disappeared on Saturday.
The 31-year-old decided to go for a swim at about 19:00 local time, New South Wales police said.
Earlier police issued a statement saying the search had been called off, but Insp Graeme Pickering told the BBC this was not the case.
Insp Pickering described the beach as "treacherous" and notorious for its dangerous currents.
"It's well known locally that it has a fairly consistent and strong rip [tide] along the beach which could carry you out," he said.
The man who has links to the Manchester area has been named locally as Glen Sanderson.
He had been in the country for a week and had been fishing with a friend before entering the water, police said.
When he did not return his friend contacted emergency services, who began a search involving police divers and the police helicopter.
"The search hasn't been completely called off. We are conducting a search again today using a number of resources but we will be continuing regular patrols," Insp Pickering told BBC Radio Manchester.
"Our water police will be continuing patrols out there and our police helicopter will be also."
He added that a lot of the surfing beaches around Sydney "look OK" but sometimes "they're not as safe as they look".
"From local experience, I'd probably say it's one of the more treacherous of our beaches."
