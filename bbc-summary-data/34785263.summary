Crews were called to the building on the Electra Road in Campsie at about 08:40 GMT on Wednesday.
Twelve fire appliances have been sent to the scene from Derry, Strabane, Omagh and Dungiven.
It is not yet known how the fire started.
"There are hundreds if not thousands of tonnes of waste inside," said Mark Smyth, the assistant group commander at the Fire Service.
"It is a sizeable building and we are working hard to control this.
"There's no hazardous or toxic waste burning as such, but we do recommend local people to stay inside.
"We don't anticipate any interruption for local people.
"We have had to get water from a considerable distance away."
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan told BBC Radio Foyle: "People can see the smoke from the city.
"There has been significant damage caused here which is a real shame.
"It's a vast site. There has been a build up of waste within the building that hasn't been touched because of the company going into administration."
