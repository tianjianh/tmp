Ms Ferris, 40, had last been seen in September last year.
Police were concerned for her wellbeing as she had a medical condition which required medication.
Her disappearance sparked a search operation which ran over several weeks. Officers said inquiries had not revealed any suspicious circumstances.
Det Ch Insp David Hadden added: "We hope this identification gives Kelli's family some form of closure and our thoughts are with her family at this time."
