Simba Kuuya, 32, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, knew he was HIV positive when he had unprotected sex with the woman.
Swansea Crown Court heard she only found out he had the virus when one of his former partners contacted her after their brief relationship ended.
Kuuya pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.
Sue Ferrier, prosecuting, told the court: "One of his former partners contacted her via Facebook and broke the news to her.
"The victim confronted Kuuya about his medical condition but he denied it - however she sought a blood test at Singleton Hospital which came back positive."
Swansea Crown Court heard the woman was "devastated" by the news.
"I have to live with this for the rest of my life," she said in a statement.
Huw Rees, defending, said Kuuya had been in denial about his condition, "something which sadly had consequences for others".
Sentencing him, Judge Christopher Vosper said: "Her life has been completely changed by being infected - something that could easily have been avoided if you had been honest from the start.
"You chose to conceal something from her that you should have been open about. The consequences have been devastating."
