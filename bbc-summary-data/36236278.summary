The team wrapped up the title on Monday after closest rivals Tottenham Hotspur slipped to a 2-2 draw at Chelsea.
But the party got into full swing as Claudio Ranieri's players lifted the trophy following their final home game of the season.
Opera star Andrea Bocelli sang before the game on a day of celebrations.
Bocelli set the tone with pre-match renditions of Nessun Dorma and Time to Say Goodbye, honouring a recent promise to his countryman Ranieri.
The party baton was then handed over to the players, who brushed Everton aside with a goal from Andy King and two from Jamie Vardy before the visitors struck a late consolation.
Lifelong Foxes' fan Steve Worthy, 39, of Wigston, had the honour of handing the trophy to captain Wes Morgan at the end of the game.
He won a competition organised by league sponsors Barclays and said he would dedicate the experience to his 97-year-old grandmother, Gladys Knight, who had to forfeit her season ticket this season due to ill health.
"When I hand the Premier League trophy to Wes Morgan I'll be thinking of my grandmother," Mr Worthy said before the game.
The 25kg trophy, topped by a golden crown, was decorated with blue ribbons for Leicester, and yellow ones to represent the royal house of Thailand, which is the country of club owners King Power.
It was engraved on Friday, in preparation for Saturday's presentation.
Demand for tickets to the final home game of the season was high, with reports of tickets appearing on websites for up to Â£5,000.
But thousands - inside and outside the stadium - were just happy to be part of what has been termed a "fairytale" by pundits all over the world.
Back in December, former England footballer and Leicester-born Gary Lineker joked he would present the Match of the Day "in just my undies" if Leicester City won the Premier League.
On Wednesday Leicester East MP Keith Vaz asked David Cameron if the pundit should keep his promise after the club's triumph.
The prime minister replied he "absolutely" agreed he should.
It has been announced an open top bus parade will take place on Monday 16 May, ending up in Leicester's Victoria Park for further celebrations.
As one fan said: "It's something I didn't think I'd ever, ever see. Ever. Not in my lifetime and it's fantastic."
