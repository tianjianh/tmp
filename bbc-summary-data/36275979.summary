The Dutchman, 29, joined the Bluebirds on loan in January and went on to score five goals in 15 appearances as Cardiff finished eighth in the Championship.
He will officially become a Bluebird on a permanent basis on 1 July when the transfer window opens.
"It only took one meeting with the CEO [Ken Choo] for me to know that this was where I wanted to be," said Immers.
"My family are already settled in Cardiff and the rapport I have with the fans is something I want to nurture going forward.
"This is a fantastic club with ambition that matches my own."
Immers is the Bluebirds' first signing since a transfer embargo was lifted by the Football League and since Russell Slade was removed from his role as manager.
He scored 31 goals in 100 league appearances for Feyenoord, having joined them from Den Haag in 2012.
Chief executive Ken Choo said: "We're delighted to be officially welcoming Lex to the Cardiff City family.
"The impact he made during his time on loan was significant, and we feel that he is the right fit for the future we see for the football club.
"A number of other clubs wanted him this summer, but I'm thrilled that he has shown such commitment and loyalty to us."
