[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-2 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United moved up to fifth in the Championship with a narrow win over bottom side Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took an early lead through striker Chris Wood before the Millers had Peter Odemwingie sent off for violent conduct.
Souleymane Doukara's finish made it 2-0 just before the break.
Leeds dominated the second half, but were nearly left to rue their wastefulness after Richard Wood pulled a goal back with a late header.
They could not force an equaliser despite late pressure and they remain winless since 20 August and are 11 points adrift of safety.
The Millers lost defender Greg Halford to injury in the opening five minutes and things just got worse for Kenny Jackett's side in the first half.
They were a goal down inside 10 minutes after Wood finished from Charlie Taylor's low cross and down to 10 men before the 30th minute after Odemwingie caught Liam Cooper in the face with his elbow.
Leeds, who play Liverpool in the EFL quarter-final on Tuesday, have now won four of their last five games in the Championship.
