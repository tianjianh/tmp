Gateshead 1-2 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League promotion-chasing Lincoln came from behind with two goals in the last three minutes as they stunned Gateshead 2-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Imps tested Dan Hanford early on through Elliott Whitehouse, but Gateshead held firm and found themselves in front on the half-hour mark after Luke Hannant was brought down in the box by Sean Raggett.
Paddy McLaughlin coolly slotted home the resulting penalty, sending Paul Farman the wrong way, and the hosts held on to their lead after Hanford pulled off a superb finger-tip save to deny a Nathan Arnold volley just before the break.
Matt Rhead equalised for the league leaders from the spot in the first minute of stoppage time, before Arnold fired in the winner two minutes later.
