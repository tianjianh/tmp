The 25-year-old scored eight goals for the Bundesliga II side this season.
He could make his Terriers debut against Rochdale in the FA Cup.
"It was a tough decision because I was feeling good, but when I had the chance to come here I knew it was a great opportunity," Quaner told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I always watched English football when I was a child and I think it is the style of football that suits me.
"I like the way that the team is set-up here. I like to play physically and I'm aggressive."
