A road has been closed after a lorry carrying glue jack-knifed, spilling its load over the carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash has closed the A76 Dumfries to Kilmarnock Road at Sanquhar in south west Scotland.
A major clean-up operation is under way and police say the route is expected to be closed for most of the day.
Lengthy diversions are in operation and motorists are being urged to avoid the area. The driver was not hurt.
The glue container burst when the lorry jack-knifed on the road at 05:30, police said.
The incident happened in the town centre and diversions are in place around the affected area in Sanquhar.
Traffic is able to rejoin the A76 either side of the town but the re-routing has caused difficulties for large, industrial vehicles.
A Dumfries and Galloway police spokesman said: "The glue container on the lorry has burst and glue spilling is affecting the road surface.
"Road diversions are being put in place. However, motorists are asked to avoid the area if possible."
A member of police control staff said the road closure is expected to be in place for several hours.
