The Isle of Man's interests "will be respected" during the Brexit process, the UK's Prime Minister has said.

Theresa May made the comments in a letter to the chief minister following a report into the possible effects of Brexit on the Crown Dependencies.
The European Union Committee report has called on the UK government to ensure the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are "fully involved and engaged."
Chief minister Howard Quayle said he "welcomed" Mrs May's comments.
The report also urges the UK Parliament to remember its "unique constitutional responsibilities" to all three islands.
In her letter, Mrs May told Mr Quayle her government will be "engaging with you as we enter negotiations, strengthening the bonds between us as we forge a new relationship with the EU and with the wider world".
Mr Quayle said it has been a week of "double reassurance" for the Isle of Man in terms of the Brexit negotiations.
"These are very encouraging messages for the island and they show the value of all the hard work that has gone in to building relationships and awareness around our position," he said.
The Crown Dependencies are not part of the European Union or the UK so did not vote in the 2016 referendum.
However, the islands have a constitutional relationship both with the UK and the EU.
