[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Forest 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jason Cummings scored on his debut as Nottingham Forest edged into the second round of the EFL Cup with victory over League One side Shrewsbury Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest made 11 changes to the side that beat Millwall 1-0 in their Championship opener on Friday, but were still full of experience and led through Mustapha Carayol's penalty.
Cummings ran onto a Carayol pass to make it 2-0 after the break.
Shaun Whalley's penalty gave the Shrews hope but Forest held on to progress.
Carayol's cool spot-kick, after he was felled by Abu Ogogo, and a well-struck near-post shot by Scottish striker Cummings looked like ensuring a relatively smooth home win on a miserable, rain-soaked night at the City Ground.
But despite Whalley scoring after Niall Ennis was bundled over in the box by Matt Mills, Forest managed to survive a nervy final 10 minutes which saw Dimitar Evtimov make a fine injury-time save from Alex Rodman's close-range effort.
