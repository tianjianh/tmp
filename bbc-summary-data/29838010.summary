The weekend event features talks and workshops on ghosts, UFOs and aliens, with academics, enthusiasts and declared sceptics taking part.
More than 400 people are expected to attend the Caledonian Vampyre Ball, a Halloween dance at the Albert Halls.
UFO spotting in Bonnybridge and vigils alongside professional ghost hunters are also on the programme.
Festival director Peter Broughan said the event would bring together comedy, music, film, talks and entertainment, all on the spooky theme.
"The Scottish Paranormal Festival came from my passion for the unexplained," he said.
"Whether it's pondering the existence of poltergeists or understanding UFOS, we've been able to bring an exciting number of experts, writers and investigators from across the world to this event in Stirling and it is set to be an awe-inspiring few days."
Other high-profile events at the festival include a talk by the Navajo Rangers, two US national park rangers who have had a range of strange experiences working in Native American territories, and an appearance from Gordon Smith, the medium known as the "psychic barber".
VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead said the festival would be "a very mystifying and intriguing few days".
He added: "From ghosts to aliens, UFOs to vampires, coming alive through comedy, theatre, talks and music, it will be a chance to discover the fact behind the fiction.
"I would urge everyone to make the trip to Stirling to discover not only this amazing festival, but also this historic and magnificent city's fascinating past."
