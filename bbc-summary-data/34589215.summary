South African Craig Joubert was heavily criticised after awarding Australia a late penalty in Sunday's quarter-final.
Damir Skomina turned down Chelsea's penalty appeal when Cesc Fabregas fell under Serhiy Rybalka's challenge.
"The decision was crucial for the outcome," said Mourinho.
"A fall in the box is a penalty."
Asked about Skomina's performance, Mourinho added: "The referee was very good. I'm serious.
"He made one mistake and, for example in the Rugby World Cup, the referee in the Scotland game was very good.
"But he made one mistake and because of that mistake Scotland is crying."
World Rugby has said Joubert was wrong to award the crucial 78th-minute penalty for offside against Scotland's Jon Welsh.
Chelsea created the better chances in Ukraine, Eden Hazard hitting a post and Willian's free-kick striking the crossbar.
The Blues are third in Group G with four points from three games, three points behind leaders Porto and one behind Kiev.
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was not punished for calling referee Mike Dean "weak" and "naive" after a 2-0 defeat against Chelsea in September.
However, Mourinho was fined £50,000 by the Football Association for claiming officials were "afraid" to award his team penalties.
The Portuguese last week described the fine as a "disgrace" - and appeared to refer to Wenger's comments without naming him after Tuesday's draw.
"Afraid costs £50,000. Weak and naive - you can do it," he said.
"The referee was weak and naive. Big penalty."
Chelsea have won only one of their past five games in all competitions but Mourinho said a draw against Kiev was "acceptable".
"For 70, 75 minutes, we had the control, the initiative, the chances," he said.
"We hit the post, we had the penalty. We had everything but we didn't score.
"The result is acceptable because it keeps us in a strong position. We have the game at home. Dynamo plays against Porto so they have to lose points.
"We are third but we are in a stable position."
