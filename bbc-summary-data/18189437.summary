HMP Littlehey inmates detained for prison mutiny

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two inmates have been convicted of prison mutiny following a disturbance at Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four officers were injured at the young offenders unit on 10 January.
At Peterborough Crown Court, Scott Taylor, 22, was given six-and-a-half years to run consecutively with his previous indefinite term for attempted murder and actual bodily harm.
Ali Njie, 22, was given five-and-a-half years on top of his four-year sentence for rape and robbery.
In addition to prison mutiny, both men were convicted of two counts of causing actual bodily harm, and one count each of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, inflicting grievous bodily harm, wounding with intent and unlawful wounding.
A spokesman from Cambridgeshire Police said Taylor had thrown boiling water from a kettle over one prison officer.
Both men assaulted officers, threw chairs at them and caused damage to the prison wing.
At the time of the incident, the Prison Officers Association (POA) said it believed up to 60 inmates had been involved.
Specialist officers were brought in to control the disturbance.
A Cambridgeshire Police spokeswoman said it was the first time the force had charged or convicted for prison mutiny.
She added: "It means that two dangerous individuals will remain behind bars for a long time."
Governor at HMP Littlehey David Taylor described it as "a good outcome after the shocking and violent outburst".
