Trident workers deserve voice in nuclear debate says Eagle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The thousands of people whose jobs depend on Britain's nuclear weapons system should be involved in the debate over Trident's future, shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle has said.

Ms Eagle told Labour's conference she disagreed with leader Jeremy Corbyn's stance of scrapping Trident but was keen to have a full and open debate.
She later predicted "something will have to give" when the party formalises its position.
Labour won't discuss Trident this week.
Delegates decided against choosing the issue of Trident renewal - which divides the party - for a full debate in Brighton. Read our full story here.
In her first speech since accepting the role earlier this month, Ms Eagle said those working in the submarine industry and the defence supply chain had a legitimate right to a voice.
She added: "I recognise and respect the different views in our party on the future of our nuclear deterrent. Jeremy knew that I disagreed with him about this when he appointed me. And he still asked me to do the job.
"At the last election, we were committed to having a much more transparent and public facing debate about our place in the world and how best we should fulfil it.
"Jeremy Corbyn has asked me to facilitate such a debate. And I will do that."
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Ms Eagle was asked whether she would resign if the party adopted a position of opposing Trident renewal.
She added: "Let's have the debate, let's see what happens, and at the appropriate stage something will probably have to give one way or another."
