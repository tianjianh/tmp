[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheridan Smith role as Cilla Black up for International Emmy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Actress Sheridan Smith has been nominated for an international Emmy for her portrayal of Cilla Black in a three-part ITV drama.

The show, which was broadcast before Black's death earlier this year, looked at the star's early career.
Smith's performance was previously nominated for a Bafta and won a National Television Award.
Other British nominees include Rafe Spall, for his role in the Christmas episode of Black Mirror.
The dystopian satire, written by Charlie Brooker, focused on a not-too-distant future where an implant allows humans to block other people in a similar way to social media.
Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes will also receive the International TV Academy's Founders Award at the gala ceremony in New York on 23 November.
BBC Two is up for the arts and documentary award for Messiah at the Foundling Hospital, which recreated the candlelit premiere of Handel's Messiah in 1750.
Channel 4's My Mad Fat Diary is up for best drama, while Sky's 50 Ways To Kill Your Mammy - in which TV presenter Baz Ashmawy set his mum Nancy a number of daredevil challenges - is nominated in the "non-scripted entertainment" category.
The International Emmys honour programming from outside the US, as well as US shows created in languages other than English.
In all, the nominees span 19 countries from Colombia to Turkey and South Korea.
