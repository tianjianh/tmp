Player-coach Fab Flournoy says Newcastle Eagles' BBL Cup win against Plymouth proved his side are back to their best after a trophy-less 2011.

Eagles ran out 115-94 winners to secure the first silverware of the campaign.
"It's an engulfing feeling that has set upon us as a team," New York-born Flournoy told BBC Newcastle.
"We wanted to win so bad to re-establish ourselves, with a chip on our shoulders to prove to everyone we're a good basketball team."
It was an afternoon of broken records, with Eagles' points haul smashing the competition's record score, while guard forward Charles Smith broke the individual record with 39 points.
"That's Chuck, with an exclamation point, it was a fantastic performance," Flournoy continued.
"People might not remember, we were in the same building fighting for our lives against Milton Keynes, we were out of the game and we crawled back into it.
"It came down to one final possession, we drew it up, Charles had the basketball and he took a beautiful shot from the baseline that rolled in and came out, and subsequently we didn't get back in it.
"He's having that special type of year, especially after all that was said about him being too old, doesn't play defence, all he does is shoot the three points.
"You say that, and then you come out and see the performance he's capable of, he's one of the most underrated players in the history of this league."
Smith, 36, was expected to retire at the end of last season, but was tempted back to Sports Central for an eighth campaign with the promise of a push for honours.
"I've put up bigger points than that before, but it's my first cup win," Smith added.
"It was great, the guys kept finding me, and the ball just kept going in.
"I couldn't leave without winning something, that's why I came back."
