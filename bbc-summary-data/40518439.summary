Eubank, 27, defends his IBO world title against the 37-year-old German at Wembley Arena on 15 July.
WBA champion George Groves and Britons Callum Smith and Jamie Cox are among eight super-middleweights already entered in the Super Series tournament.
Smith sacrificed a WBC world title shot against Anthony Dirrell to take part.
The winner of the knockout event will earn a share of $50m (£38m) and take the Muhammad Ali trophy.
But they will have to negotiate quarter-finals in September, semi-finals in January and a May final in a tournament which organisers say will "change the world of boxing."
If contestants meet a current world title holder during the tournament, belts will also be on the line.
"It would be great to fight George Groves and to take his title away from him but let´s see what the draw in Monaco brings," said Eubank.
A cruiserweight tournament will run alongside the super-middleweight competition and as all four cruiserweight world champions are taking part, the division should have an undisputed champion by May.
Abraham believes the Super Series represents "the Champions League of boxing". He holds a record of 46 wins from 51 fights and is a former two-weight world champion, while Eubank has just one defeat in 24 bouts.
Both will know their potential Super Series quarter-final opponent on Saturday when the draw takes place in Monte Carlo.
