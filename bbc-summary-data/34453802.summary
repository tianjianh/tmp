[SN]TITLE[SN]
EU Interreg VA funding for cross-border health projects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cross-border health and social care programmes are to receive more than Â£45m in EU funding over seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Projects to be funded include mental health provision, support for socially isolated disabled people and enhanced community care for older people.
Support will also be provided to assist 5,000 vulnerable families and fund new healthcare intervention trials.
The EU's Interreg VA Programme has invited funding applications for suitable projects until 16 November.
The funding will support projects based in Northern Ireland, border counties in the Republic of Ireland and western Scotland.
Gina McIntyre of the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), which manages the funding, said it would invest in health and social care areas "where the greatest need has been demonstrated and where the value of cross-border co-operation can deliver the greatest results".
She said it would "support the development of a more joined-up and efficient cross-border healthcare system, which will benefit tens of thousands of people at a time of budgetary pressure and rising demand".
