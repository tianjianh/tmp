David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn clash over nurse and student grants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed at Prime Minister's Questions over the axing of student grants and bursaries for nurses in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Cameron said replacing bursaries with loans would mean more nurses would be trained - and scrapping student grants would let more go to university.
He accused Mr Corbyn of wanting to "cap aspiration".
But the Labour leader said the PM was saddling students with debt and robbing the NHS of talented would-be nurses.
On Tuesday, Labour failed in a last-ditch bid to block the replacement of student maintenance grants in England, which are worth up to £3,500 for university students from poorer families, with loans.
Opposition MPs have objected to the way in which the government has implemented the change without a Commons vote.
Mr Corbyn said the prime minister had "form" for hitting the less well off with policies that did not feature in the Conservative election manifesto, such as now abandoned plans to scrap tax credits.
He asked why a student called Liam, who is training to be a maths teacher, would finish his course with debts of more than £50,000, roughly twice his annual income.
Mr Cameron replied: "What I would say to Liam is he is now in a country with a university system with more people going to university than ever before and more people from low-income backgrounds going to university than ever before.
"In addition, what I would say to Liam, and I wish him well, is that he will not pay back a penny of his loan until he's earning £21,000, he will not start paying back in full until he's earning £35,000.
"Our policy is actually going to put more money in the hands of students like Liam, which is why we're doing it."
He claimed Labour plans to scrap loans and fees would cost £10bn, meaning the country would go back to "a situation where people went out, worked hard, pay their taxes for an elite to go to university".
He added: "We're uncapping aspiration, you want to put a cap on it."
Mr Corbyn then asked why student nurses were being hit with an effective pay cut of £900 through the scrapping of bursaries, quoting the example of "Vicky", a single mother from York, who said she could not afford to train as a mental health nurse.
Mr Cameron claimed "two out of three Vickys.. who want to be nurses" are rejected under the current system and nurses have to be brought in from "Bulgaria and Romania" to do jobs that home-grown nurses should be doing.
Mr Corbyn claimed "nine out of 10 hospitals currently have a nurse shortage" and the government's plans would make this worse.
The Labour leader then highlighted comments from Tory MP and former nurse Maria Caulfield who said she would have struggled to train without a bursary.
Mr Cameron denied this, claiming the proposals would  actually "uncap" the numbers that go into nursing and create 10,000 extra nurse degree places.
