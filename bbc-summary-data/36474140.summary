Her morning varies depending on where in the country or even the world she is.  If she's not touring the globe with England, then she splits her time between her home town of Bury and the England training camp at Loughborough.
She doesn't hit snooze as mornings for her revolve around exercise, high protein breakfasts and her dog Ollie.  Find out more in the video!
