A road tunnel is to be transformed into a nightclub as part of a motoring festival.

The Greyfriars Green tunnel on Coventry's ring road will close to traffic at 17:00 GMT on 30 May and be turned into a 5,000-capacity club.
The Motofest event will follow the official opening of the tunnel, part of the Â£59m Friargate development.
After a night of DJs and other entertainment, the tunnel will reopen at 05:00, organisers said.
Jeremy Heaver, Motofest commercial director, said: "When we first took the idea to Coventry City Council, I think it probably took them aback as it is a slightly leftfield thing to do."
Councillor Rachel Lancaster, in charge of public services, described it as a "pretty unique way to celebrate the opening of our new tunnel", part of a major regeneration project in Coventry.
The three-day Motofest 2015 begins on 29 May and will see the city stage time trials on public roads, alongside exhibitions, music and other events.
British Formula 3 cars, among others, will complete laps of the ring road.
It follows a change in the law in July which allowed local authorities to suspend the Road Traffic Act.
Organisers said they wanted Motofest to be seen as the "Edinburgh Festival" of vehicles.
