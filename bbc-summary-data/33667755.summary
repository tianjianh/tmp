Ian Simpson, from Armoy, who is in his 40s, has a head injury following a crash that happened after 16:00 BST on Saturday.
Mr Simpson had been racing in the 400cc Supersport race.
Belfast Health Trust confirmed that the motorcyclist's condition was stable.
In a statement on Sunday afternoon, Armoy Motorcycle Road Racing Club said the news was "positive".
"The clerk of the course, Bill Kennedy, visited Ian and his family this afternoon in the Royal Victoria Hospital and spoke personally with Ian. He has now been moved out of the ICU and into a high dependency unit," the statement said.
"We are aware that the many local fans and the wider road racing fraternity will be keen to know how Ian is and at this stage we are delighted to say the news is positive."
Liam Beckett was commentating for Radio Ulster at the race.
"In that particular race, the red flags went up. It happened at a part of the circuit known as the Church Bends which would have been about one and a half miles into the circuit," he said.
"The longer the delay, the more we knew it was quite serious. The air ambulance arrived and got the rider off as quickly as possible to hospital."
