[SN]TITLE[SN]
Head teacher banned for stealing £19,500 from Swindon school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former head teacher has been banned from teaching for at least two years after he stole more than £19,500 from a school he worked at.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Burrell, 43, who was head of Ruskin Junior School in Swindon, was convicted of fraud last year.
Burrell improperly claimed and received additional pay while at the school between January 2011 and May 2013.
A teacher misconduct panel said he had breached teaching standards in a "serious and significant way".
The panel decided that he should be prohibited from teaching for a period of at least two years.
Burrell may apply for the prohibition order to be overturned in January 2019.
He was head teacher at Ruskin School between April 2010 and August 2014.
He left the school to take up a new post as head teacher at nearby Grange Federation.
Soon after, a financial audit at the school identified some irregularities, and it began an investigation before referring the matter to the police.
Burrell was arrested on 23 December 2014, and on 8 June 2015 he was charged with fraud and forging documentation to facilitate the improper payments.
He resigned from his post at Grange Federation on 31 August 2015.
In March 2016, Burrell received a suspended 12-month sentence at Swindon Crown Court.
