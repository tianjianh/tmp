[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sion Davies: Wrexham pair deny shooting and stabbing victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man died after being shot with a crossbow, stabbed and falling from a third floor balcony, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Munkley, known as Charlie, 53, and Lee Michael Roberts, 33, deny the murder of Sion Davies, 25, in the Caia Park area of Wrexham in October 2014.
Mr Munkley's wife Gwenythe, 55, also appeared in Mold Crown Court and denied attempting to pervert the course of justice.
All three defendants also face charges related to the supply of drugs.
The court heard that Mr Davies was shot at several times and "stabbed and slashed repeatedly" in a dispute over drugs.
Prosecuting barrister Mr Andrew Thomas QC told the  jury he was then chased onto a balcony and fell three floors but did not die immediately.
He said he was left undiscovered in the back yard of the flats for nearly three hours and eventually died from a combination of stab wounds and a head injury which he suffered as a result of the fall.
Mr Thomas told the court that Mr Munkley and Mr Roberts's accounts of what happened were inconsistent.
He said that Mr Munkley had claimed the deceased arrived at his flat with an unknown man with a Geordie accent.
The court was told that Mr Munkley claimed to have left the flat when the two men began fighting each other.
The prosecutor also said that Mr Munkley had claimed that his co-defendant Mr Roberts was not present.
Mr Thomas said by contrast Mr Roberts admitted he was at the flat with Mr Munkley at the time of the attack but that Mr Munkley acted alone.
"On his account, there was no Geordie male," said Mr Thomas.
In a police interview Mrs Munkley admitted that she drove her husband to Rochdale after the incident.
"She says that all she knew was what her husband told her, namely that two men had started fighting in their flat. As far as she was aware, her husband had nothing to do with it," Mr Thomas explained.
The case is continuing.
