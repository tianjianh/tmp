A new international art festival is being planned for Newcastle and Gateshead as part of a scheme to boost the arts in the north-east of England.

More than 60 organisations and people involved in art in the region have published a 10-year strategy to enhance the area's reputation in the art world.
The new festival will combine work by local and international artists and is expected to get off the ground in 2019.
That is the year after Tyneside hosts the Great Exhibition of the North.
On Tuesday, the government announced that Newcastle and Gateshead had won the contest to host the Â£5m event in summer 2018.
The new festival is separate and aims to build on the history of the Tyne International art festival, which was held in Newcastle and Gateshead in 1990 and '92.
The 10-year strategy that was published on Friday also lays out plans to draw on the area's industrial past by setting up major sculpture production facilities by 2025.
The North East Contemporary Visual Arts Network hopes to encourage more artists to live and work in the region with more studio facilities.
And the strategy says its members will work together to get more people involved in the arts in the area and raise the profile of work created in the region.
Sarah Munro, director of the Baltic art gallery in Gateshead, said: "We believe now more than ever before that the visual arts have a vital role to play in the future international profile, economic growth, social capital and political issues of the north-east."
