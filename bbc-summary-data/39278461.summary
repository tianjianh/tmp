Third-placed Pompey made light work of Grimsby in Tuesday's 4-0 win at Fratton Park with midfielder Baker scoring.
"We just feel like we're right at it at the moment," he told BBC Radio Solent. "In the dressing room, the lads are so confident over the last few weeks."
Victory opened up a six-point gap for Paul Cook's side to fourth-placed Carlisle with nine games remaining.
Three successive victories for Portsmouth have seen them keep three clean sheets and net 14 goals.
"We needed a reaction after losing at home to Crewe earlier this month and the past three games we've been tremendous," Baker, 34, added.
"It's obviously about the wins at this stage of the season, but deep down we know we've been bang at it.
"But, there's still a lot of points to play for so we need to keep taking each game at a time and we won't look at the table too much and get carried away."
