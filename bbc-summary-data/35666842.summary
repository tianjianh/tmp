The 27-year-old scored a three-point shot in a record 128th consecutive game, surpassing Kyle Korver's mark.
Curry was successful with 10 three-point shots as he scored more than 50 points for the third time this season.
The Warriors have won 52 games and lost five - Chicago Bulls hold the season record of 72-10 in 1995-96.
Curry scored 40 points in the first match of the season - the most points by a reigning MVP in an opener since 1972 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 41 for the Milwaukee Bucks.
He also became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989-90 to score 118 points in the first three games of the campaign.
