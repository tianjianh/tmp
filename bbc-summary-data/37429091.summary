Julie Kelley from the University and College Union (UCU) said 60 lecturers and other staff would be made redundant.
She claimed the cuts would "diminish the student experience".
The college, with sites in Hull, Harrogate and Goole, said it was operating in a "challenging financial climate".

The UCU said as well as the cuts to the number of lecturers the college would close its three children's nurseries, making 37 staff redundant.
The other losses would come from management, library and IT staff. The union said that 385 jobs had been lost at the college since 2011.
"This is an outrageous attack on hardworking and dedicated staff," said Ms Kelley.
"There is a lot of anger amongst staff who believe the college management is rushing into yet more job losses without fully considering alternative options."
Hull College Group said demographic factors had impacted on the number of 16-18 year olds in its catchment area.
The proposal to close the subsidised nurseries in 2016 had been taken due to the financial losses incurred, it said.
