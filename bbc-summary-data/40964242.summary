[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There have been two attacks in Spain's Catalonia region involving people driving cars at crowds at high speeds.

Here is what we know so far.
On Thursday afternoon at 16:50 local time (14:50 GMT) a white van smashed into people on Las Ramblas, a famous boulevard in central Barcelona that runs 1.2km (0.75 miles) and was packed with tourists.
The van driver is said to have zig-zagged to try and hit as many people as possible along the pedestrianised area, knocking many to the floor and sending others fleeing for cover in shops and cafes.
He killed 13 people and injured more than 100, and managed to flee the scene.
Spanish police have described it as a terror attack.
About eight hours later, an Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians in the popular seaside resort town of Cambrils, 110km (68 miles) south-west of Barcelona, authorities said.
A woman who was critically injured later died in hospital. Five other civilians and a police officer were hurt.
The attackers' vehicle overturned and five people who got out, some of whom were wearing fake suicide belts, were then shot by police. Four died at the scene and one later died of his injuries. They have not yet been named.
The Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks are believed to be linked.
A massive manhunt is under way to find Moussa Oukabir, who is thought to be 17. He is suspected of using documents belonging to his brother, Driss Oukabir, 28, to rent the van that mowed down people on Las Ramblas.
Although he is suspected of driving the van, police say that cannot yet be confirmed. It is also possible that Moussa Oukabir was one the five suspects shot dead in Cambrils, police have added.
Driss Oukabir was arrested in Ripoll, a town in Catalonia, on Thursday.
Catalonia's Interior Minister Joaquim Forn, quoted by the Associated Press, said: "We had local police on the scene, but we were unable to shoot him, as the Ramblas were packed with people."
Three others. One person from Spain's north African enclave of Melilla was arrested in Alcanar on Thursday, and two others were arrested on Friday, one in Ripoll.
Police said on Friday that three of those arrested were from Morocco and one was from Spain, but gave no details.  It remains unclear how many people were involved in the plots.
Police are linking the attacks to an explosion on Wednesday night that completely destroyed a house in Alcanar, 200km south of Barcelona, killing one person and wounding seven. The house was reportedly filled with bottles of propane and butane.
Police said on Friday that they believed the blast had thwarted plans for an even bigger attack.
"They were preparing one or several attacks in Barcelona and an explosion in Alcanar stopped this as they no longer had the material they needed to commit attacks of an even bigger scope," said Catalonia police official Josep Lluis Trapero.
In another incident, a car was driven into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona on Thursday evening.
The car was later found with a dead man inside it, but the interior ministry has denied earlier reports he was killed by police gunfire. Officials have not ruled out a connection with the Las Ramblas attack but investigations are ongoing
Also, on Thursday, not long after the first attack, a second van thought to be a getaway vehicle was found in the town of Vic, 80km north of Barcelona.

They come from all over the world, with at least 34 nationalities represented.

Francisco LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez, a 60-year-old from Granada, is the first Spanish victim to be named. Belgium said one of its citizens had been killed and Italy's foreign ministry said two Italians had died.
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that at least one US citizen had been killed.
France said 26 of its nationals were injured, 11 seriously.
The Australian government said at least four citizens were injured, while a seven-year-old boy from Sydney is reported to be missing. Thirteen German citizens were wounded, some seriously.
A "small number" of Britons were injured, the UK's Foreign Office said.
So-called Islamic State (IS) has said it was behind the Las Ramblas attack and that IS "soldiers" carried it out. But it did not provide any evidence or details to back up the claim.
The country is one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations but in recent years has not seen the kind of jihadist violence that has rocked France, the UK, Belgium and Germany.
Still, Spain has been targeted before - several trains in Madrid, the capital, were bombed by al-Qaeda inspired militants in 2004, killing 191 people.
The IS news outlet, Amaq, said the attack was carried out as part of efforts to target states fighting in the US-led anti-IS coalition.
A few hundred Spanish soldiers are in Iraq, training local forces fighting the Sunni militant group.
The number of operations carried out against jihadists has increased significantly since Spain raised its terror alert level to four out of five in June 2015, meaning there was a "high risk" of a terror attack.
Before these attacks, 51 suspected jihadists had already been detained in the country this year, while 69 were detained last year, and 75 were detained in 2015, according to El Pais.
Spain's long anti-terror experience
Security and surveillance was stepped up in the wake of truck attacks in the French city of Nice in July 2016 and the German capital Berlin in December.
On Twitter, the Spanish royal household posted: "They are murderers, nothing more than criminals who are not going to terrorise us. All of Spain is Barcelona."
World leaders have offered support and message of solidarity.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was "sickened by the senseless loss of life in Barcelona".
US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack on Twitter but has come under fire for invoking a debunked myth about a general who fought Islamist militants by using pig's blood to commit mass executions.
