The driver initially got out of the car and "even spoke to a number of people before driving away" after the crash in Handsworth on Friday, police said.
The local woman died at the scene after the crash near the Guru Nanak temple, in Soho Road, just after 17:30 GMT.
Police appealed for witnesses and said the sports-type Vauxhall Astra involved sustained "considerable" damage.
Sgt Alan Wood said early examination of CCTV film suggested the white car had a rear spoiler and black roof.
"The car would have suffered considerable front-end damage, with the bumper hanging off, and I'm sure would have caught the attention of other drivers and pedestrians," he said.
"If anyone saw a vehicle matching that description yesterday evening I'd ask them to call me. I'd also urge the driver to do the decent thing and get in touch so that he can put across his side of the story."
