[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stoke City v Watford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic is available to face Watford after serving a three-match suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ramadan Sobhi and Wilfried Bony are likely to miss out because of the Africa Cup of Nations, while Jonathan Walters is doubtful with a knee injury.
Juan Zuniga and Nordin Amrabat have joined Watford's lengthy injury list after suffering ankle and leg injuries respectively on Sunday.
However, Hornets defender Miguel Britos returns after a one-match ban.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We're giving goals up too readily. We'll address that. A lot of the elements of our play, apart from that, are very good.
We had a good result against Watford not too long back. We just need to revisit our thoughts on that one and play as well as we know we can, but clearly take out the catastrophic errors."
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: "We have 50 per cent less time to prepare than Stoke. They had more rest than us.
"It will be very difficult but I guarantee we will do everything possible to defend the badge."
One to watch from behind the settee. Stoke were competitive at Chelsea - not many teams score two at Stamford Bridge. They were also competitive at Liverpool, but no matter how you look at it they have still conceded 10 goals in three games.
Watford simply did not turn up against Tottenham at Vicarage Road, a complete non-performance, and I can see nothing but more frustration for them here.
