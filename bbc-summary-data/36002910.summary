George Boyd got the Clarets' opener when he struck from the edge of the area into the bottom corner.
Jacques Maghoma equalised after Tom Heaton could only parry on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jon Toral's effort.
Boyd's cross allowed Andre Gray to score his 24th of the season for the winner, before Toral was sent off in injury time for a second yellow card.
Sean Dyche's side have stretched their unbeaten run to 19 games as they look for an immediate return to the Premier League.
The Clarets's next game is at home to top-of-the-table Boro on Tuesday night at Turf Moor.
Burnley keeper Heaton produced smart saves from Toral and David Cotterill as they went into the break ahead, while Jonathan Grounds hit the crossbar in the second-half for Blues.
The Clarets created numerous chances themselves as Dave Jones shot wide and Ashley Barnes drilled into the side netting before Gray's side-foot volley secured three points.
Toral was dismissed in the closing moments when his challenge on Lloyd Dyer brought a second booking.

"It's frustrating because we were fantastic. We were the better team. It was a really strong performance at a difficult point of the season against an excellent Burnley side.
"Jacques Maghoma had his face kicked off in the penalty box after four minutes. It was a blatant penalty but the referee said he didn't see it.
"Probably Burnley are going to be promoted. They manage to get results in games they do not play well in. But that is a skill in itself and you have to take your hat off to them."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"George Boyd was tireless in his work and his quality was outstanding, while the response of the team after they equalised was to be admired.
"There is a great belief among the players and there is certainly energy and desire.
"We are in a good place for a reason. I was very pleased with the way we played."
