Consortium bids for £690m cancer contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £690m cancer care contract in Staffordshire is expected to be awarded to a consortium including private firms.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A leaked document said a group of organisations, also featuring two local NHS trusts, had come together and was the last remaining bidder in the process.
The BBC understands it could be led by private firm Interserve.
Pending further discussions, the deal is due to be awarded in December.
In the leaked document, clinical commissioning groups said the public-private sector consortium would "bring together a wide range of skills and expertise".
Discussions are expected to take place over the coming weeks, before an official proposal is submitted.
If successful, the consortium will co-ordinate cancer care - from diagnosis through to treatment - in the county.
Outsourcing contracts to cover both cancer and end of life care in Staffordshire were announced last year. Together, they are expected to be worth £1.2bn and cover a 10-year period.
The contracts will cover the areas controlled by Stafford and Surrounds, Cannock Chase, Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire CCGs.
Trade unions have previously described the involvement of private companies as a "huge gamble".
Campaigners are expected to hand over a petition on Thursday against awarding the contracts to the private sector.
