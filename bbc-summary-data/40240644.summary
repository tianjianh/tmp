Kelly, who has signed a two-year contract, played 32 times for the Dons as they finished 15th in England's League Two this season.
County manager Jim McIntyre told his club website: "Sean is a player I have admired for a number of years now.
"He is a left-sided player and, at 6'2", will add a real presence to our defence."
Kelly, a product of St Mirren's youth system, left the Paisley club last summer after their relegation from the top flight but returns to the Premiership after a season in England.
"Although still young at 23, Sean has lots of experience having played for St Mirren before moving south to Wimbledon," added McIntyre.
"He will be a great addition to the squad and I am delighted to get him tied up."
