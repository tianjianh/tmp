2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifiers: Evans and Flower back for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan's Ben Flower and Rhys Evans of Warrington are among the Super League players back in Wales' squad for their 2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifiers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales will face Serbia on Saturday, 15 October at Stebonheath Park, Llanelli.
John Kear's side travel to Serbia a week later and then to Monza to face Italy on Saturday, October 29.
Evans and Flower's fellow Super League stars Gil Dudson and Lloyd White also return to Wales' 29-man squad.
Warrington's Evans and Flower of Wigan could join Wales off the back of winning the Super league Grand Final on 8 October.
Flower is serving a two-match suspension after he elbowed Declan Patten but would be free to play in the Grand Final should Wigan qualify.
The big omission from head coach Kear's squad is St George Illawra's Tyson Frizell, who was not available for selection according to Wales Rugby League.
He plays for an Australian Presidents XIII v Papua New Guinea on the weekend and is tipped to switch nationalities to play for Australia in this Autumn's Four Nations series, if selected.
Wales will again be able to call upon the experience of the likes of Phil Joseph, Elliot Kear, skipper Craig Kopczak and Rhys Williams as they look to qualify for the World Cup to be held in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea next year.
Wales' 29-man provisional squad: Dan Fleming (Bradford Bulls), Dalton Grant (Dewsbury Rams), Michael Channing (Featherstone Rovers), Elliot Kear, Rhys Williams (London Broncos), Andrew Gay (Mackay Cutters), Rob Massam (North Wales Crusaders), Joe Burke (Oldham), Phil Joseph (Vice Captain) Craig Kopczak (Captain) (Salford Red Devils), Matty Fozard (Sheffield Eagles), Oliver Olds (South Logan Magpies), Courtney Davies, Connor Farrer, Ian Newbury, Christiaan Roets (South Wales Ironmen), Regan Grace, Morgan Knowles, Calvin Wellington (St Helens), Jake Emmitt, Rhodri Lloyd (Swinton Lions), Morgan Evans, Steve Parry, Lewis Reece (University of Gloucestershire All Golds), Anthony Walker (Wakefield Wildcats), Rhys Evans (Warrington Wolves), Gil Dudson, Lloyd White (Widnes Vikings) and Ben Flower (Wigan Warriors)
