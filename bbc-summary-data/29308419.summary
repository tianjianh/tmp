[SN]TITLE[SN]
Traffic delays expected in Slough for Crossrail roadworks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers are expected to face delays as work begins to remove a bridge in Berkshire for the Crossrail project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A series of roadworks in Stoke Poges Lane, Slough, have begun ahead of the removal of Horlicks Bridge.
Lane restrictions and temporary traffic lights are in place on the north side of the bridge at the junction of Simpsons Way.
This will allow BT and Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) to work on cables on behalf of Crossrail.
Horlicks Bridge will be removed at the end of November 2014, with a replacement due to be installed in April 2015.
The first Crossrail services through central London will start in late 2018.
Slough Borough Council said some delays were expected, but it was working with Crossrail and the utility companies involved to minimise disruption.
