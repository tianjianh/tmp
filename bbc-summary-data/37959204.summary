[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-1 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Michael Smith rescued a point for Portsmouth with a late equaliser at Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Smith cancelled out Daniel O'Shaughnessy's opener for Cheltenham to continue the sequence that every meeting between the clubs has finished all square.
The Robins had a penalty appeal waved away in the fourth minute after Danny Wright went down under a challenge from Michael Doyle.
Pompey's best effort of the first half was a diving header from Carl Baker well saved by Russell Griffiths four minutes before the break.
The away team started the second half strongly, Gary Roberts being played in on goal by Gareth Evans in the 47th minute, but Griffiths saved well.
Conor Chaplin then had a header blocked in the six-yard box before Kyle Bennett's shot cannoned off the left post.
Cheltenham broke the deadlock in the 65th minute when James Rowe's free-kick was helped on by Pell, nodded down by Wright and, after Pompey failed to clear, it was fired into the net by O'Shaughnessy.
Rob Dickie missed a good chance to make it 2-0 before Portsmouth levelled in the 82nd minute when Griffiths spilled Baker's cross, presenting Smith with a tap-in.
