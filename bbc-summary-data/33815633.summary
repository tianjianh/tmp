Minister for Communications Alex White will turn the first sod on Friday.
The hub will have 75 separate workspaces and will have the fastest broadband connection in Ireland when it opens in November.
It hoped that the hub will create 500 new jobs within five years. The centre will be named the Ludgate Hub, after Skibbereen native Percy Ludgate.
He was born in the area in the 1880s and is credited with developing the first portable computer.
