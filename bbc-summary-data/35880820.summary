The mother of murdered schoolgirl Paige Doherty said her family had been "devastated" and called for public help in getting "justice" for her girl.

Pamela Munro said: "We are absolutely devastated that we have lost our beautiful little girl and would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and bring justice for Paige."
The 15-year-old was last seen on Saturday morning at shops in Clydebank.
Her body was found on Monday in a wooded area near Great Western Road.
The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Duncan Sloan, said the public response to his appeal for information on Tuesday had been "encouraging".
He said officers had also carried out "significant door-to-door inquiries" and were "in the process of reviewing CCTV which may be useful to help track Paige's last movements".
Det Supt Sloan said officers were "currently working through all information...passed to the incident room over the last 24 hours".
The public is being asked for help so police can "piece together Paige's movements between Saturday 19 March and Monday 21 March", Det Supt Sloan said.
"We know that the last confirmed sighting of Paige was on Saturday morning at about 08:20 at the shop in Fleming Avenue.
"I need to hear from people who recognise her image that we have issued, and who saw her that morning.
"Paige was a very independent young lady, who would routinely make her way to work during the weekend over to Kirkintilloch from Clydebank, taking a bus into Glasgow City Centre on to Kirkintilloch."
The detective said he needed people to come forward with any information "however insignificant it may seem".
He asked: "Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area of Fleming Avenue on Saturday morning, and crucially, did you see anyone in the vicinity of Great Western Road, near to a wooded area on the A82 on Monday?
"This is a very busy route for cars, and popular with joggers and dog walkers."
Det Supt Sloan added: "I must reiterate that a team of detectives are working around the clock to try to identify who was responsible for the death of this young girl, however, we need as much information from the local community as we can in order to achieve this.
"If you have any piece of information, no matter how small, please contact the incident room and let us know."
Detectives have also announced a dedicated mobile number which people can text with any information they may have. The number is 07557 540 848.
Meanwhile, a shopkeeper who was one of the last people to see Miss Doherty alive also said he was "devastated" by Paige's death.
Mr Ahmed runs Fleming Foodstore on Fleming Avenue and knows Miss Doherty's family.
He exchanged a few words and a wave with the 15-year-old outside his store in Clydebank on Saturday morning.
Mr Ahmed told the BBC  she was "a very bubbly lassie" who was "always smiling" and "had time for everyone".
He said she "didn't deserve what she got".
Fundraising web pages set up in the past 24 hours to help Miss Doherty's family have raised more than £14,000.
Family friend Lynsay Smith set up one page and wrote: "All the money raised is to help Pamela, her mum, and Andrew, her stepdad, with any funeral arrangements and anything else to ease the pain that they are going through at this time."
Donations on the page had reached £7,300 by 14:00 on Wednesday.
A second page set up by Gail Duncan smashed the target of £3,000 within hours and had raised £6,900 by 14:00 on Wednesday.
She said the money would go to Paige's family to "spend how they see fit in honour to remember Paige".
