[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
European Union funding worth Â£215m has been officially announced for cross-border projects in western Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The funding is part of the Interreg VA programme, which will also funds projects in Northern Ireland and the Irish border region.
Groups can apply for funding for projects focused on health, sustainable transport and the environment.
Infrastructure secretary Keith Brown welcomed the funding, saying it would strengthen cross-border ties.
The Interreg programme was set up by the Special EU Programmes Body with funding from the European Regional Development Fund, and was reviewed by authorities including the European Commission and the Scottish government.
Public sector groups, government departments, voluntary and community organisations and universities and colleges will be able to apply for a share of the money, although they have to put up 15% of their project budgets themselves.
Mr Brown said he looked forward to people and communities in the west of Scotland sharing in the benefits delivered to all three regions.
He said: "This huge investment will help projects delivering healthcare, transport, environmental benefits and wider innovation, strengthening our already good cross-border links with Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland.
"Funding such as this also demonstrates quite clearly how communities in Scotland gain from being an active part of the European Union.
"Western Scotland was incorporated into the previous round of this programme in 2007 and we have already seen good results."
