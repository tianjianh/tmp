Peter Colwell, from Capel Uchaf near Clynnog Fawr, was found at the Ship Inn in Llanbedrog at 00:15 GMT on Sunday.
Det Supt Iestyn Davies said while it was being treated as a murder investigation, "we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances".
He said four of Mr Colwell's friends had been arrested and released on bail.
Mr Colwell, who was said to be a keen hunter, died at the scene. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later.
His family are being supported by specially trained officers.
Det Supt Davies said: "We are employing experts to help us establish exactly what happened and how the firearm came to be discharged.
"I would like to reassure the local community that this was an isolated incident involving local people and there is no wider threat to the public.
"We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the investigation and the firearm involved has been recovered.
"We will be consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service in due course regarding any charges that may be made.
"Our sympathies go out to Peter Colwell's family and friends at his difficult time for them all."
Mr Colwell was a former pupil at Ysgol Botwnnog.
Head teacher Dylan Minnice said: "We are deeply saddened by the tragic news of Peter's death. Peter was a quiet, pleasant pupil who always gave of his best.
"His diligence was rewarded when he won the best student award for Year 11 pupils at Coleg Glynllifon during his final year here at Ysgol Botwnnog.
"Our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends at this sad time."
Llanbedrog councillor Angela Russell said it had been a solemn weekend for the community.
"The community has had a big shock," she said.
"It's such a beautiful and quiet place and something like this has happened in the middle of the village - they can't believe it."
