[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men are facing jail terms for killing a man after they forced their way into a house in North Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reece Brunton and Liam Kippen, both 21, attacked John Hamilton, 35, at the house in Bellshill on 10 November 2015.
Brunton, who has committed dozens of offences dating back to when he was 10, faces a life term after he admitted murder. Kippen admitted the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on both men was deferred.
The court heard how the victim was attacked after a getting a message from Kippen warning him to stay away from Gemma Mooney.
Ms Mooney had once been in a relationship with Mr Hamilton but Kippen had since been in a "close friendship" with her.
Brunton and Kippen later turned up at a house where the victim was and Kippen was heard yelling: "We're coming through that door".
Prosecutor David Taylor told how Mr Hamilton was then repeatedly stabbed by Brunton who was armed with a knife.
Kippen meantime got a piece of concrete and was seen striking or trying to hit Mr Hamilton.
A woman who was near the attack yelled: "I've got three kids in here."
Brunton then said to her: "Shake my hand, its got nothing to do with you." He and Kippen then fled.
The victim did not recover from the attack in which he suffered six stab wounds.
Brunton later boasted how he had been "going mental" and had been "stabbing Hammy".
Brunton was described in court as a "habitual offender". He had crimes since the age of 10 with 28 offences dealt with by Children's Panel.
He has latterly jailed for assault and possession of a knife.
