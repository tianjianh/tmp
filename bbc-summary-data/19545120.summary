[SN]TITLE[SN]
Victory parade: Map and athletes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 800 athletes are expected to take part in the victory parade for Olympic and Paralympic competitors. They will be carried along a three-mile-route, from the City of London to the finish in The Mall, by a series of 21 floats. Find out more about the route and who will be appearing on which float below.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The floats carrying the athletes will be travelling in alphabetical order, so athletics will occupy the first  floats, with waterpolo bringing up the rear.
