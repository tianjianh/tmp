[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A legal challenge to plans to build a 103-turbine wind farm in the centre of Shetland has been adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wind farm, run by community company Viking Energy, would be one of the biggest in Scotland.
Sustainable Shetland, a group opposed to the development, launched a judicial review.
The challenge, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, has been adjourned. It is expected to resume at the end of April.
Energy Minister Fergus Ewing granted consent for the scheme in April.
Protesters claim the development is too big and would blight the landscape.
Supporters argue it would raise money for the islands, create jobs and help meet renewable energy targets.
The 370MW wind farm is aimed at powering more than 175,000 homes despite Shetland having a population of about 22,000.
It is estimated the wind farm could bring about Â£30m annual income for the local community.
