Workers were due to walk out from 21:00 GMT in a row over jobs, pay and rosters.
The RMT said "significant progress" had been made "which has enabled us to now suspend all industrial action".
A series of separate strikes by Tube maintenance workers in a dispute over safety are still planned.

Some stations would have been closed from Saturday evening until Tuesday morning had the walk-out gone ahead.
A union spokesman said: "The breakthrough has been secured through the solidarity of the workforce and their willingness to take industrial action to defend jobs and safety."
Transport for London (TfL) confirmed the strike was off but has not commented further.
