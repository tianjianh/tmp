Somerset v Warwickshire: Jamie Overton strikes twice for hosts on rain-ruined day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset just had the edge against Warwickshire as only 32.5 overs were possible on the first day of the County Championship meeting of Division One's bottom two at Taunton.

After putting on 46 for the first wicket, Warwickshire's openers were undone by the introduction of Jamie Overton into the attack.
Ian Westwood played on for 21, before Overton yorked Andy Umeed for 24.
Craig Overton removed Ian Bell for eight before an early finish on 92-3.
Having started on time, play lasted for an hour and a half in the morning session before a rain break half an hour before the scheduled lunch.
When they resumed again in early afternoon, only another 62 balls were possible.
Jonathan Trott remains at the crease on 30, accompanied by the recalled Sam Hain, who is unbeaten on eight.
Hain was one of four changes made by the struggling Bears, who gave Championship debuts to young pace bowler Grant Thornton and spinner Sukhit Singh, while bringing in 21-year-old Umeed for his first Championship appearance of the season.
Somerset fast bowler Jamie Overton:
"That has to be one of the best spells I've bowled since I came back from injury, along with my second spell in the one-day game against Hampshire when I took four wickets.
"I want to bowl in quick spells and, as long as I don't go for 10 an over, I'm pretty happy. Today I went for less than four an over so I was pleased with that.
"One thing I've worked hard on over the last few years is my control. The batsmen have to play me. I'm using my bouncer sensibly now. Batsmen now know I've got one to bowl. It's a very handy weapon."
Warwickshire first team coach Jim Troughton told BBC WM:
"With both teams sitting at the bottom of the table this is an intriguing fixture with a lot to play for.
"Any time you can get Ian Bell out is good for the opposition and Craig Overton bowled well for Somerset in that spell after the rain break.
"There looks to be a bit on offer for the bowlers if you put it in the right areas."
