Turkish club Antalyaspor have dropped Samuel Eto'o from their squad until further notice in a row over the striker's comments on social media.

Former Cameroon captain Eto'o, 35, wrote on his Instagram account: "Perhaps some people do not feel respect for me because I am black."
Eto'o later made a second post denying the criticism was aimed at Antalyaspor chairman Ali Safak Ozturk.
Ozturk had criticised Eto'o for his performances earlier in the season.
He said at the time: "No player is above the interests of Antalyaspor. Everyone must know their place."
Eto'o called Ozturk his "brother" in his second Instagram post, adding that the Turkish people had supported him "wholeheartedly".
"My message was to a person who criticises me unjustly for years and while he continues his criticisms, I kept winning trophies," the former Barcelona, Chelsea and Everton player wrote.
The Turkish club issued a statement stating Eto'o would have a separate training programme until his case was heard by their executive board.
Three-time Champions League winner Eto'o moved to Antalyaspor in June 2015 as the keystone of the club's bid in the southern Mediterranean resort city to find national and even European success.
But his stint has turned sour in the past weeks amid intense rumours in the close season that he would join Istanbul arch rivals Besiktas.
Tensions have been compounded by a poor start to the new season for Antalyaspor, who have taken only one point from four matches.
