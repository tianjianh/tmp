[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-4 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Danny Hylton double helped Luton move up to fourth in League Two as they thrashed Yeovil at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hylton's 21st and 22nd goals of the campaign were followed by a Glen Rea header and a late Pelly Ruddock strike as the Hatters extended their unbeaten run to six games.
After prolonged Luton pressure, Isaac Vassell was brought down in the area by Bevis Mugabi in the seventh minute and Hylton duly converted the spot-kick.
The Hatters striker grabbed his second on the contest in the 31st minute, this time played in by Stephen O'Donnell during an incisive breakaway and he rounded goalkeeper Artur Krysiak before slotting it in.
Poor defending was the story of the Glovers' afternoon and they were punished again 10 minutes into the second half when Rea was given space in the box to head an Alan Sheehan free-kick back across the goal and into the far corner.
Ruddock then rounded off a great day for the visitors with five minutes left by slotting in past Krysiak.
