Sherlock has come out on top again - this time in a worldwide poll of most popular BBC television characters.

Actor Benedict Cumberbatch said he was "honoured" to see his portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuth voted top by viewers in seven countries.
He continued: "Who would have thought a high-functioning sociopath could be so popular... all over the world?"
Another poll of iconic BBC moments saw Sherlock seemingly falling to his death score more than a quarter of the vote.
That put the ending of 2012's Reichenbach Fall episode streets ahead of Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch, its closest competitor.
The BBC Worldwide Showcase poll surveyed more than 7,000 people from Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States.
Almost 30% of respondents put Sherlock Holmes top, ahead of the Doctor of Doctor Who fame, Idris Elba's Luther, Fawlty Towers' Basil and Top Gear's Stig.
Ab Fab's Patsy Stone is the highest ranking woman in the list - though that may change if the next Doctor is female, or if it turns out The Stig has been keeping something from us.
Other characters on the Top 10 include Edmund Blackadder, Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances and the Vicar of Dibley.
Basil Fawlty makes another appearance in the Top 10 of most iconic BBC moments, thanks to the Gourmet Night episode in which he attacks his car.
Other moments singled out include Colin Firth's Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in Pride and Prejudice and David Brent's "dancing" in The Office.
BBC Worldwide's Paul Dempsey said the poll demonstrated "the love and affection audiences have for our shows around the world".
