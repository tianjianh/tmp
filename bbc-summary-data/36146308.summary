England's Moeen Ali made an unbeaten century on day four as Worcestershire drew with Gloucestershire at Bristol.

Resuming on 217-6, 186 ahead, the hosts declared on 382-7 after tons from Chris Dent (138 not out) and Jack Taylor.
Needing 352 to win from 63 overs, the visitors then lost Brett D'Oliveira and Daryl Mitchell to Liam Norwell and were 49-3 when Josh Shaw bowled Joe Clarke.
But Moeen's 136 not out calmed any fear of defeat, leaving both sides still waiting for a first victory of 2016.
Moeen's day did not start too well when his first over was hit for 21 runs by Dent and Taylor, who was eventually out for 105 off 103 balls.
The 28-year-old all-rounder finished with figures of 0-49 from eight overs, but then made an impact with the bat, taking his tally of runs to 210 in the match to secure Worcestershire's second draw of the season.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"If I was an England selector who had come to watch, you'd have seen a really good match with some quality cricket played and possibly the draw is a fair result in the end.
"It has been terribly cold for the people watching but the ones who braved it for four days have seen a really interesting game of Division Two cricket.
"Chris Dent's second innings knock for them was outstanding and Jack Taylor struck them out of trouble with some really lusty blows. He is a very clean striker of the ball.
"In the first innings, Hamish Marshall was outstanding with his knock but our two boys who got hundreds, Joe Clarke and Moeen Ali, played well too. It was intriguing stuff."
