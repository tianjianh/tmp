Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale has compared full-back Craig Woodman with German great Franz Beckenbauer.

Woodman, 33, impressed in a depleted Exeter defence as City beat Cheltenham 3-1 to register their seventh away win of the season, joint best in League Two, and move up to 17th in the table.
"Craig Woodman's playing like Beckenbauer, he's just unbelievable at the moment," Tisdale told BBC Devon.
"I think he could have played with a broken arm he was that good."
Beckenbauer famously played part of a 1970 World Cup semi-final for West Germany against Italy with his arm strapped up after dislocating his shoulder.
Exeter are unbeaten in their last three games, although they have still to win at home since April and have been in the relegation places for much of the season.
But Tisdale said his players' attitude has impressed him even when the going has been tough.
"We've played well at home recently, we've been playing generally very well and I'm very positive about the things that could happen in the next couple of months," he added.
"I've never had a group of players so committed and receptive as this group, never.
"There's been no dissent, there's been no ego, they're selfless and they're committed and they'll get there in the end."
