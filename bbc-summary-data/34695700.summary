The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Sunday showed that factory activity unexpectedly shrank in October to 49.8, below the 50-point mark, which suggests contraction.
It is also marks the third consecutive month of contraction in manufacturing.
The Shanghai Composite closed down 1.7% to 3,325.08, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 1.2% at 22,370.04.
A private survey, which focuses on smaller to mid-size firms, also showed on Monday that factory activity fell for the eighth month in a row in October, but it was an improvement from the previous month.
The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI was up to 48.3, from 47.2 in September.
Angus Nicholson, market analyst at trading firm IG, said manufacturing activity in China should pick up in the last few months of the year.
"The key takeaway from the manufacturing PMIs is that activity in China has stabilised in the wake of significant monetary easing and fiscal spending," he said in a note.
