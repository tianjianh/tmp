Oxfordshire NHS waiting times warning over £180m savings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxfordshire's NHS needs to "modernise" and find almost £180m of savings or patients could face longer waiting times, a health boss has warned.

The chairman of the county's Clinical Commissioning Group said the local NHS needs to become more efficient by 2020 in response to rising demand.
Dr Joe McManners said there was also pressure from central government to cut health budgets.
A public consultation into the savings will be launched in the autumn.
Dr McManners told the BBC the county's NHS needs to save £176m over four years, or health providers "would have to start prioritising what treatments are available".
He added they were hoping to move to a system that tries to prevent issues before they happen, rather than treating them afterwards.
This includes developing community services, delivering care closer to home and trying to reduce demand for hospital care.
There will be a series of meetings and drop-in events over the coming months.
An Oxfordshire Transformation Board was established last year between NHS trusts, GP federations, and Oxfordshire County Council.
Health bosses said the consultation will decide the future of a number of Oxfordshire NHS services, including Wantage Community Hospital.
