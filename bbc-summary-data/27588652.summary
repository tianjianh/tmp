North Bristol NHS Trust said more than 500 patients, some critically ill, were moved from old buildings at Southmead and Frenchay hospitals.
Trust chairwoman Andrea Young, admitted the building had some "teething problems" which led to a number of operations being rescheduled.
These continued on Wednesday morning after fire alarms activated.
The alarms prompted a partial evacuation of public areas for more than 30 minutes but no inpatients were affected.
Avon Fire and Rescue Service confirmed one fire engine was sent to the site from the nearby Southmead station to assess the situation.
It is believed the alarm was activated by smoke from a toaster.
Ms Young said the hospital was working with contractors to adjust the sensitivity of the sensors.
Last week 180 operations were rescheduled.
The trust said this was because adjustments had to be made to a "high-tech air flow system" that helps to eliminate infection risks.
Ms Young said the hospital's theatre capacity was now "getting back on track".
"All emergency and urgent work did go ahead, along with some routine operations," she said.
"I'd like to offer sincere apologies to those affected and assure them that their operation will be rebooked as quickly as possible."
The accident and emergency department was among the first department to move in on 19 May.
So far this week Southmead has treated 15 "major trauma cases" including seven transferred from other hospitals in the area.
