Rolf Harris faces sexual offences retrial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former TV star Rolf Harris will face a retrial over three alleged sexual assaults and one new charge of indecent assault, a prosecutor at Southwark Crown Court has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Harris has pleaded not guilty to the new charge.
Last week, a jury cleared him of three sexual assault charges but failed to return a verdict on four counts.
The 86-year-old will not face a retrial on one of the four counts that the jury could not reach a verdict on.
After deliberating for just under a week, the jury found Mr Harris not guilty of indecently assaulting a young autograph hunter on a visit to a Portsmouth radio station with her mother at the end of the 1970s.
He was also cleared of groping a blind, disabled woman at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London in 1977, and sexually assaulting a woman in her 40s after filming a TV show in 2004.
Judge Alistair McCreath discharged the jury from deliberating on the further four counts Mr Harris was accused of.
His retrial will take place on 15 May.
