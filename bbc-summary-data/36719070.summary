Taylor, who has played nine events on the senior ITF tour this year and lost in qualifying at the WTA event in Birmingham, was pleased to progress against Stefanini in windy conditions in south-west London.
"It didn't quite go the way the score showed as she was very difficult to play against," the British number nine told BBC South Today.
"I managed to get through it well and play the right tactics. For me there is no pressure as I am enjoying every minute on court."
Elsewhere in the girls' singles, Hindhead's Jodie Burrage lost to Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 7-5 4-6 6-2 and Leeds' Francesca Jones was beaten by the American fifth seed Kayla Day 4-6 7-5 6-1.
