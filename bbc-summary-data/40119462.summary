[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tracy Louise Haley and Darren Lowe, of Bagillt, Flintshire, died after the accident on the A543 near Pentrefoelas on 27 February 2016.
Shaun Goldstraw, 21, from Leek, Staffordshire, admitted two charges of causing death by dangerous driving at Mold Crown Court.
Judge Niclas Parry said he had used the road "as a racetrack".
Miss Haley, 49, was pronounced dead at the scene, while Mr Lowe, 43, died more than a month later as a result of his injuries.
Goldstraw was also seriously injured in the crash.
Judge Parry said Goldstraw was using a route known as the "Evo Triangle", near the Denbigh Moors, to test his vehicle.
He reached "grossly excessive" speeds of 107 mph and was "totally out of control" of his car.
It was the "most serious example" of death by dangerous driving and had left families "utterly devastated".
His "utterly selfish actions caused the deaths of two people", the judge added.
"This was deliberate risk-taking for thrills."
Goldstraw has also been banned from driving for 12 years, to start after he is released from prison.
After the hearing, Miss Haley's sister Debbie Orme said her family was "pleased" that Goldstraw's sentence "does try and reflect the seriousness of what happened" but added: "We're angry with him.
"We just feel that whatever the sentence....it's never going to bring our family members back.
"It's just devastated all of us."
Mr Lowe's sister Michelle Naden said: "I just miss them both dearly. They were just amazing people."
Insp Dave Cust from North Wales Police' Roads Policing Unit said Goldstraw had visited the area on the day of the crash as part of an organised car meet.
"A motor vehicle can be very dangerous in the wrong hands, and Goldstraw proved he did not have the experience, skill or maturity to drive in a safe and responsible manner," he said.
"Two people needlessly lost their lives because of his reckless actions and this sentence should serve as a deterrent to those who choose to drive in this manner."
