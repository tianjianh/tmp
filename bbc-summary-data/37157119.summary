[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The "jury's out" on the economic realities of Brexit, a Welsh Government minister has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Welsh Labour and others in the referendum Remain campaign warned of economic damage from a Leave vote.
But skills minister Julie James told BBC Radio Wales the economy "seems to be even-keeling at the moment".
A majority of Welsh voters backed leaving the European Union, contrary to the stance of the Labour-led Welsh Government.
In July, First Minister Carwyn Jones told AMs there were "already worrying economic signs stemming from the EU vote, which could have a serious knock on effect on the public finances".
Prior to the referendum Mr Jones warned Brexit would hit Welsh jobs.
Speaking on Good Evening Wales, Ms James, who was discussing changes to reduce the subsidy to firms involved in Jobs Growth Wales, said: "At the moment of course the jury's out about what the economic realities of Brexit might be.
"The market has wobbled quite substantially but it seems to be even-keeling at the moment."
