British Cycling has revealed that David Millar, the former British road race champion who served a two-year doping ban, is mentoring its academy riders.

Miller served his ban from 2004 to 2006 after admitting using blood-boosting agent EPO early in his career.
The 39-year-old returned to the sport and has volunteered to educate Britain's young riders.
Technical director Shane Sutton said "nurturing an anti-doping culture" was at the heart of British Cycling.
Millar won stages in road cycling's three most prestigious stage races - the Tour de France, Vuelta a Espana and Giro d'Italia - and also won 2010 Commonwealth gold for Scotland in the road race time trial.
The Scot, who retired in 2014, is regarded as one of the sport's leading anti-doping campaigners.
Sutton added: "Having someone of David's calibre on board to support us in this education process is invaluable. He is readily available to share his well-rounded experiences as a professional cyclist to the young riders who aspire to succeed in their careers.
"David will work with the squad on a voluntary basis until the end of the month with a view to subsequently joining the team in a more official capacity."
