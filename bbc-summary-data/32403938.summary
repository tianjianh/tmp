Leading 2-1 from the first leg, Carlos Bacca extended the Spanish club's cushion with a penalty before Zenit's Salomon Rondon and a sublime 40-yard finish from Hulk levelled things.
But substitute Kevin Gameiro's 86th-minute equaliser sent Sevilla through.
Italian clubs Fiorentina and Napoli, and Ukraine's Dnipro, are also through.
Uefa had announced that Russian and Ukrainian clubs would be prevented from meeting in the semi-finals if they advanced, in light of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
But Ukraine's Dynamo Kiev joined Zenit in exiting the tournament.
Sevilla, though, remain on course to win Europe's second tier competition for the fourth time in nine years.
It was far from comfortable for Unai Emery's team in Russia as Zenit, managed by former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas, pushed them all the way.
All seemed to be going well when Bacca scored from the spot after Vitolo was brought down by Luis Neto.
Rondon equalised early in the second half before Brazilian Hulk scored a spectacular long-range goal after spotting keeper Beto off his line.
But with the tie heading for extra-time, Gameiro connected with Vitolo's cross to put the tie out of Zenit's reach.
Fiorentina, who overcame Tottenham earlier in the competition, secured a 3-1 aggregate win over Dynamo Kiev.
The Ukrainian visitors had arrived in Italy with hopes of making it through after a 1-1 draw in the first leg.
But goals by Mario Gomez and Juan Manuel Vargas put the game out of reach, Kiev finishing with 10 men after Jeremain Lens was sent off.
Napoli coach Rafael Benitez remains on course to win the competition for the second time in three seasons.
The Spaniard - who won the title with Chelsea in 2013 - saw his side held 2-2 by Wolfsburg, with Jose Maria Callejon and Dries Mertens scoring for the hosts before two goals in three minutes by Timm Klose and Ivan Perisic earned the Germans a creditable draw.
However, the Italians still advanced 6-3 on aggregate.
Dnipro, who have never won a major European trophy, advanced 1-0 on aggregate against Club Brugge after an 82nd-minute winner in Ukraine by Yevgen Shakhov.
