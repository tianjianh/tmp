Queen Rania of Jordan has published a cartoon as a riposte after Charlie Hebdo linked the drowned Syrian child Alan Kurdi with migrants accused of sex attacks in Germany.

The French satirical magazine's cartoon shows a man chasing a woman and says Alan would have grown up into a "groper in Germany".
It was widely accused of racism.
But Queen Rania posted a cartoon by Jordanian cartoonist Osama Hajjaj on social media showing Alan as a doctor.
"Alan could've been a doctor, a teacher, a loving parent," she wrote.
The Charlie Hebdo cartoon followed the revelation that gangs of migrants carried out organised sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve.
Has Charlie Hebdo legacy gone sour?

Alan's relatives in Canada said they were disgusted at Charlie Hebdo's cartoon.
However, some people have interpreted it as mocking the media for how quickly it switches from positive to negative stereotypes.
The magazine has put Alan Kurdi in a number of cartoons over recent months, including one that showed the boy's body washed up on the beach next to a McDonald's advertisement with the caption: "So close".
The photograph of two-year-old Alan lying face down on a beach in Turkey caused an international outcry over the human cost of the migrant crisis.
