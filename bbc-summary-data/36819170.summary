The Alzheimer's Society report calculates that of the 45,000 people with dementia in Wales, 17,000 live in rural areas.
It said this brings extra challenges for those with the disease as access to support services is likely to be more difficult.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said he was committed to helping those people.
The report makes six recommendations, including calling on the Welsh Government to invest in research to understand the problem, and identifying links between rural dementia and Welsh language.
Mr Jones said he wanted to set out his commitment to helping people in rural Wales with dementia "lead more fulfilling and inclusive lives".
Sue Phelps, director of Alzheimer's Society in Wales said the 17,000 figure was a "crude estimate" and it was "likely this figure is much higher".
"Research is desperately needed to ascertain the extent of the problem to enable us to plan and deliver effective information, support and care services that are accessible and responsive to need," she said.
