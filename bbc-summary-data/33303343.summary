Joshua Bonehill, of Hudson Road, Yeovil, was arrested in Somerset on Thursday in an operation with Avon and Somerset Police, the Met said.
It came as part of an operation ahead of a planned march in the Golders Green area of the capital on 4 July.
Mr Bonehill, 22, is due at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday.
In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: "Officers continue to assess all information and intelligence available in relation to the proposed demonstration and speak with the organisers to ensure an appropriate policing response is in place.
"We are aware of concerns in the local community about the negative impact this proposed demonstration may have on them.
"We are working with residents to ensure that people can exercise their rights in a way that is lawful, while minimising this impact."
