Ex Swansea Striker, Lee Trundle has years of football experience and he definitely put them to good use to score this penalty during a charity game.
Lee went to shoot but put in his own little trick to throw off the keeper who definitely didn't see it coming!
Check out the video to see Lee being a little bit of a show off, but he's a show off with skill and imagination for sure...
