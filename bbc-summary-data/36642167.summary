Tofilau, 20, has been training with the club and was named in the squad for the Melrose Sevens, scoring in the final as Edinburgh won the tournament.
He has been playing club rugby with Scottish National League Division 2 side Kirkcaldy since October.
"I'm really excited to be involved at the club and I'm grateful to the coaches for putting faith in me," Tofilau told the Edinburgh website.
"Hopefully, I can return the favour in the way I train and play.
Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons added: "We are delighted to welcome Sasa to the club.
"He is a talented young player who has represented Australia at under-20 level.
"I have no doubt he will make his mark at Edinburgh and look forward to working with him."
