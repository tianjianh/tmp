Philippe Montanier: Nottingham Forest boss "tired" of constant transfer speculation

Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier says speculation about the future of Reds duo Dorus de Vries and Britt Assombalonga is tiresome.

Goalkeeper De Vries, 35, reportedly had a medical at Celtic on Friday having been photographed in Glasgow.
Like De Vries, 23-year-old striker Assombalonga - linked with a move to Norwich - was left out of the Reds side that lost to Brighton on Friday.
"I'm a little tired about the speculation," Montanier said.
Talking to BBC Radio Nottingham after the loss at the Amex Stadium, the Frenchman continued: "I want to try digest this defeat, the rest is not important and for me is not a problem.
"What we need is good players, as we saw this evening, if we are to have ambitions for the Championship."
Montanier insists that Assombalonga, who scored twice in the Reds' season-opening win against Burton Albion seven days earlier, was injured earlier on Friday and would likely return for Forest in time for Tuesday's trip to Brentford.
