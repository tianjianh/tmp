[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Orhan Koca, 32, who is originally from Turkey, denies murdering 22-year-old Mr Magee Jr, in west Belfast on 30 May.
A detective said police were concerned about the defendant absconding.
"Given the likelihood that a conviction would result in a significant sentence, this increases the chance of absconding," he said.
"In recent months several thousand pounds has gone through the defendant's account.
"This access to funds would give him the means to flee justice."
The detective said he was also concerned about interference with witnesses.
"The defendant is aware of several witnesses," he said. "The opportunity to interfere with evidence would be very real."
A prosecuting lawyer told Lisburn Magistrates Court that on 30 May, at 2.38am, police were called to Summerhill Park in west Belfast.
They found Mr Magee Jr lying in the road and bleeding heavily from stab wounds.
"Mr Magee had been at the home of his girlfriend, Miss Courtney Ward, and at 2am they ordered a pizza," said the prosecution.
"Shortly after 2.30am, Mr Magee Jr left the house by the rear exit and his girlfriend then heard screaming outside.
"When she left the house she saw two men standing over Mr Magee Jr trying to help him."
The lawyer outlined how Miss Ward was the estranged partner of the defendant and that she had started a relationship with the victim.
The court also heard that jeans, covered in Mr Magee Jr's blood, had been recovered from Beckett's Bar, where the defendant both worked and stayed.
The jeans were found close to items of clothing belonging to Mr Koca.
A defence solicitor said that the defendant had no criminal record in the UK.
Mr Koca was remanded in custody to reappear before Lisburn Magistrates Court on 6 July.
