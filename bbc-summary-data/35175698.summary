A Japanese court has paved the way for two more of the country's nuclear reactors to be restarted.

The Fukui District Court lifted an injunction that had blocked the reopening of two reactors operated by Kansai Electric Power in the western city of Takahama.
The injunction was issued after locals argued the reactors could not withstand a strong earthquake.
Japan closed all its nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.
The Takahama plants had already obtained approval from the country's nuclear watchdog.
"Today's two rulings show a recognition that safety has been ensured at Talahama Nuclear Power Station," Kansai said.
It aims to restart the reactors next month.
The vast majority of Japan's nuclear reactors remain closed - according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the country's nuclear generating capacity is running at less than 5% of its full potential.
The government is keen to restart more reactors, which before the Fukushima disaster supplied about 30% of the country's power.
Japan has been forced to import fossil fuels to make up the shortfall.
