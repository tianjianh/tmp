[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slater (119) was assisted by Billy Godleman (42) as Derbyshire eased to their target of 217 inside 42 overs.
Earlier, Durham slipped to 75-7 with only Mark Stoneman (22) in the top six reaching double figures, as Shiv Thakor (3-36) proved a constant menace.
Ryan Pringle then made 125 from 101 balls - his highest limited-overs score - to help Durham reach 216 all out.
Sunderland-born Pringle, whose previous highest score in one-day cricket was 35, scored more than half of Durham's runs and smashed four sixes and 16 fours.
He put on 62 for the 10th wicket in 6.1 overs with number 11 Chris Rushworth, who ended unbeaten on three.
In reply, Slater and Godleman shared a first-wicket stand of 105 before Godleman's 53-ball knock was brought to an end by Usman Arshad.
Slater hit a six and 17 fours in his 137-ball innings, passing his previous limited-overs best of 57 which was made in Twenty20.
He was caught in the deep by Pringle going for a big shot to win the game off Stoneman, who was bowling his first over in 53 games of List A cricket.
