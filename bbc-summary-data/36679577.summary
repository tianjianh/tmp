The bodies were found at 11:30 BST after neighbours rang the emergency services.
Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said: "This was a tragic, isolated incident and one which I know has caused concern within the wider community.
"Investigations are ongoing. However, we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths."
The parents of Ms Nash issued a statement, which said: "We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter and request that we are left in peace to grieve her death."
Hertfordshire Police made a mandatory referral of the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because they had prior contact with the deceased.
The commission said it would decide whether to investigate the police response in due course.
