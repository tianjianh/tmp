The 23-year-old left-back has agreed a three-year deal with the R's.
Bidwell scored three goals in 211 appearances in almost five years at Griffin Park, which included two spells on loan from Everton.
"Jake's a player we've been tracking for a while," Rangers manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink said.
"This is a real statement for us in terms of attracting a really solid, dependable Championship player who had his pick of other clubs at this level."
Bidwell captained the Bees last season as Dean Smith's side finished ninth in the Championship, three places above QPR.
The defender becomes QPR manager Hasselbaink's third signing of the summer, following the arrivals of midfielder Ariel Borysiuk and centre-back Joel Lynch at Loftus Road.
