[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The winner is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, on behalf of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's estate, and awarded to whoever "shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses".
Over the years, 10 individuals from Africa have been honoured for their efforts:
"The Nobel Committee for the second time chose a prize-winner who was being persecuted by his own authorities"
"After having taken the initiative in negotiating a peace treaty between the two countries"
"The Committee has attached importance to Desmond Tutu's role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa"
"For their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa"
"For their work for a better organised and more peaceful world"
"For her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace"
"For their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way"
"For their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work"
"For its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011."
