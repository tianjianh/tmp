[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Truncheons, handcuffs and the dying words of two murderers are among artefacts documenting the history of crime and punishment in Cambridge.

The new exhibition at the Museum of Cambridge on Castle Street includes some items never seen by the public.
It features reports of some of those imprisoned in both the County Gaol where the county council offices now stand and the Borough Gaol on Gonville Place, where the YMCA stands.
The exhibition runs until July.
County Gaol, on the site of the city's Norman castle, was constructed between 1802 and 1807. It was used until 1915 and was finally demolished in 1928.
Shire Hall, the council headquarters on Castle Street was constructed using some of the old prison bricks.
The Borough - or Town - Gaol overlooking Parker's Piece, was built in 1829 and pulled down in 1878.
The YMCA and a multi-storey car park now occupy the site.
Among those who passed through the penal system were a pair of murderous lovers, Elias Lucas and Mary Reader.
They were hanged at County Gaol on 13 April 1850 for killing Susan Lucas. The unfortunate wife of Elias - and sister of Mary - was poisoned with arsenic to enable her killers to marry.
Instead, they were hanged together in the prison courtyard.
Others escaped the ultimate punishment and were instead deported.
John Frederick Mortlock, 33, described as a "gentleman of Cambridge" was sentenced to "21 years' transportation" in 1842 after being found guilty of attempting to murder a man with a pistol.
As late as 1942 what might appear to be severe sentences for minor criminal acts were still being handed out.
Jesse Whitehead, a 26-year-old plumber from Kent, was jailed for a year for stealing a silk handkerchief from a member of Queen's College in the city.
Some of the items on show have been brought out of storage at the museum while many others have been donated either by descendants of the original owners, or collectors.
