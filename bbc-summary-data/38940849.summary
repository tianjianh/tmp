[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 0-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport ended a run of five straight defeats with a solid National League point on the road at Woking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sandgrounders dug in resolutely from the start and set out to be hard to beat.
Gozie Ugwu and Max Kretzschmar missed with half-chances as the visitors failed to make a breakthrough in the first half.
The away side's approach showed great maturity despite their bad run of results, and they could easily have snatched a second-half winner.
Liam Nolan released Lindon Meikle whose strike drifted just wide of goal, while Andrai Jones also brought a good save from Woking stopper Michael Poke towards the end.
