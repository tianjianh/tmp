Worcestershire-based fairground operator Henry Danter has been in talks with the owners and the Vale of Glamorgan council this week.
The council said it wanted the site to continue to be used "and enhanced" for leisure purposes.
The fair has been an attraction since 1920 and had 400,000 visitors over a bank holiday at its peak in 1934.
In recent years it found new fame with the TV comedy Gavin and Stacey after featuring in the BBC show, but the attraction has struggled after the nearby Butlins holiday camp closed 18 years ago.
There was an application for restaurants, a cinema, bowling alley and 124 flats on the site two years ago.
But senior councillors have been keen to include a "vibrant fairground".
They have been helping to bring together the owners Hilco and businessman Ian Rogers with an investor.
Councillors last month admitted progress had been "at times frustrating" and "slow" while the site was turning into an eyesore.
Last month, debris was blown from the funfair, temporarily closing surrounding roads.
Officials said it was "puzzling" that the first phase of the most recent plans mostly involved housing.
"We have made it clear to the applicant on several occasions that any redevelopment has to have regard to the future use of the funfair site," said director of development services Rob Thomas.
"To this end, how and when the funfair site is brought forward is of utmost importance, and these are discussions that we continue to progress."
Mr Danter, who runs Treasure Island fairground in Stourport-on-Severn, visited the fair as a child and has 50 years fairground experience.
