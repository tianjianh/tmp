Jeremy Corbyn's communications chief claims the Labour leader's preparations for Prime Minister's Questions are being leaked by his own staff.

In a fly-on-the-wall documentary, Seumas Milne said the "annoying" leaks from his top team were handing an advantage to the Conservatives.
Mr Corbyn also criticises the media coverage of his party.
Vice News followed Labour's leader for eight weeks, including the row over anti-Semitism and May's elections.
The film, Jeremy Corbyn: The Outsider, shows Mr Corbyn's inner circle rehearsing for his weekly PMQs bout with David Cameron.
After the two leaders have clashed over the government's academy plans, Mr Milne tells the Vice reporter: "This time they did (know the questions) because it leaked. It leaked from that meeting.
"It's very annoying because it only happens about a third of the time, but it obviously gives them a little bit of extra time.
"Whenever there is a leak it gives them that advantage - it gives them the advantage on TV as well."
Mr Corbyn also hit out at the BBC over the local elections, claiming "the whole narrative" had been that "Corbyn's going to lose" and saying an unnamed group of political commentators were "shallow, facile and ill-informed".
In other footage, the leader's aides discuss their attempts to ensure he dresses smartly and watch him pose for a succession of photographs with supporters.
Mr Corbyn is also shown reacting to the suspension of Ken Livingstone from the party after the former London mayor invoked Hitler in a defence of an MP's comments about Israel.
