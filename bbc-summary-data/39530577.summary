[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Stuart Broad warmed up for a busy international summer with three wickets for Nottinghamshire against his former county Leicestershire.

The paceman's haul (3-45) included the hosts' top scorer Mark Cosgrove (57), giving long-serving wicketkeeper Chris Read his 1,000th first-class catch.
Ben Raine (55 not out) and Clint McKay (33) sparked a home fightback from 169-8 to 251 all out with a stand of 81.
The visitors then reached 52-1 in reply at the close, losing Greg Smith (11).
Like Broad, Australia international James Pattinson could be pleased with his efforts on the opening day of the Championship season, finishing with 3-55 on his Nottinghamshire debut after skipper Read had decided against a toss and elected to bowl first.
The defiant ninth-wicket stand between Raine and McKay was the only partnership of the hosts' first innings to pass 50 as Leicestershire, who were deducted 16 County Championship points for disciplinary offences on Thursday, struggled with the bat.
