They could replace injured pair Calum Chambers and George Friend, but unsettled playmaker Gaston Ramirez will not be involved.
West Brom defender Jonny Evans is likely to miss a fourth successive game because of a calf injury.
Recent signing Jake Livermore awaits his full debut but is expected to be among the substitutes again.
Alistair Mann: "In the pack of clubs immediately above the drop zone, Middlesbrough's recent form of five league games without a win is genuine cause for concern.
"It's easy to identify one of the main reasons for their recent difficulties, having failed to score in five of their last eight matches, a statistic which has maintained their unwanted position as the division's lowest scorers.
"Aitor Karanka has attempted to address that issue with the recent acquisitions of Patrick Bamford and Rudy Gestede.
"Eighth-placed West Brom will arrive with few of the anxieties inhibiting their hosts.
"Tony Pulis' greater concern of late has concerned his quest for new signings. He is resigned to dealing only in the loan market and expects to conclude any transfer business before Tuesday's kick-off."

Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka on the transfer window: "I said I wanted to improve the squad and at the minute we didn't.
"I tried my best. I need to trust in the club. The only thing I can do is put players on the pitch."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "It will be difficult on Tuesday, Middlesbrough are a good team, especially at home. The supporters are fanatical and make it very hard for you.
"What we need to do is maintain our standards. We've moved up a level this year and now we're in a pool competing against West Ham and Everton."
I am going to go for an away win here. Middlesbrough's home form is improving but West Brom are in a good place at the moment and are looking to cement their place in the top 10.
