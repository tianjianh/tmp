[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 0-0 Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich failed to score for the third successive league game as they played out a goalless draw with Brighton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was also Town's second successive goalless draw at home, while Brighton were unable to extend a three-game winning run and climb into the top two.
Dale Stephens was dismissed in the closing 10 minutes for the Seagulls for a second booking when he fouled Jonathan Douglas on the halfway line.
Douglas did have the ball in the net in the first half, but was ruled offside.
Ipswich have now scored just four times in their past nine Championship games, but have kept three successive clean sheets at home.
The closest Mick McCarthy's side came to breaking the deadlock were long-range shots before half-time from both Cole Skuse and Jonas Knudsen.
But neither really troubled David Stockdale in the Brighton goal on a relatively quiet night for the former Ipswich loanee.
Brighton's best chance fell to centre-back Shane Duffy on the hour, but the former Blackburn man failed to keep his shot from 12 yards under the crossbar.
