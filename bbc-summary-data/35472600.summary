Steve McNamara: England head coach leaves as contract not renewed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England head coach Steve McNamara has left the post after the Rugby Football League decided not to renew his deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McNamara's contract expired at the end of last year, following England's 2-1 series victory over New Zealand.
The 44-year-old Englishman was appointed in 2010 and combined the role with his job at Sydney Roosters, where he remains assistant coach.
It was revealed earlier this week that Australian Wayne Bennett has been offered a role with England.
The 66-year-old Brisbane Broncos boss is the most successful coach in Australian rugby league history, with seven Grand Final wins.
The BBC understands McNamara's replacement will be announced on Tuesday.
An RFL statement read: "Steve McNamara has been the longest-serving national coach in our history and it is undoubtedly the case that the national team and set-up have moved on considerably under Steve's leadership.
"We would like to place on record our thanks to Steve for his considerable efforts over the years to both the England senior team and the underlying programme. He leaves with our very best wishes and on a high, after a series win over New Zealand."
England were runners-up at the Four Nations in 2011, and McNamara also led them to the semi-finals of the Rugby League World Cup in 2013.
