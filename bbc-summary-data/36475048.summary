Town beat AZ Alkmaar and lifted the trophy after the second leg in Amsterdam.
Butcher played in the Ipswich team which won the cup final on aggregate after a 3-0 win at Portman Road followed by a 4-2 defeat in Holland.
He has been part of a charity cycling team which made a 260-mile round trip to Holland to commemorate the victory.
They were raising money for Prostate Cancer UK and for the Ipswich Town Academy.
