Police warn cyclists against using Inverness footpaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have asked cyclists to stay off footpaths in Inverness after receiving complaints about near misses between people on bikes and pedestrians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The complaints were about cyclists travelling at speed on pedestrian routes in and around the city centre.
Police they had traditionally applied discretion around the issue.
But after getting a number of complaints, Police Scotland has decided to remind cyclists that it is an offence to use footpaths.
Insp Jill Moss said: "Whilst we can understand that some cyclists may not feel safe or comfortable cycling on busy roads, we would urge people to refrain from cycling on footpaths and placing pedestrians in danger.
"If you decide that a road is too busy to cycle on then please choose an alternative route or dismount and walk with your cycle on the footpath until it is safe to continue on the road.
"Cycling on a footpath is an offence and anybody found committing such an offence may be issued with a fixed penalty notice."
She added: "As the nights get darker it is important that you keep safe by wearing suitable reflective clothing and fitting lights to your cycle where they can be seen by other road users."
