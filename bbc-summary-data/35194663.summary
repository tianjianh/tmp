Charlie Walker danced through to give Quins an early lead at Sixways before Luke Wallace bundled over as the visitors led 17-3 at half-time.
Walker added his second try following Danny Care's fine kick along the turf.
Worcester earned a bonus point through Marco Mama's score, a penalty try and Phil Dowson's try but were unable to overturn a 21-point deficit.
There was little sign of what was to come from Warriors in the final 30 minutes when Walker's converted try put Harlequins 24-3 in front shortly after the break.
As the visitors started to lose their discipline in the muddy conditions, Warriors' pack began to dominate and ran in 17 unanswered points.
But with just over 10 minutes left for the hosts to find another try, Quins' defence held firm to move up to third in the Premiership table.
Worcester have not beaten Harlequins since a 15-9 victory at the Stoop in February 2005 and their task was made even more difficult when wing Walker exchanged passes with Ross Chisholm to score after just three minutes.
George Lowe was sent to the sin-bin for Quins for coming in at the side of the ruck, but Warriors were only able to add a Tom Heathcote penalty with their man advantage.
Flanker Wallace extended the lead following a big drive from the line-out which Nick Evans converted to take him past 1,500 points in the Premiership.
Harlequins continued their dominance after the break as Walker did well to pick up Care's clever grubber kick and touch down before Mama was driven over for Warriors.
However, as lack of discipline began to creep into Quins' game, Jamie Roberts was shown a yellow card, leading to a penalty try which Ryan Mills converted to reduce the arrears to just nine points.
Worcester captain Dowson crossed in the corner to set up a fascinating finale, but it proved to be the final score of a thrilling match.
