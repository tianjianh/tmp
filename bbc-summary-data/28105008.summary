[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Oscar-winning actress is specifically backing a project aimed at securing the future of Nower Wood, as an "outdoor classroom" for generations.
The ancient woodland, in Leatherhead, serves as a wildlife and environmental education site for pupils from primary to A-Level age.
A fundraising drive aims to raise Â£470,000 to rebuild dilapidated classrooms.
Dame Judi said: "As a local Surrey resident with a love of wildlife, I'm delighted to be supporting Surrey Wildlife Trust and its Nower Wood New Build Project.
"I also recognise the importance of outdoor education and the need to inspire the next generation about wildlife and conservation."
