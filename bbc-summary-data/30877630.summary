They join already announced stars including Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Paloma Faith, Royal Blood and George Ezra.
There are online rumours that Madonna is set to perform new material from her new album Rebel Heart, but as yet there is no official confirmation.
The Brits will take place at London's O2 Arena February 25.
This will be the sixth time Take That have performed at the Brit Awards since 1994, but the first time as a threesome since the departure of Jason Orange.
This year's Brit Awards will be hosted by Ant and Dec, who are up for a number of National Television Awards, including best presenters - their 14th nomination in a row.
Take That have won a total of eight Brit Awards and still hold the crown as the UK's most successful live act.
Last week, at the nominations, Clean Bandit star Neil Amin-Smith said this year's list was dominated by "white boys".
In response, the British Phonographic Industry, who organise the Brits, said that the process of nomination is an "open and transparent process driven by a combination of market data and personal taste".
It's also been announced that Take That will headline the annual War Child Brits Award Show on 23 February at Shepherd's Bush Empire.
