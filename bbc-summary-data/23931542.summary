They played drums and bass, respectively, with Caribbean comedy outfit The Cuban Brothers at the Big Feastival in Oxfordshire.
Wearing baseball caps and shades, the musicians claimed to have formed the "supergroup of the Cotswolds".
The festival, now in its second year, is held at James's farm in Oxfordshire. About 14,000 attended the event.
James told the BBC: "I've had a great time and so have my children. We've been blessed by the weather. Let's do it again next year."
The Blur star, who charged Â£150 per head, repeatedly turned his back to the crowd to show off his low slung jeans which exposed his black underwear.
Cuban Brothers frontman Miguel Mantovani, aka Scotsman Mike Keat, told the BBC: "It was unrehearsed. They jumped on stage with us and they can hold their own.
"They're great guys and it was nice to have them join us. They have many, many talents. Jamie is a very impressive young man. Not only is he a stick man, he's cooking. Alex is doing his cheese making. He's hanging out with guys like Jeremy Clarkson. It's a Cotswolds thing."
The Feeling closed the festival, with Mark Owen, KT Tunstall, Lianne La Havas and Dodgy among the other performers.
The Cuban Brothers had flown back into Britain early on Sunday morning for the Big Feastival from Moscow where, they said, they had performed at an "oligarch's party".
Mantovani would only say: "He was called Dmitri. I can't reveal or pronounce his other name." But he added: "My pockets are considerably fatter now."
Their, at times risque, show included daredevil break dancing and was one of the best received performances at the weekend's festivities.
The Cuban Brothers are currently promoting their new album Yo Bonita, which includes collaborations with Mica Paris, KT Tunstall, Omar and Kurtis Blow.
Last year, James and Oliver played together in a one-time-only band called The Farm Lovin' Criminals.
