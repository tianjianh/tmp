Electricity North West said about 680 customers in Bury and 480 in Rochdale were still cut off.
The company has reconnected more than 24,750 customers in the past two days.
Thanking people for their "goodwill", incident manager Steve Cox said the "focus today is to ensure power is restored for the remaining customers".

Elsewhere in the area, a major clean-up is continuing following the floods on Saturday.
In Rochdale, dozens of town centre businesses were underwater, after the River Roch burst its banks, while in nearby Littleborough, about 100 properties and two care homes had to be evacuated.
Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk said more needed to be done to prevent flooding, including the diverting of overseas aid funds.
"Why do we spend money in Bangladesh when it needs spending in Great Britain?" he said.
"What we need to do is to sort out the problems which are occurring here and not focus so much on developing countries. That has to be our priority."
The Environment Agency have said flood defences across the UK need a "complete rethink" following the recent flooding.
The clearing-up operation in Bury has seen a housing association praise the "instinctive community spirit" of those hit by the floods.
Irwell Valley Housing Association's Cath Mustafa said about 100 of their residents had been hit and the "resilience of everyone affected and the instinctive community spirit to pull together at such a difficult time is truly astonishing".
Central Salford suffered its worst flooding for nearly 70 years as homes in Kersal, Lower Broughton and Trinity were evacuated.
A Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said they had received more than 300 flood-related calls.
She said it was believed crews had "rescued up to 1,000 people in less than 24 hours when water levels rose so rapidly yesterday that whole towns were cut off".
