[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government 'dragging its heels' on Berriedale Braes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has been accused of "dragging its heels" on proposed improvements to a challenging hairpin bend on the A9 in Caithness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A9 drops from 150m (492ft) to 20m (65ft) as it enters a valley at the Berriedale Braes.
Caithness Chamber of Commerce said it was taking too long starting construction work on the improvements and the problem was being ignored.
Transport Scotland said it was continuing to progress the design work.
The A9 provides a link to the far north mainland coast and the ferry services at Scrabster, Gills Bay and John O'Groats to Orkney.
Chamber chief executive Trudy Morris said: "For too long, the Scottish government has ignored the impact the Berriedale Braes has on those living and working in the North of Scotland and Orkney Isles."
She added: "While progress has been made in identifying a solution to this important issue, we are disappointed that the Scottish government is dragging its heels in moving towards a practical implementation of this.
"The project as it stands is effectively shovel-ready - all that remains is for Scottish government to commit the funding."
Last year, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for work to tackle the bend to be accelerated.
Government agency Transport Scotland said a significant step in the project should be taken later this year.
A spokeswoman said: "We are continuing to progress the design work for the Berriedale Braes improvement scheme following the publication of draft orders last year.
"We are currently working to resolve objections to the scheme and subject to completion of the statutory process we will look to publish made orders later this year."
Made orders mark the last stage in the development of a final design for a new road.
