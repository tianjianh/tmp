Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has agreed with the club's American owners that money will be available for transfers as they fight relegation.

The Swans are bottom of the Premier League having won just twice all season and face Sunderland on Saturday.
"We haven't gone into individuals sort of money but they are fully committed to make some signings to give everybody a lift to go forward," he said.
"We need some players in to give everybody a lift."
American owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan bought a controlling stake of 68% of shares in the club in July.
Manager Bob Bradley's job could be on the line after he was made bookies' favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked but Jenkins says the club is focused on avoiding relegation.
"We don't control every story that goes out in the press. The recent story about Bob Bradley, I don't know where that came from," he continued.
"Our main aim is to make sure we get things right over the next three games and have a few discussions over the next few weeks to make sure we strengthen the team in January.
"We are fully committed to try and make sure we compete and stay in the Premier League every year."
Jenkins has said he takes responsibility for the club's slump, which has left them bottom of the Premier League.
Fans have turned on Jenkins and the board, accusing them of greed after selling most of their shares in July's American takeover.
