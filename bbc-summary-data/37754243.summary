Further arrests have been made over a "brutal attack" at a football match which left a man dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beyake Keita Ann, 21, died in hospital three weeks after he was injured in Attock Park, Bradford, on 23 August.
Two men, aged 20 and 26, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. A third man, aged 21, has been re-arrested for the same offence.
Six other men, aged between 17 and 32, are on bail and three more have been released without charge.ã€€
Mr Keita Ann had gone to the park in the Laisterdyke area of the city to play football when an argument started and players were attacked.
Det Ch Insp Ian Scott, from West Yorkshire Police, said: "Beyake was sat to the side of the pitch, not involved in this disorder in any shape or form.
"He was brutally attacked, being struck around the head causing fatal injuries."
His family paid tribute to a "gentle, quiet and happy boy" who came to England in May to "find a better life for himself".
