The family of a man killed by a runaway police van have claimed "significant failures" by West Yorkshire Police played a part in his death.

Donald Bennett, 83, died after he was trapped under the vehicle in Pudsey Park in Leeds, where he was eating an ice cream on his way to watch bowls.
A Wakefield Coroner's Court jury found his death in June 2013 was accidental.
The inquest heard an officer applied the van's handbrake after parking it on a slope, but did not leave it in gear.
The court was told that about two minutes after PC Claire Bugler left the vehicle, it rolled down the slope, hitting Mr Bennett, who died from chest injuries.
Eleanor Fry, representing the family, said there were "significant areas that could be improved" and made a number of recommendations regarding training.
Ian Mullarkey, for West Yorkshire Police, said some recommendations had been implemented since Mr Bennett's death, including checking police vehicles and replacing parts every 60,000 miles.
Speaking outside the court after the inquest, Mr Bennett's son-in-law, John O'Leary said: "We are very disappointed at what we consider are some significant failures by West Yorkshire Police.
"Especially as some of these failures were identified prior to and after dad's death and that if these were identified we would have anticipated that Donald would still be here."
A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: "This was a tragic incident and our thoughts today are, first and foremost, with Mr Bennett's family, to whom we sincerely apologise."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said an investigation "found no case to answer for gross misconduct or misconduct for the driver".
However, the IPCC found "the West Yorkshire Police driver training school does not teach a stopping drill to students and recommended the force implements guidance issued in the Highway Code, which includes the selection of a gear when parking on an incline."
