Chris Kane had already fired one effort wide when he put Saints ahead with a neat finish from a tight angle.
The striker then hooked a volley wide before his 25-yard strike hit the bar, while Liam Craig had a goal disallowed.
Hearts threatened intermittently, Bjorn Johnsen and Arnaud Djoum drawing saves from Alan Mannus, but fell short again.
This was a fourth defeat in five games against Saints this season - the other was a draw - and a third straight loss amid a wretched run of only one win in their past nine games.
St Johnstone, who have already secured fourth place and a Europa League qualifying spot, finish their campaign at home to Rangers on Sunday, while Hearts travel to face champions Celtic.
Few would have criticised the Saints for taking their foot off the gas here, but the exact opposite was the case.
The slick passing in midfield from David Wotherspoon and Chris Millar was more than a match for the Tynecastle trio of Malaury Martin, Djoum and Don Cowie.
Add in the constant threat of Danny Swanson and the Hearts rearguard were on the back foot from the off.
It was the departing Swanson, who will join Hibernian in the summer, who slipped the ball thought the Hearts defence into the path of Kane.
Despite the attentions of three Hearts defenders, the striker was able to clip the ball beyond the despairing arms of keeper Viktor Noring with the outside of his right foot.
Hearts made a change at the break with the ineffective Johnsen making way for youngster Rory Currie, while Jamie Walker was sent on after an hour.
The visitors looked much more effective with Sam Nicholson in particular looking livelier in the second period.
Nicholson, who will be leaving the club after failing to agree a contract extension, was given the freedom to drive forward and cut infield.
Isma Goncalves had a deflected shot tipped away by Mannus and then the Saints keeper dived low at his left-hand post to deny Liam Smith as Hearts searched for the equaliser.
Currie has made 12 appearances for Hearts this season and his energy and enthusiasm is one of the few hints of promise in what has been, by and large, a very disappointing campaign.
There will be much to ponder for the respective head coaches over the coming days and weeks.
Saints boss Tommy Wright's top priority is to find a replacement for Swanson, and with a European campaign starting in just six weeks, he will have to act very quickly indeed.
However there are few Saints fans who will have anything other than confidence in the man who has led the club to a third straight fourth-placed Premiership finish.
Ian Cathro does not enjoy the same support, with plenty of Hearts fans doubting the ability of the 30-year-old to lead their club forward.  This was a 13th defeat in his 25 matches in charge.
He will be given another chance in the summer to add to the squad and the success of his recruitment, along with results in the early part of the new campaign, will decide if he has a long-term future at Tynecastle.
St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: "It was a good performance. There were many moments where we could have extended the lead.
"In the first half we probably passed the ball as well as we have all season, but in the second half we got a bit panicky and went a bit too long, but overall we had a really good night against them again.
"We have lost players in the past and we have had a bit of time to prepare for Danny Swanson going.  We are speaking to one or two people and hopefully we will get something sorted to get more quality added to the squad."
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "I think we certainly deserved a draw but we have to reflect on a first and second half that were completely different.
"We started off the first half OK but we became comfortable and started to fall off them and we were far too passive in our pressing.  A large part of that first half was completely unacceptable.
"In the second half the intensity was better and I don't think there was any way we deserved to lose that game."
