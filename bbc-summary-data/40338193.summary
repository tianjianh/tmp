Two kayakers have been rescued from the Irish Sea after getting into difficulty off the Wigtownshire coast.

One had fallen overboard and had been in the water for more than 30 minutes.

Rescuers have praised the actions of two local boys who spotted the kayakers in trouble and called the coastguard.
