Ex-footballer Ryan Giggs has dropped a bid to ban reporters from covering a court battle with his estranged wife.

The former Manchester United and Wales winger is embroiled in a High Court dispute over money with wife Stacey.
He is no longer pursuing a bid to exclude the media from the hearings, it has emerged.
However, a ban on naming the pair's children and reporting financial details heard during litigation remains.
During a hearing on Friday, Mr Justice Cobb also said media outlets could report the couple's identities and the fact they were involved in a dispute.
Neither Giggs nor Mrs Giggs were present.
After the hearing, a lawyer representing Mrs Giggs said she "wishes to make no comment on the current proceedings other than to ask that her privacy and that of her family is respected".
"She understands that coverage of these matters has the potential to cause upset and distress, something which she is determined to avoid at all costs," said James Brown, a partner at Hall Brown Family Law.
Giggs, who was born in Cardiff, retired as a player in summer 2014.
He made a record 963 appearances for United and won 64 Welsh international caps.
The 43-year-old worked as United's interim manager for a short spell after ending his playing career. He has also become involved in property development.
Specialist lawyers are currently debating how much the public should be told about people involved in big-money divorce battles after High Court judges outlined opposing views.
