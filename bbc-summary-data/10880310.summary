The Seagrove Centre, which is being run by North Edinburgh Dementia Care, is sited in the grounds of the former Eastern General Hospital.
It will provide core services to those with dementia and offer a possible alternative to hospital admission.
The facility will be able to offer day care services to more than a hundred patients with the condition across the area.
Edinburgh City Council has said it was committed to funding the centre for at least the next five years.
Councillor Norman Work, vice convener of the health, social care and housing committee, said: "It is fantastic to see this new centre spring to life and I would like to say congratulations to everyone who has had a part to play in the development of this new building.
"Not only will it provide great facilities and services for service users, it will also be a lifeline for their families too.
"We are looking forward to working with our partners in providing a high quality service."
New equipment for the centre has also been provided by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.
