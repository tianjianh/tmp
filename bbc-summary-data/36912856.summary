Banchory bride trashes wedding dress for more memories

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most new brides lovingly store away their pristine wedding dress in a box after their big day and tuck it away somewhere safe.

But Sammy Birnie and husband Mike decided to instead "trash the dress" in a colourful photoshoot in Aberdeenshire woodland.
They said this was to give them even more memories of their marriage.
A quad bike driven by the groom covered the bride in mud, and they also sprayed each other in paint and champagne.
'Load of fun'
The Banchory couple had married at the Raemoir House Hotel earlier this month, but organised the more unusual photoshoot for two weeks later at Glen Dye.
Trashing the dress is a phenomenon the couple had heard about before.
The new Mrs Birnie, nee Anderson, 29, a logistics co-ordinator, told BBC Scotland: "It was all my idea. It was just something different.
"I just thought it looked like a load of fun.
"I did not just want my dress to sit in the loft forever - I thought it would be good to make more memories.
"It's not completely destroyed but it will be stained. It's at the dry cleaners.
"I had a locket made from part of the dress before we did this shoot.
"I still had powder paint in my hair for a day or two."
Her husband, a 34-year-old car mechanic, said: "I thought it was a brilliant idea - and it was absolutely brilliant.
"I enjoyed driving the quad bike - I don't think Sammy enjoyed the mud as much.
"My brother came and helped - it was his quad bike.
"My mum was quite disapproving to start but came around - and she loved the photos.
"We will look at the photos for years to come."
Photographer Logan Sangster, of Deeside Photographics, said: "It was all their idea, I think it's more of an American thing.
"When they came in they also said they wanted to trash the dress.
"We sat down and chatted. The wedding images were still the most important.
"I did ask Sammy if she was sure as it was a beautiful dress and they are not cheap.
"The reaction to the photos has been through the roof.
"We've had a couple of people asking since, so watch this space."
