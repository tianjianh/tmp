[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, died after she was struck on The Kingsway in Swansea on 31 March.
The service was held at Christ Church, Cardiff, at 12:30 BST before moving on to Thornhill Crematorium.
The funeral cortege paused outside Llanishen police station, where Sgt Lucas worked, on the way.
Police motorcycles and horses led the hearse to the church near Roath Park Lake.
During the service, a poem read out by Sgt Lucas's husband Gavin described how they had met in a bar in Cardiff, her love for her children and how she was "the centre of my heart".
Tributes were also read out by South Wales Police's chief constable Peter Vaughan and Supt Alun Morgan.
Rev Dr Trystan Owain Hughes described Sgt Lucas as "an enthusiastic and lively" member of the congregation and someone who brought "joy and love".
A coroner's investigation held last week was told the exact cause of her death is still unknown and the hearing was adjourned.
Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips raised concerns about the road while investigating the earlier death of Daniel Foss, 37, on the same road in 2013.
Mr Phillips said The Kingsway had a "serious design issue" which must be addressed.
Since then Swansea council has put up temporary barriers along the route and last week announced plans to change bus routes.
