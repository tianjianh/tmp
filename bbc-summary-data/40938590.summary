Adam Higson ran in two first-half tries to help put Leigh - the only side to be promoted to the top-flight via the Qualifiers when they went up last year - 10-0 up at the break.
Corey Paterson and Josh Drinkwater grabbed further scores before Brayden Wiliame went in for Dragons' only try.
Paterson's second completed the win, leaving Catalans fifth in the table.
The French side have earned just one win from three games as they battle to avoid relegation, and can be overtaken in the Qualifiers table by Championship clubs London Broncos and Featherstone on Sunday if either one seals victory.

Replacements: Bousquet; Garcia, Baitieri, Margalet.
Leigh Centurions: McNally; Dawson, Brown, Langi, Higson, Reynolds, Drinkwater; Hansen, Mortimer, Maria, Paterson, Vea, Burr.
Replacements: Higham, Stewart, Hopkins, Richards.
