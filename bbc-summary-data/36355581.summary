Perera, 25, was the side's wicketkeeper before being given a provisional suspension for failing a drugs test, which was lifted earlier this month.
"Kusal will join the team as soon as possible and acclimatise so he can do some serious work with the bat," said chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya.
Prasad was injured in Sri Lanka's warm-up game against Essex.
England won the first Test in three days at Headingley by an innings-and-88-runs.
