[SN]TITLE[SN]
Iron Age broch in Lego planned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lego is to be used to draw attention to some of Scotland's oldest and most formidable structures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brochs are Iron Age roundhouses, and ruins of these homes can be found in the north and west Highlands and Orkney.
Caithness in the Highlands has more broch sites than anywhere else in Scotland.
Caithness Broch Project plans to make a large scale model of a roundhouse in Lego and loan it to museums.
The model would also be taken on tours and used as an "eye-catching prop" to encourage people to find out more about the construction and use of brochs.
Working with universities and heritage and archaeology groups, Caithness Broch Project is also planning to hold a range of events during 2017's Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology.
These include clearing vegetation from broch sites to better aid their preservation and running art competitions for schools.
Eventually, at a later date, the project hopes to build a replica roundhouse.
The reconstruction could become a tourist attraction and offer workshops in drystone dyking, a dying trade in the Caithness area.
