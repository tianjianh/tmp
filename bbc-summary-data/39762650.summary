Former South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald will be unable to take up his coaching job with Kent until next year.

The 50-year-old was named as assistant to head coach Matt Walker in January.
Work permit issues delayed his arrival, prompting the club to recruit Jason Gillespie as a temporary replacement.
Donald must obtain a Level 3 coaching qualification before his permit is granted, but he can work with Sri Lanka at the forthcoming Champions Trophy tournament in England.
He is free to take that role because visa requirements only apply to employers in the UK.
"I'm 100% committed to Kent despite the frustration of not being able to join Matt Walker and the boys as planned," said Donald, who took 602 international wickets during his career.
Walker told the club website that the situation was "frustrating" and Gillespie could only stay with them until midway through the season.
"We will announce a second interim coach to cover for Allan in due course," he added.
