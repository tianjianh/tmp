Sgt Mark Shepherd shared photographs on Twitter of his shift working in Norwich city centre.
Figures released by police earlier this year suggest that more than half of violent crime in the city happens between 21:00 and 06:00.
Mr Shepherd said: "This hopefully shows we are human. People love the fact they are getting put on social media."
Mr Shepherd, who works for the Norwich South Safer Neighbourhood Team, posted tweets after 22:00 on Saturday until after 05:00 on Sunday, using the hashtag "SelfiesWithCops"
He described incidents including one which said: "A few assaults coming in now. Also collapsed drunks. #DrinkResponsibly #KnowYourLimits #AlcoholHarm Think, how will you get home?"
He said: "Engagement is really important and we regularly get asked for photos. This takes it a small step further."
Writing on Twitter, one person tweeted: "...great sport Mark, loving the picture.  You even look like you were enjoying it!"
Another person said: "Love it."
A Norfolk Police spokesman said: "Social media can play a positive role in policing - keeping members of the public informed about incidents, day-to-day work and traffic issues - while also giving officers another way of keeping in touch with residents."
