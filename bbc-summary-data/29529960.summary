£100 oatcake spend at Robbie Williams Stoke-on-Trent Freedom ceremony

A council spent £100 on oatcakes served at a ceremony honouring Robbie Williams, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Williams was presented with the Freedom of Stoke-on-Trent at the city's Town Hall in July.
A Freedom of Information request found £100 was spent on catering after the singer requested guests be provided with cheese and bacon oatcakes.
The remainder of the £259 total was spent on flowers and ceremonial scrolls, the authority said.
A series of events was held in Stoke earlier this year to mark the star's 40th birthday.
Williams, who grew up in the city, told the private ceremony he was "honoured" by the accolade.
Oatcakes, which resemble a pancake with a sweet or savoury filling, are considered a traditional Staffordshire delicacy.
In recent years there has been a push for the dish to be awarded protected status, as in the case of Cornish pasties or Melton Mowbray pork pies.
