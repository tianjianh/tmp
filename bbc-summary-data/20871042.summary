It is believed that an empty, parked car rolled into a woman and a buggy carrying the boy on the Comber Road shortly before 16:00 GMT on Saturday.
A 31-year-old man arrested by police has been released on bail pending further inquiries.
The woman was treated for injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.
Castlereagh DUP councillor Jim White said it was "absolutely tragic".
"This family has been in Dundonald for quite some time and they are well-known in the area and the neighbours are all absolutely horrified at what has happened," he said.
"For a family to suffer this, at this time of the year, is unbelievable."
