Triumph motorcycle riders think they have almost doubled the world record for the largest ever parade of the iconic motorbikes.

The record stands at 362, and up to 688 riders are thought to have taken part in the latest record attempt in Mansfield in Nottinghamshire.
Each biker donated their entry fee to a fund set up by 29-year-old Jessica Simpkin, who has had a series of brain tumours since she was a child.
The record now needs to be verified.
The money raised will go to the University of Nottingham's Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre.
Miss Simpkin, who has already raised more than Â£16,000, said: "I think it's amazing all these people that want to help come and support.
"I want to help to raise money for research into childhood brain tumours, so that the treatment and cure does not cause the problems in later life that I am experiencing."
It will take about a month for Guinness to verify the record attempt.
Organiser Kevin Wilcox, from Staffordshire Triumph, said 688 people registered but some might not have turned up.
"We've almost certainly broken the world record by a lot and we've raised a lot of money for Jess as well which is fantastic," said Mr Wilcox.
Miss Simpkin had a malignant brain tumour when she was three and the treatment caused her several problems with her health and development.
When she was 19 she discovered she had another brain tumour and she was recently diagnosed with five further brain tumours.
"This is why fundraising is so important to me as I do not want one single person to go through what I have," said Miss Simpkin.
