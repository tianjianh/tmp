The eight-week traineeship will help boost people's chances of getting a job and develop their digital skills.
The scheme will include training designed by BBC Academy and is open to unemployed people aged 18 and over.
BBC Cymru Wales, the Welsh Government and the UK Government Department for Work and Pensions are working in partnership on the project.
Director of BBC Cymru Wales Rhodri Talfan Davies, said: "The BBC is in a unique position to connect our most creative young people with Welsh companies that are leading the way in the digital arena.
"This scheme, the biggest of its kind in Wales, is a vital part of BBC Wales' plans to help open up the creative and digital industries in Wales to a much broader range of people from all backgrounds.
"It will also help address the growing need for digital skills across Welsh industry and business."
BBC Cymru Wales will announce the scheme at the National Digital Learning event in Cardiff on Wednesday.
The project is a key part of the BBC's Make it Digital initiative, which aims to inspire a new generation to develop digital and coding skills.
Training will be held in Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Wrexham and Bangor.
The BBC is rolling out the scheme across the UK this summer, creating trainee places for up to 5,000 people.
