Trading Standards officers in Dumfries and Galloway are warning people to stay safe online in the run up to Christmas.

They are urging shoppers to steer clear of scam websites and fake goods as they look for gifts for friends and family.
People are advised to buy from internet traders they have dealt with before and ensure they have a landline number for the website.
They should also look out for the padlock sign and https in the web address, which indicates a secure site.
Service manager for the area, Sarah Harkness said: "We have complaints all year about this type of thing and unfortunately if there's a scam website or a fake website there's very little we can do.
"It's very difficult to trace back the supplier of the goods if they turn out to be fake, or if goods don't turn up at all it's very difficult to get any form of payment back because these websites can be from anywhere in the world."
