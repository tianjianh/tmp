The Clarets, who made a net profit of 40m euros in the year they were relegated from the Premier League, were one of four English teams joined in the top five by Real Madrid.
"This is a club that has to be run properly," said manager Sean Dyche.
Burnley's operating profit of 54m euros was the 10th best on the continent.
The figures were revealed in Uefa's Club Licensing Benchmarking Report for 2015.
Manchester United returned the highest operating profit - their 143m euros beating the 135m Real Madrid brought in in 2011.
Premier League rivals Liverpool, having sold striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona, had the best net profit - 75m euros.
Newcastle (43m), Real Madrid (42m) and Leicester (40m) completed the top five teams.
Uefa's report showed Queens Park Rangers produced the third highest net loss (60m euros), behind Inter Milan (140m) and AC Milan (89m).
