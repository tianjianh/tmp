Ziggy Worrell-Owusu was attacked at the Basement Shisha Lounge in Ilford, north-east London, in the early hours of 27 October. He died in hospital.
Detectives said the 19-year-old may have "stepped in to prevent a fight escalating between others".
Two 17-year-old boys who were arrested have been bailed until mid-December.
About 100 people were at the bar in Goodmayes Road where Mr Worrell-Owusu, who had turned 19 the previous day, had spent the evening celebrating his friend's birthday.
Det Insp Euan McKeeve called him a "popular young man" and appealed to partygoers "to come forward of their own accord and speak to us".
