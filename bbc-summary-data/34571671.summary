Ireland wing Tommy Bowe will have a scan on Monday to determine the extent of a knee injury suffered in the World Cup quarter-final defeat by Argentina.

The Ulster player, 31, was forced off early in the game with what appeared to be a serious injury.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt said after the match it "could be a knee ligament injury" but a scan will reveal if Bowe faces a lengthy spell out.
Bowe was added to a long injury list for the Irish at the World Cup.
It included influential fly-half Johnny Sexton, who missed the Argentina clash because of a groin strain.
Paul O'Connell's international career ended prematurely when the Ireland captain tore a hamstring in the group-stage victory over France.
Ulster, meanwhile, lost centre Jared Payne to a foot fracture sustained during the tournament.
