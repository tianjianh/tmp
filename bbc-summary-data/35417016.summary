[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has backed plans for a new £2.8m sports and leisure project in Dungiven, County Londonderry.

The scheme has been in the pipeline for a number of years but councillors had disagreed over funding.
On two previous occasions, the council rejected plans for the development.
The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is providing £2.5m in funding. A funding shortfall of more than £300,000 is now also being met.
Ulster Unionist Councillor William McCandless said that they are glad to see it finally get the go ahead.
"Once we became aware that there was a £339k shortfall, we were unable to vote for the scheme to proceed at that stage," he said.
"We are delighted to announce that our persistence and perseverance has been rewarded.
"DCAL has now issued a letter guaranteeing funding of an additional £350K which council can use to progress with another project and keep the Dungiven project cost neutral to the ratepayer."
Sports Minister Carál Ni Chuilin has welcomed the decision and said that the facility in the town is in a state of disrepair.
"The existing facility does not comply with existing disability legislation.
"As well as the many sporting benefits it will bring for the community, the construction of the new complex is also economically beneficial for the borough.
"This is a great day for Dungiven and the surrounding area and look forward to the commencement of construction in the coming weeks."
A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure said: "The department is providing £2.5m in funding for a new sports and leisure complex in Dungiven, while the remaining £339,000 is being met by the council.
"The department has, separately, committed to providing up to £350,000 to the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council in 2016/17 for the development of a multi-sport facility in the borough, the need for which will be identified through the council's sports facility plan."
