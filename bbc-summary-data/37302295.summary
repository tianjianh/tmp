Lucas Browne returns from drugs ban with WBA heavyweight title fight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australian heavyweight Lucas Browne will fight Fres Oquendo for the vacant regular WBA heavyweight title after serving a six-month drugs ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Browne stopped champion Ruslan Chagaev to win the title in Russia in March, but tested positive for clenbuterol after the fight.
The WBA has since reinstalled Browne, 37, in the top five of its rankings.
It ordered that he face 43-year-old Puerto Rican Oquendo, the leading contender, within 120 days.
Britain's Tyson Fury is the reigning 'super' champion at heavyweight. He faces a rematch with Ukraine's Wladimir Klitschko for the WBO and WBA belts in Manchester on 29 October.
