The Cavan Gaels forward switched to the Lilywhites in 2012 when he was dropped from the Breffni squad.
However, Cavan boss Terry Hyland has brought Johnston into his provisional training panel for 2016.
Midfielder David Givney and goalkeeper Alan O'Mara have also returned as Cavan prepare for their McKenna Cup opener against Armagh next month.
"Sean made himself available, we thought about it and discussed it," Hyland told the Irish Sun.
"He had an operation on an ankle injury at the start of the year. That had been holding him back so it was only as the year went on that he was able to put those injury problems behind him.
"It is up to Sean now. Hopefully he can remain injury-free and apply himself. He wouldn't have played with a lot of the players on the panel now so he has to prove himself to them as well."
