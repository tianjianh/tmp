[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 2-2 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon twice came from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw at Peterborough in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Williams' men trailed at the break after Gwion Edwards continued his prolific start to his Posh career by scoring a fourth goal of the season.
Edwards headed home a 36th-minute Marcus Maddison free-kick which appeared to have been harshly awarded following a challenge from Michael Doughty.
But Doughty got over that disappointment when he levelled from the penalty spot six minutes into the second half after seeing his shot handled by defender Michael Bostwick.
But the hosts hit the front again on 63 minutes when new recruit Sean Murray endured a nightmare Town debut.
The former Watford man tripped Chris Forrester to concede a penalty only four minutes after his introduction as a substitute and Maddison made no mistake in beating Lawrence Vigouroux.
But Swindon rallied to claw their way level again when a dangerous Doughty cross was turned into his own net by Posh defender Jack Baldwin with 14 minutes to go.
And they came closest to winning it when substitute Luke Norris flashed a last-gasp shot wide.
