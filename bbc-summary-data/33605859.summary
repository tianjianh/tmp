Miles Frost collapsed while out jogging near the family's home in Oxfordshire on Sunday.
His godfather, Michael Rosenberg, said the family were left "totally in shock" by his sudden death.
Friends said the financial investor had appeared "in wonderful form" in recent weeks and there had been no indication of any health problems.
Lord Chadlington, a long-standing friend of the Frost family, said: "It is very sad and very, very sudden. His family are very much in shock."
Chris Hurley, chief executive of LDC, where Mr Frost worked for five years said: "We're all deeply saddened by the news. Our thoughts are with his family and friends."
Mr Frost has two younger brothers; 29-year-old Wilfred, a TV presenter on CNBC's Worldwide Exchange programme, and George, 28.
In March 2014 the family were joined by 2,000 guests, including the Prince of Wales, for a memorial service at Westminster Abbey in Sir David's memory.
The much-loved broadcaster died two years ago, aged 74, after suffering a heart attack on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship.
His career spanned journalism, satire and daytime television presenting, including The Frost Report.
