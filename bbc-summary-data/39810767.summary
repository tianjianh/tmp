Woking manager Garry Hill has left the National League club after not being offered a new contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a statement, chairman Rosemary Johnson said the board was unable to offer Hill a new deal as the club is in negotiations with a potential investor.
Hill, 57, was appointed Cards boss in January 2011, leading them to promotion as Conference South champions in the 2011-12 season.
Woking finished 18th in the National League table this season.
