Scrum-half Williams collected his own speculative chip-kick to snatch a vital victory to maintain Blues' challenge for a top six finish.
"We solved a few problems at half time in terms of stopping some of the things they wanted to do and held on for dear life," Wilson told BBC Wales' Scrum V.
"And there was a great defensive set to finish. Defensively I thought we were excellent.

"Credit to the boys, that was a huge set not to give a penalty away and hold on for what will be another good away win for us."
