Ashes 2015: Moeen Ali may open v Pakistan in UAE - Trevor Bayliss

England will give consideration to playing all-rounder Moeen Ali as an opening batsman in their next Test series against Pakistan, according to coach Trevor Bayliss.

Asked if Moeen could partner Alastair Cook in the United Arab Emirates, Bayliss said, "Possibly, yes.
"Moeen is the type of guy who could bat in a few positions in that top seven."
Spinner Moeen mainly batted at eight in the Ashes and has never been higher than number six in England's order.
England face Misbah-ul-Haq's side in three Tests in October and November on pitches that traditionally favour spin.
Bayliss said England would look to change the balance of the side by including another spin option to back up Moeen.
"In the UAE the possibility of playing two spinners will be at the forefront of everyone's thinking, so obviously we'd have to change the team to get a second spinner in," he said.
With incumbent opener Adam Lyth having struggled in the Ashes, averaging just 12.77, there has been speculation that Moeen could move up the order.
"Adam hasn't scored as many runs as he would like," said Bayliss. "It's a big step-up [from county cricket].
"There are a few positions in the team that we can be stronger and [opening batsman] will definitely be a discussion point."
Cook has already had six different partners at the top of the order since previous captain Andrew Strauss retired in 2012: Nick Compton, Joe Root, Michael Carberry, Sam Robson, Jonathan Trott and Lyth.
