Donald Trump's plan to cut US corporation tax 'could impact on Northern Ireland jobs'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Donald Trump's economic advisors has cautioned that a cut in the US corporate tax rate could have an impact on Northern Ireland jobs.

Mr Trump plans to slash the US rate from 35% to 15% to get manufacturers to move work to the United States.
Stephen Moore said the tax policy was mainly aimed at bringing work back from Asian countries.
But he did not rule out an impact on Northern Ireland.
"I wouldn't say it's nothing to worry about (for Northern Ireland)... I want to see jobs for America first," he said.
US companies are major investors in Northern Ireland and include manufacturing firms such as Caterpillar, Terex, GE and Emerson.
Mr Moore had previously talked about a "flood of companies" leaving the Republic of Ireland as a result of the planned tax change.
In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster he was more measured saying: "It's not like all of a sudden all these companies are going to leave and come back to the US - some might."
Mr Moore also agreed that US companies would continue to invest abroad.
He praised the low corporation tax polices of the British and Irish governments and said the Northern Ireland Executive was right to pursue a policy of cutting the tax.
"Capital flows to where its treated most kindly. Taxes aren't the only thing but they do matter," he said.
He also played down the possibility of a trade war with China or other countries saying the US simply wanted to renegotiate existing agreements.
Listen to the interview with Stephen Moore on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster at 08:15 GMT on Tuesday.
