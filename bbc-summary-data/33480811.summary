Bryony Charles, 23, was injured at Foxhall Stadium in Ipswich on Saturday, 13 June.
She has had two separate operations to put a pin in her right ankle and repair ligaments on her right knee.
"I now want to focus on getting better and returning to the job that I love," she said.
Ms Charles has returned home to Ipswich where she lives with her partner and she praised the support she had had from the team at Ipswich Hospital and her St John Ambulance colleagues.
"I would like to thank everyone who has sent me messages of support - these have kept me positive and motivated for my recovery," she said.
Debbie Charles, her mother, said: "We've still got a long journey ahead of us, but she's recuperating well and getting used to her wheelchair.
"She's missing her full-time job and voluntary work, which are both with St John, but we don't expect her to be up and walking for six months."
Ms Charles had been due to volunteer for St John Ambulance at Kylie Minogue's concert in Newmarket the following weekend, but was unable to make it.
The singer sent her a personal message instead.
"The picture of Kylie is still in the living room," Mrs Charles said.
