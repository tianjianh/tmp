Dutch airline KLM's scheduled service to Schiphol Airport will give Inverness another connection with the international air transit hub.
Flybe already runs flights between the two destinations.
The news follows last month's announcement that BA is set to restore its connection between Inverness and Heathrow from next year.
The Heathrow link has not run since 1997.
Transport Minister Derek Mackay welcomed the latest announcement.
He said: "This new Inverness-Amsterdam route from KLM is fantastic news, boosting connectivity to the Highlands and Scotland as a whole.
"By opening up a wide range of onward connections from Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest hub airports, we offer Scottish businesses improved access to important global markets.
"This link also makes it even easier for visitors to get a taste of the fantastic experiences on offer in the Highlands, which is welcome news for the tourism industry."
