The officer is in a stable condition in hospital after the attack by a dissident republican group known as the 'new IRA'.
During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader passed on the sympathies of "the whole House" for the "police officer who lost his life".
North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds later described Mr Corbyn's gaffe as "one of the worst displays of crass ignorance that could be imagined".
It is understood Mr Corbyn has written a letter to the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to apologise for his error.
A spokesman for the Labour leader said: "He meant to say 'nearly died'", adding that Mr Corbyn "had not intended to cause offence".
