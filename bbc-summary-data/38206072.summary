A tram driver was sacked for speeding on a bend on the Oldham line in Greater Manchester in June.

The Metrolink driver took a corner at nearly three times the speed limit causing passengers to be hurled from their seats, the Manchester Evening News reported.
Three passengers suffered "very minor" injuries, operator Metrolink said.
It was therefore "not reportable" under the Rail Accident and Investigation Branch (RAIB) guidelines, it said.
Metrolink confirmed the network operator had dismissed a driver after he was "found to be over-speeding".
A statement added: "The welfare and safety of passengers and employees is our highest priority and we closely monitor the time drivers spend driving to ensure they're able to carry out their duties safely and effectively.
"As well as enforcing rigorous safety standards, we have internal channels and processes to encourage employees to speak openly about any safety or health concerns they may have."
Transport for Greater Manchester (TFGM) said it was "satisfied appropriate corrective action was taken" by the operator over this incident.
Peter Cushing, TFGM's Metrolink Director, said: "Metrolink is one of the safest tram networks in Europe.
"This was an isolated staff-behaviour incident [which took place in June], not considered formally 'reportable'."
Last month, a tram derailed killing seven people and injuring more than 50 in south London.
The RAIB said the tram was travelling at 43.5mph in a 12mph zone.
