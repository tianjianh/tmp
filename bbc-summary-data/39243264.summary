The five-year-old has suffered a "minor setback", says trainer Colin Tizzard.
However, Tizzard hopes the horse will be fit to race at Aintree's Grand National Festival next month.
The winners of the 'big four' races of last year's festival are all amongst the absentees for the 2017 edition, which starts on Tuesday.
Gold Cup champion Don Cossack and Queen Mother Champion Chase holder Sprinter Sacre have retired, while World Hurdle and Champion Hurdle winners Thistlecrack and Annie Power are out with injuries.
Don Poli, who was third in the 2016 Gold Cup, was also ruled out on Friday.
