It is understood the intruders opened a lock at the 531ft (162m) tower on Brighton seafront at 07:30 GMT.
A spokeswoman for sponsor British Airways i360 said: "We will be reviewing security levels with our contractors in light of this incident."
The tower, directly in front of the derelict West Pier, is still under construction.
Sussex Police said a group had broken in to the site via the King's Road arches.
Permanent security measures at the completed project will include high security walls, alarmed doors and CCTV.
"[These] will make breaches of this type become increasingly difficult," the BA i360 spokeswoman said.
The seafront viewing platform will open in the summer.
