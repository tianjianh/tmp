Steinbach nutcracker firm files for bankruptcy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steinbach, one of Germany's best-known makers of traditional wooden nutcrackers, has filed for bankruptcy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company blamed high wage costs resulting from the country's minimum wage, introduced at the beginning of this year.
The 200-year-old family firm paid its workers between â‚¬5.50 and â‚¬6.50 before the introduction of the â‚¬8.50 minimum wage, according to German media.
It has been unable to cope with the additional costs.
Steinbach is based in Hohenhameln in northern Germany. The nutcrackers it produces are particularly popular as Christmas decorations and are collected around the world, especially in the US.
Current boss Karla is the sixth generation Steinbach to run the firm.
