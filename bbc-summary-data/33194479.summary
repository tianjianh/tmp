Tour of the North: Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly says planned protest has been called off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Féin's North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly has confirmed a planned residents' protest at Friday's Orange Order Tour of the North parade has been called off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Parades Commission had applied more stringent restrictions to the march than in previous years.
On BBC NI's The View, the Orange Order's Mervyn Gibson welcomed the move by the residents.
However, he said it was still unhappy with the Commission's determination.
He said the Order hoped to seek a judicial review on Friday.
Mr Kelly described the move by the residents as "helpful".
As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast.
They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat.
This year, all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it.
The planned residents' protest had also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations.
