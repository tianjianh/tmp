The 35-year-old Tongan spent 11 years playing in Australia's National Rugby League for Paramatta, for whom he made 201 appearances.
Leigh won the Championship Grand Final last term and, in 2015, will be looking to win promotion back to Super League.
"The signing is a strong indication of Leigh's ability to attract world-class talent," said head coach Paul Rowley.
"He will not only bring profile to our club off the field, but a huge presence and class on the field."
Moimoi began his international career representing New Zealand, but switched to the nation of his birth in 2013 and represented Tonga at the World Cup.
Leigh, who lost only once during the regular Championship season in 2014, have said the deal includes an option of a second year.
