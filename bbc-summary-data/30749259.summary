A bulldog who was so lazy she needed to be bribed with ham to take exercise has been crowned "pet slimmer of the year".

Daisy, six, of Middlesbrough, has been named the PDSA's Pet Fit Club champion after she shed almost a third of her bodyweight in six months.
Nicknamed Lazy Daisy by owner Gillian Turrell, the dog was spoiled with treats before going out for walks.
But thanks to dieting tips from the charity, Daisy has shed 8kg (17lbs), to get down to 20kg (44lbs).
Ms Turrell, 60, said: "Daisy always begged for food and has even been known to steal things out of the fridge.
"I also got into the habit of spoiling her with treats and titbits. The weight crept up slowly and I didn't notice how big she'd got.
"When I couldn't get the car harness around her and she was struggling to get up the stairs, I knew things had to change."
Her proud owner added: "The difference in Daisy is amazing. Losing the weight has really improved her mobility. Before she struggled to climb the stairs - now she sprints up them!"
