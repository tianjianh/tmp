[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dramatic pictures show Ian Bowman being brought to the ground at Worcester Cathedral by a specialist rescue unit.
The accident happened during evensong on Saturday when the bell-ringing rope caught Mr Bowman's heel. He was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital.
Mr Bowman, 51, fractured a bone in his back but is able to walk.
Mr Bowman, who was performing as a visiting bell-ringer, said: "[The rope] pulled me up in the air and I came crashing down on the floor with a big bang."
The mechanic, from Widecombe-in-the-Moor, in Devon, said he had been ringing the tenor bell, which requires two people.
Mark Regan, ringing master at the cathedral, told the Worcester News it was a "freak accident".
"He went up in the air a couple of feet and landed awkwardly," he said.
