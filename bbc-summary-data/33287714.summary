Most of the 500 properties in Bangor left without electricity following a fault have been reconnected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Power said engineers were at Bangor High Street working to restore power as quickly as possible.
Many businesses have reportedly closed but a spokeswoman could not confirm if the whole street had been affected.
She said it was thought a high-voltage cable fault had affected between 400 and 500 customers in the area.
