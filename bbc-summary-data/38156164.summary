Thieves carried out the raid at the Royal Bank of Scotland's Langholm branch on 11 November.
Ch Supt Gary Ritchie said he hoped to be able to issue an update on the investigation "very soon".
He also moved to reassure the public over policing levels across Dumfries and Galloway.
"The policing provision I think for the remote areas in the division is in actual fact pretty sound and reflective of the type of demand that we get there," he said.
"We are able to respond very well when something like that happens and I think the policing provision is probably balanced in the right way."
However, he said he understood public concerns after such an incident.
"People, obviously, after something like this have a nervousness and fear that their community is exposed - especially in an area like Dumfries and Galloway where we have a lot or rural and remote communities," he said.
"What I would say is that it is very much a one-off - we don't see much crime like that in the area.
"Unfortunately for the type of crime it is, the criminals do pick places that are remote and are generally considered to be safe.
"It's not something that we regularly see."
