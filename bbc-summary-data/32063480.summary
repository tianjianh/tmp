Kutcher, 37, whose partner Mila Kunis gave birth to their first child Wyatt in October, took to social media to highlight the issue.
"There are NEVER diaper changing stations in men's restrooms," he wrote.
"The first public men's room I go into that has one gets a shout on my FB page! â€ª#â€ŽBeTheChange."
Kutcher's post has since been liked more than 240,000 times on Facebook.
He also posted on Twitter last week: "You may not realise how sexist public bathrooms are until you're a parent."
Followers from around the world have told Kutcher that there are father-friendly loos in Australia, Sweden and Newcastle.
In the US there's a campaign called Potty Parity which is demanding more facilities for men in public toilets.
In California politicians have passed two laws for equal access to nappy-changing stations in new public bathrooms.
