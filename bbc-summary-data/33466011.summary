The mother-of-four was among 38 people killed when a gunman opened fire at Sousse on 26 June.
The funeral for Ms Jones, who was 51 and from Blackwood, Caerphilly, will be held at St David's Church in the town at 12:00 BST on 13 July.
An inquest into her death at West London Coroner's Court was told she died from a single shot.
