Three drivers jailed for A40 crash near Haverfordwest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven Pembrokeshire men have been given jail terms for "driving like lunatics" before a head-on car crash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Lloyd, 23, and Stephen Murray, 19, of Neyland, Jack Murdoch, 19, of Waterson, Scott Beavis, 22, and Ieuan Power, 19, of Milford Haven and Edward Adams, 20, and James Adams, 23, of Steynton, were sentenced at Swansea Crown Court on Monday.
The crash happened on the A40.
All of the men had admitted or been convicted of dangerous driving.
The head-on crash between a Citroen Saxo driven by Beavis and a Seat Ibiza driven by Andrea Gainfort happened on Arnold's Hill, near Haverfordwest, on 11 August, 2013.
Other drivers described numerous cars "swarming" up the hill and using the oncoming lane to overtake.
Judge Paul Thomas QC said: "Anyone who has experienced traffic on a sunny Sunday afternoon in Pembrokeshire will consider that your driving was truly astonishingly bad.
"It was Scott Beavis who directly cause the accident. It could easily have been any one of you driving like lunatics on that day."
