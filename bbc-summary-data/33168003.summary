Plans to cut Welsh councils cause split in north

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Wales council chiefs are split over plans to carve the region up into two or three authorities as unions warn of job cuts and privatisation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews insisted the case was "compelling and widely accepted".
But opposition is widespread and varied, even within his own party.
Flintshire deputy leader Bernie Attridge described it as "political suicide" adding Welsh Labour needed "urgent change at the top".
The future for the north is still uncertain with proposals suggesting either two super authorities comprising Gwynedd, Anglesey and Conwy in the north west, and Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire in the north east.
An alternative allows further consultation over three councils, with Denbighshire joining with Conwy instead.
Leading councillors suggested that the two authorities proposal could deliver a Plaid Cymru stronghold to the west and Labour to the east.
Others questioned whether Gwynedd's policy strongly promoting the Welsh language could be put at risk from a merger with authorities with a less strict approach.
Geoff Edkins, Unison's regional organiser, said that estimates based on the Welsh Local Government Association's figures, warned of 15,000 workers in Wales facing redundancy in merged authorities, including around 4,000 in north Wales.
Wednesday's announcement has prolonged the uncertainty for the union's members in the north.
Financial pressures on council spending has already prompted some to look to close or to privatise services, he said, like libraries, leisure, welfare rights and home care.
"Whether the outcome is two or three authorities in north Wales is uncertain and will remain so till after the assembly elections and possibly up till 2020. Yet sticking as we are isn't tenable," he said.
"The greatest fear for our members is the loss of jobs and privatisation. They wonder just what services will be left to be merged."
Hugh Evans the independent leader of Denbighshire council said that merging the county into a new authority with Flintshire and Wrexham was his "worst fear realised".
Denbighshire and Conwy had reached a voluntary agreement for merger which was earlier rejected by Leighton Andrews.
But he is now suggesting that the arrangement could go out to consultation in a model of three new north Wales authorities.
Mr Evans said the scale of the two council models in the north would be a major concern and saw a 'glimmer of light' in the further consultation.
"There are also the cultural and linguistic differences with the strong urban industrial areas against the rural areas, particularly in Denbighshire," he said.
"It should be about how best to deliver local services not about boundaries," he said, adding that the Williams Commission which drew up proposals for 10 or 11 authorities "seemed to be a complete waste of time and money".
"Two authorities would take communities further away from the decision makers. I would be really concerned. Haven't we learned the lessons of the Betsi Cadwaladr health board?
"This whole process is a distraction beyond 2020 when we should be concentrating on providing services."
But Dyfed Edwards, Plaid Cymru leader of Gwynedd council, said that reform of the map of local government was essential and needed political leadership in all parties.
He added: "Will someone please get on with it? If the status quo isn't sustainable, then tell us what is.
"I think personally one council for north west and one for north east Wales makes sense in terms of spatial planning.
"The big question is over health and social care, where we have a health board across the whole of north Wales."
Mr Andrews said no final decisions had been taken.
"The case in north Wales is finely balanced between two or three local authorities. We therefore feel that there is a case for a further debate and would welcome views," he said.
"I want to emphasise this is not a final decision. It is the next phase in our public debate."
