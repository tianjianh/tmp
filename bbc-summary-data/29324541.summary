When two modern greats, Lorde and The Hunger Games, come together you know it's going to be amazing.

So when the 17-year-old tweeted what the cover of her single for the Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part One looked like, we were, well, slightly disappointed.
We'll have to wait almost a week to find out what Yellow Flicker Beat will sound like.
Earlier this month, the singer gave us a taste of some of the lyrics.
In August it was announced that Lorde had been chosen to handpick all the songs for the film's soundtrack.
She said: "I think the soundtrack is definitely going to surprise people."
The film's director Francis Lawrence said: "I sat down with Lorde on the set of Mockingjay this spring and I was immediately struck by how she so innately understood what we, as both fans and filmmakers, were trying to accomplish with the film."
Yellow Flicker Beat is out on 29 September and Mockingjay Part One will be released on 21 November.
