At least six students were seriously injured by gunfire, but dozens more were hurt as they tried to escape.
The gunman was accompanied by a suicide bomber, who blew himself up in the car park.
No-one so far has said they were behind the attack but the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has carried out similar raids in the town .
The name Boko Haram, loosely translated from the region's Hausa language, means "Western education is forbidden".
The gunfire at the College of Administrative and Business Studies sparked panic, with students jumping from windows to escape the militants.

They were injured after jumping out of windows and over walls, the Associated Press news agency quotes a hospital worker as saying.
The police have said that the surviving gunman is in their custody.
The attack in Potiskum comes as Boko Haram is facing renewed pressure, reports the BBC's Abdullahi Kaura Abubakar from the capital, Abuja.
A military operation is continuing in its Sambisa forest stronghold, with senior Nigerian officers say many of the insurgents have been killed and those still alive are on the run.
Despite this, Boko Haram is still able to carry out isolated attacks.
Observers say unless senior members of the group are captured, Boko Haram may be able to regroup and rearm, both within and outside Nigeria's borders.
Why Boko Haram remains a threat
What next for rescued Boko Haram captives
The group has become known for its targeting of schools and colleges with its most notorious attack on a school in Chibok in north-eastern Nigeria.
More than 200 girls were kidnapped in the attack in April 2014.
In the past few weeks the Nigerian army has freed hundreds of women and girls who had been held by Boko Haram, but the Chibok hostages have not been among them.
The group has also killed thousands of people, many of them are school and college students.
