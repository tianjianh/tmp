The midfielder injured a hamstring while playing for Arsenal in their opening-day Premier League defeat by Liverpool on 14 August.
He missed Wales' recent draws with Austria and Georgia as well as September's win over Moldova.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says the 25-year-old will miss "one or two" more games.
Arsenal have seven games before Wales, who are third in Group D, host joint leaders Serbia at Cardiff City Stadium.
Wenger is "disappointed" Ramsey will not face Swansea City in the league on Saturday, but says the player has "had a few little, little setbacks that forced us to be cautious with him".
The Frenchman added: "He's not far away now. He's on the last stage to build up his fitness.

"It's a little bit of a vicious circle. The fact that he had a little setback - we rest him - and the longer that lasts, the more you have to dedicate time to build up his fitness again.
"Then you have to create, basically, a new three weeks preparation to get him up to the level where you he was before the injury.
"It's more the time it takes to rebuild his fitness. We have decided that we give him a complete pre-season even if he misses one or two more games."
