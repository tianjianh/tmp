[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bill to ban parking on pavements

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bill banning parking on pavements has been introduced to the Scottish Parliament for the third time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the current law, only driving on the pavement is prohibited unless councils have passed specific traffic regulations.
SNP MSP Sandra White hopes her proposals will stop vehicles blocking walkways, a particular issue for people with mobility problems.
But it is unclear whether Holyrood or Westminster has the power to legislate.
The Footway Parking and Double Parking (Scotland) Bill would make it an offence to park on footways or drop kerbs and would outlaw double parking.
Ms White, the MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, wants to give traffic wardens across Scotland the right to ticket vehicles that are causing an obstruction.
The proposal has received the backing of traffic wardens, the fire service and charities such as Guide Dogs Scotland.
But some powers over parking on pavements are reserved, meaning an amendment to the 1998 Scotland Act could be needed to allow Holyrood to legislate.
Stuart Hay, director of the charity Living Streets, welcomed Ms White's bill, and said it was up to the UK and Scottish governments to work together to push the legislation forward.
He said: "The publication of this bill will hopefully clarify how a ban on pavement parking becomes law and how the constitutional issues which have thwarted efforts thus far can be resolved.
"It's vital that the Scottish secretary works with the Scottish Parliament to give councils and Police Scotland the powers they need to protect disabled and visually impaired people from inconsiderate and irresponsible parking."
Former Liberal Democrat MSP Ross Finnie and SNP MSP Joe Fitzpatrick have previously tried to ban pavement parking in Scotland.
Mr Finnie's bill ran out of time and Mr Fitzpatrick became a government minister, preventing him from putting forward a member's bill.
