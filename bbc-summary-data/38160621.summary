Hamilton Academical captain Michael Devlin is hoping to see another transfer window come and go without the club losing midfielder Ali Crawford.

Crawford, 25, has scored eight times so far this season, including the leveller in Saturday's draw at Ross County.
"We're grateful that we have got Ali Crawford," Devlin told BBC Scotland.
"I think we've been fearful we've been losing Ali for a couple of years now, and we're grateful when the transfer window shuts."
Part of Hamilton's first team since 2010, Crawford has been a regular scorer since they returned to Scotland's top-flight in 2014.
"He's capable of stepping up and producing a bit of magic and that's what happened on Saturday, because I don't think we deserved anything from the game," said defender Devlin, 23.
"But fortunately we've got Ali, he can supply us with that bit of magic.
"He's a fantastic footballer with great potential of moving on and playing at a higher level.
"We know how important he is and he's a massive part of what we're trying to do here, and while he's here we'll just be grateful and confident going into every game that we've got him on our side.''
Devlin says he would love the chance to pull on a Scotland jersey after being tipped for a call-up by Accies player-manager Martin Canning.
"That's a vote of confidence from the manager," Devlin added.
"He's shown great confidence in me since he took over. I played beside him under the previous manager and learned a lot from him. He has been a massive influence in my career.
"So to hear him say something like that, a guy that's played at the top and all his days in the Premier League, does mean a lot to me.
"It would be a dream come true to represent your country, I would love that.
"It's performances for the club that will potentially thrust you into that position, but it's for other people to decide. I'll continue to work hard here and try and improve my game and do my best for Hamilton, and if anything else comes from that fantastic."
