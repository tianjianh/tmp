Senegal international striker Famara Diedhiou has joined French Ligue 1 club Angers on a four-year contract from second division side Sochaux.

He follows the route of Cameroonian striker Karl Toko Ekambi, who switched from Sochaux to Angers on Tuesday.
The 23-year-old was top scorer in Ligue 2 last season with 21 goals for Clermont Foot, where he was on loan. He was also Ligue 2 player of the year.
Diedhiou, who has been capped once by Senegal, joined Sochaux in 2014.
Another African on the move is veteran defender Henri Bedimo who joins Olympique Marseille from rivals Lyon, after signing a deal that will keep him at the Stade Velodrome until 2019.
It will be the Cameroonian's eighth French club.
"I love challenges and I believe I have joined a competitive side in Marseille," Bedimo told the club's website.
Bedimo, who has played 222 Ligue 1 matches, has turned out for Grenoble, Toulouse, Le Havre, Chateauroux, Lens and Montpellier - with whom he won the title in 2012 - before spending the last three seasons in Lyon.
