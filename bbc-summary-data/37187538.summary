Attending to a reported stabbing in the Scarborough area, police found two people dead and one person wounded. The injured victim later died.
Reports said the suspect, a 35-year-old man, was seriously wounded.
In a related incident, police later evacuated a building in the city because of a suspicious package. Police gave no more details.
Police said two of the victims were male and the third a woman.
Constable David Hopkinson said all three victims had what appeared to be crossbow wounds and a crossbow was found on the floor nearby.
Buying a crossbow in Canada does not require a licence.
Constable Jennifer Sidhu, a Toronto police spokeswoman, told the BBC that police received reports of a stabbing incident and arrived just before 1300 EST (1800 GMT) to find the three injured in a garage.
According to Canada's National Post, one of the victims made a call to police.
Television footage showed part of a residential street in Scarborough, a suburban area east of the city's downtown area, taped off.
A motive for the attack is still unclear, police added.
