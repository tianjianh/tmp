Salih Mehmed, 25, from Bulgaria, was a passenger in a Seat Ibiza when it crashed on Bolton Road, Rochdale, on 12 December.
The car crossed on to the opposite side of the road and hit a tree. Mr Mehmed died the following day in hospital.
Family members said he had moved to Greater Manchester with the "dream" of continuing his education there.
His aunt Sevinc Mehmed said his parents were "devastated" by his death, adding: "He was a very quiet and sensible man. He was easy going, always cheerful and friendly.
"He was intelligent and would never say anything bad to hurt anyone."
Mr Mehmed was working at Argos in Heywood after he finished university in Bulgaria.
His aunt said he had told his parents there were "more opportunities in the UK" and he "would continue with his education" and "make his future there".
"Unfortunately, my precious nephew did not live to see that dream come true," she added.
The driver of the car, a 22-year-old man, sustained minor bruising. A 23-year old man travelling in the back of the car was uninjured.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
