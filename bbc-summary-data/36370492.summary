Liam Fee murder trial: Liam accused showed 'heartless cruelty'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Evidence of untreated injuries found on Liam Fee's body showed a "callous indifference" to the toddler's suffering, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rachel and Nyomi Fee deny murdering two-year-old Liam in March 2014 and abusing two other boys.
In his closing speech, advocate depute Alex Prentice, said the pair had shown "an unyielding, heartless cruelty" towards Liam.
He urged the jury to find them guilty of all of the charges against them.
Mr Prentice said the extent of the injuries and the lack of medical assistance should assist the jury in working out the mental attitude of Rachel and Nyomi Fee towards the youngster.
He also said the two accused acted together with a "common criminal purpose" and described it as a "circumstantial case".
Mr Prentice told the jury it was a "harrowing case" and said they would need to be made of "granite" not to be moved by what had been heard. But he said sympathy should play no part in their judgement.
Mr Prentice told the jury of nine women and six men the most obvious thing for an adult to do would be to tell a doctor, nurse or hospital the real reason for injuries suffered by a child.
He said: "The conduct I say is set out on the evidence in the charges suggest a course of violence and cruelty towards the children.
"That's capable of providing you with evidence in relation to the murder charge.
"I ask you to find both the accused guilty of everything that's on this indictment. You're entitled to do that.
"There's sufficient evidence led in this case to justify the charges as they stand. The evidence is there in support of all that is on the indictment."
He added: "You can look at the awkward and very deliberate lies and explanations that were put forward.
"The most obvious thing would be to tell a doctor or a health visitor or a hospital immediately. If it's sexualised behaviour, that indicates a problem that has to be addressed.
"No, they hide it. They never tell anyone. They never mention it until the night Liam dies.
"In this case I suggest there's a clear and compelling case of the boys being ill-treated in a way that is completely unacceptable."
Nyomi Fee, 29, and Rachel Fee, 31, deny killing the toddler at a house near Glenrothes in Fife on 22 March 2014, by repeatedly inflicting "blunt force trauma" to his head and body.
They also face charges they neglected Liam and abused two other children.
The pair blame one of the other children in their care for killing Liam.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
