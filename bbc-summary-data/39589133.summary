Cardiff manager Neil Warnock says he expects defender Sol Bamba to miss the remainder of the season.

The 32-year-old suffered a groin injury in last week's 0-0 draw at Barnsley.
"We've assessed him now and we think he'll be out for the season," he said.
"He did train yesterday but not fully. The only chance he has in the last couple of games, if any chance.
"At first we thought that he could be out for months."
He continued: "It's not severe as we first thought. He was chirpy yesterday."
Meanwhile, Lee Peltier could make his first appearance in 10 weeks against Sheffield Wednesday, after an injury which Warnock says has caused him "agony".
The 30-year old has not played since the end of January after suffering an ankle injury in the 2-0 win over Preston.
"He's training really well. We're having to hold him back a bit. I'm toying with the idea of using him tomorrow on the bench.
"But we've just got to be careful. He had an operation to take away one large bit of bone and two others. He must have been in agony for weeks. But it's good that it's been cleared up."
Warnock also welcomed the news that goalline technology will be used in the Championship next season.
He was Crystal Palace manager in 2009 when Freddie Sears found the net against Bristol City, only for the ball to hit the the stanchion and bounce back into play as the referee failed to spot the goal. Palace went on to lose the game 1-0.
"It's not before time. I've had my disappointments, with Bristol City being my main one. We all celebrated but four people in black didn't see it," he said.
"It can only help referees. I thought it would have been introduced the same time as the Premier League (in 2013) with what's at stake in the Championship."
