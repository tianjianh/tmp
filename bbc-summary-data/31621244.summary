The film took £4.5m between Friday and Sunday, about a third of the amount taken the previous weekend (£13.5m).
After 10 days, it has grossed £25.24m, overtaking The Wolf of Wall Street (£22.70m) to be the biggest 18 certificate film at the UK box office.
Disney animation Big Hero 6 came in second with £2.58m.
Aardman's Shaun the Sheep was not far behind with box office receipts totalling £2.42m.
Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service, written by the director and Jane Goldman - writer of numerous screenplays including Kick-Ass and the Woman in Black and who is also wife to Jonathan Ross - took fourth spot with £1.2m.
The chart's highest new entry was The Wedding Ringer, which rounded up the top five with just under £1m in takings.
Teen sci-fi film Project Almanac was another new entry at six.
It was a similar tale for Fifty Shades at the North American box office, where it took an estimated $23.2m (£15m) over the weekend to stay top of the chart, despite takings falling by 73% from its record-breaking $85m (£55m) holiday debut.
The adaptation of EL James's best-selling erotic novel is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and stars Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson.
James's trilogy of Fifty Shades books have reportedly sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 50 languages.
