Three of the 12 holes at Gogarburn Golf Club have been closed since Monday to allow police teams to search the area, following Saturday's discovery.
It is understood body parts were found in two different locations.
The initial find was in the grounds of Gogar Mount House and the other parts were later found a short distance away.
Dave Hamilton, Gogarburn Golf Club greens convenor, said he understood a caretaker at Gogar Mount House found a skull on Saturday and alerted the police.
He said: "On Monday morning detectives arrived and told us they had found a skull in the property next door to us and we knew nothing about it.
"We've closed the top field and we are playing a short course instead of the full course.
"We are helping the police in any way we can."
Police divers are searching ponds on the boundary of the golf course.
