Fifa presidency: Five candidates hoping to succeed Sepp Blatter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five candidates are hoping to be named Fifa president Sepp Blatter's successor at a special congress on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Gianni Infantino, Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne are all in contention.
The election in Zurich follows Blatter's decision in June to stand down amid corruption allegations at world football's governing body.
The new president will be the first since 1998, when Blatter was elected.
Sheikh Salman and Infantino are both favourites for world football's top job.
Suspended Uefa president Michel Platini was the original favourite but, along with Blatter, he was banned in December from all football-related activities for eight years by Fifa's ethics committee.
The pair deny any wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans. They are expected to find out the result before Friday's election.
BBC Sport takes a look at the five candidates in the running.
