Aaron O'Connor had Stevenage's best chance of the game, as a wayward header from the Barnet defence fell favourably and he shot wide of the far post.
Michael Tonge had a free header from 10 yards out, but steered it straight at Bees keeper Jamie Stephens.
Barnet had one last chance in stoppage time, but Shaun Batt nodded straight at Boro keeper Chris Day.
Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"I don't think it was a spectacle that people would come and watch for entertainment, but for a full-blooded affair you can enjoy it from that side.
"From my point of view it's a big improvement from where we've been the past few weeks. I felt if anyone was going to nick it, we were going to nick it.
"I think when you lose games and draw games in quick succession you try to build something from your team. The minimum requirement is to compete and I felt we did that all over the pitch today.
"We stood up to the challenge. If there is any slight criticism then it's that we didn't get on the ball as much as we could do."
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London:

"We've got a lot of injuries, we've got a lot of people missing and they didn't have one shot, so it's all credit for the courage and the discipline of our players that played today.
"I thought we might have nicked it on the counter-attack or the break, but obviously with them lower than us in the league, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out it was an important game.
"They haven't gained on us, we've got another point on our total, another clean sheet despite having two players injured in the first half, so a good all-round performance and a real fighting spirit from the whole squad."
