McLaren has adorned its cars with #BillyWhizz stickers for the Russian Grand Prix, which begins on Friday,
It is understood other teams will be joining McLaren in a show of solidarity for Billy.
The 17-year-old from Charlwood, Surrey, hit the back of another car on 16 April and had to be airlifted to hospital.
Woking-based McLaren said it had consistently showed its support for Billy over the last fortnight. It "felt this gesture was appropriate", and added given the sense of communality in Formula 1, it was no surprise the other teams were rallying round in a similar way.
Williams Racing confirmed it would be putting on a similar display, and is also auctioning off a race suit worn by Felipe Massa and signed race boots worn by Lance Stroll.
So far the items have raised £2,600 on ebay, and this money is being donated to a Just Giving page set up by Steven Hunter, head of Billy's team, Derbyshire-based JHR Developments. It will help support the teenager through his life-changing injuries.
More than £760,000 has been donated so far following the crash during the Formula 4 British Championship at Donington Park in Leicestershire.
Formula 1 driver Jenson Button and F1 driver Max Verstappen have both donated £15,000, while Billy's F4 former rival Devlin DeFrancesco gave £26,000.
The Russian Grand Prix begins on Friday with practice sessions, before qualifying on Saturday and race day on Sunday.
