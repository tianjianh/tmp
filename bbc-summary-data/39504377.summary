Lifeguards return to duty at seven locations this weekend, with the RNLI giving safety advice.
Despite warmer weather, supervisor Rob Steele said water temperatures are cold and swimmers should wear wetsuits.
Lifeguards will again be at Three Cliffs Bay, Gower, after a campaign led to their installation in 2016 when two people drowned 12 months earlier.
They will also be on patrol at Tenby South Beach and Whitesands, Pembrokeshire, Aberavon in Port Talbot, Coney Beach and Trecco Bay, Bridgend county and Whitmore Bay, Vale of Glamorgan.
In total, the RNLI will patrol 38 Welsh beaches over the course of the summer in 2017.
Mr Steele added: "Conditions can also be changeable so please bring appropriate clothing and be ready for all weathers and if you see someone in trouble in the water, don't attempt to rescue them yourself, as you could also be putting yourself in more danger."
In 2016, the RNLI responded to 1,271 incidents and rescued or assisted 1,436 people in Wales.
