Eales has been owner of the League One club since the summer of 2014 when they were in League Two.
"I'm not a quitter, I'm not going anywhere," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
"What I've always said from day one is, if I can find a financial partner that could assist me, I would welcome them with open arms."
Eales believes Oxford can achieve promotion to the Championship in the next couple of seasons, but concedes the club would need to significantly increase its playing budget.
"This club is now in my blood and I want to as far I can contribute to us building future sustainable success in the Championship," he said. "Additional investment enables us to be more competitive.
"It's quite a big financial burden when you're considering it on your own and they say the challenge becomes even greater, the higher you climb.
"For me, life's about driving forward and the art of possibility, achieving as much as you can and bringing people with you."
