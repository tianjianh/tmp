Detectives and investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) want to interview Andy Hill as soon as possible.
Reports that Mr Hill, 51, has left hospital are unconfirmed by police.
Eleven people died when the Hawker Hunter jet plummeted on to the A27.
The former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, was placed in a medically-induced coma at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton after the crash, and was later moved to a specialist hospital.
An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash.
It said it was not clear whether he initiated his ejection.
After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected.
A friend also described him as an expert pilot.
