Torquay's Josh Rees netted a first-half opener, but Jack Sampson levelled five minutes after half-time.
Dan Butler restored the lead, only for Neill Byrne to equalise soon after and Kristian Dennis put Town in front.
But Iffy Allen scored on his debut to keep Torquay in the competition.
Allen's goal came just two minutes after Macclesfield had gone in front in a game which was re-arranged after the pitch at Plainmoor was deemed unplayable on Saturday.
"I'm happy with the lads' attitude, I'm happy with how hard they worked, how much they put in and the fact that they never gave up," Torquay manager Kevin Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"I'm happy to be in the cup still, I thought with the chances we had we probably could have won it, but a couple of the goals we allowed were terrible defending.
"There are lessons to learn, things to work on, things to be positive about.
"I find it hard to imagine what fans think watching that because it must have been exciting, frustrating and terrorising all at once, and it certainly was for me."
