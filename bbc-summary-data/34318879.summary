[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prison inspectors have expressed concerns about levels of serious violence directed at staff and inmates at a Kent young offenders institution.

Improvised weapons such as sharpened cutlery had been used during fights at Cookham Wood in Rochester, they found.
An unannounced inspection found an increase in the number of boys needing hospital treatment for head injuries.
Prison officials said they had taken measures to improve safety and behaviour since the inspection.
HM Inspectorate of Prisons said that at the time of the inspection in May, Cookham Wood held 166 boys, most aged 16 and 17.
About 10% of the boys had been convicted of or charged with murder or manslaughter.
The number of violent incidents was very high and in the six months leading up to March 2015 there had been 61 assaults and 92 fights, some of which were very serious.
Assaults on staff had almost doubled since the last inspection with 21 in the preceding six months, some resulting in serious injury.
However, the inspectors found levels of self-harm had fallen and health care had improved.
Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said Cookham Wood reflected systemic problems across young offenders institutions.
"The welcome fall in the number of children in custody means that those who remain represent a more concentrated mix of very challenging young people, held in a smaller number of establishments that are increasingly unsuitable to meet their needs, and cared for by a staff group beset by shortages and a lack of training for their complex and demanding role," he said.
"A much wider political and policy response is needed if we are to fulfil our responsibilities to care for these, our most damaged children, safely and help them to grow into adults who are valued, not feared."
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said: "Cookham Wood manages an increasingly complex group of boys.
"Since the inspection, staff numbers have increased; a new education contract has been introduced; staff have been trained in new restraint techniques and safeguarding measures have been strengthened, all of which have had a positive impact on safety and behaviour.
"Tackling violence and providing a safe environment remains the governor's biggest challenge and top priority and work will continue to improve standards even further."
