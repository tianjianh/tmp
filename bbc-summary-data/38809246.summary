The 33-year-old has scored 15 goals in 28 games since rejoining the Seagulls on a season-long loan last summer.
He has now agreed a two-and-a-half-year deal at the Amex Stadium.
Murray joined the Cherries for Â£4m in September 2015, but was restricted to just seven starts for the Premier League club last season.
He previously scored 56 goals for Brighton between January 2008 and May 2011 before moving to Crystal Palace on a free transfer.
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Christian Walton has been recalled from a loan spell at Luton to cover for David Stockdale while Niki Maenpaa recovers from a shoulder injury.
The 21-year-old made 33 appearances during his six-month stay with the Hatters.
