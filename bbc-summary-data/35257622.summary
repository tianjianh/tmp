Berdych will play Novak Djokovic - against whom he has won two of 23 meetings - in the last four.

Nadal was made to work for his victory by the world number 79, but prevailed in just over two hours.
He will next face Ukrainian world number 94 Illya Marchenko, who upset Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-3 7-6 (3).
