Basketball has changed its rules on headgear in a move that will allow players to wear the hijab during matches.

Previous rules had banned the practice, over what world governing body Fiba said was a safety issue.
The Qatar women's team withdrew from the 2014 Asian Games after being denied permission to wear the hijab - a head covering worn by many Muslim women.
On Thursday, new rules were ratified that will take effect from 1 October.
"The new rule comes as a result of the fact that traditional dress codes in some countries - which called for the head and/or entire body being covered - were incompatible with previous headgear rules," a Fiba statement read.
Fiba began a revision process of its headgear rule in September 2014, with exceptions being granted at national level as part of a two-year testing period.
Earlier that year, football's governing body Fifa officially authorised the wearing of head covers for religious reasons during matches.
