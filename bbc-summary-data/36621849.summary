Ronan Costello, 17, died on 14 June, three days after being injured during an under-19s game against Salford.
The funeral service was held at St Patrick's Church in New North Road, Huddersfield, followed by a private family burial.
His family have acknowledged his death was "a tragic accident".
In a statement they said: "We are absolutely devastated to lose Ronan so tragically and suddenly. He was a loving and caring 17-year-old lad.
"He was dedicated to his family and friends and was a credit to all of his family. We are so proud of him and his achievements.
"We are all truly heartbroken and Ronan will be missed and forever in our hearts."
Huddersfield Giants caretaker-coach and head of youth development, Andy Kelly, said: "It's been the worst week of my sporting life.
"You never truly encapsulate in words how I felt and how we feel as a group.
"It's just the most horrendous time and that's how it will remain."
