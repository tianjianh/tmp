The four home football associations have held further talks over a Team GB women's football team taking part in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish representatives held discussions on the topic while attending the Uefa Congress in Helsinki, Finland.
Men's and women's sides competed under the GB banner during the 2012 Olympics.
Plans for the teams to compete at the 2016 Games were scrapped after protests from the Irish, Scottish and Welsh FAs.
Though there is no prospect of a return for a men's side, it is believed there could be a possibility of a women's team competing in 2020.
The associations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have traditionally been against teams playing under a GB flag for fear of losing their status as independent football nations.
Wales boss Chris Coleman has previously said he is not in favour of the idea.
"I cannot accept we should be a Great Britain team. I think that is wrong. Our independence would possibly go away," former Football Association of Wales (FAW) president Trefor Lloyd Hughes told BBC Wales Sport.
British Olympic chiefs have already said they are in favour of fielding GB soccer teams in Tokyo.
