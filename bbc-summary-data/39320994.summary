The HGVs blocked the southbound carriageway from 05:00 GMT on Saturday.
Fire crews said both drivers had a "lucky escape" after receiving minor injuries. No-one else was hurt.
One of the lorries overturned and landed halfway down a bank between Bicester and Thame. The road was closed until 18:00 for emergency repairs.
Incident commander for Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue, Paul Webster, said: "It was a lucky escape for the two drivers and the other road users that there were no serious injuries. The cause of the accident is being investigated by police."
