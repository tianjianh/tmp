The demonstration, organised by the Friends of the Library of Birmingham (FLB), saw people march from New Street to Victoria Square from noon.
Birmingham City Council has cut £1.3m from the library's budget. Hours have been reduced from 73 a week to 40 and the number of staff is being halved.
FLB member Martin Sullivan said the decision could be reversed.
"No decision is final," he said.
"The council's argument it has no money to spend on the library is false because they are making decisions to invest in a number of other things while rejecting the library.
"We think there is scope, at least, to increase the number of hours."
The library, which opened in September 2013, is the biggest in Europe and features an amphitheatre and roof gardens.
