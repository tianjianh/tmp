The three-time World Cup winner scored a spectacular goal with a bicycle kick in the 1981 film featuring Sylvester Stallone and Sir Michael Caine.
The boots had an estimated price between £4,200 and £5,600.
Pele, 75, is selling more than 2,000 items of personal memorabilia including shirts and medals over three days.
Other early items sold included a "Pele 2015 best in the world wood plaque" (£1,225), a "Pele 2014 Brazilian Football Confederation 100th anniversary medal" (£425) and a "50 years of the first Intercontinental Cup title plaque" (£225).
Pele is the only player to have won the World Cup three times and his winning medals from 1958, 1962 and 1970 are expected to net up to £140,000 each.
One of the highlights in the sale is the ball with which Pele scored the 1,000th goal of his career, which auctioneers say could sell for up to £42,000.
He is held by many as being the greatest footballer in history, scoring 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches and appearing 91 times for Brazil.
In Escape to Victory, Pele, Stallone and Caine portrayed Nazi prisoners playing a propaganda football match during World War Two.
