Lewis Kerr was put in an induced coma after hitting a fence following a collision with another rider at an event in Peterborough on 3 August.
The 25-year-old, from Snettisham in Norfolk, is now recovering and has said he intends to race again.
Before the team's season finale he did a lap on the back of a bike, to the applause of the watching crowd.
Mr Kerr said: "It's good to be back and I want to thank the club about how supportive they've been."
He said that he was looking forward to racing during the next season.
"I want to be better than I was, so there's a lot of fitness to do over the winter," he said.
