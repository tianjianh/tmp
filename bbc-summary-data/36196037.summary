But manager Mark McGhee has incurred a one-match suspension for his later reaction to the incident.
McGhee immediately accepted the touchline ban for comments made to the fourth official at full-time.
Assistant manager Stephen Robinson was dismissed along with Lasley, with both cases to be considered at a Scottish FA disciplinary hearing on 12 May.
The notice of complaint against McGhee and Robinson says the duo "adopted aggressive behaviour" towards the fourth official and used "offensive, abusing and insulting language".
McGhee will sit in the stand for Saturday's visit of St Johnstone, while Robinson and Lasley will both be available pending their hearings.
Veteran midfielder Lasley was sent off by referee Bobby Madden late in the game following a challenge on Kenny McLean.
"I thought it was more of a tired, miss-timed tackle, rather than one that was reckless, violent or with intent to hurt," said McGhee.
"There was another tackle earlier in the game that was fairly similar in many ways, that resulted in a booking, which is why I was surprised at the red card.
"Obviously Bobby, who I thought had a good game overall, had the yellow in his hand and he's changed his mind, which he's perfectly entitled to do, but I think his initial gut reaction to the challenge was the correct one."
