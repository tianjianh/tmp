Perfect Strangers was made as a test run during preparations for making a feature-length romantic comedy, Journey Bound.
The 26-minute short will be given its first Scottish screening at Glasgow's Southside Film Festival next month.
Perfect Strangers was shot at locations on Rannoch Moor.
The comedy was made by Bafta-nominated director Ryan Hendrick and David Newman.
With actors Kenny Boyle and Clare Sheerin in the lead roles, the short features music from Scottish-based singer-songwriter Jack Henderson's debut album.
Hendrick said: "We are thrilled that our little film is finally returning home for its first Scottish screening after a successful few months on the festival circuit.
"We were so incredibly lucky to be able to take Perfect Strangers to the Cannes Film Festival, it has opened so many doors for us."
Perfect Strangers tells the story of two people stranded in the Scottish Highlands on Christmas Eve who team up to try and get home in time for Christmas.
It was shot on Rannoch Moor over five days days last winter during preparations for Journey Bound, a forthcoming comedy road movie starring Ford Kiernan, Clare Grogan, Sylvester McCoy and Rutger Hauer.
Hendrick said: "It is crucial to enable independent filmmakers working with very little resources to get their films out there.
"It's incredibly challenging on the festival circuit and you always receive far more rejections than you do acceptance notices."
He added: "Independent film festivals like the Southside Film Festival need to be supported."
