At least 30 people were killed in the blaze.
Three of their names have now emerged.
Five-year-old Isaac Shawo has been described by his mother as a "beautiful boy".
He was a pupil at Saint Francis of Assisi Catholic Primary School and lived in Grenfell Tower with parents Genet Shawo and Paulos Petakle and brother Luca, who is three.
He reportedly got separated from his family in the smoke and the BBC has now learned that he died.
Artist and photographer Khadija Saye, 24, whose artwork is being shown in the Venice Biennale, lived on the 20th floor of Grenfell Tower with her mother, Mary Mendy.
Labour MP David Lammy confirmed her death, writing on Twitter: "May you rest in peace Khadija Saye. God bless your beautiful soul. My heart breaks today. I mourn the tragic loss of a wonderful young woman."
He said she was a "talented artist".  His wife is her employer and mentor. and she had been filmed for a BBC documentary.
Khadija's work in Venice is based on Gambian spiritual practices and is being shown in the Diaspora Pavilion. She had written on Facbeook: "It's been a real journey, tears shed, highs and lows, but mama, I'm an artist exhibiting at the Venice Biennale and the blessings are abundant!"
Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, believed to have been 23, came to the UK in 2014 and was studying civil engineering while living in North Kensington.
Syria Solidarity Campaign said: "[He] undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK, in his own home."
He had been in a flat on the 14th floor with his brother Omar but the pair lost each other in their attempt to leave the building.
Mohammed then returned to the flat and tried to call family members in Syria but could not get connected to them, so spoke on the phone to a friend in the country for two hours while he waited to be rescued.
The brothers had been due to join the Syria Solidarity Campaign on Saturday to take part in The Great Get Together, celebrating the life of murdered MP Jo Cox and marking Refugee Week.
