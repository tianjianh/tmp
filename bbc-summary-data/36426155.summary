Emergency calls to the ambulance service have been disrupted after its computer system lost power.

Health chiefs urged patients to only call in a life-threatening emergency after they were forced to rely on a back-up programme.
It means call handlers have to write the 999 details by hand, rather than use a computer dispatch system.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said some of their vehicles' satellite navigation and mapping systems were also down.
It said engineers were urgently trying to resolve the problem.
Richard Lee, director of operations at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said that if an ambulance was dispatched, it would be "helpful" if someone could wait in the street to flag it down.
"Please only ring us if the situation is life-threatening, and use us appropriately," he added.
