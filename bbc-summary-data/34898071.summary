Probe over police chief and legal head's relationship

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dyfed-Powys Police's deputy chief constable and its director of legal services are under investigation after it emerged they had a relationship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Langley, who was appointed to the deputy's role in March 2014, has been "temporarily" redeployed into a Wales-wide role, the force said.
Legal director Samantha Gainard remains in her post.
The investigation is examining any "consequences or otherwise" on internal force matters, a force spokesman said.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission received a referral from Dyfed-Powys Police but determined the case was suitable to be investigated locally.
In a statement, the force said: "Dyfed-Powys Police received allegations of misconduct concerning deputy chief constable Langley and director of legal services Samantha Gainard, which were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
"An investigation has commenced and is being conducted by Chief Constable David Shaw of West Mercia Police.
"Part of the investigation concerns the consequences or otherwise of a former relationship on internal force matters. It is not appropriate to comment any further due to the ongoing investigation."
Regarding Mr Langley's new post, a spokesman said: "The police forces in Wales have been considering for some time re-introducing the role of All-Wales deputy chief constable, in line with the practice in a number of other regions.
"DCC Langley is qualified for this role, and has been temporarily redeployed into it while the investigation is under way.
"He will be working with the four Welsh police forces to improve the effectiveness of collaboration between the forces.  He will continue to receive the same salary."
