In a goalless first half, Barnet goalkeeper Jamie Stephens was made to work hard to keep Oxford at bay.
But O'Dowda broke through in the second half, slotting in after a defensive error before running through from the half-way line to double the lead.
Barnet's Andy Yiadom had a shot saved by Oxford's Benjamin Buchel before Danny Hylton smashed in the third.

Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London: "I thought we were excellent in the first half. We had a couple of good chances and their keeper made a couple of good saves.
"It was just disappointing to concede that goal so soon after half-time, and of course the game opened up a little bit and we all know how dangerous some of their players are.
"We still tried to attack, still tried to get one back. I always fancy if we do get one back we can come back and get another one, but it wasn't to be today."
