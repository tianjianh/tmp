Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"Wigan need to win their last two games so we can expect them to be very motivated to get a result and to work very hard to make it very difficult for us.
"They'll be doing everything in their power to get a result, so we can expect a very tough game.
"The season has gone very quick with all the games we've had, so it's always nice to play at home and if we get a result, we know we'll be in the top six.
"You try to stay calm at this stage of the campaign and we need to trust ourselves that we can do what we need to do before the end of the season."

Ex-Reading captain and BBC Radio Berkshire's Ady Williams:
"Home form has been so impressive for Reading this season, just two defeats, so you would expect them to beat a side 23rd in the Championship table and destined for League One.
"The game at The DW Stadium at the beginning of November ended in a 3-0 away win, Gareth McLeary and Yann Kermorgant inflicting the damage.
"The stat that may concern Jaap Stam, Wigan have won their past three league visits to the Madejski Stadium, conceding just one goal."
BBC Radio Manchester's Paul Rowley:
"It looks a near impossible task for Wigan to survive in the Championship despite their history of Great Escapes in their Premier League days.
"But Graham Barrow's side can scrape home on goal difference if they win their last two games (against play-off chasing Reading and Leeds United), Birmingham City lose their last two, while Blackburn Rovers have to fail to win either of their last two.
"On the plus side, the 'Tics have won their last three games at the Madejski, and super sub Nick Powell has scored five goals in the last four matches after coming off the bench late on."
