Billed as Scotland's largest rural performing arts festival, it will see a wide range of performances at various venues until 4 June.
Among the highlights are a Scottish Ensemble residency, Scottish Opera's pop-up roadshow and comedian Mark Nelson.
Many of the events had sold out prior to the start of the programme.
