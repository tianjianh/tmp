Sheriff Hutton Castle goes up for sale as part of £1.1m sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ruined castle once owned by Richard III has gone on the market as part of a £1.1m estate sale near York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheriff Hutton Castle's remains date back to the 14th Century, with the English king's son thought to be buried at a nearby church.
The sale also includes a large house and annexe, a cottage, outbuildings and gardens situated on 11.5 acres of land.
Previously owned by eight English monarchs including Henry VIII, it was last inhabited in the mid-16th Century.
The southwest tower is the most complete part of the castle's remains, standing at five storeys high.
Henry Scott, from Boulton and Cooper Stephensons estate agents, described the sale as "totally unique and very unusual".
He said: "The estate has been in the sellers' family since the 1940s and it's been a wrench for them to put it up for sale.
"There's already been a smattering of interest and I fully anticipate it attracting interest from far and wide, possibly even abroad given the connections to Richard III."
He added: "I've never sold anything like this before, it's very rare to have something like this come to the market."
Originally built by Lord John Neville of Raby, the site was used by the Council of the North until the 16th Century.
Current owners the Howarth family originally put the castle on the market almost 10 years ago for £1.5m, but it failed to sell.
