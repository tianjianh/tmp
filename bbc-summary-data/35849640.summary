[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers need two more wins to secure the Scottish Championship title and promotion after beating Queen of the South in a goal-laden match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Forrester put the hosts ahead but Iain Russell levelled from the penalty spot.
Second-half strikes by Michael O'Halloran, Andy Halliday and James Tavernier put Rangers in control.
Gary Oliver and Mark Millar replied for Queens but they could not draw themselves level again.
The Ibrox side now hold a 14-point lead over nearest challengers Falkirk and are 20 points ahead of Hibernian, who have games in hand over both of the top two sides.
Having lost 3-2 to the Bairns after being 2-0 up last Friday, Rangers had been boosted by Hibs' defeat at Raith Rovers the following day.
And Mark Warburton's side took the lead when Forrester converted following Halliday clever back-heel.
However, the visitors were level midway through the first half. Russell was fouled in the box by Rangers captain Lee Wallace and scored the resulting spot-kick.
The second period opened with O'Halloran firing into the net from a Wallace cross, and Halliday's overhead kick stretched Rangers' advantage.
Kenny Miller had set up the hosts' third and he notched another assist by heading the ball back for Tavernier's close-range effort.
A quick response came from the visitors with Alex Harris laying on a pass for Oliver to net.
And there was a late rally from James Fowler's side as Millar struck from outside the box following Kyle Hutton's pass.
Millar had a further effort in stoppage time but Wes Foderingham made the save.
Match ends, Rangers 4, Queen of the South 3.
