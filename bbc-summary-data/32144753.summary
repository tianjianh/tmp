He's best known as Oliver Queen in the TV series Arrow, but Stephen Amell is set to hit the big screen.

The 33-year-old will play vigilante Casey Jones in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.
He'll star opposite Megan Fox who will return as news reporter April O'Neil.
The Paramount Pictures film is due out in June next year, following the first movie in the franchise last Autumn, which did well at the box office but was panned by critics.
Stephen posted about his excitement on his Twitter and Facebook feeds.
Amell, from Toronto in Canada, is married with one daughter.
He started his acting career in Channel 4 Queer as Folk and has also been in The Vampire Diaries and New Girl.
Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio and Will Arnett are also confirmed in the line-up, but details about other cast members aren't out yet.
Variety Magazine reports that six actors were put through their paces over the weekend, but Amell's chemistry with Megan Fox nabbed him the role.
Last year's remake of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which was originally a hit in the 1980s, topped the UK box office taking Â£4.79 million in its first week.
But it wasn't without its critics. The Guardian reviewed it as "total turtle turkey", and the Telegraph didn't mince its words either, calling it, "dreadful".
