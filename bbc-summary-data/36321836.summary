Aged 31, five months and five days, he achieved the landmark by reaching five on the fourth day of the second Test against Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street.
He brought up the milestone with a leg-side clip for four off Nuwan Pradeep and saluted the England balcony.
He beat India legend Sachin Tendulkar's record of 31 years, 10 months and 20 days, which has stood since 2005.
England's leading Test run-scorer, Cook is the 12th player in history to 10,000 runs, and only the second opener.
Brian Lara, Kumar Sangakkara, Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, Mahela Jayawardene, Sunil Gavaskar, Jacques Kallis, Allan Border, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Waugh are the other batsmen to reach the milestone.

Cook surpassed Graham Gooch's tally of 8,900 Test runs at Headingley last May to become England's leading run-scorer.
He is playing the 128th Test of a glittering career which has seen him score 28 Test hundreds - also a record for an Englishman.
Cook made a century on debut against India in 2006, but was ruled out of the next match because of illness. He has not missed a Test since.
Appointed captain in 2012 following Andrew Strauss' retirement, Cook led England to Ashes series wins over Australia in 2013 and 2015.
