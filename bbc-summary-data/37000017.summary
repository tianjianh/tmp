Geraint Thomas suffered a late crash in the men's road race while GB's three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was also down the field as Belgian Greg van Avermaet triumphed.
American shooter Ginny Thrasher, 19, won the first gold of the 31st Games.
Peaty broke his own record in reaching the 100m breaststroke semi-finals.
As the first medals were won, there was drama elsewhere - with a controlled explosion on an unattended bag, while a stray military bullet landed in a media tent.
Live - all the action from day one in Rio
A gruelling road race ended with Van Avermaet sprinting first across the line after passing Poland's Rafal Majka in the last few seconds.
British hopes were ended when Thomas crashed on the final descent, after Froome and compatriot Adam Yates failed to stay with the leaders in the 237.5km race.
Welshman Thomas remounted to finish 10th, one place ahead of Froome, who had to be told to register for the race by two BBC journalists - minutes before the start at Fort Copacabana - after failing to hear his name being called over the public address system.
There was a surprise name as the first gold medal winner of the Games - Ginny Thrasher.
A biomedical engineering student, she secured her maiden major international victory in the women's 10m air rifle, scoring 208.0 to leave China's 2006 world champion Du Li with silver.

Adam Peaty - the swimmer who was once frightened of water - scared his rivals with a new world best.
The 21-year-old clocked 57.55 seconds to break his own world record of 57.98 and will bid to seal his place in the final at 03:16 BST on Sunday.
Team GB colleague William Fox-Pitt is more than twice his age, but is eyeing an extraordinary equestrian success.
"I'm lucky to be here," said the 47-year-old rider, who was in a coma nine months ago after a fall, but leads the eventing competition at the halfway point of the dressage, the first of three disciplines.
GB rowers Kath Grainger and Vicky Thornley went through to the semi-finals of the women's doubles sculls, while the men's lightweight four and men's pair also progressed.
But British Commonwealth champion Ashley McKenzie was in tears after being knocked out the -60kg category of judo, while GB's men made a losing start to their Olympic hockey campaign with a 4-1 loss to Belgium.

Brazil's bomb squad earlier carried out a controlled explosion on an unattended backpack near the cycling road race finish.
The bag may have belonged to a homeless man, a spokeswoman for the public security department said.
A loud blast shook the media seats near the finishing line amid tight security at South America's first Olympics.
Meanwhile, there was a scare at the Olympic Equestrian Centre - which is located near a military compound - as a bullet pierced the roof of the media tent and landed on the floor. The competition was not disrupted and nobody was hurt.
Rio 2016 organisers have apologised after spectators faced long queues to enter the Olympic Park on day one of the Games.
There have also been reports that X-ray machines were turned off to speed up waiting times for spectators.
But organisers said they have increased security staff at checkpoints and the lines were back to normal.
Cypriot weightlifter Antonis Martasidis has joined an unconfirmed Greek competitor as the first two athletes sent home from Rio 2016 for doping.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova has been been cleared to compete in Rio after a convoluted drugs case that saw her go through the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The world champion will line up in the 100m breaststroke heats on Sunday after initially being banned because of a previous doping violation.
She is among a team of more than 270 Russian athletes at the Games, about two thirds of the original entry despite the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) recommending a blanket ban after a state-sponsored doping scandal.
