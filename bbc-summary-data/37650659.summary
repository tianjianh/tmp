Leading 1-0 from the first leg, the Swedish side netted an away goal with Olivia Schough's volley.
City, who missed out on the last-16 phase last season, levelled on the night through Sarah Crilly.
But Schough scored again from close range and Glasgow could not recover, Erin Cuthbert threatening late on.
Mimmi Larsson's header in last week's initial meeting had put Eskilstuna ahead in the tie, albeit narrowly.
And Schough made City's task all the more difficult with her early strike meaning Scott Booth's hosts had to score at least three to progress at Airdrieonians' Excelsior Stadium.
Crilly converted a back-post cross but Schough then scored a rebound shot following a Gemma Fay save.
Defeat means Glasgow join fellow Scottish Women's Premier League side Hibernian Ladies in exiting the Champions League, Hibs having lost 10-1 on aggregate against Bayern Munich earlier this week.
