[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish Water has confirmed that less than half of households billed for water had paid by the due date.

In its first billing cycle, it collected 30.5m euros (Â£21m), compared with about 67m euros (Â£47m) that was due.
In April, the company sent bills to 1.7m households. Irish Water said 675,000 households had paid so far and it had received 46% of payments due.
Anti-water bill campaigners are claiming a victory.
But the company defended the rate of payments, calling it "a solid start".
Head of communications Elizabeth Arnett said: "Typically, in well-established UK water utilities, customers take an average of three months to pay a water bill.
"No reminders have been issued to our customers and yet we have a payment rate that is broadly in line with what would be expected for a new utility sending out a new bill for the first time.
"This represents a solid start for Irish Water".
However, those opposed to water charges have said that the figures represent a victory for them.
Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said it signalled to the Irish government in no uncertain terms that the majority of the people do not support water charges.
Anti-Austerity Alliance TD Paul Murphy said it represented "a massive victory for people power" and that a clear majority of people have sent a message that they will not pay these charges.
Householders who refuse to pay face fines.
