A crowd of shocked spectators watched the bird grab the boy's green hoodie during a show at Alice Springs Desert Park.
Witnesses said the bird tried to pick him up "like a small animal" before park staff moved in to help.
The boy, thought to be between six and eight years old, was left very upset but escaped with no serious injuries.
"On Wednesday, 6 July, an incident occurred at the Alice Springs Desert Park where an eagle made contact with an audience member," the park said in a statement.
"A thorough investigation regarding the circumstances behind this incident is under way and the eagle will be removed from the show while this investigation is ongoing."
