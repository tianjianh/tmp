A 48-year-old man suffered a serious facial injury during an altercation in the Allison Arms, on Pollokshaws Road, at about 21:30 on Saturday 21 May.
The man required hospital treatment.
Police said drinkers in the pub were "shocked at the level of violence". They believe the men in the image may be able to help with their inquiry.
The first man is described as white, in his 20s, of large build with short dark hair. He was wearing a red T-shirt.
The second man is described as white, in his 50s, with dark hair. He was wearing a blue polo shirt under a dark jacket.
Det Con Paul MacDonald, who is leading the investigation, said: "This incident has left a man seriously injured.
"Those drinking within the pub were also shocked at the level of violence displayed that evening. It is crucial we trace those responsible.
"We are appealing for anyone with information or for anyone who may recognise the men in the image to contact officers."
