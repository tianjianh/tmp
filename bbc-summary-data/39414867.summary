The body of Stacey Tierney, 29, was discovered in Dreams Â­Gentlemen's Club in Melbourne on 19 December.
Police have not released information about how the former fitness instructor, from Manchester, died.
However, a 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of perjury on Tuesday, Victoria Police said in a statement. They did not provide further details.
"The investigation into the matter continues and anyone with information is urged to contact [police]," the statement said.
Perjury carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' jail in Victoria.
Local newspaper the Herald Sun reported that police suspected illicit drugs had been removed from the scene.
Detectives were investigating whether other people were present the night Ms Tierney died, the newspaper said.
Police said in January a post-mortem would be conducted, but no details have been made public.
Ms Tierney's family have described her as "the most amazing, special, caring person".
"This loss has devastated our family," they said in a statement in January.
Ms Tierney studied dance at Oldham College and had worked as a fitness instructor at Nitro Boxing Fitness Centre and Manchester Aquatics Centre before moving to Australia.
