Connell, who plays Bobby Muir in the BBC comedy, was caught with a knuckleduster as he prepared to fly from Glasgow Airport in November 2015.
He was fined Â£450 for the offence at Paisley Sheriff Court.
Connell, who is from Bishopbriggs, won best Actor at the 2015 Scottish Comedy Awards for his role as the police-pestering character in Scot Squad.
The actor, through his solicitor, claimed he had the weapon on him as he had bought it on a previous jaunt abroad and planned to use it in a sketch but forgot it was in his bag.
A trial had been due to take place but Connell admitted having an offensive weapon on him in the airport.
The 29-year-old, who collected trolleys in Asda for nine years before he found fame, was previously reported as saying Scot Squad had changed his life.
