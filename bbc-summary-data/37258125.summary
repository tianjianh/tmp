Newborn monkey at Paignton Zoo looks exactly like Harry Potter's Lord Voldemort

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new arrival at Paignton Zoo has been nicknamed 'Voldemonkey', we can't think why...

OK OK, we know why. There's no mistaking the big black eyes, ghostly white skin and tiny slits for nostrils the Harry Potter villain is famous for.
The colobus monkey was born after her mum had to have an operation called a C-section - the first time staff at the zoo had performed the procedure.
In the wild, colobus monkeys live in all types of forest in central Africa.
Both mum and Dark Lord-lookalike are doing well and already on the hunt for Harry Potter (not really).
