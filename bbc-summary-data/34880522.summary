A rapist who attacked a 14-year-old schoolgirl in Aberdeen has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie King had offered to walk the girl, who had been drinking vodka, home - but then raped her.
King, now aged 20, denied carrying out the offence in October 2013, when he was aged 17. He was found guilty after a trial.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, a judge told King he had shown "no signs of remorse or regret" for his actions.
The offences happened at Queen Street and at the rear of shop premises at Great Northern Road.
The judge, Paul Arthurson QC, said King's victim had been a stranger to him.
"You left the scene leaving her weeping and distressed," he said.
The judge said there was "no alternative" to a substantial custodial sentence, and that King represented "a high risk of causing serious harm".
Defence counsel David Moggach said: "This was not premeditated, this was not planned. It was a chance meeting."
King will be be kept under supervision for a further two-year period after his release, and has been placed on the sex offenders register.
