[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Surrey fire station has fully reopened despite traces of legionella bacteria still being found in the building following a six-week outbreak.

Raised levels of the bacteria were found at Staines fire station during a routine inspection but were within "safe parameters".
The building has been in use during the day. Night-time crews have returned after being based at Sunbury.
The fire service said it was "difficult to completely eradicate".
Showers were removed and portable toilets brought in to allow work to be carried out on pipe work, and chemical treatments used to try to eliminate the bacteria.
A "spike" in levels of the waterborne legionella bacteria had been detected six weeks ago, but were "within safe parameters", the fire service said.
Bob Weldon-Gamble, from Surrey Fire and Rescue Service, said: "We have done absolutely everything we could - that's not been working as well as we hoped."
A Surrey County Council spokesman said: "It's not unusual for legionella to be found in large buildings with no effect on human health in most cases."
Chemical treatments will continue, and filters on tap and showers will remain in place.
