Charlie Walker's deflected free-kick put the hosts ahead, before Giorgio Rasulo's shot doubled the lead.
Grimsby then took a 3-2 lead with goals from Padraig Amond, Omar Bogle and Nathan Arnold, before Rhys Browne fired in an equaliser for Aldershot.
But Jon Nolan's cross went over Shots keeper Phil Smith and into the net to earn the Mariners all three points.
The result keeps Paul Hurst's Grimsby side third in the table, seven points above sixth-placed Braintree.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"I am just disappointed with the goals we conceded, but I thought the first-half the players showed that commitment and desire. The passing football we like to do and like to play made us score two great goals.
"In the second half we still played some good stuff and the boys still worked hard, but lapses of concentration in our box cost us.
"The players know who they are picking up in the box. Phil Smith has held his hand up for two goals and feels he could've done better, which is credit to him, but it's lapses of concentration."
Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:

"First-half going in at 2-0 was very concerning because I asked them some questions and they were quiet.
"To drag themselves back into the game and get in front and then have the disappointment of going 3-3, but clearly there was some luck in the end with the winning goal from Jon Nolan.
"We've certainly earned some luck, we haven't had it recently and I'm hoping that's a change in that fortune. What a fantastic three points and reward for the fans that were not happy at half-time as we all weren't."
