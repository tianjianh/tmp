In addition to 200 hours of network TV coverage, brought to you by presenters Clare Balding, Hazel Irvine and Jonathan Edwards, there will also be more than 650 hours of live action via six HD streams.
BBC Sport will also bring all the analysis, insight, news and highlights from Sochi 2014 to audiences wherever they are, on whichever device they want, across all 17 days of the Games.
Building on the BBC's digital success at London 2012 and other major sporting events in 2013, an innovative new approach to delivering world-class live coverage across PC, tablet and mobile has been developed for Sochi 2014. This will power the BBC's digital offering of a live event for the first time ever throughout the Winter Olympic Games.
The action in Sochi starts on 6 February, with the opening ceremony on 7 February.
2010 gold medallist Amy Williams and former Olympians Graham Bell, Colin Bryce, Emma Carrick-Anderson, Robin Cousins, Jackie Lockhart and Wilf O'Reilly form BBC Sport's world-class team of winter sports experts. Each will draw on their Winter Olympic experience to bring the most unique and insightful analysis to viewers.
All of Team GB's medal moments will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 5 live throughout the event with Chris Mitchell, Eleanor Oldroyd and Will Perry presenting all the main events and races live across 5 live's daytime schedules.
BBC Two will bring you live coverage every day from early in the morning and will have an hour-long daily highlights programme in the evening.
The 11th Winter Paralympic Games, which are being held from 7-16 March, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live and online.
