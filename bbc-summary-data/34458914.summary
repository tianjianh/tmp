[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glastonbury Festival organisers have donated tickets and "bespoke on-site festival experiences" to Oxfam's appeal to help fleeing refugees.

Five pairs of tickets and "experiences" such as a tour of the festival grounds with the festival founder Michael Eavis are being auctioned.
This year's festival has also donated ponchos and 500 pairs of discarded wellington boots to migrants in Calais.
The auction is taking place at the Oxfam online shop.
Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said: "The plight of refugees who have left their homes due to fear and aggression has moved everyone in the Glastonbury Festival team and we want to do something to help.
"We hope this auction will raise many thousands of pounds so that Oxfam, which has been a trusted partner of Glastonbury for many years, can deliver the support these people so desperately need."
The eBay auction will run until Tuesday 13 October.
