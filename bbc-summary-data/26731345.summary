A new TV mast could be built to replace Guernsey's main transmitter tower at Les Touillets, in the Castel.

Arqiva, which runs the transmitter, said the landlord may not renew the lease on the area, which is due to run out in 2016.
The company aims to apply for planning permission to build a transmitter at the nearby Frie Plady Reservoir.
Peter Wingate-Saul, community relations manager, said the mast provided a TV signal for 24,000 people.
He said: "We are starting this process now, so that we can be certain the new tower would be up and running before the lease ends.
"The new site is less than 100 metres away from the current tower, meaning that in the case of a move, we will be able to ensure equivalent TV and radio coverage."
The mast provides Freeview TV, radio for the two local stations - BBC Radio Guernsey and Island FM - and mobile phone services.
Mr Wingate-Saul said that if it is built, the tower would look very similar to the existing one and its location would allow the related buildings to be screened behind the reservoir embankments.
