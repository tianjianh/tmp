Sergio Aguero: Man City contest FA violent conduct charge for Winston Reid elbow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City are contesting a violent conduct charge against striker Sergio Aguero for elbowing West Ham's Winston Reid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aguero, 28, clashed with Reid during Sunday's 3-1 win in the Premier League.
If found guilty, the Argentina international would be banned for three matches and miss the Manchester derby on 10 September.
He would also miss a league match against Bournemouth and the EFL Cup game against Swansea.
The Football Association said referee Andre Marriner and his officials did not see the 76th-minute incident so it has decided to take retrospective action after reviewing television footage.
An independent panel is due to rule on the case on Friday using written submissions and reviewing video evidence.
Aguero, who is out of Argentina's two 2018 World Cup qualifiers this month with a calf injury, will not appear in person.
