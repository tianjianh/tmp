The 27-year-old, who scored six goals in 18 appearances after joining the Championship club on loan in January, has agreed a three-year contract.
"I believe we've signed the most talented player at Championship level in terms of ability," head coach Lee Johnson said.
Tomlin had two years remaining on his contract with Bournemouth.
The Leicester-born former Middlesbrough and Peterborough man made six Premier League appearances for the Cherries after signing from Boro in August 2015.
"He was fantastic for us last season and I believe his best football is ahead of him," Johnson added.
"He does things every day in training that make you smile - you think how on earth has he done that?"
Tomlin becomes the Robins' third signing of the summer so far, joining former Norwich City midfielder Gary O'Neil and former Preston midfielder Josh Brownhill.
