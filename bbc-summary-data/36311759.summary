The North West's organised anti-crime unit, Titan, believes the haul may be the largest in its history.
A total of 160kg (352lb) of drugs were discovered on Monday at a house in Stradbroke Road, Wavertree, a van parked nearby and a city-centre flat.
Two men, aged 31 and 32, have been charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine.
Stephen James Hussey, of Gentwood Road, Huyton and Stephen Brown, of Abbey Close, Kirkby, will appear at Liverpool and Knowsley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
The drugs are thought to be cocaine, heroin and cannabis.
Police said a number of vehicles were removed from outside the house in Wavertree, including a van.
