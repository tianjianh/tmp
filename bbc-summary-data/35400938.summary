Scientists have released a series of images revealing the colourful range of wildlife found in sea caves at some of Scotland's most remote islands.

Scottish Natural Heritage and Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University examined the sites in St Kilda and North Rona last year.
They said the entrances to the caves were teeming with life.
The creatures included scorpion fish, jewel anemones and lion's mane jellyfish.
North Rona is an uninhabited island that lies off Scotland's north west coast, while St Kilda is an archipelago off the Western Isles.
St Kilda was inhabited for thousands of years until 1930 when the last 36 islanders left.
Today, scientists, conservationists and workers at a military radar station spend months at a time on the main island of Hirta.
