The home fans booed their side at half time as they trailed 30-0, with Lama Tasi the first of six different try scorers to go over in the first half.
Corey Thompson grabbed a Widnes try before Michael Dobson and Robert Lui added to the visitors' lead.
Australian half-back Carney then came off the bench to help set Gareth O'Brien up for Salford's ninth try.
Carney, an unused replacement in Salford's win against Castleford, made his eagerly anticipated debut after his career in the north west of England was delayed while his visa application was being processed.
Salford's fourth win from seven games this season leaves them fifth in the table, while Widnes' fifth Super League defeat this term leaves them second from bottom with the second worst defensive record in the competition.
The hosts showed their greatest resistance in the opening 14 minutes, but once Tasi went over for the opening try a torrent followed with Greg Johnson, George Griffin, Ben Murdoch-Masila, Kris Welham and Justin Carney crossing before the break.
Thompson and a late Rhys Hanbury try after the break were of little consequence in a match Salford dominated.
Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester: "It was a great start, something we spoke about. We felt we let ourselves down a bit with LWLW record and we wanted to change the mindset of that about backing games up. To get a 30-0 lead at half-time was tremendous.
"People talk about us saying we can't back up, so it's important for us to show them we can back up.
"Todd's got class, we see it in training, it's all about getting him in at the right time. When he first came on he chased the ball about. Later on his dropped into our shapes. He has some nice little touches to him."
