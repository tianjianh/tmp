[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

The leave campaign won by a hair's breadth in the city, where 50.4% voted Leave and 49.6% Remain.
Cannock Chase, Telford & Wrekin and North Warwickshire were among areas where more than 60% voted to leave - a clear message voters wanted out.
Eurosceptic Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stone, said the result represented the common sense of the British people.
"They didn't buy the armageddon arguments and above all else they want to govern themselves," he said.

EU referendum result: What happens now?
The West Midlands voted decisively to Leave the European Union in yesterday's referendum.
North Warwickshire was the first of the region's areas to declare with a decisive 67% to 33% in favour of Leave.
It proved to be the start of a series of convincing victories across the patch as result after result here backed the Brexit option.
There was some brief respite with Remain coming out on top in Cotswold and Warwick but they were scant reward what was a night of misery for pro-EU supporters.
When Coventry and then Birmingham - by a whisker - backed Leave it became clear that there could only be one winner.
The West Midlands delivered a devastating verdict giving a victory for the Leave campaign on an historic night for British and European politics.
In Cannock Chase there was a huge lean towards leaving the EU from the 71% turnout.
The leave campaign won with 69% after gaining 36,894 votes against 16,684 for remain.
The first West Midlands count to finish, in North Warwickshire, was a taste of things to come as one by one regions followed suit.
A total of 25,385 people voted to leave and 12,569 to remain after a 75% turnout.
A total of 40,817 people voted leave and 38,341 remain of an 81% turnout.
In Telford & Wrekin, the leave campaign was also well out in the lead with 63% after a total of 56,649 of votes.
Remain got 37%, with a total of 32,954 votes, and the turnout was 72%.
