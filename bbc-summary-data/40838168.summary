French authorities are investigating the mysterious death of two friends whose bodies were found in a back garden bearing no sign of violence.

Lucien PÃ©rot, 69, and Olivier Boudin, 38, appear to have died as they were having a meal together.
Their bodies were found on Thursday in the garden of Perot's house in Authon-du-Perche, about 150km (90 miles) south-west of Paris.
One was sitting on a chair and the other lying down, prosecutors say.
"Their bodies showed no apparent sign of attack. They seem to have died simultaneously," the prosecutors told L'Ã‰cho RÃ©publicain newspaper (in French).
They were found by a neighbour, who told the newspaper that she had seen the two friends eating in the garden the night before.
Prosecutors added that they were considering a number of hypotheses, including a dual suicide, poisoning, or the possibility of the sudden death of one causing a fatal shock in the other.
