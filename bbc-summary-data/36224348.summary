Scottish Greens push Lib Dems into fifth place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Greens pushed the Lib Dems into fifth place after their most successful election since 2003.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Greens picked up six seats in the new Scottish Parliament, with the Lib Dems one behind on five.
Overall, the SNP won 63 seats - two short of a majority. The Conservatives have 27 and Labour 22.
Victorious Green Ross Greer has become the youngest ever MSP at the age of 21. He said the result showed "the level of faith Scotland has in young people".
Green party co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was clear his party had "gained huge momentum", particularly in Glasgow.
Mr Harvie was elected in the city, while the party now has another five MSPs from the regional lists.
He said he was "gutted" at missing out on a second seat in Glasgow.
But he added: "I'm even more gutted that there are going to be more Conservatives in the next session of the Scottish Parliament.
"I think that's a sign of the chronic failure of Labour to offer a credible, progressive left alternative.
"I think the Greens are going to step up and play a significant part in providing that alternative."
Youngest MSP Ross Greer was 15 when he joined the party and has also served as a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament.
He said: "We did promote during my campaign that I would be the youngest MSP and we were very open about my age.
"So it's a vote of confidence from the same region that elected Mhairi Black last year."
Ms Black was just 20 when she became the SNP MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South at last May's general election.
