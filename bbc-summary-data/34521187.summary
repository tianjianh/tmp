He told BBC London she was "much more strong-willed" than he was and so ended up staying for 15 years rather than three months outside his Camden home.
The woman is the subject of a new film, The Lady in the Van, starring Dame Maggie Smith.
It is an adaptation of the writer's play of the same name, based on his memoir.
Mr Bennett and director Nicholas Hytner speak to BBC London's entertainment correspondent Brenda Emmanus at the film's premiere in Leicester Square.
