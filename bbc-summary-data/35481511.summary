Jacqueline Melinda Friend, 59, from Castleford, and Lynda Leonard, 52, from Bradford, had been passengers in a black cab heading towards Bawtry.
Ms Friend has been described as "the most fabulous wife, mum, nana, sister, aunty and friend".
Ms Leonard's family said she would be "sadly missed by her daughter Abbygail and partner Colin".
The crash happened at about 00:25 GMT on Sunday near the Mount Pleasant hotel on the A638 Great North Road at Rossington near Doncaster.
A Fiat Scudo taxi, travelling in the opposite direction towards Doncaster, collided with the black LTI London taxi the two women had been in, which was heading towards Bawtry.
Both women died following the collision.
Ms Friend's family said she had been "tragically taken from all her loved ones by the incident on Saturday night in Doncaster".
"Our world has been shattered, and will never be the same again.
"Jackie was the foundation of our whole family, and will be missed unbearably by all who knew and loved her.
"We will love her forever."
Ten other people were treated in hospital for minor injuries.
The black LTI London taxi also carried two 58-year-old men and a 61-year-old driver.
The Fiat Scudo taxi carried six passengers - three men aged 22, 25 and 29, three women, aged 21, 25 and 26, and a 40-year-old driver.
All 10 were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries, South Yorkshire Police said.
