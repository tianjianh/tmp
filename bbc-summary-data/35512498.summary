The number of Syrians trying to cross into Turkey amid an upsurge of fighting in northern Syria has nearly doubled, a Turkish official says.

The governor of the Turkish border province of Kilis said 35,000 refugees had reached the border area - up from an estimated 20,000 on Friday.
Turkey says it is prepared to help the refugees but the frontier remains shut.
They are fleeing a Syrian government offensive on rebel-held positions near the northern city of Aleppo.
In the past few days, the Syrian army - backed by Russian air strikes - has made a series of gains around Syria's largest city.
In other developments:
On Saturday, Kilis Governor Suleyman Tapsiz said Turkey was able to help refugees inside Syria.
"Our doors are not closed, but at the moment there is no need to host such people inside our borders," he said.
Turkey has been providing food, shelter and blankets to thousands of civilians who are stranded on the Syrian side of the border.
The Turks have so far refused to open the border crossing.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn on Saturday urged Turkey to do so.
"The Geneva convention is still valid which states that you have to take in refugees," Mr Hahn said, as EU foreign ministers discussed the crisis in Amsterdam.
The call was echoed by Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.
"I look at these images of people standing at the Turkish border and I just wanted to underline the message people who are in humanitarian need should be allowed in," he said.
The thousands fleeing Aleppo have spent their first night in temporary shelter at the Turkish border but the crossing remains closed.
Turkey has welcomed more than two million Syrians since the start of the war and it is unclear whether it will accept another huge wave in one go.
Human rights groups are calling for the gates to open but at a time when the EU is trying to reduce the flow of refugees to Europe, there will be diplomatic pressure on Turkey to act with caution.
The Turkish government is using the new refugee exodus to take aim at Russia, whose air strikes on Aleppo have prompted thousands to flee. But there is no sign that Russia is pulling back and as opposition fighters retreat, the Assad regime is strengthened and thousands more civilians will flee, hoping for sanctuary in Turkey.
In November, the EU clinched a deal with Turkey, offering it â‚¬3bn (Â£2.3bn; $3.3bn) to care for Syrian refugees on Turkish soil.
On Thursday, 60 donor countries meeting in London pledged billions of dollars to ease the plight of Syrian refugees.
About 4.6 million people have fled Syria during the civil war that began in 2011. Another 13.5 million are said to be in need of humanitarian assistance inside the country.
Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees - 2.5 million.
