[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-3 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Wheeler bagged a late brace as Exeter beat fellow strugglers Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wheeler struck in the 81st and 85th minutes to move his side away from the League Two relegation zone and leave the Robins deep in trouble.
Cheltenham were the better side in the first half, with Amari Morgan-Smith hitting the post with a shot and Harry Pell seeing his effort crash against the bar.
But Exeter kept them out and took the lead 10 minutes after the break when Lee Holmes curled a shot into the top-left corner.
Cheltenham responded well and levelled through Billy Waters' ninth goal of the season in the 70th minute following a long ball forward from Aaron Downes.
But Wheeler stabbed in from close range after Troy Brown's pull back at the far post to make it 2-1 to Exeter.
And Wheeler was in the right place to follow in after Russell Griffiths parried substitute Liam McAlinden's low shot with five minutes remaining to put the result beyond all doubt.
