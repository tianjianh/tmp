[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Osborne's Budget amounts to an assault on young people, the Welsh government's finance minister has said.

Jane Hutt attacked plans to scrap housing benefit for under 21 year olds, saying the young would be "hit hard".
Mr Osborne also announced a compulsory living wage of Â£7.20 an hour from next April, rising to Â£9 by 2020.
Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns said "difficult decisions" were taken "in the interests of the country" and people would see the benefit.
The chancellor stressed his commitment to a funding floor for the Welsh government's annual grant from the Treasury, more powers for Wales and road and rail improvements.
But Ms Hutt told BBC Wales some of his other measures would make young people suffer.
"Particularly worrying and bad is the assault on young people," she said.
"The fact that young people - 18 to 21-year-olds - who of course want to 'earn or learn' as he says, are going to have their housing benefit taken away from them or not be eligible for it automatically.
"I think young people are going to be hit hard by this Budget."
Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales the UK government was "determined to ensure those who work hard, those who play by the system, start to benefit now because it's been so tough over some recent years".
"We took some difficult decisions over the last five years - they weren't all popular," he said.
"But at the election I think people recognised that they were in the interests of the country.
"Further difficult decisions were taken yesterday, but people will start to see the benefit."
