Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson admits he was taken out of his comfort zone during a loan spell with Essex earlier in the season.

Dawson played twice for Essex in the T20 Blast group stage, but hopes to lead Hampshire to victories in both the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast Finals.
The 25-year-old was recalled early by his parent county to the first team.
"It was a fresh challenge for me. I enjoyed it and I'm glad I did it," he told BBC South Today.
"Getting out of your comfort zone a little bit helps. You realise what you've got and what a good place it is to play cricket here (at The Ageas Bowl)."
Hampshire travel to Gloucestershire in the One-Day Cup quarter-final on Wednesday before their sixth successive T20 Finals Day on Saturday.
They face Lancashire Lightning in a repeat of last year's semi-final.
Dawson hopes his side can overcome their recent poor record in the competition at Edgbaston, where they have lost the last two semi-finals, and lift the trophy for the first time since 2012.
"Six years in a row is an unbelievable effort from the lads," he added.
"We've fallen short a couple of times and been beaten in the semi-finals. That's something we want to put right this year, play in that final and go all the way as it's such a great day."
