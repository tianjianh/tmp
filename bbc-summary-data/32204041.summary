A reward has been offered for information to find a "dangerous" convicted murderer who breached his prison release licence.

William Kerr, 53, absconded from a probation hostel in Hull following his release on 23 January.
He was handed a life sentence in 1998 for killing Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a Leeds bedroom cupboard.
The charity Crimestoppers has offered up to Â£5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
Police have warned people not to approach Kerr, who they have described as "dangerous".
A spokesperson for Crimestoppers said it was "urgent that he is returned to prison".
"We understand that it might be someone that knows him personally who is aware of where he is, and for that reason, I would urge you to contact Crimestoppers, completely anonymously, safe in the knowledge nobody will ever know you spoke to us.
"Do the right thing and tell us where Kerr is," the spokesperson added.
North Yorkshire Police, who are leading the hunt for Kerr, believe he is now in the London area but said he also had links to Humber and West Yorkshire.
Ms Comfort, 43, was strangled at her flat in Cromwell Heights, Burmantofts, where she had lived alone, in 1996.
Her body was found in a cupboard in her bedroom by her family after they became concerned they had not heard from her.
Two years later Kerr was found guilty of her murder at Leeds Crown Court.
Senga Bailey, who found her aunt's body, said she was "frightened of what he's going to do next".
