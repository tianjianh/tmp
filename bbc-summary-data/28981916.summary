A Canadian Lancaster, currently on a UK tour, performed an engine shutdown during a flight in County Durham.
Its owners said it landed safely at Durham Tees Valley airport following the "precautionary" shutdown.
It had been due to fly to Bournemouth to take part in weekend displays with an RAF Lancaster bomber.
An airport spokesman said the plane had experienced an "issue" with one of its engines as it was approaching the runway at the end of a 30-minute demonstration flight for invited guests.
"The aircraft landed safely and nobody was injured and it taxied to stand.
"The Lancaster has been returned to the hangar and engineers are conducting tests to determine the cause of the fault," he added.
The last remaining flying Lancasters - owned by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - were due to fly at the Bournemouth Air Festival as well as the Shoreham Air Show and the Gedling Show in Nottinghamshire, as part of a two-month UK tour by the Canadian aircraft.
The aircraft are based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire for the duration of the visit.
There were over 7,000 of the type of aircraft produced between 1941 and 1946.
A statement from Bournemouth Air Festival said: "We share the disappointment of all the Canadian Lancaster fans but we understand that she is over 70 years old and these sort of things can and do happen.
"We hope she's airworthy again soon."
An airworthy Merlin engine is being shipped from the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre near Skegness and this will be fitted over the weekend.
