Thousands of people have marched in Edinburgh to demand that the Scottish and UK governments act to prevent climate change.

The march, organised by Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, was part of a global campaign ahead of the United Nations' meeting in Paris.
The campaign is urging politicians to agree plans to cut carbon emissions.
It is also asking for support for developing countries who are "suffering most from catastrophic climate change".
Marchers gathered at The Meadows before heading to the Ross Bandstand in Princes Street Gardens for a rally.
Marchers, who gathered in the rain, were asked to wear bright colours and unite around the slogan Climate, Justice and Jobs.
Organisers said about 5,000 people were at the event, which was also attended by Environment Minister Aileen McLeod.
Dr McLeod said Scotland "wants and expects an ambitious and fair climate treaty to be agreed" at the conference.
She said the Scottish government had "high ambition" for climate change - "with a world-leading target of 42% cut in emissions by 2020 compared to 1990."
Tom Ballantine, chairman of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, a coalition of 60 organisations, said: "We're proud that so many people in Scotland are coming together to show they care about the fate of others across the world and that they want to protect the planet that we all rely on.
"Scotland and the UK as a whole benefited massively from the era of fossil fuels - now we need to take our fair share of responsibility for the world's growing climate crisis."
At next week's United Nations talks in Paris, international leaders will attempt to agree a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Patrick Harvie MSP, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said Scotland could lead the way in the transition from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy.
He said: "The negotiations in Paris must strike a bold deal to protect our society.
"The trend of rising global temperatures is clear and the impact will be felt by the poorest people in the world. The pollution that has caused this is the responsibility of developed nations such as ours.
"The scientific consensus is clear - we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground if we're to limit the damage that climate change will cause."
Scottish Labour's environmental justice spokeswoman, Sarah Boyack, said her party in government at Holyrood would deliver regulatory change to make warm homes that tackle climate change "a 21st Century reality".
She said: "These are worrying and challenging times for renewables, so the SNP government needs to redouble its efforts to get on with tackling climate change.
"Without the political will to support low- carbon heat and power, we won't tackle fuel poverty and Scottish companies will miss out on becoming leaders in making this globally important technology commercially viable."
