UCU, NUS Wales and Unison Wales said those elected following May's election needed to invest or risk denying opportunities for people in disadvantaged areas.
The unions will meet on Monday at University of South Wales in Cardiff to launch the Don't Cut Me Out campaign.
They added most adults returning to study did so without employer support.
Ebbi Ferguson from NUS Wales said: "Our colleges and universities offer a vital second chance to adults who want to develop their skills and to those from disadvantaged communities.
"Cutting funding for post-16 full-time and part-time education denies these people, the majority of whom are women, another opportunity and means there is a huge untapped resource of potential Wales is missing out on."
