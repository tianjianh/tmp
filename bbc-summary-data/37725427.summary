[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County boss Graham Westley has vowed to make Rodney Parade "a place that people fear coming" to.

The Exiles have not won in six home matches this season, are bottom of League Two and host leaders Plymouth Argyle on Saturday.
"It's up to us to step up to the plate," said Westley, who managed Peterborough in League One last season.
"The home record over the last couple of years hasn't been good and we need to start putting that straight."
Saturday's opponents Plymouth are three points clear at the top of the table having won nine of their 13 league games this season.
"Our home needs to be a place that people fear coming to and it will be," Westley, who succeeded the sacked Warren Feeney on 7 October, told BBC Wales Sport.
"With respect to any team in League Two, they're a League Two team. Last year I faced some big clubs in League One and there were some really tough challenges.
"We're in League Two facing League Two opponents and of course we must not underestimate them - but we must not overestimate them.
"We've got a lot of experience and good quality players here and I'm sure we're capable of playing like a top of the league team."
Newport conceded in the 80th minute as they lost 1-0 to Yeovil in Westley's first game in charge of the club, but the 48-year-old is confident letting in late goals will not become a habit.
"My sides are notorious for being strong late on and scoring lots of late winners," he added.
"They're certainly not notorious for conceding late goals, so it won't be an issue."
