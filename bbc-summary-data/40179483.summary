Zhi Min Soh, 23, was struck on Edinburgh's Princes Street, at its junction with Lothian Road, at 08:30 on Wednesday 31 May.
Pedal on Parliament have asked for "a short, respectful protest" at the scene exactly a week on from the accident.
Cyclists have previously branded the tracks "an accident waiting to happen".
Ms Soh, from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, was a medical student at Edinburgh University.
She was described as "talented and thoughtful". The university said it had lost "a bright star of the future".
A Pedal on Parliament statement said: "We and every other cyclist we have spoken to personally and online are angry as well as saddened at this death.
"Edinburgh's tram tracks have been described as an accident waiting to happen from the moment they were unveiled.
"As a result, hundreds of cyclists have been injured from falls on the tracks, and thousands more have had close shaves, putting many off cycling those roads at all.
"This is a sorry record for a city that aspires to be the most cycle-friendly in Scotland. We should not have had to wait for a young woman to die for there to be ministerial action, and a review."
It comes after lawyers claimed warnings about the safety risks which tram tracks in Edinburgh pose to cyclists have been ignored.
City of Edinburgh Council said it has made "every effort" to raise awareness about the tracks.
