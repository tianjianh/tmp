[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh autism law bid to be considered by assembly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Assembly Members will be asked to back efforts to introduce a new autism law for Wales on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tory AM Paul Davies said the law is needed as children and adults had not received the help that they should.
The law would require a strategy to be introduced ensuring councils and health boards take the action needed to support people with the condition.
Ministers have said Â£13m is being spent on a National Integrated Autism Service over the next four years.
The Welsh Government maintains that there are already "legislative and policy levers to support people with autism in Wales" but says the situation will be kept under review.
But Mr Davies told BBC Wales that services "have been patchy in the past".
"We need legislation to ensure these services are put on a statutory footing," said the Preseli Pembrokeshire AM.
"What this bill will also do is ensure there are clear pathways to diagnosis [and] that staff dealing with people with autism get the right training as well."
Mr Davies won a ballot in March to present a bill in the assembly.
If a majority of AMs support his plans, he will have 13 months to draft a formal bill which could then become law.
The Conservative AM said he was "hopeful" his proposals would progress to the next stage.
In October, a Conservative motion calling on Welsh ministers to introduce an Autism Bill was defeated in the assembly.
