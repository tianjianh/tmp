Strauss-Kahn: Press sees 'fiasco' for justice system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
France's press believes the acquittal of former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of procuring prostitutes for sex parties is a stinging defeat for investigators, while still leaving the onetime presidential hopeful's image irreparably damaged.

Some believe that while Mr Strauss-Kahn's conduct may have been distasteful, the investigation's case was simply "poorly put together", as Bruno Becard puts it in La Nouvelle Republique du Centre Ouest.
Le Figaro's judicial affairs analyst Stephane Durand-Soufflant compares the ruling to taking a "chainsaw" to the prosecution's case.
"The criminal court in Lille so brutally pruned the tree of the case that the three botanists of the judicial investigation had cultivated in a greenhouse that nothing but a puny branch remained," he writes.
"In this story of orgies and cattle for slaughter" - as the prostitutes were reportedly referred to at the orgies in question - "the court decided it had to rule on the law, and not make a moral judgment," writes Pierre Frehel in Le Republicain Lorrain.
In L'Est Republicain, Philippe Marcacci says that only a week after one of the suspects in an unrelated 10-year paedophilia case was acquitted, this is "another fiasco" for the judicial system.
But in Belgium - scene of some of the sex parties Mr Strauss-Kahn attended - Thierry Dupiereux argues in L'Avenir that the fact that one of his co-defendants was convicted of pimping shows that the case overall was not "totally void", adding: "One cannot talk of a 'judicial fiasco'."
In the German magazine Der Spiegel, Stephan Simons argues that the acquittal still leaves Mr Strauss-Kahn - often referred to as "DSK" - morally "guilty".
"According to the ruling, DSK is not a pimp, but just a 'libertine' and a testosterone-damaged macho - not a criminal offence, but morally bankrupt. In the court of public opinion, he is still a convicted man."
Most commentators agree that Mr Strauss-Kahn is unlikely to relaunch his political career.
"His personal image is in ruins: He appeared as an immoral, misogynistic, supercilious, aloof and dishonest man," historian Christian Delporte writes in France's Le Figaro.
For Patrice Chabanet, in Le Journal de la Haute-Marne, Mr Strauss-Kahn - "already tarnished" by accusations - later thrown out - that he raped a hotel chambermaid in New York - has "now been finished off".
"Dominique Strauss-Kahn has his political future behind him", writes Raymond Couraud in L'Alsace. "Nobody knows if he regrets that, but he only has himself to blame."
But L'Express offers a chink of light for Mr Strauss-Kahn, pointing out that an opinion poll in April suggested that DSK - amid widespread disillusionment with politics - was the only French politician to see his rating rise.
