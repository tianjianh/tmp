Hibernian: McGinn wants success to silence club's critics

John McGinn wants to make Hibernian's critics eat their words by ending the season on a high.

A run of two wins in nine matches has left Hibs behind Falkirk in the race for second spot in the Championship.
But with promotion still up for grabs and a Scottish Cup final to look forward to, McGinn believes this could prove to be a special season for Hibs.
"It will give us a great feeling at the end of the season if we can ram the words down people's throats," he said.
The phrase "Hibsing it" - meaning to throw away a favourable position - has been prevalent on social media among rival fans this season, and McGinn admits it riles him.

"Our character can't be doubted over the course of the season," said the midfielder, who made his Scotland debut against Denmark last month.
"We ignore it to an extent but then it gives us something to inspire us and be successful."
McGinn and team-mate Jason Cummings are among the nominees for the Championship Player of the Year award.
Cummings says the feeling the Hibs players experienced after losing the League Cup final to Ross County is spurring them on to make sure they do not finish the season empty-handed.
"The boys after getting beat in the League Cup final don't want to feel like that again," said Cummings, who has scored 24 goals in all competitions for Hibs this season.
"So, I think we're going into the Scottish Cup final [against Rangers] just to give everything.
"We're still in good stead for promotion. I think we're still favourites. Everyone's still confident."
