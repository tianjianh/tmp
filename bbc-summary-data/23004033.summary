Air pollution there hit a new record high on Friday for the third day in a row - soaring way past hazardous levels.
The haze has been caused by illegal forest fires on the nearby island of Sumatra, part of Indonesia, started by farmers to clear land.
Singapore's prime minister has warned the smog could last for weeks.
