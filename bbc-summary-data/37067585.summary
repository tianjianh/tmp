[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 2-2 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge United slipped to the foot of the early League Two table after a draw with Carlisle, which leaves them without a league win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's were in front after only seven minutes when Leon Legge headed home from Piero Mingoia's corner, before Carlisle struck back after 23 minutes through Jason Kennedy's header from Macaulay Gillesphey's free-kick.
Cambridge were ahead at half-time against the run of play through Luke Berry, who was fouled in the box by Danny Grainger and stepped up himself to send Mark Gillespie the wrong way from the penalty spot.
Berry had earlier fired wastefully over after good work by Joe Pigott.
Keith Curle's visitors drew level for a second time 14 minutes into the second half, Charlie Wyke turning home Nicky Adams' cross from the left having only come on as a substitute four minutes previously.
It was Carlisle who threatened to go on and win the game, with Josh Coulson's fine block denying Mike Jones and goalkeeper Will Norris parrying Jamie Devitt's effort before Jabo Ibehre headed over the rebound.
