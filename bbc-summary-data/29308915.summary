Attractions also saw an increase with 43% saying they had more visitors than last year.
As the results were announced, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism Ken Skates visited the National Trust's Erddig in north Wales.
And the Minister for the Economy, Transport and Science, Edwina Hart visited Llwyn Helyg Guest House in Carmarthenshire, who have also had a busy summer
Welcoming the figures, Mr Skates said: "It seems that 2014 is proving to be an excellent year for Welsh tourism, even compared to 2013 which was a successful year in itself.
"Although the weather has been kind this year, the weather was also good for the UK as a whole but Wales is managing to outperform the rest of GB in terms of attracting staying visitors and day visitors.
"Visit Wales' marketing working is achieving its response targets and I look forward to working with the Tourism Advisory Board to realise our target of 10% growth for the industry by 2020.
"These figures show that the tourism sector is going from strength to strength."
