NI festivals: Counting the public costs and cultural returns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Whether it is music, literature, film, science, sailing, children or food, there are now hundreds of festivals in Northern Ireland each year.

In the summer, many take place each week, big and small.
You - the taxpayer - are paying for them, whether you buy a ticket or not, but that money brings important returns.
Very few could take place without some form of public subsidy, often from several sources.
"Most festival directors have to use a broad portfolio of funders," says Carolyn Mathers, director of Snow Water, a festival and events consultancy firm.
"It could be anything from Tourism Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Invest Northern Ireland, the Arts Council or local councils, plus a lot of them rely heavily on sponsorship."
She has worked with several local and UK festivals, and says UK-wide research shows they bring important economic returns.
"For every £1 spent it generates £8 into the economy, it's contributing to the vibrancy of the area. People are supporting hotels, restaurants, bars, they're using taxi services. So it's all providing cultural regeneration."
The Arts Council currently funds nine festival organisations, including the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival which got £126,100 in 2015-16.
It also gave £189,150 to the Belfast International Arts Festival, and £142,590 to Féile an Phobail, a community arts festival in west Belfast, although there may be some cuts to that money.
The Arts Council also provided funding to a number of other arts organisations that hold festivals as part of their work.
Meanwhile, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has allocated £400,000 to a community festivals fund this year, although that is down £50,000 on previous years.
That helps local councils to pay for community festivals in their area.
The EastSide Arts Festival begins in east Belfast later this month, ending with two concerts by Van Morrison.
It is one of three festivals run by EastSide Arts, and its arts manager Anthony Toner says the £94,000 from the Arts Council, plus a grant from Belfast City Council, is crucial.
"We culminate in the two big shows by Van Morrison on Cyprus Avenue, but for the week and a half prior to that there's 77 events taking place right across the east of the city," he says.
"The festival raises the profile of the area, and gives the community a sense of something happening culturally in their part of the city. It also sets up the idea of this being a part of the city where cultural things happen all year round."
Meanwhile, the Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival has just drawn to a close in County Fermanagh.
Its director Sean Doran says that it pays its way and attracts tourists.
"We're on an operating budget of around £400,000, but we deliver around the £1m mark," he says.
"Also, 70% of our attendance comes from outside Fermanagh, 40% comes from the Republic of Ireland and people are flying in from Japan and Australia and America."
However, arts and community funding is being squeezed and even long-established festivals like the Belfast Mela have suffered cuts.
The Mela's founder Nisha Tandon says it is more vital than ever.
"Belfast has been the European city of hate, so it is very important that we embrace this to have social inclusion and community cohesion through the arts," she says.
She adds that it is time for the corporate world to step up and provide money.
"I put a plea to businesses to adopt an arts organisation and nurture them all through the year, and see what returns they get. They'll get a lot of enjoyment, but also fulfil their corporate social responsibility," she says.
There is little sign of festival fatigue among audiences.
The Arts Council says that in Belfast alone last year, a total of more than 250,000 people attended the Belfast Festival, West Belfast Festival and Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival.
But whether there will be enough private and public investment in future to maintain all our festivals remains to be seen.
