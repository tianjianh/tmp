[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Spender teed up Scott Quigley to give the Welsh hosts the lead but Stefano Fraternali levelled for the reigning San Marinese champions.
Quigley turned provider for the second, playing in Jamie Mullan to restore the hosts' lead.
Aeron Edwards nearly made it 3-1 but Mattia Migani made an important save.
The New Saints boss Craig Harrison told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"A win's a win and we're certainly pleased with another Champions League win at home but I think it's a bit more of a tale of opportunities missed.
"We've had some good chances and on another day we should probably be scoring probably five, there.
"The goal against us was terrible four or five minutes after we had scored. We're not the biggest team in the world and not the best at set plays, but apart from that we did really well."
Match ends, The New Saints 2, Tre Penne 1.
