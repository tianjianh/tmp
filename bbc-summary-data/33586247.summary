People from 11 towns, villages and suburbs all called Whitchurch, have gathered in Whitchurch, Hampshire, for the Worldwide Whitchurch Weekend.

The inaugural three-day event, involving communities from England and Wales, featured competitive sports - all Whitchurch versus Whitchurch.
Organisers also received a message of support from the mayor of Whitchurch-Stoufville, in Canada.
The next event is already being planned in Shropshire for 2017.
The places represented were in Shropshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Buckinghamshire, Somerset, Herefordshire, Dorset, Cardiff, Cardigan and St David's.
Competitors took part in archery, bowls, tug-of-war and a bake-off. Non-competitive activities included a vintage car parade and live music.
Organising committee member Paul Driver said: "We were just looking for something unique and the amount of times we got contacted by other Whitchurches looking for the wrong venue, we just thought, that's got to be something different, let's get them all together.
"'Come on Whitchurch' is all you can hear, which is great. Everybody is being cheered on.
"We had a great response to this. We said it's something we envisage taking place every two years and this week, luckily, Shropshire have said they want to be the hosts next time so we are all looking forward already for two years time."
