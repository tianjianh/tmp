The scrum-half, 27, was found guilty of misconduct by a New Zealand Rugby employment panel over the incident at Christchurch Airport last month.
He was banned for the Rugby Championship win over South Africa.
"He presented himself as genuine, honest and incredibly remorseful," said NZ Rugby general manager Neil Sorensen.
"We accepted that he is genuine about wanting to improve himself and note that he himself has acknowledged he will need the support of his family, friends and rugby to move forward.
"We also noted that Aaron had already made a very public apology to his partner, friends and family, team-mates, his employer, and rugby fans and he had already served a one-week stand-down."

Smith was dropped to the bench for a Test against South Africa in 2012 after breaking a team curfew.
In 2014, he sent a naked picture of himself on Snapchat which was captured by other users and widely circulated.
Smith has played 54 Tests since his making his New Zealand debut in 2012.
