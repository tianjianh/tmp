Aberdeen: Jonny Hayes hoping Niall McGinn will stay at Pittodrie

Jonny Hayes reckons team-mate Niall McGinn could still decide to stay at Aberdeen beyond this season.

Dons manager Derek McInnes revealed it is looking increasing likely that the Northern Irishman will move to the English Championship this summer.
McGinn, 29, is out of contract in a few months and has not signed the new deal offered to him by Aberdeen.
But Hayes said: "I'd like to consider myself Niall's closest pal in there and he's not even told me what he's doing."
McGinn has scored 13 goals this season and has been a key player for the Pittodrie outfit since joining them in 2012.
"Obviously I want him to stay and, as a team, we want him to stay," Hayes added.
"He keeps his cards close to his chest and, if I don't know, I don't think anyone else will know.
"We enjoy having Niall here and, if he's here next season, it will be a bonus."
The Dons entertain Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Tuesday night, with McInnes' men full of confidence following their 7-0 win at Dundee on Friday night.
Left-back Andrew Considine scored a hat-trick in that win and Hayes reckons the 29-year-old is hugely underrated.
When asked if Considine gets the recognition he deserves, Hayes said: "No. Nowhere near it.
"I've said from day one about how good Andy was and I've never thought he gets the recognition he deserves.
"There always seems to be a bit more hype around a quick, marauding left-back rather than Andy - in my opinion our steadiest and most consistent player over the last couple of years.
"I think people are starting to come round and realise that now.
"I'm sure he'll be up there about the player of the season awards and it will be fully deserved."
Making reference to the absence of any Dons players from recent Scotland squads, Hayes joked about Considine's chances of being selected for the national side that "he can't, he plays for Aberdeen".
The Irishman then spoke of the depth of quality Scotland currently have at left-back with Kieran Tierney, Andrew Robertson and Lee Wallace among those battling to make the berth their own.
"If Andy's playing left-back for us, I'm sure Mr Strachan will be looking at him at left back," Hayes added.
"Other countries will be envious of the choices Scotland have at left back. It's unfortunate that Andy has quite a few players ahead of him at this point."
There is an added edge to Tuesday's match at Pittodrie following the news that Caley Thistle midfielder Greg Tansey has signed a pre-contract agreement to join Aberdeen in the summer.
McInnes said the signing is part of the club's plan to maintain quality, even if they lose some of their out-of-contract players in the coming months.
"Greg's a player I have long admired and I think it's only fair that I don't talk too much about that until he is my player," McInnes said.
"But we're well aware of his qualities and his team-mates' qualities."
