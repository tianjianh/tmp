[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brentford 2-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Redfearn's first game in charge of Rotherham United ended in defeat as Alan Judge's brace earned Lee Carsley his first win as Brentford boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judge gave Brentford the lead with 67 seconds gone when he volleyed the ball past Lee Camp from long range.
Rotherham restored parity soon into the second half when Joe Mattock chested the ball before shooting from distance.
But the Bees took the lead again when Judge latched on to Jake Bidwell's cross and powered home a header.
Redfearn, who was appointed Rotherham manager last week, suffered a poor start as Judge found the net with barely a minute gone.
On the half-hour mark, the Bees could have doubled their advantage when Marco Djuricin fired Alan McCormack's cross wide.
The Millers fought back and broke away on the counter but some good defending from Harlee Dean stopped Matt Derbyshire from equalising.
John Swift had the best chance to double Brentford's lead when he ran clear of the Rotherham back line and cut back to Djuricin, but Camp saved his close-range effort.
Rotherham enjoyed a better start to the second half as Mattock superbly controlled the ball before levelling the scores within a minute of the restart.
Despite the best efforts of Camp, Judge notched his second of the afternoon, nodding the ball home to give Carsley his first win as Brentford head coach.

"The result was the main thing for us today. We started well and won the ball straight back from the kick off, but we started the second half poorly so we'll talk about that.
"We had a great reaction to the equaliser and to be honest over the 90 minutes. It would be easy to start to have doubts at 1-1 but we knuckled down, got on with it and got our reward for a lot of hard work this week.
"I'm delighted to have picked up my first win as coach but you don't have long to think about it because I was already thinking about the Wolves game as we walked off the pitch."
Rotherham United manager Neil Redfearn:
"We looked fragile and unsure but I felt we did enough to get something from the game. We showed a lot of spirit but I was disappointed with the goals.
"I was pleased with the performance but we have to do more about the goals against and make ourselves harder to beat.
"We also need to be more clinical in front of goal but these are things that have been happening all season and I am still in the process of looking at the players. If some need help we may have to help them."
