The Spireites lost 4-0 at home to Oxford on Saturday to leave them six points adrift of safety in League One.
Caldwell said at the time: "When there is criticism and negativity from the sides it doesn't help. If you want to show negativity, then don't come."
On Monday, he told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I say what I feel. It's very emotional when you've just lost 4-0."
The 34-year-old added: "The message I was trying to give them was that this team needs them to be positive and get behind the team.
"I accept that some people may have taken it the wrong way, but we need our supporters more now than ever."
Caldwell was appointed manager at the Proact Stadium in January following the sacking of Danny Wilson, but has failed to win any of his seven games in charge.
On Saturday, he suggested that some of the players were not showing the mentality needed to lift the team up the table.
"There's no consistency within the group and that has to change," the former Wigan boss said.
"Forget the game and tactics, it's about desire. The players have to show a desire and a focus for this club to keep them in this division. They have to take responsibility.
"I knew this was a challenge when I came in but the overall resilience and desire in the group has disappointed me."
Chesterfield are in League One action again on Tuesday, when they visit Walsall.
