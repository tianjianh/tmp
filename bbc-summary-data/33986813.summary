Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham says he may ditch "Mr Nice Guy" as he still waits for his first win in management.

Boro have lost three of their four games this season - the most recent against Leyton Orient on Tuesday.
"We need to get accustomed to what it takes to win football matches - get ruthless with each other," he told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"Perhaps no more 'Mr Nice Guy' and enjoying the surroundings; maybe some home truths and sorting things out."
Saturday's 2-2 draw at Newport was the only point Sheringham has seen his side take in their first three League Two games.
And the former England, Tottenham and Manchester United striker, who moved into management after one season as a coach at West Ham, said his side need to be more "professional" in their approach to matches.
"It's not about doing stuff for 45 or 50 minutes. It's a 90-minute game. You've got to be clued in," the 49-year-old added.
"It's tough to win football matches. You've got to be very professional, resilient and switched on for 90 minutes.
"We can't do it for 55 and think we'll get away with it. It's not good enough."
