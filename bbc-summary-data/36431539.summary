McIlroy, set to represent Ireland in Rio as golf returns to the Olympics, said last week he could turn down a Games spot because of the virus.
However, McIlroy, 27, said on Wednesday he was now "ready to play".
"I feel like the advice I've sought out over the past 10 days has put my mind at ease," the world number three said.
"It makes me more comfortable going down there knowing that, even if I do contract Zika, it's not the end of the world.
"It takes six months to pass through your system and you're fine."
Former Masters and US PGA champion Vijay Singh and Australia's Marc Leishman have already announced their withdrawal from the Olympics because of worries relating to the mosquito-borne virus, which is linked to brain defects in newborn babies.
McIlroy is engaged to Erica Stoll and has spoken about "a point in the next couple of years" where he and his fiancee may think about starting a family.
