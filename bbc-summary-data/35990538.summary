Markus Rehm: IAAF sets up group to rule on long-jumpers with prostheses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Athletics' world governing body the IAAF has set up a group to rule on whether long-jumpers with prostheses can compete at the Olympics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group must decide whether having a prosthetic leg gives athletes an unfair advantage.
The IAAF Council will deliver its final ruling in June.
The move could pave the way for Paralympic athletes like Germany's Markus Rehm to compete at the Rio Olympics in August.
Rehm's personal best of 8.40m would have won gold at the 2012 Olympics in London ahead of Great Britain's Greg Rutherford, and the 27-year-old has told BBC Sport he wants to compete alongside able-bodied athletes in Rio.
Rehm was dropped from the 2014 European Athletics Championships by his own federation due to concerns about his prosthesis, but in February, he jumped 8.10m to win the Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix against able-bodied athletes.
South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, a double-leg amputee, competed in the 400m and 4x400m at the London Olympics.
