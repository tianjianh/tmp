Jim O'Brien: Shrewsbury Town sign midfielder after Coventry City departure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have signed midfielder Jim O'Brien on a two-year contract following his exit from Coventry City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old Scot had not appeared for the Sky Blues since February, having gone on loan at Scunthorpe.
But he missed the final six weeks of the season before undergoing an operation on his groin.
The former Sky Blues skipper, who joined on a free transfer from Barnsley in 2014, began his career with Celtic before moving to Motherwell.
O'Brien becomes Town manager Micky Mellon's seventh summer signing as the Shropshire club attempt to rebuild following their League One relegation near miss.
