James, 24, is back from a two-year absence through illness and injuries.
She said: "To have a bronze after all I've been through over the last two years, at home, in London, with all the support here, is just incredible.
"I'm hoping I'm back in the team now and have given myself more opportunities."
James won the sprint and keirin titles at the 2013 World Championships in Belarus.
But in May 2014, she had an operation to remove abnormal cells following a cervical screening, which could have developed into cancer if left untreated.
She has also suffered knee and shoulder injuries.
James made her return to the British vest in January, but did not make the podium at the World Track Cup in Hong Kong.
"It's been a really, really tough road and the World Cups were really tough for me this winter.
"All I rode was sprint and I was knocked out first round, which was so frustrating.
"It's just been so good because I've just been working so hard and knuckled down since Hong Kong.
"I've just seen improvements week in, week out and managed to pull it out, so happy days."
James failed to qualify automatically for the keirin final, instead doing so via a repechage.
"I like to do it the hard way, put myself in the rep (repechage) to do a bit of extra racing," James told BBC Sport.
"I haven't actually ridden a keirin since the nationals in September so I've just been doing video analysis and specific keirin training.
"It's really worked and just to get myself in the top six, each step I made was like a complete bonus and once I got through the rep I was just so overwhelmed I couldn't believe it.
"And then getting third in the semis and then into the final - it just doesn't feel real.
"I'm so over the moon to be back."
