[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The iWild devices, which were locked in steel security cases, were taken from Ty Mawr Country Park at the weekend.
James McConnell of NatureSpy, which runs the wildlife project, said staff were "very disappointed".
The cameras were installed in 17 parks and nature reserves across north east Wales in March.
Mr McConnell added: "This project is designed to give local communities the chance to see the wildlife that they share their parks with.
"Unfortunately it just takes one or two thieves to spoil that for everybody."
