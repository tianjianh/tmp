The Australia international, 22, has agreed a three-year deal and is the Hoops' first signing since their relegation from the Premier League.
QPR have also signed fellow midfielder Ben Gladwin, also 22, from Swindon.
Both played a crucial role in helping the Robins reach the recent League One play-off final, where they lost to Preston.
Former Tottenham trainee Luongo, who helped Australia win the Asian Cup earlier this year, made 34 appearances in 2014-15 for Swindon, scoring six goals and making eight assists.
Gladwin, who was playing for non-league Marlow two years ago, scored eight goals in Swindon's final seven games of the campaign.
"I'm confident Luongo will flourish at QPR," said boss Chris Ramsey, who previously worked with the Australian at Spurs.
"As with any young player there are areas of his game that need improving, but knowing him as I do, I know he will embrace the learning curve of playing for us in the Championship.
"Ben's a fine addition for us and someone myself and Les have been monitoring for some time.
"I'm happy we've persuaded him to come here because there was a lot of interest from other clubs, some in the Premier League."
