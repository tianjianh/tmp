The islanders take on the Netherlands this weekend, with further warm-ups against Scotland and Denmark to come.
"We've got a very good team now and we're going to try and win the tournament," Wright told BBC Guernsey.
"We've got a young exciting squad now, and it's time to start turning some of that potential into results."
He continued: "As always we're aiming to get promoted, like I imagine every team is who's going there."
Guernsey will host a Twenty20 match and two one-day games against the Dutch at the King George V Club.
Director of cricket Wright will be without all-rounder Matt Stokes for the triple-header, while teenage bowler Will Fazakerley remains with Leicestershire, where he has a professional deal.
"It's given a few of our emerging players, and some of the lads on the fringe, to actually get in against a team like this," he added.
"If they go well then they can start pushing to get that first-team spot for when we go off to South Africa.
"As a sportsman you always want to try and test yourself against the best people you can, and that's why we're trying to more cricket on the island."
