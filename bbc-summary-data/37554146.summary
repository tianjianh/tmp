The character's faithful dog Gnasher will also appear in the series called Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed.
The 52-part series of 11-minute episodes will see the 10-year-old Dennis given a 21st Century makeover.
The first pictures of the new series to be released show Dennis in his trademark outfit and spiky hair, but without his catapult.
Emma Scott, chief executive of Beano Studios, said the new series "will see us bring Dennis to life and bang up to date in CGI for the next generation of Beano fans".
Previous BBC TV series starring Dennis and Gnasher, the last of which aired in 2013, showed the pair only in cartoon animation form.
Cheryl Taylor, controller of CBBC, said: "Dennis and Gnasher have been unleashing their own particular brand of mischief on CBBC for many years.
"Their ardent fans will be delighted by this wonderful new series from two of the UK's most notorious rascals."
