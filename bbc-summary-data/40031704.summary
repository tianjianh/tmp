A section of one of America's most famous routes - California's Pacific Coast Highway - has been buried beneath a landslide.

More than a million tonnes of rock and dirt tumbled into the ocean on Saturday, in an area called Mud Creek.
The landslide spans about a third of a mile and has heaped up to 40ft (12m) of debris on the road.
No injuries or property damage were reported.
The California Department of Transportation is working to remove the mountain of rubble from the route, which covers the Big Sur, a major tourist attraction famed for its mountainous coastline.
The agency's spokeswoman, Susana Cruz, told the San Luis Obispo Tribune it is the largest known mudslide in the state's history.
"It's one of a kind," she said.
They said they do not know when they will be able to reopen the sealed-off road.
A Monterey County sheriff's office spokesperson said on Facebook: "The slide went from bad to worse over the weekend."
Sections of the highway have been closed after several earlier landslides since January.
