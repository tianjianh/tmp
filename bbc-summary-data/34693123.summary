David Mundell says Scotland Bill changes 'deliver on the vow'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Changes to the Scotland Bill will make it  clear "beyond any reasonable doubt" that the UK government has delivered on the vow of more powers for Holyrood, the Scottish Secretary has said.

David Mundell said it would become one of the most powerful devolved assemblies in the world.
UK government amendments to the bill are due to be laid at Westminster.
The Scottish government said the changes "continue to fall short of delivering the Smith report in full".
A House of Commons debate on the bill, which brings new powers over tax and welfare to the Scottish Parliament, will take place next week.
The bill follows the Smith Commission review of devolution after last year's Scottish independence referendum.
The new powers are due to come in from April 2017. But the SNP government at Holyrood has threatened to block the bill if it believes changes to the way Scotland is funded would see them lose out.
The Scottish Secretary said: "We have listened to points raised as the bill has been debated and taken steps to improve the legislation even in areas where we believed the bill was already delivering Smith.
"For example, there has never been a power for the UK government to block welfare changes from Holyrood but we have taken steps to make it even clearer that there are no UK vetoes in this bill. We are acting in good faith and want to build consensus.
"Both of Scotland's governments have a responsibility to meet our commitments and deliver the new powers that Scotland voted for."
He added: "I am confident the House of Commons will support the Scotland Bill next week and we will enter a new phase where the Scottish government will need to start telling us how they intend to use these new powers.
"Will they top up benefits? Will they create new benefits and how much will it all cost?"
Deputy First Minister John Swinney insisted the UK government amendments had not gone far enough.
He said: "The Scottish government and the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee have set out amendments that would deliver Smith in full, including the full scope of the Sewel Convention, removal of constraints on social security powers, new powers over benefits in devolved areas and employment support, and all the Crown Estate's economic assets in Scotland, including Fort Kinnaird.
"Unless all of these amendments are accepted it is not credible to claim that the Smith Agreement has been delivered.
"It is also remains unacceptable that UK ministers can veto devolved social security powers."
The Fort Kinnaird retail park in the east of Edinburgh is part-owned by the Crown Estate but it has been proposed that it would not be included in the devolved settlement.
