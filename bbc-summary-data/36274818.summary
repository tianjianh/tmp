A 1980s-themed concert at Queen of the South's Palmerston Park has been cancelled due to poor ticket sales.

The Boomtown Rats were to headline the event in Dumfries along with Rick Astley, ABC, The Stars from The Commitments and The Rezillos on 4 June.
Last year the Doonhamers hosted their first concert when Status Quo were the headline act.
However, advanced ticket sales of just 700 compared with 5,000 sold in 2015 prompted the decision to cancel.
Organisers said sales were "not sufficient to justify the event going ahead on a commercial basis".
"We have not been helped with the number of alternative outdoor festivals and concerts across Scotland and the north of England," they said.
"After weighing up additional costs to go ahead with the concert from this point against the costs of cancelling altogether it was unfortunately a decision that had to be taken.
"Clearly all customers who have already bought and paid for tickets for the event will be refunded in full."
