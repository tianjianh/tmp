[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said the man was approached by two men carrying weapons at Monklands Hospital, Airdrie, at about 12:10 on Tuesday.
They demanded his car keys and then hit the man's legs with weapons before making off in his grey Audi A4.
It follows a similar attack near Glasgow Royal infirmary on Monday where three armed men stole a man's car.
Police said they were not ruling out a link between the two incidents.
In the latest attack, the victim had parked his car off Centenary Avenue and was walking to the hospital entrance when he was attacked.
He did not need hospital treatment.
Police said the first suspect had a slight build, was in his late teens or early 20s and was wearing dark clothing and a woollen balaclava.
The second man was also described as slim and wearing dark clothing and a woollen balaclava.
Det Sgt David Lamont said: "This was an innocent man simply going about his business who was randomly attacked by two opportunistic criminals.
"The men responsible gave no consideration for the victim or anyone else around the hospital at the time, and later drove off in the vehicle in an extremely erratic manner, placing other members of the public in danger.
"From inquiries so far, we know the car was driven through the Coatbridge area and was later abandoned in Netherhouse Place, Easterhouse."
In the incident on Monday, police said the stolen red three-door Vauxhall Corsa may have been in the area of Tillycairn Road in Easterhouse.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland.
