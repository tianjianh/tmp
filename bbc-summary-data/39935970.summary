A gay couple popular in Poland, Jakub and Dawid, mime to George Michael songs, in a YouTube video promoted with the Twitter hashtag #Polandwakeup.
George Michael, who died in December, was "the greatest gay artist of our time", the LGBT activists said.
Poland's nationalist government, close to the Catholic Church, has been accused of restricting gay rights.
Jakub and Dawid plan to get married in June - but same-sex unions are illegal in Poland, so they will go to Portugal for the ceremony.
The campaigners said the video was aimed at an international audience, in the hope that "it might force the government to make at least civil unions legal".
A European Parliament resolution in 2007 condemned homophobia in Europe, including "the emerging climate of racist, xenophobic and homophobic intolerance in Poland".
It spoke of an anti-LGBT agenda in the Polish education system, and urged the Polish authorities to stop "public leaders inciting discrimination and hatred based on sexual orientation".
Among the Polish gay celebrities backing the George Michael video project were: dancer and singer Wiktor Korszla, vloggers Piotr Sokolowski and Pawel Dworak, hairdresser Tomasz Bozek, campaigners Marek and Jedrzej Idziak-Sepkowski and drag queens Charlotte Drag Queer and Aldona Relax.
