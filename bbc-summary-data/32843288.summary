A disabled woman who stabbed a friend to death at a flat in Fife has been jailed for at least 13 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tammy Hoggan, who has cerebral palsy, was given a life sentence after being convicted of murdering Leslie Carrington, 48, in Kirkcaldy in 2013.
The court heard Hoggan, 29, describe her victim as a "lovely guy, harmless and caring".
She had denied the killing but a jury heard she told five police officers she had attacked Mr Carrington.
Judge John Morris QC ordered Hoggan to serve a minimum of 13 years before she can apply for parole.
He said it appeared she had "not been dealt the best hand in life".
But he added: "What you did was take the life on an innocent man and deprived a child of his father."
Earlier, the trial at the High Court in Glasgow was told that Mr Carrington spent the hours before he was attacked watching University Challenge and listening to music with friends Douglas Butters and Hoggan's ex-boyfriend Robert Lawson.
Mr Lawson said Hoggan had turned up at his flat in Melrose Crescent and was "distraught" after apparently having a row with her mother.
The witness then told how his ex kicked over a table before he realised she was clutching a knife as she sat beside Mr Carrington.
Hoggan - who has problems down her right side - had the blade in her left hand. The court heard she made a stabbing motion towards Mr Carrington three times.
Mr Lawson said: "I saw Les leaning forward then the blood running between his legs on to the couch then on to the floor."
He also remembered the victim saying: "Tammy, I can't believe you stabbed me."
Mr Carrington, who had a young son, never recovered from his injuries.
Hoggan claimed she remembered very little of the incident and said it was Mr Lawson who had told her she was responsible.
But, prosecutor Bruce Erroch, in his speech to the jury, described this as "an attempt to re-write history".
