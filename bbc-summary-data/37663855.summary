West Ham United 1-0 Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Winston Reid scored a 94th-minute winner for West Ham at the London Stadium to condemn Sunderland to their worst start to a Premier League season.

The hosts may well have had a penalty when Reid was wrestled to the ground by Javier Manquillo early on.
Dimitri Payet then drew a smart save from Sunderland keeper Jordan Pickford before firing a low strike against the post after some clever footwork on the edge of the box.
Wahbi Khazri had the visitors' best chance after Steven Pienaar's deflected pass put him through on goal, but his tame shot was easily saved by Adrian.
Sunderland must have thought they had earned a point, but Reid turned smartly on the edge of the box from a West Ham corner to fire left-footed past Pickford.
It leaves David Moyes' side bottom of the Premier League with just two points from their first nine games this season.
West Ham's tricky start to life at the London Stadium has been well documented, with Slaven Bilic's side only picking up four points from four Premier League games at their new ground before Sunderland's visit.
Payet's wonder goal salvaged a point against Middlesbrough last time out in east London and eased some of the frustration the home fans have expressed since their move from the Boleyn Ground.
Those claret and blue-clad supporters were growing restless as the Hammers looked to have been held by the division's bottom side, despite dominating in the first half.
Moyes and Sunderland looked content to return home with a point as the former Everton and Manchester United boss threw on defensive reinforcements and watched his side drop deep into their own territory.
But it was a moment of hesitation deep into injury time that caught the visitors out, as a short corner from West Ham was worked to Reid and his effort snuck through a maul of bodies in the box.
Bilic opted to start with three central defenders as the Hammers recorded only their second win of the season at Crystal Palace last week, but the hosts were missing suspended left wing-back Aaron Cresswell, influential to that system, against Sunderland.
The Croat stuck with a back three in Cresswell's absence, handing Edimilson Fernandes a first Premier League start, and the 20-year-old Swiss looked an adept attacking threat, managing four shots on goal and making a key pass for the hosts.
On the other flank was Michail Antonio, the club's top scorer this season, and his pace and energy caused problems for the visitors with the England hopeful managing six crosses, as did his second-half replacement Sofiane Feghouli.
Despite the ammunition, summer singing Simone Zaza was unable to open his West Ham account, though the Italy forward did watch an acrobatic overhead kick drop narrowly wide of Pickford's far post before the break.
Sunderland have staged miraculous escape acts in recent seasons, but with just six goals and two points to show for his tenure so far, Moyes needs his side's fortunes to change quickly if they are to repeat that trick.
They are now only the second team in top-flight history to fail to win any of their opening nine league games in consecutive seasons, with Bury the other in 1905 and 1906.
Jermain Defoe's 15 goals played a big part in the Black Cats' successful survival bid last term, and the former England international has scored four of his side's six goals so far this season.
But the 34-year-old touched the ball just once inside the opposition box in the first half against his old side at the London Stadium and cut an isolated figure.
Moyes, who got the backing of Sunderland chief executive Martin Bain this week, sent his team out with more intent early in the second half with Khazri and Duncan Watmore posing more of a threat, though to no avail.

Sunderland manager David Moyes: "It was offside. It should be given offside. The referee thinks it is onside.
"You can tell by the referee's movement to the linesman that he is not sure, they weren't sure but it was not a goal.
"I thought the players played well. Not in the opening 20 minutes, they bossed us but we got through it and had good chances. I am very pleased with the performance but not the result."

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic speaking to BBC Sport: "It was a dramatic end. The first 25 minutes it was by far our best 25 minutes, including last season.
"We were good, sharp, created chances and we deserved to be two up. Then they came back. And in the second half they had great chances and were dangerous on the counter attack but in the last 15 minutes we pushed more and we were looking to score.
"I cannot say it was a goal from the training ground. You expect Winston Reid to score a header but it was a great decision to come in on the edge of the box."
Former England midfielder Danny Murphy:
"David Moyes thought the winner should have been ruled out for offside - and it was tight. But ultimately if you're conceding lots of goals late in games, you have got a problem.
"Players switched off and were not concentrating. As Winston Reid hits it, you can see Jonathan Calleri is in line with Jack Rodwell. It's an inch or two inches but it's not a bad decision. I think the assistant referee has done well."
West Ham are back at the London Stadium in EFL Cup action on Wednesday, when they host rivals Chelsea. Slaven Bilic's side then visit Everton in the Premier League for the 13:30 BST kick-off on Sunday.
Sunderland go to Southampton in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, before Arsenal visit the Stadium of Light in the Premier League's early kick-off on Saturday.
