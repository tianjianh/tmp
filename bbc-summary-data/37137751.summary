The 30-year-old announced in April that he was leaving Premiership side Bath, having signed in 2012 from Scarlets.
"I'm really excited about the challenge of playing for the Rebels," Day said.
Day currently plays for Toyota Verblitz and will join his new side at the end of the Japanese Top League season, which concludes in January.
"Playing in the Pro12 and Premiership I would always watch Super Rugby and enjoyed the attacking style," he said.
"I think it's the most exciting competition in the world.
"Super Rugby has some of the best and most skilful players in the world and I want to test myself in that arena."
Fellow forward Gareth Delve - the first Welshman to play Super Rugby - had a three-year stay at Melbourne Rebels between 2010 and 2013.
