The 29-year-old, who submitted a transfer request to the Cobblers this week, has agreed a two-year deal with the Addicks.
Holmes scored 16 goals in 53 appearances after moving to Sixfields from Portsmouth in January 2015.
"Ricky was a top target for me," Addicks boss Russell Slade said.
Holmes becomes Slade's first signing since his appointment as manager at The Valley earlier this month, and Charlton's second signing of the transfer window.
"Ricky had a fantastic season at Northampton and is capable of not only scoring goals but creating them too," Slade added.
"I have no doubt that the Charlton fans will take to his style of play."
Northampton chairman Kelvin Thomas said the League Two winners were "very sorry" to see Holmes leave the club.
"Having turned down three bids already, Ricky handing in a transfer request did change the game somewhat," he added.
"Upon realising we couldn't persuade Ricky to stay, our focus was to ensure that we got the best deal possible for the club."
Meanwhile, BBC Wiltshire reports Charlton have agreed a fee in the region of Â£800,000 to buy striker Nicky Ajose from Swindon Town.
