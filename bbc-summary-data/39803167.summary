[SN]TITLE[SN]
First Conservative elected in Western Isles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Conservatives have made historic gains in the Highlands and the Western Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The results for Highland Council have seen the first Conservatives to be elected in 22 years, with six so far in wards in and around Inverness.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said her party has won its first ever seat in the Western Isles.
Ranald Fraser is among the newly-elected councillors to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.
The comhairle's count in Stornoway on Lewis, which has finished, has seen none of the women among the candidates elected.
Independents have dominated the Western Isles election, as they have done previously, with 23 Independent candidates being elected, followed by seven SNP, one Conservative and no Labour councillors.
Labour had three candidates elected at the last vote in 2012.
Paramedics were called to the Stornoway count after veteran SNP figure and Barra and South Uist candidate Donald Manford fell ill.
No details were available on his condition. Mr Manford is a well known figure in Western Isles politics and has been re-elected as a councillor.
In the Highlands, the five Conservatives councillors are in the wards of Inverness Ness-side, Aird and Loch Ness, Inverness Millburn, Nairn and Cawdor, Inverness South and Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh.
The results from Highland Council's count have also seen the re-election of veteran figures.
They include the council's former leader, Independent councillor Margaret Davidson, the SNP group's leader before the election Maxine Smith, former Inverness provost Helen Carmichael and long-time Labour councillor Jimmy Gray and Lib Dem Jamie Stone.
