Work to boost fish numbers on River Kennet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has begun to boost fish numbers on a stretch of a Berkshire river affected by pollution.

Studies showed the fish population on a River Kennet tributary had not recovered following a series of pollution incidents.
The work involves creating a series of pools as "steps" for fish to swim upstream at Stratfield Mortimer Weir.
Charlotte Hitchmough of Action for the River Kennet said the aim was to "remove barriers to fish movement".
The week-long work on Foudry Brook involves building a "passage" for species such as perch and brown trout.
Ms Hitchmough said: "A huge number of fish died but the fish population hasn't recovered as we would hope - one of the reasons is they can't easily swim upstream to repopulate the whole river.
"Healthy rivers are good for all wildlife, this is an example of a relatively small river which, with simple interventions, could be a lot better."
