The purpose-built rehearsal facility in Glasgow - which has increased space by 50% - has been unveiled as part of RCS 170th anniversary celebrations.
The project has created 27 acoustically separated rooms for individual practice and one-to-one teaching and two large ensemble rehearsal spaces.
A new tartan has also been created to celebrate the occasion.
The fabric is a blend of blue, purple and grey and features in a new collection of accessories which are available to buy from the conservatoire's website.
Every purchase supports scholarships for students.
Established in 1847, the RCS offers specialised teaching across dance, drama, music, production and screen.
In one review, it was ranked sixth in the world for performing arts education.
Prof Jeffrey Sharkey, Principal of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, said: "Students are at the heart of everything we do at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and we're thrilled to hand over this wonderful learning and teaching complex that will support them on their journey with us.
"An inspiring environment is crucial to the student experience and this purpose-built space gives our talented students and lifelong learners a place to grow and develop as performers."
The Creative Campus project has been financed through a fundraising campaign, including support from The Robertson Trust, Garfield Weston Foundation, The Hugh Fraser Foundation, The Sackler Trust, PF Charitable Trust, Wolfson Foundation, W A Cargill Charitable Trust.
