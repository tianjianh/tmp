The movie's Glasgow-born producer Iain Smith and head of visual effects Andrew Jackson join a line-up that also includes actress Barbara Rafferty.
Sunset Song's Dundee-born producer Bob Last has also been invited to the festival, now in its ninth year.
The event will be held from 4 to 6 December at venues in Cromarty.
Festival co-founder and film director Don Coutts said: "It's fantastic to be able to welcome Iain Smith and Andrew Jackson to the festival.
"Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the big cinema hits of 2015 and it will be great to have them both in Cromarty to reveal their experiences and insights of working on such a successful piece of work.
"We have a broad variety of guests this year with incredibly diverse backgrounds - from the acting talent of Barbara Rafferty to the music industry experience of Bob Last.
"It will be great to hear more about his experiences on Sunset Song and also his documentary work. The audience will gain great insights into these and the experiences of other guests in that fantastically intimate way that only Cromarty Film Festival can provide."
The festival has a tradition of holding screenings in unusual locations, including in a pizza restaurant and in the outdoors.
In 2008, its organisers claimed to have staged the world's smallest drive-in cinema on a car ferry.
Four passengers watched the 1950s film, The Maggie, on the ferry which ran between Cromarty and Nigg in the Highlands.
