SNP conference: Sturgeon makes NHS treatment centres pledge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon is to pledge to build a new £200m network of NHS treatment centres for planned operations if the SNP wins next May's Holyrood elections.

She will announce the new policy in her leader's address to the SNP conference.
Ms Sturgeon will also accuse Prime Minister David Cameron of playing "fast and loose" with the UK's membership of the EU.
And she will say the SNP will "campaign positively" to keep both Scotland and the UK in the EU.
With a growing elderly population, the Scottish NHS faces growing demand for hip and knee replacements and cataract operations.
Ms Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, believes the service will be "overwhelmed by the demand" unless there is new capacity.

She will commit a future SNP government to extending the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank and building new facilities at hospitals in Livingston, Edinburgh, Dundee, Inverness and Aberdeen.
The treatment centres would open within five years and increase the number of planned operations by up to 50% by 2025.
She will tell delegates at the conference in Aberdeen that the treatment centre at the Golden Jubilee has been a "huge success", with staff there "helping to take pressure off our emergency hospitals".
The first minister will announce: "We now intend to extend that model. Over the next parliament we will invest £200m to create a new network of elective treatment centres.
"We will extend the Golden Jubilee and develop new centres at St John's in Livingston, at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, at Ninewells in Dundee, at Raigmore in Inverness and here in this city at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary."
Her speech comes at the end of the SNP's biggest ever conference, which Ms Sturgeon hopes to use as a launch pad for her party's bid to win a historic third term in office in next year's Scottish Parliament vote.
The election campaign will be her first as first minister, prompting Ms Sturgeon to ask voters to put their trust in her.
She will say: "Over these next few months, as we prepare to seek re-election, I won't pretend that we are perfect. Or that I am perfect.
"But I will promise this. We will always strive to be the best we can be. And we will serve this country with imagination, courage, humility and always to the very best of our abilities."
Ms Sturgeon will also say the prime minister is showing a "failure of leadership" by "pandering to eurosceptics" as she attempts to drive home her party's pro-EU message.
And she will use her address to make the case against UK military intervention in Syria, arguing instead that "what is needed is not more bombing but a renewed and intensive diplomatic initiative led by the UN".
And she will warn that military action such as airstrikes risks "simply adding to the already unimaginable human suffering".
