Ulster SFC semi-final replay: Cavan 2-17 5-18 Tyrone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyrone booked an Ulster Championship final meeting with Donegal by hammering Cavan 5-18 to 2-17 in Sunday's high-scoring one-sided replay at Clones.

Two goals in the space of two minutes from Peter Harte helped the Red Hands to a 2-8 to 0-7 half-time lead.
Connor McAliskey and Rory Brennan added further goals early in the second half, before Cavan's Cian Mackey netted.
The points continued to pile up for both sides, as substitutes Mark Bradley and Jack Brady traded late goals.
Tyrone are aiming for a first Ulster title triumph since 2010, the last time they contested the provincial decider.
Cavan's 19-year wait for an Anglo-Celt Cup success continues however as their bid to reach a first final since 2001 ended in failure.
Re-live the semi-final action at Clones as it happened
The replay was the fourth meeting between the sides this season, with Tyrone having beaten their Ulster rivals twice in the Football League, including the Division Two final on 24 April.
Despite conceding three goals in the drawn game a fortnight ago, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte made just one change in defence, with Niall Morgan replacing Mickey O'Neill in goal, thereby offering his side an extra free-taking option, an area which has been problematic for the Red Hands.
Prior to throw-in, it was revealed that Justin McMahon and Ronan McNabb would replace Mark Bradley and Darren McCurry, with full-forward Eugene Keating coming in for Seanie Johnston in the Cavan line-up.
The opening exchanges were evenly contested but with Tyrone leading by a point, 0-6 to 0-5 after 22 minutes, a quick-fire brace of goals from Harte put his side in the ascendancy.
Harte completed a fine move by his team for the first, accepting a pass from Cathal McShane, before blasting the ball left-footed past Raymond Galligan.
Soon after, the same player toe-poked the ball into the net after Tiernan McCann was fouled in the build-up, but referee David Coldrick played the advantage.
Further points from Harte and Morgan extended the advantage to nine, but Gearoid McKiernan ended a 15-minute period without a score for the Breffnimen with his second and third points of the match.
Having spurned some early opportunities for a goal, including Keating hitting the bar, Cavan were denied a chance to find the net in the final minute of the first half as Tomas Corr looked to be brought down inside the penalty area, but Coldrick waved play on.
The first score of the second half took nine minutes to materialise, Sean Cavanagh gaining possession and McAliskey picking up the ball in the middle of the field, before running through on goal and shooting right-footed past Galligan.
The Cavan goalkeeper kicked a free but was forced to pick the ball out of his net again in the 50th minute after substitute Brennan palmed the ball home.
Terry Hyland's demoralised side trailed 4-12 to 0-10 when Mackey slotted the ball home for a consolation goal on the hour mark, then Harte passed up an opening for a hat-trick, firing over the bar with the goal gaping.
The prolific points-scoring continued while Bradley took advantage of the wide open spaces in their opponents' defence to score his team's fifth goal in injury-time, with Cavan replacement Brady grabbing his side's second three-pointer six minutes into added time.
Tyrone will play Donegal in the Ulster final on 17 July, the first time the counties have met in the decider since 1989. Cavan face Carlow in Round 2A of the All-Ireland Qualifiers at Breffni Park on Saturday 9 July, with a 17:00 BST throw-in.
Tyrone manager Mickey Harte:"It was a good day but not a great day - I'm happy with the score we built up but 2-17 is a serious score to concede.
"We played an open expansive brand of football and it was pleasing to score five goals, that made such a difference from the initial game two weeks ago.
"We will relish the fact that we are in the final but we know what we are up against and Donegal will pose a serious challenge for us."
Cavan manager Terry Hyland:"It is rare to have such a high-scoring game in the Championship and it is not like Cavan to concede five goals, I can't remember ever doing that in my time in charge.
"Tyrone were exceptionally good but we created a number of goalscoring chances ourselves in the first half but didn't take them. That swung the pendulum in Tyrone's favour."
