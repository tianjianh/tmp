The phoenix club, created following the demise of Hereford United in December 2014, will play in English football's seventh tier next season.
Saturday's 4-0 win at Salisbury secured the Southern League Division One South & West title with six games to spare.
"To win 4-0 away is a great way to do it," said Bulls manager Peter Beadle.
"And to do it against a decent side and to win the title with six games to go is a huge, spectacular effort by the players.
"It was a real tough league for lots of different reasons. There were three or four really good sides in there and they've all raised their game when they've played us - their big day if you like.
"But this will keep evolving. It will keep getting bigger. That's our ambition - to make sure the club keeps moving forward."
Hereford faced a tough test at Steve Claridge's Salisbury, who they beat in the FA Vase semi-finals to reach Wembley in March 2016.
They also needed both Taunton Town and Tiverton Town to lose on Saturday to be crowned champions.
Second-placed Taunton lost 2-0 at Evesham, while third-placed Tiverton were beaten 1-0 at Wimborne, so Mike Symons' double, Jamie Molyneux's goal and a stunning strike from Pablo Haysham ensured Beadle's Bulls will play in the Southern League Premier Division next season.
Hereford have had an average attendance of 2,721 at Edgar Street for their 18 Southern League Division One South & West home games this season.
That is higher than five League Two clubs and all but three National League sides: Tranmere Rovers (5,036), Lincoln City (4,346) and Wrexham (3,893).
The crowd of 1,807 at Salisbury was bigger than all of Saturday's other 10 Southern League Division One South & West games put together.
"The fans have been spectacular," said Bulls boss Beadle. "They always are, both at home and especially when they travel away from home.
"You'd like to shake every one of them by the hand to thank them for all the effort they've put into getting across the south-west of the country to support us with the passion they do."

"It has been a phenomenal achievement by everyone connected with the club in only their second year in competitive league football.
"Manager Pete Beadle and his players deserve particular credit, but the off-the-field team of directors, staff, fans and volunteers have all played a part in this success.
"There will obviously be bigger challenges ahead. That's what promotion is all about. But, on and off the field, Hereford appear well equipped to deal with life at the higher level next season."
