A couple have been found guilty of causing or allowing the death of their seven-week-old son.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Kightley suffered severe brain injuries and more than 40 fractures and died soon after he was admitted to hospital on 17 March 2012.
Jacqueline Parker, 21, and Adam Kightley, 24, of London Road, Northampton, had denied the charge.
A charge of murder against both defendants was dropped at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday.
Jamie was found "not breathing" at 06:30 by Mr Kightley, who when questioned in court said he did not pick up and cuddle his son because he was "in shock".
The baby had extensive bruising all over his body, no pulse and was not breathing when he arrived at Northampton General Hospital by ambulance.
He was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later.
The prosecution said Jamie had been assaulted about two weeks before his death and again within hours of his death, but that both parents had "hidden behind a wall of silence" over who was responsible.
Medical evidence showed he suffered injuries consistent with being grabbed around the middle and shaken, the jury heard.
Kightley and Parker agreed they had been drinking and smoking cannabis the night before Jamie's death but denied doing anything to harm their son.
When asked about bruises on his body, Parker claimed she had not seen them until Jamie was in hospital.
She also said Jamie went seven hours without being fed the day before his death.
The jury took 25 minutes to return guilty verdicts.
Kightley and Parker are due to be sentenced on Thursday.
