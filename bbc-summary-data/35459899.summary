A Lancashire animal sanctuary hit with an eviction notice is facing a "heartbreaking" race against time to re-home more than 30 animals.

Easterleigh Animal Sanctuary in St Annes has been told it must leave its current premises by the end of March after a year-long tenancy row.
The charity is trying to re-home eight horses, 25 dogs, three pigs and one cat and has vowed none will be put down.
Sanctuary owner Mandy Leigh said: "It's heartbreaking, time is running out."
She added: "It's terrible, very upsetting, but the fight is on and we are determined.
"I'm not going to give up after 20 years and I absolutely promise not one animal will be put to sleep.
"I have never done that and I'm not going to start now."
The sanctuary currently employs eight staff and has re-homed 22,000 animals in the past 20 years.
Owner Mrs Leigh, 67, said she hopes to keep some of her staff on, funded by charity shops across the Fylde coast.
She said: "We tried to buy the sanctuary without any success.
"We thought we would have more time to get out, but we've been told we have to be out by the end of March.
"We are trying not to panic and we will get every animal sorted one way or another.
"It's so upsetting. Some of the staff have been with me for more than 10 years. We'll get a new place eventually, but we need to find homes for these animals now.
"We need money. If we have to put animals in kennels or stables, it will all have to be paid for."
