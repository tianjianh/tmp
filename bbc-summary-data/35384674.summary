Canadian teen star Shawn Mendes has ended his countrymate Justin Bieber's extended run at the top of the charts.

The singer's second single, Stitches, took 17 weeks to reach number one, bucking a trend for songs to enter the UK chart at the top spot.
Only one song has taken longer: Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud, which had a 19-week climb to the summit in 2014.
Mendes rose to fame on the video-sharing app Vine, much like Bieber who was originally discovered on YouTube.
He beat his rival by just 1,500 combined sales and streams - although Bieber still had the most-streamed song of the week, with Love Yourself racking up 3.72 million plays.
In reaching the top spot, 17-year-old Mendes ends an unprecedented run of success for Bieber.
The star spent eight of the last nine weeks at number one - and recently became the first artist in chart history to occupy the top three spots, with the songs Love Yourself, Sorry and What Do You Mean.
His residency at number one was only interrupted by the NHS Choir, whose charity single A Bridge Over You became the Christmas number one after Bieber urged his 72 million Twitter followers to buy their single instead of his.
A lack of new releases, combined with Beiber's continued success, has resulted in a top 10 where every single is at least 10 weeks old.
In the album chart, David Bowie continues to exert an influence, with his final album Blackstar retaining the number one position.
The Best Of Bowie compilation from 2002 jumps from 18 to number three; while a more recent hits collection, 2014's Nothing Has Changed, is at number six.
Hunky Dory, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, The Next Day, Low and Let's Dance also feature in the top 40.
The death of The Eagles co-founder Glen Frey also prompted a surge in sales, with the US band's Complete Greatest Hits re-entering the chart at 29.
Elsewhere, US rock band Panic! At The Disco scored their first top five album with Death of a Bachelor, a new entry at number four.
And husky-voiced songwriter Jack Savoretti sees his fourth album, Written In Scars, enter the top 10 for the first time, after a performance on Graham Norton's show last week.
