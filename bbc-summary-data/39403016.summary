Lee, 26, had a one shot lead going into the final round but five birdies on the front nine put her in control.
She finished on 20 under to match the tournament record set by Cristie Kerr in 2015 when Lee was runner-up.
Fellow South Korean Ryu So-yeon and American Austin Ernst tied for second on 14 under in the final outing before the first major starts on Thursday.
"It's been a long time to be winner of the tournament," said Lee via a translator.
"So I (was) kind of nervous before I started. But I tried to focus and then it gave me a good result."
The 35th staging of the year's opening major, the ANA Inspiration tournament, will be played at Dinah Shore in California.
