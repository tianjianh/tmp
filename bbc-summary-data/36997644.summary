County Championship: Chris Jordan's maiden century puts Sussex in control

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Jordan made his maiden century as Sussex took charge against Essex on the third day at Colchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 59, the England fast bowler reached three figures off 164 balls, having hit nine fours and a six.
Jordan, caught off Graham Napier for 131, was last man out as Sussex were bowled out for 448, a lead of 90.
The hosts lost Nick Browne immediately, caught at square leg off Jordan, to end on 163-4, with a lead of 73 runs going into the final day.
Jordan's previous highest-ever score of 92 came in the Championship against Derbyshire in 2013, when he shared a 179-run sixth-wicket stand with Mike Yardy to help Sussex to a nine-wicket win.
