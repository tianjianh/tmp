[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premiership: Bath 32-26 Sale Sharks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sale Sharks' faint chances of a play-off spot were dented as they lost their game in hand at an improved Bath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated the first half and led 17-0 thanks to early Ollie Devoto and Charlie Ewels tries.
Sale narrowed the deficit to just three points with quickfire Johnny Leota and Andrei Ostrikov scores after the break.
But Semesa Rokoduguni and Will Homer tries made sure of Bath's win, before late scores from TJ Ioane and Leota earned Sale a bonus point.
Sale's late tries ensured they got two points despite defeat, boosting their hopes of a top-six finish.
Bath v Sale as it happened.
Bath, who were without back row Alafoti Faosiliva having suspended him after he pleaded guilty to assault at Bath Magistrates Court on Thursday, avenged last Sunday's 29-17 defeat at Sale in the reverse fixture.
Sale move above Northampton into fifth and are six points behind fourth-placed Leicester.
Bath remain ninth, three points below eighth-placed Gloucester with two matches remaining.
