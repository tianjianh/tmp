The film, which stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, was the only new entry in this week's top 10.
It pushed Marvel's Doctor Strange, which has been the most popular film in the UK for the last fortnight, down to number two.
The superhero movie, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch, took a further £2.4m over the weekend.
Children's animated film Trolls, Ben Affleck's The Accountant and A Street Cat Named Bob rounded out the top five.
Arrival also made its debut at the US box office over the weekend, but landed in third place behind Doctor Strange and Trolls.
