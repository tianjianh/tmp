[SN]TITLE[SN]
i paper helps stem Johnston Press sales decline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The growth of the i title has helped drive a rise in sales for Edinburgh-based newspaper publisher Johnston Press.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sales in September of the compact, which costs 50p, were up 4% to an average 290,000 per day.
However, revenue for the group, which also publishes The Scotsman, fell 3% between July and October when compared with the same period last year.
The figures came on top of a 9% fall in revenue for the first half of 2016.
The growth of the i resulted in the title taking a 20% share of the so-called "quality segment" of Britain's newspaper market.
Without the i, the figures fell more sharply, with revenues down 16% in the past three months.
Advertising revenue without the new title was also down 12%, while circulation revenue dropped by 10%.
Digital advertising, seen as a way of replacing declining revenue from paper sales, fell during the summer-autumn period by 3%.
Despite the figures, Johnston Press saw its share price rise slightly to 14p.
It has fallen from 66p a year ago, and fell below 9p before a surge in September, when an activist investor became involved in moves to change the publisher's strategy.
Last month, it announced a deal with creditors to change the conditions on some of its borrowing, giving it more time to raise finance by selling assets.
That is expected to include newspaper titles.
