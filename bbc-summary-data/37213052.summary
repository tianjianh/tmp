A mass has been held in Glasgow to remember the victims of last week's earthquake in central Italy.

At least 290 people were killed and hundreds more injured when the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Wednesday, 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome.
The town of Amatrice was among the worst affected areas.
The service at St Andrew's Cathedral was led by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia.
It follows a similar event in Edinburgh on Sunday.
Ronnie Convery, director of communications for the Archdiocese of Glasgow, said there had been wide interest in the service from Scotland's Italian community.
"We are looking at something like 400 new arrivals from Italy every month at the moment in Glasgow and Edinburgh," he said.
"It's those people I notice on social media who have really taken up the information about the mass today.
"It's also interesting that in many cases people are not necessarily practicing Catholics but they just want to have that opportunity to be together, to meet, to do something."
