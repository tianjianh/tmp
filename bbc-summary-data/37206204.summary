Chris Froome's hopes of winning the Vuelta a Espana have suffered a setback after the Briton lost 33 seconds to Nairo Quintana on stage eight.

Uzbekistan's Sergey Lagutin won the stage after being part of an 11-man breakaway on the first mountain stage.
But Colombian Quintana attacked Team Sky's Froome on the final climb of the 181.5km stage and seized the leader's red jersey from Darwin Atapuma.
Froome is still third in the general classification, but is 27 seconds down.
The Briton is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Vuelta and Tour de France in the same season.
Quintana's team-mate Alejandro Valverde finished alongside Froome and is in second place, 19 seconds behind.
"We have achieved our principal objective which was to get the leader's jersey and take some seconds off our rivals," Quintana said.
"We started with a lot of caution because we expected the attack from Froome, he attacked and we knew how to respond."
Three-time Vuelta winner Alberto Contador is up to seventh after his late surge earned him 12 seconds over Valverde and Froome.
