[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family has paid tribute to "their rock" after she died in a car crash in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Debra-Claire Lewis-Jones of Pontyclun was travelling on the A4232 at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday when her car overturned near Culverhouse Cross.
Her family described her as "a wonderful mother, daughter, sister and wife."
South Wales Police do not believe any other vehicles were involved in the crash and are appealing for witnesses.
A family tribute said: "She was one of the happiest people, she laughed easily and frequently, and as her family can attest; she laughed with her whole body and soul.
"She knew the answers to everything, and she knew it. Her favourite phrase was 'I'm always right' and I can't recall a time when she wasn't."
Police want to speak to anybody who saw the Grey Seat Ibiza crash or who stopped to provide assistance.
