The funeral of the popular BBC Radio Ulster contributor Geordie Tuft has taken place in County Down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Tuft regularly appeared on the Gerry Anderson Show to offer advice on rural life that typically descended into comedic chatter with the presenter.
He died in a fire at his home outside Loughbrickland earlier this month.
BBC Radio Ulster's Sean Coyle, who co-presented the Gerry Anderson Show, was among those who attended Mr Tuft's funeral.
It took place at Aghaderg Parish Church in Loughbrickland, a short distance from where Mr Tuft lived.
