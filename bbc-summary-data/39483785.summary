[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father has been jailed after his two little boys behaved "like zombies" when they were exposed to heroin fumes.

Caernarfon Crown Court heard the boys, then aged one and three, also had powder absorbed on their skin.
Their father, from Bangor, admitted child cruelty by recklessly exposing them during one month in autumn 2014.
Sentencing him to three years in prison, Judge Huw Rees said: "In simple terms, he could not have cared less for the children at that particular time."
Sion ap Mihangel, prosecuting, said doctor said the boys suffered from opiate withdrawal for four or five days before recovering.
Social services removed the children and their foster carers described them behaving like zombies, looking ghastly and unhealthy, the court heard.
The elder boy had to be woken up, was sick, and went into a meltdown, screaming and growling.
The doctor believed they were repeatedly exposed to substantial amounts of heroin, and that would be consistent with zombie-type, typical withdrawal symptoms.
Simon Mills, defending, said the father did not mean to harm the children but by his own drug problems has exposed them leading to withdrawal symptoms.
