Labour rejects BBC and ITV Senedd documentary

A behind-the-scenes documentary about the national assembly will not go ahead after Labour objected to it.

BBC and ITV asked to make a programme about life in Cardiff Bay in the run up to the 2016 assembly election.
Presiding officer Rosemary Butler said it was a "fantastic opportunity" but Labour said the request came at "very short notice" and could be disruptive.
Earlier this year the assembly refused a James Bond film access to the Senedd debating chamber.
Dame Rosemary wrote to the four party leaders in October saying broadcasters wanted to film in and around the assembly, and possibly follow AMs in their constituencies.
She said it was an opportunity to promote the assembly, but wanted the approval of all parties.
She asked for responses as soon as possible but, in another letter on Monday, said: "On this occasion, and for various reasons, we were not able to secure unanimous approval and we will therefore advise BBC Wales and ITV Wales that the project will not be proceeding."
Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black said: "Once again we see the evasive Labour party shutting down transparency and scrutiny in the National Assembly."
A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: "We certainly didn't turn it down."
The Welsh Conservatives said they supported the idea too.
A Tory spokesman said: "At a time when boosting engagement with politics in Wales should be paramount, we are disappointed to hear unanimous support could not be agreed upon."
A Labour spokesman said: "It was felt that the proposal came with very short notice, lacked detail and would potentially cause significant disruption to the day to day work of members, staff and to assembly business during an extremely busy period."
A similar BBC documentary, Inside the Commons, took viewers behind the scenes in Westminster this year.
The assembly has opened its doors for new S4C drama Byw Celwydd, due to be broadcast in January.
