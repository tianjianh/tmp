Twenty properties were searched in Northern Ireland and five men arrested during the past two days.
The Garda (Irish police) also carried out two searches in County Donegal.
The PSNI has said the operation was aimed at disrupting the supply of cocaine and cannabis, as well as money laundering.
Ten of the searches took place in Londonderry.
The others were in Belfast, Strabane, Armagh, Dungannon, Aughnalocy and Glenavy.
Police seized quantities of drugs and luxury items valued at more than Â£200,000.
The items included high value watches, a large diamond and other jewellery, luxury cars and Â£9,000 in cash.
Those arrested include a member of staff at a jewellery store.
A 36-year-old man has been charged with conspiracy to supply drugs, money laundering and possession of criminal property.
Detective Superintendent Tim Mairs, head of the PSNI's reactive and organised crime branch, said the operation was a significant investment of PSNI resources.
"The searches across these two days have involved, including the interviews, somewhere in the region of about 400 officers," he said.
"Drugs are a huge concern for people in Northern Ireland and this demonstrates our commitment to dealing with the issue."
