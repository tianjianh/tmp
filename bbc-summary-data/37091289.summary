[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
However, it was a night of mixed fortunes for the Magpies as Aleksandar Mitrovic, Dwight Gayle and Rolando Aarons all came off injured.
Perez, who was also injured and had his head bandaged, curled in a brilliant opener in first-half stoppage time.
The Spaniard tapped in his second when Gayle pounced on Easah Suliman's back-pass and squared the ball.
