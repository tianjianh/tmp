Euro 2016: Wales 0-0 Israel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales were made to wait in their bid to qualify for Euro 2016 as they were held to a frustrating goalless draw by Israel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales seized control early on with chances for Andy King and Aaron Ramsey but they were shackled by a rigid Israel side.
The hosts continued to press after the break and Simon Church had an injury-time goal ruled out for offside, meaning Chris Coleman's side have not yet confirmed an end to Wales' 57-year absence from major tournaments.
Wales remain top of Group B and their hopes are still in their own hands, with games away against Bosnia-Herzegovina and at home to lowly Andorra to come in October.
Coleman's team are a point ahead of second-placed Belgium, who beat Cyprus 1-0 later on Sunday, and five in front of Israel in third, but this stalemate at an expectant Cardiff City Stadium interrupted the momentum of the Welsh campaign after three successive wins.
Since a goal by Pele knocked Wales out of the 1958 World Cup, Welsh football fans have had to endure generations of near misses, misfortune and plain misery.
But Coleman's side have given their supporters renewed hope and still stand on the brink of banishing half a century of heartache.
Anticipation abounded around Cardiff ahead of this game against Israel, the nation they beat in a play-off to reach those 1958 finals.
Roared on by a vociferous sell-out crowd, Wales thrived on the magnitude of the occasion and dominated from the start.
King had a shot saved by Ofir Marciano and Ramsey headed the rebound over and, although Wales continued to press, they were frustrated by their organised opponents.
There may have been a few doubts creeping into Welsh minds as the wait for a goal dragged further into the second half.
Bale clipped a free-kick narrowly over the bar from the edge of the Israeli area, the hosts were denied a clear penalty for a handball by Israel's Eitan Tibi, and King's header from a Ramsey corner was held on the line by Marciano.
The home crowd thought the breakthrough had arrived in injury time as substitute Church headed into the net but the roars of celebration were cut short as his effort was correctly ruled out for offside.
It made for a heavy sense of anti-climax inside Cardiff City Stadium, the home crowd made to wait for their moment of glory.
Wales conclude their campaign with a double-header next month, visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina on 10 October before hosting group minnows Andorra three days later.
That final encounter at Cardiff City Stadium could be the setting for an almighty party, as Wales may already have sealed qualification.
Wales manager Chris Coleman: "Had we scored early, it would have settled us down. It is in our hands so Israel and Belgium have to do their work to catch us."
Wales captain Ashley Williams: "They made it difficult for us. We wanted to get it done and dusted today but is has been a positive week with four points."
Former Wales striker John Hartson on BBC Radio 5 live: "They should have won but the official bottled it [over the penalty decision]. My five year-old daughter Stephanie would have done better than him today. But I believe we are on our way to France."
