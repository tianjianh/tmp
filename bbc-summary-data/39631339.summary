A car used by a number of men was traced to Newton Abbot, where police arrested a 20-year-old for failing to stop for police, and for drug possession.
Police then went to another address on the same street, where officers were met at the door by a 22-year-old brandishing a meat cleaver.
He was Tasered and arrested at 05:40.
At 16:50, police went to Condor Drive, Torquay, the scene of the reported hammer attack.
A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of that assault and in connection with the earlier stabbing at McDonalds.
A McDonald's spokesman said: "We can confirm an incident occurred at our Torquay restaurant in the early hours of yesterday morning.
"The restaurant was closed from around 01:00 allowing the police to carry out necessary inquiries and has since reopened."
