In a document further detailing its plans, the government said its key priorities were:
The government also said it would implement the General Data Protection Regulation - new EU data protection rules due to come into force in 2018.
It said the new UK bill would ensure the country met its obligations while a member of the EU, and would help the UK maintain its "ability to share data with other EU members states and internationally after we leave the EU".
The new bill will replace the Data Protection Act 1998.
Responding to the speech, a spokesman for the technology industry trade body techUK said: "We support the government's commitment to maintain the UK's world-class protection of people's personal data.  This will include implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, the biggest transformation of data protection rules in a generation."
The announcement was also welcomed by Nick Taylor, managing director at business consultancy Accenture Strategy.
"This new data protection law is the news that many companies have been waiting for to accelerate their GDPR programme and make it a concrete part of their business," he said.
"Companies now have certainty that they will have to comply with tougher rules, and this gives them the incentive, and need to get their GDPR programme right."
