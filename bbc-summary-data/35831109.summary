The posters were discovered on walls and buildings in Digbeth during the St Patrick's Day celebrations, which attracted 75,000 people.
They featured the photographs of two men and asked people to join a 'non violent protest' at the nearby The Bond warehouse.
Police said the allegations were "entirely false and malicious".

Insp Will O'Connor added that they had been "upsetting for two innocent men and their families" and said officers were working to track down who was behind the campaign.
The posters claimed to be from Digbeth Residents' Association and said the men had been "found to be exchanging graphic, indecent pictures of underage boys via West Midlands and Warwickshire encrypted paedophile networks".
Pamela Pinski from Digbeth Residents' Association said: "It [the poster] has absolutely nothing to with us...it is completely against our ethos and something we're really concerned about.
"Somebody has used our logo in this malicious way," she said.
The Bond, an events and wedding venue, said they could not comment on a pending police investigation.
Inspector O'Connor said: "Officers patrolling as part of Sunday's St Patrick's Day parade noticed several posters dotted around Digbeth naming two local men as child sex offenders.
"The allegations are entirely false and malicious: the two men featuring in the posters have no criminal convictions.
"An investigation has been launched in a bid to find out where the posters originated, while the posters have been seized for forensic examination.
"This is a serious offence. It's upsetting for two innocent men and their families who are understandably concerned they could be targeted on the back of these false allegations.
"If anyone has any information about who is responsible for the posters I would urge them to contact me on the 101 number."
