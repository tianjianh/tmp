Their 6-3 win against the Kirkcaldy side followed up a 3-2 loss at Braehead Clan on Saturday, where they were 3-0 down after only five minutes.
The Canadian also reserved praise for team-mate Ian Schultz, who scored a hat-trick in Sunday's home win.
"Being around the bottom of the standings, we desperately needed to take the points," said Staal.
"There was a lot of disappointment around the result against Braehead on Saturday, but we did it to ourselves with the start we made and we couldn't claw our way back.
"For Ian, It was one of those nights against Fife where the puck kept following him around.  We had success on our powerplay and he was a big reason for it. He definitely sparked our comeback."
The Caps may still be bottom of the Elite League table, but if their weekend was anything to go by, they'll fight tooth and nail to get themselves out of it.
They began on Saturday at Braehead Arena against Braehead Clan, who had played out a 3-3 draw in their Challenge Cup quarter final first leg against Nottingham Panthers on Thursday.
Despite Clan surging into a three-goal lead in the first five minutes through a Scott Pitt double and one from Matt Keith, Capitals settled into the game.
Jacob Johnston pulled one back with Garrett Milan adding their second to bring themselves to within one, but Clan held out to take the points in a 3-2 win.
Edinburgh returned home on Sunday to face Fife Flyers with their winless run at three and despite going behind again to the Kirkcaldy men, it turned out much better for them.
Sebastien Thinel and Russ Moyer put Fife two up before Schultz pulled one back, but the visitors restored their two-goal lead through Carlo Finucci.
Matt Tipoff struck to kick off the comeback from the home team, with Johnston levelling at 3-3 followed by Schultz's second to give them the lead.
Karel Hromas added the Capitals' fifth with a powerplay goal followed by Schultz adding his hat-trick goal to kill the Flyers off in the end.
It compounded a miserable weekend for Todd Dutiaume's side, who went to Edinburgh on the back of a 2-0 home defeat to Manchester Storm on Saturday.
Goals from Cody Cartier and Darian Dzuirzynski bookended a disappointing night for Fife as their two Gardiner Conference games ended with nothing to show for them.
Another team who suffered disappointment at the weekend was Dundee Stars, who also played two and lost two over the weekend.
They travelled to Coventry Blaze on Saturday to play a team that had won their previous two as they clawed their way out of the bottom two places in the league.
Disappointingly for the Stars, Blaze's upturn in fortune continued as they took the points in a 4-1 win at the Skydome.
Kevin Noble's opener for Coventry was cancelled out by Kevin Bruijsten, but the Blaze kicked on with further goals from Ben Davies, Ross Venus and Josh Godfrey as they scooped victory.
Clan went ahead through Matt Beca with five minutes to go of the first period, with Kyle Wharton adding a second just two minutes later.
Dundee hit back early in the second period through Felix-Antoine Poulin then Mikael Lidhammar struck twice more in the middle period to turn the game around in the Stars' favour.
Leavitt hit home two powerplay goals that sealed the victory as Braehead registered their first four point weekend since mid October.
As for Dundee, it was three defeats in a row following on from their 4-1 midweek loss to Cardiff Devils in the Challenge Cup as their form takes a downturn.
