The teenager was hit by a van while she was walking near the Merrions Close turning on Birmingham Road on Wednesday morning.
West Midlands Police said Zoe, a pupil of Q3 Academy in Great Barr, was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards.
Her mother Jo Corbett, from Malvern, confirmed Zoe was the second child she had lost in recent years.
Her son, Max Corbett-Gardener, died aged four in 2013 from complications associated with severe epilepsy.
A 42-year-old man from Walsall was arrested at the scene of the accident on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been released on bail.
PC Julie Lyman, from West Midlands Police's collisions investigations unit, said inquiries were ongoing and officers were supporting Ms Shapiro's family.
