EFL: Derby struggle, Abraham nets again - five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The nights may be drawing in and autumn is coming, but the English Football League continues to provide thrills and spills for players, managers and supporters.

Derby fans were left with a sinking feeling despite seeing the end of their goal drought at the iPro Stadium, while an England Under-19 keeps banging them in for Bristol City.
They are just two of five things you may have missed from Saturday's EFL action.
Remember that kid at school who found football insanely easy? Tammy Abraham was probably one of those people.
He scored 74 goals in 98 youth games at different levels for Chelsea and has carried on that form since joining Bristol City on loan.
The 18-year-old has taken well to life in the Championship, netting his seventh league goal of the season against Fulham on Saturday, and his 10th in 12 appearances in all competitions since moving to Ashton Gate.
His early volley against the Whites helped set the Robins on their way to a 4-0 win at Craven Cottage - and their first league win since beating Aston Villa on 27 August.
England Under-19 international Abraham is one of 38 players Chelsea have out on loan and it looks like he will be one to watch this season, as he bids to become a long-term successor to Diego Costa and Michy Batshuayi at Stamford Bridge.
If you are a fan of well-drilled free-kick and corner routines, then Queens Park Rangers might be the team for you.
The west London side are yet to score from open play in the Championship this season, with all 11 of their goals coming from set-pieces.
Centre-back Steven Caulker helped continue that trend on Saturday, heading home Tjaronn Chery's corner to give Rangers a 1-1 draw at home to Birmingham.
Even though four of their 11 league goals have come from the penalty spot, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's side give new meaning to the cliche "dangerous from set-pieces".
Derby County reached the Championship play-offs last season but former Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has not had a great start to life at the iPro Stadium.
The Rams are the lowest scorers in the whole of the EFL so far this season, having found the back of the net just three times in their first nine league games.
Striker Matej Vydra bagged Derby's first home goal of the Championship campaign to give them the lead against Blackburn, ending a goal drought of more than 425 minutes in the east Midlands.
But any joy could not have lasted long, as Rovers equalised within a minute and then Danny Graham scored the winner three minutes later to give the visitors a 2-1 victory.
Pearson's side are now 22nd in the table, just a point above bottom side Wigan.
Cheltenham manager Gary Johnson said his return to Yeovil Town on Saturday would "feel like a home game".
The 60-year-old spent seven years in charge of the Glovers over two separate spells, leading the club out of non-league in 2003 and into the Championship for the first time in their history in 2013.
Johnson spoke of his hopes of "a happy return" to Huish Park but that did not prove to be the case - the Robins were 2-0 down inside 16 minutes and trailed 3-1 at half-time.
Cheltenham rallied after the break but eventually lost 4-2, leaving them one point above the League Two relegation zone with seven points from their opening nine games of the season.
There were 14 red cards across the three divisions of the EFL on Saturday, but the dismissal of Luton's Danny Hylton must have been the strangest of them all.
He was sent off in stoppage time of the Hatters' 3-1 win at home to Doncaster for a second bookable offence.
However, Luton's Twitter account suggested referee Andy Haines might have been a bit harsh on the striker, who was dismissed after "throwing a piece of rubbish" to the side of the pitch.
The League Two club later suggested Hylton got his second yellow for his reaction after sliding into an advertising board in front of the visiting fans at Kenilworth Road.
"I'm disappointed with Danny because he showed a lack of discipline," Luton boss Nathan Jones said.
"I won't say too much as I've told him in the dressing room. He's so far in credit that we'll give him that one but we lost him [to suspension] now."
Exeter's Jordan Moore-Taylor received the quickest red card of the day, in the 24th minute at Stevenage for a pull-back on Tom Pett, but it did not hinder the Grecians as they won 2-0.
Meanwhile, Huddersfield winger Rajiv van La Parra picked up two bookings in the space of three minutes - the second for dissent - as he saw red inside 26 minutes at Reading, a match the Terriers lost 1-0 to slip off the top of the Championship.
