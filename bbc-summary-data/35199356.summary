[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ailsa Bosworth, who has been made a MBE, started the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) following her own experience of the condition.
More than 690,000 people are affected by the condition in the UK.
Others honoured in the county, include Paul Owen from Wargrave, who has been made an OBE for services to canoeing.
Mrs Bosworth started the NRAS in 2001 operating initially from her own home before moving to headquarters in Maidenhead.
She said: "I am delighted, it came totally out of the blue.
"It is really a reflection on my team. I couldn't do without their passion and support. Rheumatoid arthritis is a hidden disease and many people do not really understand it."
Elsewhere in Berkshire, Karnail Pannu, the chairman of a multi-faith forum that helps to develop community links and cultural activities has been appointed an OBE for services to the community in Windsor and Maidenhead.
Rosanna Noad, from Slough, who works as part of a Border Force team safeguarding children entering and leaving the UK has also been made an OBE for her services to child protection.
Among high-profile names receiving honours, AP McCoy, who lives just outside Lambourn, has been knighted in recognition of his racing career where he became champion jockey 20 years running.
