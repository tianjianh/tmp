There will be about 60 street parties in Wales as people celebrate the Queen's 90th birthday on the weekend of 10 June.

More than half of the applications - 30 - were made in Cardiff, some of which are for other non-related events.
Eight local authorities received no requests from residents.
In 2011, there were 200 requests for road closures so locals could celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton.
While the Queen's birthday was on 21 April, some events will officially mark the milestone this month.
Although people can still apply to hold a party on their street in most areas, Wales' councils have so far received 59 applications.
However, Ceredigion, Denbighshire, Swansea, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil councils have not received any.
Only one application has been received in Caerphilly and Carmarthenshire, while the highest number outside Cardiff is four in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wrexham, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Powys.
Flintshire was the only local authority not to answer the BBC's request for details.
