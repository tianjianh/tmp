A decision on the future of RAF Mildenhall has been "kicked into the long grass", a campaigner has said.

The United States Air Force (USAF) said in January it would leave the base by 2020, with the Ministry of Defence suggesting a decision on its future use by September.
Now the MoD has said the autumn date was "aspirational".
Former councillor John Smith said "no plan B" was in place for when the USAF leaves.
More than 4,000 US and UK nationals work at the base, with the USAF estimating it was worth $331m (Â£219M) to the local economy in 2013-14.
Since news of the closure, concerns have been raised over loss to local businesses.
Mr Smith, a former East Cambridgeshire District Councillor, said the closure was a not a local issue but a "European matter" and called for Euro MPs to fight the corner for regeneration funding.
He said: "This has been on the cards for years, and there's never been a plan B in place.
"We must not underestimate how massive this is, it's like losing an airport. We need the area re-designated on a European footing and we need funding to make the regeneration happen properly.
"The impression I get is that the MoD is kicking it [the decision] into the long grass."
A spokesman for the MoD said: "In view of the importance that local communities placed on certainty regarding the future of current US bases, the MoD agreed to attempt to come to a decision on the future of Mildenhall by September 2015.
"But this was an aspiration, given this is part of a UK-wide review of the entire defence estate to meet the needs of UK defence for years to come."
