[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dementia carer 'smothered wife and tried to kill himself'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman with dementia whose husband was her main carer was killed by him after he tried to smother her then hit her with a lamp, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Margaret Mayer, 85, of Cardiff, was found dead at the home she shared with her husband Angus, 86.
Mr Mayer climbed in front of a train in Cardiff the day her body was found in July 2016. He died seven weeks later.
The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.
The family has criticised social services after raising concerns about Mr Mayer's ability to cope with caring.
The inquest in Cardiff heard Mr Mayer climbed in front of a slow moving train at Cardiff Central railway station which was unable to stop before it hit him, badly injuring his legs.
He told police who tried to help him: "I killed my wife this morning, I smothered her. I put her out of her misery."
Mr Mayer was described as speaking in a matter-of-fact way and said he would spend the rest of his life in prison.
He later told officers he tried to smother Mrs Mayer with a pillow, but when that did not work he hit her with the brass lamp.
The inquest heard one officer was told by Mr Mayer: "My wife suffers with dementia and incontinence. She told me if I ever put her in a home she'd kill herself.
"I told her it would be quick then I'd throw myself under a train."
He was arrested on suspicion of murder but died seven weeks later.
The coroner was told the couple's six children had become increasingly concerned about the effect the caring role was having on Mr Mayer, four years after his wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
He had lost his enthusiasm for life and the things he once enjoyed, according to one daughter.
After concerns were raised by the family in February, Mrs Mayer started attending a day centre twice a week, but the week before her death, the children again contacted Cardiff council about their fears.
The council's adult services manager told the inquest there was nothing to suggest Mrs Meyer was in danger and, in hindsight, nothing would have been done differently.
The couple's sons questioned why the wider family was not contacted in early July when there were concerns, saying the council was "passive rather than proactive" in involving them.
"We don't think the system is fit for purpose," said Andrew Mayer.
