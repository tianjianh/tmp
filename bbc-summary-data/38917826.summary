The 35-year-old was reported overdue on Sunday night after leaving for a weekend trip from Portsoy in Aberdeenshire.
His kayak was found on Monday near Lybster in Caithness. A body has now been found in the Lybster area. It has still to be identified.
Mr Jackson is believed to have set off from Portsoy harbour on Saturday.
Sister Ellie said from Australia after being told the news of a body being found: "It has been quite an ordeal for everyone and we are just so thankful that we finally have an outcome even if it is not the one we have all been praying for.
"I have felt all along that Dom has been at peace with whatever outcome has befallen him and would have accepted his fate in good spirits which was his nature.
"We have taken such strength from this international community of people who have come together at such a difficult time for Dom's family and friends and all those who knew him.
"Our heartfelt thanks must go out to all the people on the ground that worked tirelessly together to look for my brother. I must also thank the thousands of well wishers and prayers from right around the world that have kept us all going through this ordeal."
Insp Kevin Goldie, of Police Scotland, said: "I can confirm that a body was discovered in the water near Lybster at around midday during air searches by the Police Scotland helicopter. Wick lifeboat was also launched to assist.
"Formal identification has yet to take place, however the family of Dominic Jackson has been updated and we are liaising closely with them."
Fettercairn man Mr Jackson was originally from Uckfield in East Sussex.
