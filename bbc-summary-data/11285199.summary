MP Glyn Davies to have heart problem treatment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new MP for Montgomeryshire is to spend time in hospital later this month to correct an irregular heartbeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conservative Glyn Davies, 66, said he would receive electric shock treatment for the complaint.
Mr Davies, who beat Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik to win the seat in May, was admitted to hospital in July with the heart problem.
The MP was last week appointed parliamentary private secretary to Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan.
Mr Davies said he had been suffering with the minor heart complaint for about a year, and the procedure to put it right was "very common".
"I've been told I'm suffering from atrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) and I understand it is similar to what Tony Blair had," said Mr Davies, who is a former assembly member.
"Later this month I'll have electric shock treatment to correct the problem.
"I was told that I'd probably been suffering with it for about 12 months. I don't know why it happened, but I understand it's the most common heart complaint and the procedure to put it right is minor."
'Great honour'
He said he spent three days in hospital in July after suffering the heart problem, which forced him to delay his maiden speech in the Commons.
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair received hospital treatment for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 and 2004.
In 2002, Mr Davies underwent surgery for bowel cancer.
Meanwhile, the MP said his appointment as Ms Gillan's parliamentary private secretary was a "great honour".
