[SN]TITLE[SN]
May ups the ante on terror

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Enough was enough, on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Tuesday night, it seems the prime minister has concluded that in terms of her message on terror, enough was not in fact enough.
In one of her last few appearances in this long campaign she has done more to outline her plan for combating terror.
As we reported on Sunday, she seems determined to push forward with some of the kinds of ideas that she put forward as home secretary.
She has confirmed tonight she'd consider longer prison sentences for terror offences, more stringent rules on deporting those who espouse terror, and new controls on those who are seen as a potential threat even if there is not evidence to take them to court.
Sources suggest if elected on Friday, Theresa May might consider ideas of curfews, controls on who people can visit and suspects' access to communications.
More controversially, she made it plain tonight that if that means the government would have to change the laws on human rights, she is prepared to do so.
Labour has immediately cried foul, claiming another manifesto U-turn, at almost the last minute of the campaign.
Tory sources deny that flatly, saying they would not pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights but instead, seek fresh derogations - essentially legal opt-outs.
Theresa May's team say she is not, at this late stage, making up last-minute policy, but that the terror risk has changed so fast since the start of the election, that she wanted to make clear that if re-elected she is prepared to toughen the law.
She's already accused tonight by the Lib Dems of indulging in an "arms race" on terror legislation in the wake of attacks.
The actual detail of any new policy is a long way off.
But politically, the Tories will know on Friday morning if tonight's political move  was worth it.
