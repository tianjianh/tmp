[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hassan Mohammed, from Camberwell in south London, was stabbed twice in an attack in Southend on 7 July last year.
Tajwar Alam, 19, of Seaford Road in Tottenham, north London, denied murder but was convicted by a majority verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Mr Mohammed died at Southend Hospital the day after he was stabbed. Alam will be sentenced on 19 June.
Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett said: "This was an incident that resulted in the needless death of a young man.
"The defendant, who has never shown any remorse, will have plenty of time to reflect on his actions in prison.
"This is now an opportunity for Hassan's family to try and move on with their lives."
Mr Mohammed's family said: "Not only was Hassan a loving partner, son, brother, grandson, nephew and uncle, he was a friend to so many people in the community.
"Nothing has been the same since he died. So many hearts have been broken and we as a family still grieve for his loss.
"The neighbourhood also remains in shock at his passing.
"It has been very difficult for us to attend court every day to listen to the distressing details of what happened to him.
"All we have wanted is for justice to be served on behalf of Hassan."
Five other men who were charged in connection with Mr Mohammed's murder were acquitted and formally dismissed during the trial. They will face no further action.
