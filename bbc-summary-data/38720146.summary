The 19-year-old agreed a three-year deal at London Stadium last summer after joining the Hammers from Spanish La Liga side Valencia.
The Spain Under-17 international is yet to make his senior debut for the Premier League club, but has featured regularly for their development side.
"He has a terrific scoring record," U's head coach Michael Appleton said.
Martinez is available to play in the FA Cup for the League One side, but is ineligible for the EFL Trophy.
