The 43-year-old has signed a deal until the end of the season.
Makelele reunites with new boss Paul Clement, who he worked with as a player for Chelsea from 2007-2008, and as a coach with Paris St-Germain under manager Carlo Ancelotti.
"I am really excited to be here and I am happy to start working at Swansea," Makelele said.
"Paul is my mentor. He has taught me a lot of things in my time working with him.
"When I heard he was back working in the Premier League, I phoned him and asked if I could help him at Swansea."
Makelele will be in the dug-out for the Swans' Premier League fixture with Arsenal on Saturday at 15:00 GMT.
"Paul has given me the opportunity to come back to the Premier League, and I'm very grateful because I've really missed it," he said.
"I know him very well and he knows me too. I think I have a lot to give, and hopefully I can help Paul and Swansea."
Capped 71 times by France, Makelele won the league title in three different countries as a player and was on losing side in the 2006 World Cup final.
He made over 800 appearances during his domestic career, winning 15 trophies including two Premier League titles with Chelsea and the Champions League with Real Madrid in 2002.
After retiring, Makelele was appointed coach at PSG. He then spent just under six months in charge of Bastia before taking up a technical director role with Monaco.
Makelele will work alongside Clement's fellow new recruits Nigel Gibbs and Karl Halabi who joined from Tottenham Hotspur.
