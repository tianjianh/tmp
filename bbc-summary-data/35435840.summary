[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Japanese shares fell on Friday on fresh economic data pointing to concerns over inflation and exports.

The country's industrial output dropped by 1.4% in December from the previous month - weaker than estimates had suggested.
It was the second month of decline, underscoring that flagging external as well as domestic demand was weighing on Japan's economy.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% to 16,931.1 points.
Other figures out on Friday showed the 2015 inflation rate at 0.5% - far below the central bank's 2% target.
The disappointing numbers highlight Tokyo's challenge in tackling years of deflation and weak growth with prime minister Shinzo Abe's "Abenomics" reform programme.
The data is expected to put more pressure on the central bank to launch further monetary easing to help the economy and raise inflation.
Markets in Asia received a positive lead from Wall Street, which closed higher as oil prices strengthened for a third consecutive day.
Yet only Chinese traders reflected some of that sentiment, with the Shanghai Composite up by 0.8% to 2,677 points, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5% to 19,282.5 points.
In Australia, the ASX 200 remained flat at 4,980 points but commodity stocks enjoyed solid gains.
Mining heavyweights BHP Billiton for instance saw its shares up by 1.6%, while oil company Santos rose by 3.9%.
In Korea, the Kospi index failed to pick up the positive notes and fell 0.7% to 1,893 points.
