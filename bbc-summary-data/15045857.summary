Rugby World Cup 2011: Fiji 0-66 Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales secured a World Cup quarter-final clash against Ireland with an emphatic win over Fiji in Hamilton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warren Gatland's side secured the bonus point by half-time through tries by Jamie Roberts, Scott Williams, George North and Sam Warburton.
Roberts went over again after the break with Lloyd Burns, Leigh Halfpenny, Lloyd Williams and Jonathan Davies following him.
Rhys Priestland and Stephen Jones converted all the tries between them.
After Wales saw off Fiji, Ireland beat Italy 36-6 to book their date with Wales, on Saturday 8 October in Wellington.
Wales' scrum was on top throughout against the islanders and Priestland marshalled their attack with poise before veteran 10 Jones entered the fray in the latter stages.
There were also accomplished performances from skipper Warburton and back-row colleagues Ryan Jones and Toby Faletau while centres Roberts and Williams posed major problems for Fiji's defence.
However, teenager North's powerful running and footballing skills again marked him out as a special talent.
Wales gained due revenge having been knocked out of the 2007 World Cup by Fiji in Nantes.
Wales began their Pool D campaign with a 17-16 defeat by South Africa before seeing off Samoa's stern challenge 17-10 and drubbing Namibia 81-7.
While this win was comfortable, their line-out remained a concern, although Fiji were rarely able to take advantage of the sloppiness.
Skipper Warburton rescued his side on several first-half occasions at that phase and was even able to launch try-scoring moves in the process.
The Cardiff Blues flanker played his part in Wales' opening try after six minutes by team-mate Roberts, whose dummy and sidestep sent him through an over-eager Fiji defence for Priestland to convert.
Fiji fly-half Nicky Little, who counts Pontypridd among his former clubs, failed with a penalty attempt.
And Wales produced some wonderful interplay as Priestland, Lee Byrne and North combined to send Scott Williams over, the Scarlets centre finishing with a flourish as he stepped inside and out to break clear.
Priestland converted and added a penalty before Wales' next touchdown.
Roberts this time played the role of provider, starting the assault in which hooker Huw Bennett and number eight Toby Faletau appeared before North finished it off, Priestland converting.
Hooker Bennett was the first of Wales' starters to make way, Burns replacing him in the 36th minute.
Three minutes later North charged on to Warburton's pass from a line-out before sending his captain clear, securing the bonus point in the process.
Lock Bradley Davies, who had taken a heavy knock in the opening period, was replaced by Alun Wyn Jones at half-time.
Wales' dominance continued after the break with more fine attacking play in which Priestland was twice instrumental, along with North's selflessness in sending Roberts over for his second when the wing could have scored.
Even amid the worsening conditions, Wales' momentum was unaffected.
Replacement Burns then drove over from a close-range line-out for his first Wales try.
Halfpenny was next, profiting from prop Gethin Jenkins' long clearance kick.

Scrum-half replacement Lloyd Williams' arcing run from a dominant Welsh scrum brought the penultimate score.
