Clandon Park House: Inside fire-hit mansion

Members of the public will be able to catch a glimpse of a stately home for the first time since it was destroyed by a devastating fire.

Clandon Park House, near Guildford, was gutted by the blaze in April, and work is due to start on an "epic" restoration project expected to take several years.
The first of six public open days will be held on Saturday, but the BBC was granted early access to the mansion's grounds.
"It is an extraordinary sight," said general manager Alex Bush.
"It is a largely empty building - a haunting sight."
She said the first sight of the house would have quite an impact on visitors who had been before the fire and toured the Palladian mansion, with its stucco ceilings, Marble Hall and collection of 18th Century furniture and porcelain.
"We have made sure the gardens have plenty of places where people can sit and reflect on what they are seeing," said Ms Bush.
"It is very sad to see a building in this state."
Since the fire in April, conservation work has been geared to protecting and salvaging as much of what is left as possible.
Cranes have nearly finished removing beams and other debris through the roof space and archaeologists are working on the debris at ground level.
"The exterior of the building is now structurally sound but inside it is quite a different story and that is why the work has been so painstaking over the last few months," said Ms Bush.
At first, walking through the entrance, my view was blocked by trees and plants but as I came round a corner I saw the house for the first time.
It is hard to get across the experience of seeing the shell of Clandon Park House up close.
It brought home the impact of the fire and the scale of the devastation.
The site was bustling and building work was very much taking place. But when the public arrives the work will stop, and I can't help thinking it will become a more sombre and reflective place.
Visitors on the open days, which start on Saturday, will be able to get within 30ft (10m) of the building and also see exhibitions about the house.
"We are hopeful the building can be rebuilt but we are looking at several years of work," said Ms Bush.
