[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Brazil say they want prosecutors to charge disgraced US swimmer Ryan Lochte over his made up claim to have been robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Olympics.

A police spokesperson said his case had been referred to the courts, which have summoned Mr Lochte to give testimony.
The US State Department said it was aware of the request.
Mr Lochte flew out of Brazil after the Games before he could be questioned about the alleged false claim.

He has since apologised for making up what he called an exaggerated story about being robbed.
CCTV footage contradicted his claim, showing Mr Lochte and three other US swimmers had vandalised a petrol station after partying.
Police spokesman Clemente Braune told Brazil's Globo (in Portuguese) that Mr Lochte would have to attend the hearing before a judge or be tried in absentia.
The penalty for a false crime report was between one and six months in jail, he said.
However, it is understood that if Mr Lochte did attend the hearing he could agree to pay a fine like fellow swimmer Jimmy Feigen, who was with him during the incident.
Mr Feigen agreed to donate nearly $11,000 (Â£8,300) to a Brazilian charity to resolve the case.
All four of Mr Lochte's main corporate sponsors have cut ties with the swimmer, putting his professional future in doubt.
