England forwards coach Steve Borthwick says it would be a "huge honour" to be involved with the British and Irish Lions next summer.

Borthwick is believed to have been approached by Lions boss Warren Gatland about a role on the coaching staff for the tour of New Zealand.
"For any coach it would be a huge honour," ex-England captain Borthwick told BBC 5 live.
"But right now my focus is solely on England v Argentina this Saturday."
Borthwick, who won 57 caps for England during his playing career, retired in 2014 to join the Japan coaching team under current England coach Eddie Jones.
He then moved to Bristol following the Rugby World Cup, but was quickly recruited by the RFU to join Jones' staff.
Borthwick has masterminded England's forward effort this year, with the team on a run of 11 consecutive wins in 2016.
"It would be an honour if I was asked to be involved [with the Lions]. It would then be something I would discuss with Eddie," Borthwick added.
Jones and RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie have already confirmed that any coach approached by the Lions would go with their blessing.
Meanwhile, Borthwick thinks Saracens lock George Kruis is ready to play Test rugby again after his ankle injury.
Kruis missed England's first two autumn Tests following surgery, but has joined up with the squad ahead of the match with the Pumas.
"He has worked so hard to get back from injury so quickly," Borthwick said.
"He is a top quality player. What's great is we have competition for places [in the second row]."
