[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marvin Douglas, 33, of Milton Keynes, was jailed for nine years and nine months at St Albans Crown Court for conspiracy to supply cocaine.
He had led a gang selling drugs across Bedfordshire, London and the Home Counties.
When arrested, he was on licence from jail after a drugs conviction in 2010.
Crack cocaine with a street value of up to £32,000 and £20,000 in cash were found in his Volkswagen Scirocco car on 23 September last year.
He had tried to break free as police cars surrounded his vehicle but rammed into two police vehicles, flipping the car onto its roof.
Another leading member of the gang, Lee Dixon, 31, was caught with cash and cocaine when arrested at his home in Williamson Road, Kempston, on 15 October last year.
He was jailed at St Albans Crown Court for six years and six months.
Dixon and Douglas had been linked through forensics and phone records to Robert Willoughby, 45, arrested at a drugs "safe house" in Harlinger Street, Woolwich, on 5 March, last year, police said.
National Crime Agency (NCA) officers seized a substantial amount of cocaine and £19,740 during that arrest. Willoughby was jailed for 14 years.
Forensics also linked the men with Kimberley Oyewole, 35, who was arrested at house in Bethwin Road, Southwark, south London, on 20 November.
Officers discovered cocaine and heroin with a street value of more than £3,000 and £4,835 cash. He will be sentenced later.
Douglas, Dixon and Oyewole all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine between 1 February 2014 and 21 November 2014.
Det Insp Paul Baron said: "Douglas is a prolific drug dealer who has persistently continued his criminality despite being previously arrested and even jailed.
"These people were involved in the supply and distribution of a large amount of class A drugs."
