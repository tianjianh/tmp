[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 1-1 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford City drew for the fourth straight league match against Bristol Rovers in a game that was held up in the second half by a flying drone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Charlie Colkett capitalised on a slip by Bradford defender Romain Vincelot to level in the 86th minute after James Meredith had headed the home side into a 73rd-minute lead.
Referee Andy Haines had earlier halted play in the 65th minute with the game goalless and led the players from the pitch for their own safety as the drone hovered over the stadium.
Haines brought the players back out after a three-minute delay and the match resumed before Meredith headed home with Rovers goalkeeper Kelle Roos wrong-footed following Mark Marshall's deflected shot.
But Colkett, a 78th-minute replacement for midfielder Billy Bodin, pounced to drill the ball home after Vincelot had slipped inside the penalty area with four minutes remaining.
Rovers' leading scorer Matty Taylor went closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half, while Roos ensured a share of the spoils when he pulled off a fine save to keep out Bradford substitute Haris Vuckic's header deep in time added on.
