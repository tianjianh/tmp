They became Australia's most-wanted fugitives as they repeatedly eluded police by moving at night and using their extensive knowledge of the land.

But Gino Stocco, 59, and his son Mark Stocco, 37, will now spend up to 40 years in jail for their crimes including the murder of a man.
The pair had evaded police for years before they shot Rosario Cimone in 2015, triggering events that led to their high-profile capture weeks later.
The two men were sentenced on Friday.
"They've shown no remorse, as if their actions mean nothing to them," said Mr Cimone's daughter, Maria Perre, after the sentencing in Sydney.
"We hope that the horror of what they've done and the pain they've inflicted will stay with them. The irony is, they still have each other."
The pair had spent eight years on the run from police for a range of alleged crimes - moving between jobs on rural properties - before killing Mr Cimone.
Their probable motive was fear of being evicted from a property Mr Cimone tended, the court was previously told.
Eight days after dumping his body in scrubland, the pair shot at police with a high-powered rifle during a car pursuit in Wagga Wagga in New South Wales (NSW).
The confrontation happened when police detected their car had stolen number plates.
The manhunt then moved to northern Victoria after the pair were spotted driving past a police surveillance point.
After a fortnight of nationwide media attention, the men were finally captured at a rural property at Dunedoo in central NSW.
They pleaded guilty to murdering Mr Cimone, shooting at police to avoid arrest, and destroying property.
Gino Stocco was handed a non-parole period of 28 years, while Mark Stocco will be eligible for parole in 30 years.
