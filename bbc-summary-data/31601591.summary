Fifty Shades of Trouble: Will there be more films?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Fifty Shades phenomenon obviously started with the three books by EL James, which have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide.

Since then, a movie has been made and it took Â£54.5m on its opening weekend.
But even before its release, rumours of rifts, unhappy wives, a lack of chemistry and creative head butting have dogged the production.
So, with fifty shades of drama, will films two and three happen? Newsbeat examined the rumour mill.
So if you believe what you read on the internet, Jamie Dornan will not be reprising his role as BDSM-loving Christian Grey for the next two portions of the franchise.
This appears to have come from an article with Australian NW magazine where an insider is quoted as saying, "Jamie said the movie would skyrocket his career."He tried to assure Amelia nothing would change but women all over the world now lust after Jamie. "She hasn't seen the film and I don't think she will to be honest."
His publicist told Newsbeat: "All press reports are pure conjecture as the studio have not committed to a sequel as yet."
There was a rumour about a lack of chemistry between Jamie Dornan and his co-star Dakota Johnson on set. In fact, according to another magazine, this time Us magazine, an insider told it that scenes had to be re-shot, because they weren't "passionate" enough.
Maybe it was down to the knowledge that the books have a huge fan base. During an interview at the premiere, when asked whether he was nervous about how fans would react to the film, Jamie told the BBC: "Maybe a little. We are totally aware of how many people have read the book, a hundred million people.
"That's a lot of people who already have a built in opinion of what you're trying to do."
According to an interview with Vanity Fair magazine, Sam Taylor Johnson is quoted as saying "We battled all the way through. She'd say the same. There were tough times and revelatory times. There were sparring contests. It was definitely not an easy process."
And it's because of that rift that Sam is reportedly not taking part in the next movie, Fifty Shades Darker.
And on the grey carpet of the premiere, Sam confirmed that they were both "creative heads".
Sam told the BBC at the premiere of Fifty Shades that nothing had been set in stone with regard to a sequel.
As if the reported drama with Sam and EL wasn't enough, apparently the scriptwriter, Kelly Marcel, has quit too.
EL James admitted at the premiere that she has been trying to write "about all of this", but didn't confirm whether it was a fourth book or the screenplay of Fifty Shades Darker.
Despite becoming the most successful 18-rated film in UK history, the film got some very mixed reviews, including being dubbed "better than the book".
EL, Sam and Jamie were all in agreement, the film would get that very reaction, because the book did.
"It divides opinion, the books divide opinion. A lot of slightly snobbier people have an opinion on it and without seeing it," Jamie added.
