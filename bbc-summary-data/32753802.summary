Joanna Parrish, 20, from Newnham-on-Severn, was killed whilst on a university placement in May 1990.
Nobody has ever been convicted of her murder and the case is still open.
On the 25th anniversary of her death her parents have called for a convicted serial killer to be re-interviewed about the case.
Ms Parrish's parents, Roger Parrish and Pauline Murrell, said they had been "frustrated" by the lack of movement in the case.
Mr Parrish said: "Twenty five years is a significant time and we want to push as hard as we can for justice for Jo this year, particularly."
Ms Murrell said she felt they had been "let down" by the French authorities.
"It just makes me angry. They can't be bothered with us," she said.
Ms Parrish was found raped and strangled in a river in Auxerre on 17 May 1990 after being abducted.
The chief suspects in the case were convicted serial killers Michel Fourniret and his wife Monique Olivier.
Olivier previously confessed to the murder of a woman in the Auxerre area at the time, but later retracted her story.
The family has now made a formal request to French magistrates for her to be re-interviewed and for Gloucestershire Police to help with the interview.
Ms Parrish's brother, Barney Parrish, has set up an online petition calling for help and support.
"My parents have been struggling since I was 17 for justice for my sister," he said.
"It's about time they no longer struggled, and got some support from people that can make things happen."
