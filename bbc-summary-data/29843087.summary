Yep, it's called Croatia Rocks.
The festival will take place on party beach, Zrce, from 20- 23 July 2015.
Radio 1's Zane Lowe, who is Ibiza Rocks' music director, said: "We're looking forward to playing in Croatia next year, as the Rocks family continues to find new audiences in new places."
Croatia Rocks is the latest in a wave of music festivals springing up in the country with Hideout, Outlook and Garden festivals taking place there over the past decade.
Organisers say the event will "bring something new to Zrce, with a combination of established live acts and DJs plus genuinely exciting new artists and producers".
As well as the main stage performances, club partners from the UK and Ibiza will join a line-up of "Balearic fused beach and boat parties".
Shane Murray, Brand Director, Ibiza Rocks said: "This is a genuinely exciting move for Ibiza Rocks and marks a significant new chapter in our story as we reach 10.
"Croatia has clearly evolved from an emerging to an established music destination and it's long been a wish of ours to bring the spirit of Ibiza Rocks to the beach."
The 1975, Haim and John Newman were among the acts to perform at Ibiza Rock 2014.
Tickets for Croatia Rocks will go on sale on 28 November, with the line-up being announced nearer the event.
