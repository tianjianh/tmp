BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood was "upstaged" on live television when a dog relieved itself during a broadcast.

The meteorologist was broadcasting from West Wittering beach, in West Sussex, when a dog called Connie, who belongs to a BBC producer, crept into shot.
Connie then began to urinate, with the shallow water lapping at her heels.
Spotting the dog as it sauntered off, Kirkwood said: "Upstaged by a dog, it's the story of my life."
BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin had spotted the dog in the background, and said: "Oh Carol, don't look behind you!"
Co-host Charlie Stayt added: "Don't turn round!"
The BBC Breakfast Twitter feed later carried an image of the dog with the message: "Someone's looking a bit guilty..."
It added: "Soooo... that was awkward. Rest assured: our sources tell us it was a number one."
