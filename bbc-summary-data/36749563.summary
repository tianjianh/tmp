[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man to stand trial accused of series of rapes and attacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is to stand trial accused of a series of rapes and sex attacks dating back to 1980.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian McTaggart is accused of a catalogue of rapes and assaults in Dundee, including an allegation that he attacked a pregnant woman and caused her to have a miscarriage.
The 52-year-old, of no fixed abode, made no plea or declaration to the 18 charges at Dundee Sheriff Court.
A hearing on whether he will be granted bail is to be held at the High Court.
Mr McTaggart is accused of having 11 different victims over the duration of the offences, and is also accused of setting fires at three separate addresses in Edinburgh in the past year.
One charge alleges that in 1983 he attacked one alleged victim at addresses across Dundee, kicking her down a flight of stairs and kicking and punching her in the ribs and back while she was pregnant, causing her to have a miscarriage.
He is also accused of driving a car at the woman in an attempt to run her over, and in another incident holding a hairdryer over a bath full of water, threatening to drop it in.
Sheriff Alastair Brown committed Mr McTaggart for trial and granted him bail, but this was opposed by the Crown. A bail appeal will be heard at the High Court.
