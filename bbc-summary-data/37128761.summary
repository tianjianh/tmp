The mayor of London says he wants a victory parade to be held in the city to celebrate the achievements of Team GB's Olympians and Paralympians.

Sadiq Khan told the BBC: "I'm keen for it to happen."
But he said he needed to speak to the government to find "the best way" to mark the athletes' achievements in Rio de Janeiro.
A Downing Street spokesman said the government would set out its plans for a celebration in due course.
"We want to make sure that the fantastic achievements of our Olympic heroes are properly recognised and we are working on plans to celebrate their success," he said.
Team GB is currently ranked second in the Rio 2016 medals table, with 56 in total - including 22 gold.
London has hosted victory parades for returning Olympic and Paralympic athletes since the 2004 Athens Games.
But four-time Olympic gold medal winner Sir Matthew Pinsent has raised doubts as to whether a parade will happen.
He tweeted: "Heard from 2 different sources today that there won't be a @TeamGB parade this year."
Meanwhile, there are calls for the parade to be held outside the capital.
On Thursday, former Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme "there should certainly be a parade", but it was a question of where to have it.
"We don't necessarily want to insist that every moment of national celebration is held in London. What about Birmingham? What about Manchester? Hull will be the city of culture," she said.
Former Labour Sports Minister Richard Caborn told the Daily Mail: "It should not just be another big event in London for the tourists - why shouldn't it be in Sheffield, or in Leeds?"
Smaller parades are expected to be held for individual athletes in their home towns.
The town council in Stone, Staffordshire, has said it will hold a parade for K1 slalom gold medallist Joe Clarke, 23, who will be hoisted aloft in his kayak on 29 August.
