Jamie Murphy, 18, arrived at Perth Airport with his mother and father late on Thursday.
The talented football player was detained for two nights in Kuta this week after being found with a small bag of white powder at a nightclub.
Police suspected it was cocaine but forensic tests revealed the powder did not contain illegal drugs.
Indonesian authorities also confirmed no drugs were detected in Mr Murphy's blood or urine.
Many young Australians travel abroad at this time of year, as part of high school graduation celebrations known as "schoolies".
Kuta police chief Wayan Sumara said Mr Murphy was "very lucky" after the drug tests came back negative.
He had faced the possibility of 12 years in jail and a fine of A$800,000  (Â£500,000, $600,000).
Lawyers for Mr Murphy denied police claims he had admitted buying the white powder.
Australian media broadcast footage showing Mr Murphy, with his eyes closed, being restrained around the head by a nightclub security guard.
The Sky Garden nightclub initially said the guard was "ordered" to hold the teenager's face so police could take his photo. It has since issued apologised for using "excessive force".
Indonesia has some of the world's toughest drug laws, sometimes causing diplomatic tensions with Australia.
Two Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in Indonesia last year for drug offences.
They were among a group of Australians dubbed the Bali Nine who travelled to Indonesia in 2005 hoping to bring 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin back to Australia.
A Queensland beauty student, Schapelle Corby, was convicted in 2005 of trying to smuggle marijuana into Bali.
Corby is reportedly due to be deported from Indonesia on May 27, 2017.
