The only road leading to Great Western beach in Newquay was closed in February 2015 but will finally reopen on Thursday in time for Easter.
During the work it became clear the sheer cliff face needed to be secured and abseilers were brought in.
Cornwall Council said the "extremely challenging" work cost between £600,000 and £700,000.
