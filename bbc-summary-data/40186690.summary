[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid's Luka Modric and Liverpool's Dejan Lovren are expected to be witnesses at a corruption trial in their native Croatia, reports AFP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trial involves former officials from their ex-club Dinamo Zagreb but neither player is suspected of wrongdoing.
Modric, 31, is expected to testify on his 2008 move from Dinamo to Tottenham.
Lovren, 27, is set to be questioned over his transfer from the club to French side Lyon in 2010.
Midfielder Modric has since joined Real Madrid, while centre-back Lovren moved to Southampton before joining Liverpool.
The trial against former Dinamo chief Zdravko Mamic and three other people - his brother and former Dinamo Zagreb coach Zoran Mamic, former club director Damir Vrbanovic and a tax inspector - opened in April.
All the suspects pleaded not guilty.
