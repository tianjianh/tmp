[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners calling for a public inquiry into the 1984 Battle of Orgreave disorder have been told a decision will be made by the end of October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of miners and police clashed at the South Yorkshire coking site.
Campaigners met with Home Secretary Amber Rudd to renew calls for a probe into police handling of the event.
It comes after an ex-PC told Channel 4 officers were told to write statements for arrests they had not made.
He said: "I knew in my own mind that was wrong."
A delegation from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC), which met with the Home Secretary, said they were feeling "positive" after the meeting.
The so-called Battle of Orgreave saw miners attempt to stop lorry loads of coke leaving for the steel works, with police holding them back.
About 6,000 officers are alleged to have used excessive force to suppress the miners' strike at the plant.
What was the 'Battle of Orgreave'?
Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham, who was also in attendance, said it was an "encouraging meeting" and he hopes a decision will be made to "shine a spotlight on our country's past".
Former miner Kevin Horne said: "I think we have reached another milestone. There's still a way to go, but we're getting there."
Earlier, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other MPs gathered for a demonstration outside Parliament to lend their support.
Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner, who was at Orgreave, said: "The police at Orgreave were called upon to write the same thing over and over again about every single miner they arrested."
A total of 95 miners were charged following the clashes but their trial collapsed.
