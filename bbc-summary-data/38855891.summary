The 23-year-old striker has scored once in 10 games since signing for the League Two club, but has been sidelined with a groin injury since September.
Southwell is able to play in the Imps' FA Cup fifth round tie at Burnley on 18 February.
"He needs to get minutes under his belt to get his sharpness back," Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth said.
"He remains a big part of my plans and we look forward to welcoming him back in a month's time, when he'll be able to offer real tough competition in our attack," he told the club website.
