The company said the proposals have the potential to create more than 400 jobs.
A Peterhead Travelodge opened on Wednesday, with further hotels expected in Inverness and Stirling by the end of this year.
Travelodge chiefs said Scotland remains a key growth area and it was looking for 21 new hotel sites across the country.
Target locations include Ardrossan in North Ayrshire; Aviemore in the Highlands; Galashiels in the Borders; Kirkwall on Orkney; Lerwick on Shetland; Loch Lomond; Montrose in Angus; Oban in Argyll and Bute; and Pitlochry in Perthshire.
The firm is also looking to double its portfolio of hotels in Glasgow with a further five locations.
Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman, said: "The value hotel market continues to go from strength to strength in Scotland boosted by cost-conscious businesses looking to reduce travel costs and by the growth in independent leisure travel.
"To meet this growing demand in addition to opening in Peterhead today, Travelodge will be opening new hotels in Inverness and Stirling later this year.
"This is just the start, we are on a journey to become Britain's favourite hotel for value and we have identified 21 locations across Scotland where we can bring good quality accommodation at a great value price."
