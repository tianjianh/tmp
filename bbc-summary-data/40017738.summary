[SN]TITLE[SN]
Administrators called in to law firm Hamilton Burns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Administrators have been called in following the collapse of a Glasgow law firm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two lawyers and seven administrative staff at Hamilton Burns have been made redundant.
A further four directors and three trainees are being transferred to two separate law firms, according to administrators from FRP Advisory.
Hamilton Burns, which was formed in 2001, specialised in criminal, civil, immigration and matrimonial law.
Joint administrator Tom MacLennan said: "Hamilton Burns WS Limited had been severely affected by a marked reduction in legal aid income and a significant decline in general practice fee income.
"The firm also had very high levels of historic debt which, together with the fall in income, led to unsustainable pressures on cash flow.
"Every effort had been made to find a solution for the firm, however it became clear that administration was the only option."
He added: "We are pleased to have negotiated agreements for the transfer of seven staff, client files and work in progress.
"It is with great regret that the remaining nine staff have been made redundant, for whom we will provide as much support as possible."
