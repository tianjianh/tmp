Swansea City: Sigurdsson does not get credit he deserves - Clement

Swansea boss Paul Clement says Gylfi Sigurdsson does not get the credit he deserves because he plays for a side at the wrong end of the table.

Sigurdsson has scored nine and created 11 goals this season in the Premier League alone, but the Swans are 17th.
"That's probably because of the position of the team," Clement said, when asked why Sigurdsson is not recognised as a top bracket player.
"When teams are lower in the table, the players don't get that recognition."
Sigurdsson's Iceland, who stunned England by eliminating them at Euro 2016, face the Republic of Ireland in a friendly, as they bid to qualify for the World Cup from a tough group also containing Croatia, Ukraine and Turkey.
Clement says Sigurdsson, who is already being linked with a summer move away from Liberty Stadium, works tremendously hard to hone his craft.
Swansea revealed that they turned down bids for Sigurdsson in the January transfer window.
"He is a player that's done really, really well," Clement said.
"It's no surprise. He has ability but goodness, does that player work.
"Every day in training, pushing, extra stuff to work on his technique, his finishing, set plays. He is really alert and attentive in the video meetings, (takes) good care of his body, (he is a) very good professional."
