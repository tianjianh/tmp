Bid to clear Himalayan balsam from mid Wales rivers showing success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to get rid of an invasive weed from three rivers in mid Wales has shown "real signs of success", according to an environment body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the Ystwyth Valley in Ceredigion has been largely cleared of Himalayan balsam right down to Llanilar.
Work has also been carried out from the Rheidol down to Aberffrwd and the Teifi down to Lampeter.
NRW said the work would safeguard "key habitats and wildlife".
Himalayan balsam can spread quickly, affecting wildlife and eroding river banks.
Clearance work on the upper Ystwyth has been carried out since 2009 and on the upper Rheidol and Teifi since 2013.
