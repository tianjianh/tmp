A series of images has captured the progress being made on a multi-million pound new hospital development in Dumfries.

The complex, once completed, will house 350 beds, a heli-pad and 980 parking spaces.
Work officially started on the project with a sod-cutting ceremony in June last year.
Justine Laurie, who works with the new hospital team, has posted a number of images showing the scheme's progress.
It is hoped the hospital on farmland off the Garroch roundabout will open late next year to replace the current Dumfries Infirmary on the town's Bankend Road.
