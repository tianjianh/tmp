James Thorpe, 28, and Michaela Watson, from Boston, were due to marry this Friday but cancelled the ceremony after Mr Thorpe broke his neck.
He was left paralysed from the chest down after falling in the sea in Magaluf earlier this month
Miss Watson said: "It needs to be perfect and it wouldn't have been".

She told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: "I knew deep down that the day would not go ahead, but I didn't want to take that drive away from James.
"I thought it would not be fair on him or me because we saved so hard."
Mr Thorpe is being treated at Sheffield Spinal Injuries Unit after being flown home from the Spanish holiday resort.
A crowd-funding page to help with his recovery has so far raised more than ??12,000.
Miss Watson said the support had been "humbling" and Mr Thorpe was determined to walk again.
"It would be amazing if James could walk down the aisle," she said.
"That's what we're praying for and that's what we're aiming for."
