Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Hemsby, was found dead on the island of Koh Tao on 15 September last year along with David Miller, 24, from Jersey.
Two Burmese men are on trial for their murders. They deny any involvement.
Miss Witheridge's family said learning of her death had been an "indescribably impossible time".
"Our beautiful Hannah was taken from us in the most horrific way possible," they said in a statement.
"Losing someone you love is always difficult but losing someone so senselessly and unexpectedly, at such an early stage of their life, makes for an indescribably impossible time.
"Along with her bubbly and exciting personality, Hannah was extremely intelligent and after earning a degree with first class honours from the University of East Anglia, was working towards a masters degree in speech and language therapy in Essex.
"She would have gone on to make a significant difference to the lives of many people."
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, who are both 22, initially confessed to the killings but later retracted their statements, saying they had been tortured.
Prosecutors say the men are linked to the killings by DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims.
