Rory McIlroy shot a six-under-par 66 to move into contention after two rounds of the Memorial Tournament in Ohio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Irishman sank eight birdies to improve his score to seven under, level with world number one Jason Day (71) and five off the lead.
World number two Jordan Spieth is one further back after a four-under 68.
Fellow Americans Brendan Steele and Matt Kuchar are tied for first as overnight leader Dustin Johnson in nine under after a one-under-par 71.
Luke Donald made the cut despite hitting a 73 to drop back to four under at Muirfield Village and Scotland's Russell Knox will also play the weekend action after reaching halfway at two under par but Paul Casey is heading home after a five-over 77 left him three over par.
