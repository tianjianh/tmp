It has taken just over three years to build the facility in Iskandar, Joho, and will house to about 3,000 students.
The campus is made up of two buildings, centred around an atrium known as the 'Heartspace' - a space where students can relax.
Spokesman Trevor Hawkins said the campus would promote research and economic growth in Malaysia.
It joins the University of Southampton, which opened a campus on the same site in 2013.
The opening ceremony was attended by businessman and co-chairman of Reading F.C, Sir Jon Madjeski.
