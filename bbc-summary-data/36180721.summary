Tony McMahon's shot deflected into the path of Lee Evans, who superbly volleyed in left-footed from 25 yards.
Chesterfield were reduced to 10 men when Sam Hird brought down Jamie Proctor as the Bradford striker bore down on goal.
Proctor then found Billy Clarke in the six-yard area, and the Irish striker calmly slotted in to double the lead.
Bradford will face Millwall in the play-off semi-finals, with the Lions scoring a dramatic last-minute penalty at Gillingham to secure second-leg home advantage.
Chesterfield finished 18th, seven points clear of the relegation zone.
