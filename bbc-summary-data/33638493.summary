Thailand murder trial: Police say more DNA tests possible

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DNA evidence could still be re-tested in the case of two British tourists murdered in Thailand, a police forensic expert has told a court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk were found dead at a beach on the island of Koh Tao last September.
Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, both 22, deny killing the pair.
Lawyers for the two men have asked the court to allow the DNA to be re-tested.
The lack of eyewitness accounts has meant DNA profiling has become the most important evidence in the trial.
Earlier this month the Thai police said all the DNA material had been used up in the original testing.
The trial has also heard from the first police officer to reach the scene.
In his evidence he described how the bodies, mostly unclothed, were found a few metres apart.
The defendants, who also deny rape and robbery, were arrested several weeks after the bodies were found.
They are said to have confessed to the crime shortly after the killings but have since retracted their statements.
The investigation has been widely criticised amid allegations of police incompetence and officers from the UK were called in to assist with the case.
The trial is expected to last until October.
