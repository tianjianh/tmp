The FA has asked all clubs in the Women's Super League and Premier League to mark her death at their matches.
The Fylde Ladies midfielder, 18, and former Everton player died at West Allerton station in Merseyside on Tuesday.
British Transport Police has said there were no suspicious circumstances.
Tributes have poured in from across the world of football for Ms Tynan who her family said "was never happier than when she had a ball at her feet".
Close friend and former Everton Ladies team-mate Natalie Clark tweeted she was "absolutely heartbroken and devastated".
Floral tributes and scarves from her first club Liverpool Feds, which she joined aged six, were laid at the train station.
Ms Tynan spent five years at Everton Ladies from the age of 12.
Fylde Ladies manager Luke Swindlehurst told the BBC: "She was just a really likeable character.
"From day one, all the girls fell in love with her. It's a huge tragedy. She loved to play football.
"She was hugely gifted and she could do anything - she was a clean striker of the ball and a really good passer."
The teenager joined Manchester City in 2015, making one Women's FA Cup appearance before moving onto Fylde.
Ms Tynan has been part of England youth squads at U15, U17 and most recently at U19 level.
Manager Mo Marley said: "Zoe has been involved in our squads for a number of years and was not only a very talented midfielder, but a hugely-liked and popular member of the team."
Ms Tynan was said to have received "outstanding" A-levels results last month.
