Dublin: Tram workers plan strike for St Patrick's Day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers on the Luas, Dublin's tram system are to step up their industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They plan to strike on 8 March and on 17 March - St Patrick's Day, which is a national holiday in Ireland.
Last week, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) workers stopped work for 48 hours in a dispute over pay.
It caused major disruption for 90,000 commuters in Ireland's capital city.
There are also plans to strike again on Thursday and Friday, 18 and 19 February.
The union said its members believe they are underpaid, particularly when compared to workers doing similar jobs in Irish Rail.
Workers are seeking pay rises ranging from 8% to 53%.
However, Transdev, the private company that operates the Luas, said a workers' pay claim of up to 53% was not sustainable and would add 6m euros (Â£4.65m ) to its costs.
