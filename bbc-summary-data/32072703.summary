[SN]TITLE[SN]
Senior Northamptonshire police officers in IPCC probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two of Northamptonshire's most senior police officers are to be investigated over "potential gross misconduct".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assistant Chief Constable Andy Frost and Deputy Chief Constable Martin Jelley face claims their conduct in relation to an "internal professional standards matter" was inappropriate.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is to lead the investigation.
Force Chief Constable Adrian Lee said he was aware of the investigation.
The watchdog will seek to establish whether Mr Frost's involvement in an investigation by the force's professional standards department was appropriate.
Mr Jelley, who is poised to leave Northamptonshire to become the new Chief Constable of Warwickshire Police, will be investigated "in relation to the delay in the referral of Mr Frost's conduct to the IPCC".
Chief constable Mr Lee said he was aware of the investigation, to be led by IPCC commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone, into the two officers and would "fully co-operate".
"As the Chief Constable for Northamptonshire I am the appropriate authority for conduct matters relating to DCC Jelley and ACC Frost," he said.
"As DCC Jelley moves to become the Chief Constable of Warwickshire Police the appropriate authority for his investigation will move to become the responsibility of [Warwickshire] Police and Crime Commissioner Ron Ball."
