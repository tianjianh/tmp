Police, fire and ambulance crews were called when the lorry fell on to the A12 in Witham, Essex, at about 15:40 GMT.
Adam Pipe, from Essex Police Roads Policing Unit, said a "significant incident" had closed the road in both directions.
Traffic diversions remain in place. Details regarding potential casualties have not been released.
The A12 is closed from north Chelmsford to south Colchester.
Mr Pipe said: "We have multiple units on the scene. This is going to have a massive impact this evening."
Chloe Willis, 20, of Colchester, travelling on the A12 with friends from Essex University, said: "The bridge had broken - all the barriers had broken open.
"Cars were having to drive on the grass to get round the lorry and a woman - who looked really shaken - was telling people where to go.
"There was a lot of smoke, it looked like there had been an explosion as it covered the sky."
