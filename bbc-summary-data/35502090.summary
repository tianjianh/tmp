Plans for more than 1,600 new homes in Cardiff look set to be approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Redrow Homes South Wales has submitted plans for up to 630 houses on land north and south of Llantrisant Road, in Radyr.
An outline application for about 1,000 homes in Lisvane has been put forward by South Wales Land Developments Ltd.
Planning committee councillors will consider both applications, which are recommended for approval, at a meeting on 10 February.
A primary school and community centre are also included in the plans for both developments.
More than 90 residents have previously objected to the Lisvane proposal, which forms part of the council's Local Development Plan (LDP).
