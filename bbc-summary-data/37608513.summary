Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says he understood the frustrations of a section of supporters after their 0-0 draw with Grimsby at St James Park.

Some fans protested before the game calling on Tisdale, 43, to resign, with the club 23rd in League Two, having won just two league games at home in 2016.
"I'm not in denial and I understand the frustrations," Tisdale told BBC Devon.
"But for as many frustrated comments we're getting positive letters and emails of support coming through."
Exeter could have take all three points against Grimsby, with Reuben Reid hitting the bar and the Grecians spurning a number of other good chances.
"We did everything but score," Tisdale added.
"It probably doesn't do the performance justice in terms of how much endeavour and purpose we put behind our attacking play.
"I picked as an attacking a line-up as I could and they responded with a very purposeful and determined performance.
"Maybe that' s what happens when you're on a run as we've had at home and they wanted to score too much."
