Scott, who has 33 Scotland caps, began his career at Edinburgh in 2011 and has played 70 times for the club, scoring 14 tries.
The 25-year-old's first season saw the squad reach the semi-final of the Heineken Cup and he went on to make his international debut in 2012.
"I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my time at Edinburgh," said Scott.
Scott added: "The last couple of years have been fantastic, especially this year when we won both games in the 1872 Scottish Cup.
"The guys at the moment are such a tight-knit group. It's going to be extremely difficult to leave them, but that's the main thing about rugby, the lifelong friends you make."
Edinburgh managing director Jonny Petrie expressed his disappointment at Scott's decision but said he had "no doubt he'll do well" at Gloucester.
Head coach Alan Solomons added: "He will be sorely missed by all and we wish him well in this next stage of his career."
