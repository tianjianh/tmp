The cels, from the 1937 release Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, were brought along to a valuation day in Leicestershire.
One image includes the moment the Wicked Queen hands Snow White the poisoned apple.
Auctioneer Charles Hanson said that one alone could fetch up to Â£15,000.
Snow White was released in 1937 and was briefly the highest grossing film of all time, before being overtaken by Gone With The Wind.
The cels will go under the hammer in Etwall, Derbyshire, on Saturday.

It is believed the images were first sold in 1938 at an exhibition in London of the original paintings for Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Charles Hanson, from Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers, said: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves by Walt Disney is a film that has provided so much joy to so many people over the generations.
"Such familiar and famous characters are right here at the very beginning of this success.
"Of all the scenes that could be captured on a cel the famous poisoned apple takes some beating - it's the very heartbeat of the film."
