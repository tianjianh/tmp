[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An anonymous tip-off has led to the discovery of two floodlights that were stolen from a Lincolnshire church.

The lights were taken from St Botolph's Church, known as Boston Stump, shortly after being installed.
A BBC Radio Lincolnshire listener, Peter Sherlock, was so moved by the story he pledged £2,000 to replace the lights.
It is not known whether the stolen lights still work, but Mr Sherlock said they could keep the money either way.
The lights were found by police in an outhouse in the town.
The Reverend Alyson Buxton said: "Peter, absolutely amazingly, has just said that he's content for us to keep that money and for it to be used either for the lights or for the security or for the church, so that gives us a great deal of security and hope for our big light up in December."
The lights were replaced after the building was damaged by flooding in December 2013.
The total damage caused by the flooding was estimated to have cost between £250,000 and £500,000.
