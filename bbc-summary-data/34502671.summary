[SN]TITLE[SN]
MP Huw Irranca-Davies in Welsh assembly seat bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ogmore Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies said he wants to stand for the Welsh assembly during next year's elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is seeking nomination as AM Janice Gregory is standing down from the safe Ogmore seat in Bridgend county.
Mr Irranca-Davies, who has been an MP since 2002, is the most high profile Westminster politician to consider a move to the assembly in recent years.
He said: "I have mulled over this for two to three years but I thought the opportunity would never come up."
A decision will now have to be made by Welsh Labour about whether the party's candidate is chosen from an open or an all-women list.
"I do not think Westminster is the be all and end all," said Mr Irranca-Davies.
"We should stop being humble about the Welsh assembly and the Welsh government and start saying that this is the place that really matters.
"I hope it's a sign that the Senedd is gaining in importance and credibility."
Mr Irranca-Davies is already co-ordinating Labour's assembly election campaign for next May.
