A television was also taken in the burglary in Cuxton Road, Strood, between 0630 and 1830 GMT on Tuesday.
Officers said the owner had been temporarily living in the caravan, which is next to his house.
Det Sgt Adam Marshall urged anyone who had the rifles to hand them into police, saying they were "extremely dangerous" if not handled correctly.
