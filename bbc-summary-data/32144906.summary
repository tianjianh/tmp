Mustafa Kamal quits as ICC president after World Cup snub

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mustafa Kamal has quit as International Cricket Council president and accused the body of acting "unlawfully".

Kamal said his decision came after he was denied the right to present the trophy to winners Australia after Sunday's World Cup final in Melbourne.
Instead, it was presented by Indian ICC chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan.
Kamal, a Bangladesh national, had previously criticised the umpiring at the competition after his country's quarter-final defeat by India.
He said Bangladesh's 109-run loss appeared to have been "pre-arranged" and there was "no quality in the umpiring" - a claim denied by the ICC.
"The main reason for my resignation is that I can't work with those who can act unconstitutionally and unlawfully," Kamal said on Wednesday.
"These type of people should be away from cricket, otherwise cricket will be spoilt, cricket will not move forward.
"I'm sure people will find out why I have resigned and they will unearth the truth - who are these people, what are they doing, and how they are running ICC."
The ICC later confirmed Kamal had tendered his resignation, but said his letter contained "no complaints" against anyone in the organisation.
"Mr Kamal said he was stepping down on personal grounds and offered his apologies to all associated with the ICC," a statement said.
The ICC president has become a largely honorary position since changes to the ICC constitution in 2014 handed control to the so-called 'Big Three' nations of England, India and Australia.
The ICC Board will consider the vacant position at its meeting in Dubai on 15 and 16 April.
