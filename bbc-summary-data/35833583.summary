Wales 'smart-ticketing' transport system needed, AMs say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "smart-ticketing" system is needed for transport across Wales by 2018, a group of AMs has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Enterprise and Business Committee is calling for integrated ticketing for bus, rail and metro services - similar to London's Oyster system.
It found falling subsidies, passenger numbers and bus services were having a "severe" impact, especially in rural areas and on vulnerable people.
The committee also called for a traffic commissioner for Wales to be appointed.
Its chairman, South Wales East AM William Graham, said: "Buses are the most widely used form of public transport in Wales, yet the industry is facing an uncertain future.
"We need ambition - which is why we recommend setting a 2018 deadline for a Wales-wide integrated ticket system, of the kind that is already available in London where the use of contactless payment through bank cards and smartphones is commonplace.
"It is technologically possible and passengers want it."
