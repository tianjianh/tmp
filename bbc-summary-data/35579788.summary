[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dental nurse who gave her friend a facelift despite not being qualified to do so has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adele Royston, 41, took time off from her job at Russell Court Dental Centre in Bingley, West Yorkshire, to carry out the surgery in February 2014.
It involved giving the woman local anaesthetic before cutting her face in two places and tightening her skin.
The General Dental Council (GDC) ruled Royston's actions were of the "utmost seriousness".
A misconduct panel heard Ms Royston had shown "some remorse" for her actions.
The allegations came to light after Ms Royston told the assistant manager of the practice she had performed the procedure at her friend's home while on annual leave.
An investigation was launched and she was subsequently suspended from work.
The GDC's professional conduct committee heard she administered a two-year-old anaesthetic, which could have been out of date, without being trained to do so.
She then made made incisions to the woman's face and put in stitches.
The hearing ruled Ms Royston, of Norman Terrace, Bradford, had placed her friend at "considerable risk". It ordered she be removed from the dental register.
"The committee is in no doubt, and has no difficulty whatsoever in finding, that the facts that it has found proved amount to misconduct," the panel concluded.
"Her behaviour is fundamentally incompatible with being a dental care professional."
