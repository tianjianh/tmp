[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 0-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham goalkeeper Connor Ripley was the difference after Swindon were held to a goalless League One draw with the Latics at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The result for the home side means it's now six games without a win as they remain in the relegation zone.
It took only three minutes for Oldham to have their first attempt at goal when Aaron Amadi-Holloway had his shot blocked by Nathan Thompson.
Swindon responded immediately with a shot of their own but Nicky Ajose's close-range effort was saved by Ripley.
The home side continued to dominate and Ajose found himself in on goal again in the sixth minute, only to find the Oldham goalkeeper in his way again.
Swindon started slowly in the second half but could have taken the lead in the 66th minute when Bradley Barry picked out Ajose in the area but the striker couldn't keep his shot down.
Ben Gladwin came within inches of firing the Robins to victory in the 90th minute when he calmly turned in Oldham's area but his shot went just off target.
