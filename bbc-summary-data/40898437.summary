Storey, 23, arrives at Firhill from Aberdeen on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee, while Sammon, 30, is on a season-long loan from Hearts.
Subject to clearance, both players will be available for Friday evening's Premiership game with Celtic.
"It now gives us four excellent and very different attacking options which is a great position to be in," said manager Alan Archibald.
"We've been working hard to get a couple of attacking options over the line so I'm delighted to get both Conor and Miles signed," Archibald added.
"Both players bring good experience at this level and are obviously familiar with the league and the opposition we will be playing against week in, week out. The other positive is that they are both fit and should be able to hit the ground running which is a massive bonus for us."
Storey scored as a late substitute for Aberdeen in last weekend's win over Hamilton and again came off the bench in the midweek League Cup victory against the same opponents.
However, that was just the Englishman's second goal for the club since his move to Pittodrie last summer and the Dons recruited striker Stevie May from Preston on Thursday.
Storey enjoyed a profitable 2015-16 season on loan at Inverness Caledonian Thistle from Swindon, scoring 13 goals.
Sammon moved to Hearts from Derby last summer on a three-year contract but scored only once before joining Kilmarnock on loan in January, where he netted five times.
The striker made his name at Rugby Park after a move from his native Ireland in 2008 and has had spells at Wigan, Ipswich, Rotherham and Sheffield United.
Kris Doolan, who has been at Firhill since 2009, was the Jags' leading scorer last season with 15 goals, while 20-year-old Kevin Nisbet led the attack during Wednesday's League Cup win at St Johnstone.
