Two men who died in the Shoreham air disaster are being remembered as part of a record-breaking attempt to play the longest continuous football match.

The game will raise funds for a memorial to Worthing United footballers Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt.
They were among 11 who died when a vintage jet crashed into traffic on the A27 in August.
The match is also in memory of former Worthing club manager Matt Chaplain who died after a cardiac arrest aged 38.
Event manager Mike Standing said funds raised would go to the British Heart Foundation and to providing a permanent memorial to all three men.
"We sometimes forget how quickly and suddenly life can be taken away," he said.
The football match will see players taking part in rotation, doing eight-hour stints on the field.
They will eat, sleep and live by the pitch during the event in Lancing, which is due to end on Monday.
The record for the longest marathon playing football (soccer) currently stands at 105 hours and was achieved by The Craig Gowans Memorial Fund in Edinburgh in July.
Mr Grimstone and Mr Schilt were travelling together when the Hawker Hunter aircraft hit their vehicle.
The plane, which had been taking part in a display at the Shoreham Airshow, fell onto the carriageway, destroying a number of vehicles and bursting into flames.
The pilot, Andy Hill, survived and was interviewed by Sussex Police last year.
