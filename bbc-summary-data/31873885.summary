Tottenham Hotspur stadium: Firm won't appeal court ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's Â£400m stadium development will not appeal against a High Court ruling that will see it forced out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Archway Sheet Metal Works, in Paxton Road, Tottenham, north London, had asked a judge to quash a compulsory purchase order.
But the High Court upheld the Haringey Council order in February.
The deadline has passed for the firm to take the case to the Court of Appeal.
Spurs can therefore press ahead with plans to build a new 56,000 capacity stadium.
Solicitors for the Josif family, owners of the business that produces items for the catering and hospitality industry, have confirmed they will not be appealing.
In a statement on Facebook, a spokesman for the firm said efforts were ongoing to achieve "a proper settlement" with the club.
"Our other overriding objective is also to arrange for the relocation of our family business as quickly as possible and to preserve the jobs of those we employ," it read.
A spokesman for the club said the next step would be to agree the compensation amount payable to Archway.
In November, a fire gutted the Archway premises, located yards from White Hart Lane.  The cause of the blaze is still not known, but police were treating it as suspicious.
