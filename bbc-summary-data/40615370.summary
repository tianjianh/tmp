Maupay, 20, who has played for France from Under-16 to Under-21 level, joined St-Etienne from Nice in August 2015 and scored three goals in 23 appearances for the top-flight club.
He spent time on loan in France's second division last season, scoring 11 goals in 28 league games for Brest.
His move from the Ligue 1 club is subject to international clearance.
Maupay, who featured for St-Etienne in the Europa League, is familiar with Brentford, having scored for Nice in a pre-season friendly in 2014.
Bees head coach Dean Smith said the forward is a player that the club has been "tracking for a long while".
"He fits all the profiles we set when we look for a player," Smith said. "We are very lucky to have got him and I look forward to working with him."
