Could record 200 billion daddy-long-legs hit UK?

Charity Buglife says that a combination of weather conditions this summer and autumn could lead to a record number of daddy-long-legs hatching in the UK.
The bugs - also known as crane flies - have benefited from a hot summer and the right amount of rain, which has helped them grow in their underground tunnels.
That's not all, thanks to a late burst of warm September weather, the insects now have more time to spread around the country.
Buglife - which works to save insect species - said: "If we have really hot spells like we have this year, they can move around more. They are gradually spreading northwards."
There's no need to worry though, as they're completely harmless.
