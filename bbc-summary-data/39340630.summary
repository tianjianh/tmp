His comment came amid the latest round of party in-fighting at Westminster.
Unite union boss Len McCluskey has rejected claims by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that it is plotting to help a left-wing group take over the party.
Mr Jones said people do not want parties "spending more time arguing with each other" than working for the people they were elected to represent.
Mr Watson has accused Unite of planning to fund activist group Momentum, which he said could "destroy" Labour, a claims Mr McCluskey called "a complete fabrication".
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced hecklers as he urged his MPs to unite at an angry Monday night meeting.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales on Tuesday, Mr Jones said: "I'm not going to pretend to you that things are going well in Westminster - clearly they're not.
"We in Welsh Labour fought an election last year, we're very united as a party and we're absolutely focused on delivering for the people of Wales," he told the Good Morning Wales programme.
"What people don't want to see in any political party is a political party that spends more time arguing with each other than actually delivering for the people that it's elected to represent.
"We're certainly not going to fall into the trap of arguing with ourselves," Mr Jones said of Welsh Labour.
"We're here to do a job and we intend to stick to it."
In December, the first minister said Mr Corbyn needed to "ruthless focus on the things that matter to ordinary people", days after attacking Mr Corbyn's position on immigration.
