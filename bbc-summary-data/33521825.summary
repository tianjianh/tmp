A baking challenge by supporters of murderer Jeremy Bamber, featuring recipes by the mother he shot dead, has been branded as "poor taste".

Bamber is serving a whole life term for shooting his parents, sister and her six-year-old sons in Essex in 1985. He has always protested his innocence.
The "Bamber Bake-Off" has been launched to mark 30 years of "wrongful conviction" and share family recipes.
Charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter said it was disrespectful.
"If they want to campaign, that's fine, but don't do it in this way," said chief executive Rosie Dixon.
"Every time this case is brought up again it takes families back to the day it happened, even 30 years on."
Bamber, then aged 24, shot his family at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D'Arcy in August 1985.
He has maintained his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot the family, including her sons Nicholas and Daniel, before turning the gun on herself.
His attempts at appeals through the legal system have all failed.
The Jeremy Bamber Official Website, run by his supporters, suggests bakers follow Jeremy's method then send photos of their creations to Bamber's Instagram page.
Recipes on the site include Victoria sponge, labelled as "mum's favourite", and Upside Down Pineapple Cake.
On his blog, he has reminisced about "the hours of fun and laughter" he shared in the kitchen with his mother and invited supporters to send pictures of their baking attempts to him at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire.
More than 20 photographs of cakes have been posted to his Instagram page.
Campaigner Trudi Benjamin, who believes Bamber is innocent, said feedback from supporters had been positive.
"The Bamber Bake-Off reminds people that he had a loving family, who he was close to," she added.
"It reminds us that he is a human being who has lost loved ones, despite the media perception of him being some sort of monster."
