Kyle Coetzer is a leading contender to replace Preston Mommsen as Scotland captain, but head coach Grant Bradburn says there is no rush for a decision.

Mommsen surprised his coach and team-mates by announcing his departure from cricket for a business opportunity.
Coetzer, 32, led the side prior to Mommsen and is the current vice captain.
"It's certainly something Kyle is proud to do and he's comfortable doing it," Bradburn told BBC Scotland.
"We'll work through that process with him and the other contenders as to how it would affect his own game because, first and foremost, our leader is a player first and a captain second.
"We have a number of fantastic characters who could lead the team very well.
"We'll take time to chew over the decision. The gut feeling may lead to one or two obvious candidates, but it's very important that we understand what this group needs now.
"We need a leader that commands a spot in the team, preferably across all three formats, although I'm not adverse to having different captains."
Former Durham and Northamptonshire batsman Coetzer was made Scotland captain in 2013 but lost the role to Mommsen, who stood in when Coetzer was injured during the successful qualifying campaign for the 2015 World Cup.
On his departure, Mommsen bemoaned Scotland's lack of playing time, saying progress was being "stunted".
Bradburn shares the frustration of his former skipper but is looking forward to 2017 as he prepares for a Twenty20 tournament in Dubai in January.
"It's no secret that we just don't play enough cricket," he said. "We'd like to test ourselves against the best in the world more regularly.
"Ideally, we'd like 50 days of cricket in our international calendar. Next year, we look like having at least 40, which almost double what we've had this year."
