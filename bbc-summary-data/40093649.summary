The 21-year-old made 38 appearances last season and was voted the League Two club's young player of the year.
"Otis was a fantastic attacking player for us last season," said manager Darren Way.  "He has gained a lot of experience playing in his first full season of league football.
"He attracted interest from other clubs so I'm pleased the board has supported me in securing his services."
