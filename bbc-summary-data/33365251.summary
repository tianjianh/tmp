Cameron Lancaster, from Burntisland, Fife, died at Inverkeithing Quarry in August 2014.
His mother, Gillian Barclay, 52, from Burntisland, said her son died after jumping 70ft into the water during an ice bucket challenge.
Ms Barclay hopes to use a Community Empowerment Act to take over the privately-owned Â£1.5m quarry.
Her son's death was the first of two in the last 10 months.
John McKay, 18, from Kirkcaldy died at the quarry two weeks ago, on 18 June.
Ms Barclay told the BBC Scotland news website that she would like to see deep water drained out of the quarry before it is filled in  with landfill and terraced.
She said: "The owners of the land have not responded to either police notices or notices from Fife Council.
"The land is owned by Letham Bay Developments. It bought the land in the late 90s when there were plans to redevelop Inverkeithing Bay.
"The company has done nothing since with the land.
"I don't want another family to go through this and I was livid when I heard of the most recent death there of John McKay.
"There is no fencing along the cliff above the water in the quarry and people jump into it from a great height.
"I just want to make it safe."
