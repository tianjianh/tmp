The discovery was made at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday evening.
Police have removed the items for forensic examination.
They are trying to establish if there is a link to a find at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne in March.
Police were at the scene of the find until Monday.
Det Insp Adrian Brown said: "I would ask the public to remain vigilant wherever they are and whatever they are doing.
"If you see any suspicious activity, or have seen anything unusual in this area, please contact police so that we can act on the given information."
In March, police said they had uncovered a "significant terrorist hide" containing bomb-making components and explosives at Carnfunnock.
