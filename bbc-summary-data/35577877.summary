Andros Townsend: Newcastle United have no dressing room fear

Newcastle United's poor away form is not a result of dressing room fear, says midfielder Andros Townsend.

The Magpies suffered a 5-1 defeat at Cheslea on Saturday after conceding three goals inside the opening 17 minutes.
Newcastle, who are 18th in the table, have won just twice away from home in the Premier League this season.
"It's nothing in the dressing room, the lads are not coming here scared," Townsend told BBC Newcastle.
"We came here full of confidence - we felt we were good enough to get a point but on the day we were nowhere near.
"We've got the players in the dressing room to get us out of this situation. I've no doubt in my mind that eventually we will get it right, things will start clicking and the results will start coming."
The 24-year-old scored Newcastle's only goal in the 90th minute to lessen the damage, but the heavy defeat leaves them in the relegation zone on goal difference with only 12 games remaining.
"In terms of our home performances we know what we're going to get, we're fairly consistent," said manager Steve McClaren.
"But away from home we're inconsistent and we need to solve that."
