[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at the National Museum of Scotland are due to walk out on Thursday and hold an all-day strike on Friday in a dispute over pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) said it followed a break-down in talks with museum management.
The union said the museum was being "intransigent" over its decision to remove weekend working allowances for staff.
It said talks with the management and the Scottish government had failed.
The National Museum of Scotland is the most-visited tourist attraction in Scotland.
Lynn Henderson, PCS Scottish secretary, said: "It was only a few weeks ago that the National Museum Scotland topped the poll as the most-visited tourist attraction in Scotland, but they have come bottom of the league this week for poor industrial relations.
"Museum management and Scottish ministers have proved to be intransigent throughout the process.
"It is interesting that Scottish ministers approve Â£7m to pay a bonus to prison officers but turn a blind eye to the lowest paid workers being stripped of payments for weekend working.
"Our members are now forced to take strike action again and have indicated that their resolve remains strong."
A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman, said: "Due to anticipated strike action this week by the Public and Commercial Services Union, the National Museum of Scotland and the National War Museum may be closed on the afternoon of 16 April and all day on 17 April 2015.
"These circumstances are entirely outside of our control and we apologise for the inconvenience caused to our visitors.
"The museums will open as normal on Saturday 18 April 2015."
