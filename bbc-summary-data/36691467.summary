Eilidh Doyle, Anyika Onuora, Emily Diamond and Christine Ohuruogu finished in three minutes 25.88 seconds, a first medal in the women's event since 1992.
Defending champions the United States won their sixth consecutive Olympic title with a time of 3:19.06.
Jamaica, who won bronze in London, took silver this time in 3:20.34.
Doyle and Onuora made a positive start but it was Diamond's speed on the third leg, after a slow changeover, that pushed Britain into medal contention.
The United States and Jamaica were ahead for the majority of the race but Ohuruogu's push on the final leg ensured GB won the struggle for bronze.
American Allyson Felix, meanwhile, claimed her sixth track and field gold medal, making her the fifth most decorated female Olympian in any discipline.
It is the first time since 1996 Russia have not featured in the top three, after their track and field team were banned from competing in Rio.
Bronze means British athletics has hit its pre-Rio target of seven medals.
This will be the last Olympics for Ohuruogu, who hinted at retirement after failing to qualify for the women's 400m final.
The 32-year-old is only the second British track and field athlete - after Steve Backley - to win a medal at three consecutive Olympics, having won individual gold in Beijing and silver in London.

"It has been hard but I really want to start enjoying the last 10 years or so of my sport," she told the BBC.
"Today we had to stick in, stay focused and keep each other's spirits up. I am so proud of them, we got a good job done."
Diamond said: "I'm on cloud nine. It has been a whirlwind. I'm a bit speechless and have been in tears. My mum's been in tears. It's just amazing."

"This victory is another step on the legacy of London 2012. We talked about how we would never beat that Games because of home advantage.
"Those Games gave all the athletes coming through confidence that they could go out there and perform. This will also give confidence to the next generation."
