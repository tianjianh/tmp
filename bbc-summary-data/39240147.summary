[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom midfielder James Morrison will miss Saturday's game against Arsenal because of an ankle injury.

Winger Matt Phillips is still nursing a hamstring problem and remains out for the fourth game in a row.
Mohamed Elneny should be available for Arsenal after making a quicker than expected recovery from an ankle injury.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs are both fitness doubts and will be assessed, while Santi Cazorla remains a long-term absentee.
Martin Fisher: "Even a win in this one won't be enough to lift Arsenal back into the top four, a worrying sign of what might be their fate come the end of the season.
"The FA Cup again offers Arsene Wenger the chance of silverware but it's extending his proud record of Champions League qualification that's more likely to persuade him to sign that contract on his desk.
"After losing three of their last four Premier League outings, the Gunners can ill afford any slip-ups against an Albion side I saw well beaten at Everton last weekend.
"Having superbly steered West Brom to safety by the end of February, the challenge for Tony Pulis now is to make sure the season doesn't peter out tamely."

West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "The most important thing is that we get that mentality into the players and into everyone around the football club that we want to get more points, that we want to push on.
"My aim is to get a team that can stay in the top 12 every year and get to cup finals. You've got to have that strong mentality and desire to do that."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "Success, it's not down to me to judge that. Our job is to do as well as we can until the end of the season. We want to play in the Champions League next season.
"We have a tough job because we have six or seven teams fighting for the places. We are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, we have an opportunity to do that as well. So overall that's our targets.
"After that, success is basically to take the maximum out of the potential of the team. Where is that? We will see."
The Baggies are yet to beat a top-seven team this season but I am expecting a response from them on Saturday after their recent displays.
Arsenal have a mixed record at The Hawthorns with only one win in their past three league visits, and I don't see them leaving with three points this time either.
