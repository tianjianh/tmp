Wiltshire man left lifetime collection of marbles after friend killed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Wiltshire man who inherited tens of thousands of marbles is trying to find a new home for the vast collection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Treacy took possession of more than 50,000 marbles after his friend Russell Nixon was killed in an alleged attack in Chippenham in May.
Mr Treacy said: "He always said he wanted it to go to a children's charity, but he was a hoarder and didn't like letting go of things."
He is now appealing for a charity or a hospice to take on the marble hoard.
The collection includes a wheelie bin and several 5ft 6in (1.7m) tubes stuffed with thousands of multi-coloured marbles.
"He had these tubes - 25 or 30 of them - all around his bungalow and these 1ft tall, large, chunky jars all over the place filled with marbles," said Mr Treacy.
"It's very hard to estimate, but I would say there is at least 50,000."
Mr Treacy said his friend turned to marble collecting "as a way of coping" with his "troubled childhood".
"He started collecting marbles, just a few hundred at a time, and over the years he just kept on collecting and collecting until it was in the tens of thousands," he said.
"Maybe a children's charity or someone could really benefit from this - then it will all be worth it as far as I'm concerned."
Mr Nixon died following an alleged assault in London Road, Chippenham, in the early hours of 10 May.
A 22-year-old has been charged with his murder and is due to appear in court again in October.
