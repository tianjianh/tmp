Stargazers are getting ready to enjoy the spectacular Perseid meteor shower.

Up to 100 shooting meteors an hour will streak across the sky in the beautiful natural firework show, visible around the world.
Those hoping to catch a glimpse of the shower shouldn't be disappointed this year.
Astronomers say they're expecting extra-dark skies which will create perfect stargazing conditions.
The Perseids are actually tiny pieces of the Swift-Tuttle comet that can be seen every year when the Earth passes through a cloud of the comet's debris.
They're bits of ice and dust, which can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a pea.
The fragments were left behind when Swift-Tuttle passed close to Earth in 1992.
The meteors appear to come from a point in the constellation of Perseus, hence the name Perseid.
They hit the Earth's atmosphere at a whopping speed of 134,000 mph, but don't pose any danger to us on Earth.
The celestial show is expected to hit its peak overnight on Wednesday but you can see it any night this week.
Unlike some other cosmic events, spectators don't need special technology to watch the Perseids unfold.
It's best to find a wide open space away from tall buildings or trees, and with as little light as possible. The more of the sky you can see, the better.
This year the Moon's glow will not interfere with meteor-watching, as it will be approaching its darkest or "new" phase, experts say.
