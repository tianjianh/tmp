[SN]TITLE[SN]
A policeman who attempted to arrest a judge has been given a three month sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A PSNI officer who tried to arrest one of Northern Ireland's most senior judges has been sentenced to three months in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Anthony Carlin attempted to arrest Lord Justice Gillen during a trial last month.
The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, ruled that the 43-year-old had acted with premeditation and determination.
He has been sentenced for contempt of court.
Mr Carlin's alleged outburst came at the end of a ruling in a house repossession case last month.
He had been representing himself in the legal battle with Santander over a property in County Antrim.
At the end of that High Court hearing, he allegedly got up and moved towards the bench, claiming he was going to arrest Lord Justice Gillen.
Security and court staff intervened before he was led from the courtroom.
He was arrested on suspicion of two counts of common assault, but subsequently released without charge.
Mr Carlin is alleged to have interrupted proceedings without justification, refused to resume his seat, approached the presiding judge, threatened to arrest him without lawful excuse and physically interfered with a member of court staff.
Mr Carlin rejected offers of legal representation and declined to apologise for his actions.
Speaking in court the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, said: "We are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that (Mr Carlin) was a man driven by self-importance and attention seeking."
Mr Carlin was told that if he seeks to apologise after 28 days, the rest of his sentence will be set aside.
The Police Ombudsman has also launched an investigation into the incident.
