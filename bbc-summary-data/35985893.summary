[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors moved third in the Pro12, scoring six second-half tries in a 43-14, bonus-point win over Zebre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victory in this rearranged fixture was Glasgow's seventh in a row.
The Warriors trailed at half-time to tries from Leonardo Sarto and Guglielmo Palazzani versus Fraser Brown's score.
But Ali Price, Alex Dunbar, Peter Horne (twice), Taqele Naiyaravoro and Jerry Yanuyanutawa touched down unanswered after the interval, despite Pat MacArthur's yellow card.
Glasgow are now two points behind Pro12 leaders Leinster and Connacht respectively with three games remaining, and travel to fourth-placed Scarlets next Saturday.
Shortly before kick-off, tight-head prop Sila Puafisi was withdrawn from a much-changed away line-up - Zander Fagerson was his replacement, with D'arcy Rae moving to the bench.
Zebre are without a Pro12 win since January, and have never beaten Glasgow, but started with impressive endeavour as Sarto - who joins the Warriors in the summer - and Palazzani crossed either side of Brown's try, with Carlo Canna converting both. Glasgow's Duncan Weir added the extras following the hooker's score.
With half an hour gone, the Italian fly-half missed a penalty to increase the hosts' lead, and though Zebre failed to convert their spells of attacking pressure, they preserved their seven-point advantage at the break.
Scrum-half Price - a stand-out performer this season in the absence of experienced pair Henry Pyrgos and Mike Blair - hared over brilliantly just after half-time, bursting past lock Quintin Geldenhuys en route to the whitewash.
Weir converted from under the posts, and was successful from the tee once more when Scotland centre Dunbar surged onto an inside ball from deep, penetrating the fringe ruck defence, and rounded full-back Kayle van Zyl for the third Glasgow try.
Horne then took another neat inside ball from Weir's replacement, Finn Russell, to stride over for the bonus-point score, Russell converting.
The Warriors' substitute hooker MacArthur was yellow-carded for a late tackle as the hour-mark approached.
A frenetic final quarter of gung-ho, broken-field attack ensued, but it was accurate phase play that led to unconverted tries for the giant winger Naiyaravoro and replacement prop Yanuyanutawa, before Horne latched onto a ricocheted Zebre offload to complete the scoring with his second.
