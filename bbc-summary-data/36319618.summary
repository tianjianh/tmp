The family of a pensioner from Londonderry who went missing six months ago have said they 'fear for his safety'.

John Concannon has dementia and hearing difficulties and went missing on Tuesday 10 November.
The 71-year-old's last known sighting was getting off a bus in the Lenamore Road area of Derry, near the border with County Donegal.
His brother Robert said it is "an ongoing nightmare" with no closure.
Over Christmas Mr Concannon's family made an appeal for his safe return.
They believe he went missing because he got on the wrong bus.
"It would wear you down, you're waking up and going to be thinking about John, wondering are you going to get a phone call or a knock on the door," Robert said.
"At the same time it would be a bit of a relief if you did get that.
"It's the not knowing and for his two sons and the rest of the family it's a thing you wouldn't wish to happen to anybody else," he added.
So far, all reported sightings of Mr Concannon have not led the family closer to his location.
Search teams are still operating along the border with Donegal, checking for fragments of the pensioner's clothing.
"Your head is telling you that if you do find John it will be in the wrong circumstances but your heart is always in hope.
"John is confused and totally deaf and if somebody came across him they wouldn't be able to get information out of him and would phone the police.
"That hasn't happened, so to me John isn't moving. Because of that I think the other scenario is the more likely one," Robert said.
John Concannon is described as being 5ft 6in tall, of medium build and with grey hair.
He was wearing a black and grey beanie hat, a black coat, checked shirt and navy trousers when he went missing.
