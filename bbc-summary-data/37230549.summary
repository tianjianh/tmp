A pre-inquest review into the Shoreham air disaster has been postponed by the West Sussex coroner.

Eleven men died after a vintage jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August last year during the Shoreham air show.
The review had been arranged for 19 September but has been postponed because the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not yet published its final report.
Pilot Andy Hill is being investigated for possible manslaughter.
Senior coroner Penelope Schofield had warned a delay was likely.
A spokesman for the coroner's office said: "The families have been informed and information about the new date will be available soon."
In a statement, the AAIB said: "We have published three special bulletins which have included safety recommendations to prevent future similar accidents.
"Our final report will integrate and expand on those previous bulletins, which dealt with systemic issues, and cover the technical aspects of the accident itself.
"The final report is expected to be published later this year."
