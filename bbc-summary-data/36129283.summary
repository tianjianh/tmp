Afghanistan veteran David Seath, 31, had a cardiac arrest three miles short of the finish, near the 23-mile mark, close to Southwark Bridge.
He received immediate medical attention and was taken to St Thomas' Hospital but died later.
Capt Seath's friends are planning to complete the marathon in his honour, starting at the place where he collapsed.

"We will walk as one, the final three miles of the marathon, starting where he fell," wrote Capt James Walker-McClimens on a fundraising page set up following his death.
The page has so far raised more than Â£64,000 for Help for Heroes. Capt Seath's own page has raised almost Â£40,000.
Capt Walker-McClimens served with Capt Seath in the 19th Regiment The Royal Artillery The Highland Gunners in Tidworth.
They both went on tour to Afghanistan in 2012, returning at the same time.
"He was the greatest type of guy you could imagine - everyone loved him. He was funny, outgoing, generous - he was just not a bad guy in any way shape or form."
"In the Army we don't like unfinished business. It was something he wanted to do, he wanted to do the full marathon, so we are going to complete it for him," he said.
The exact cause of death is yet to be established.
Capt Seath's mother, Libby, said: "David has achieved more in 31 years than most people do in 70. He lived his life on the edge and to the full."
Capt Seath, from Cowdenbeath, Fife, commanded a specialist team while serving as a fire support team commander for 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, based in Plymouth.
He completed two master's degrees at the University of Aberdeen before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the elite officer training centre, in 2009.
Lieut Col Jon Cresswell, Commanding Officer of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, said the regiment was "devastated".
"Witty, charming and polished, Dave was a fabulous host and stylish performer."
He said Capt Seath had been selected to train future officers of the Afghan National Army in the rank of a major.
"We have lost one of the great characters of our regiment and take strength from the memory of his example and leadership."
Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, Defence Minister Philip Dunne used his opening remarks in response to an urgent question on ship building to pay tribute to the 31-year-old.
He said the thoughts of MPs were with the family and friends of Capt Seath "at this difficult time".
Shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry also offered condolences to the family on behalf of the Labour Party.
In 2012, 30-year-old Claire Squires died close to the finish line. A fundraising campaign set up following her death raised more than Â£1m for the Samaritans.
