The 26-year-old, who last played for his country in November 2014, switched codes in 2011 when he joined Bath from Rugby League side St Helens.
Bath have not disclosed the length of Eastmond's new deal.
"I don't think there are many clubs with such a positive training and playing environment," he told the club website.
"I feel like we've started a really exciting time at Bath."
Head coach Mike Ford added: "Kyle's part of a young backline here that's already achieved some great things, but there is a lot more to come from them."
