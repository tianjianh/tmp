Alan Pardew questions referee Andre Marriner appointment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew said Andre Marriner should not have refereed Saturday's 4-2 Premier League defeat by Liverpool - because he awarded the Reds a penalty in last season's fixture.

Christian Benteke scored Liverpool's winner in the March meeting after Marriner gave a stoppage-time penalty.
"He gives the penalty last year so we've got a negative in our mind anyway," said Pardew.
"I don't think Andre Marriner should have reffed this game."
Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy said: "I don't agree with not refereeing. You can't look back at every game and start taking referees off games."
The Professional Game Match Officials Limited - led by general manager Mike Riley - assign officials to matches.
In April, it stood down Leicester fan Kevin Friend from officiating a match involving their title rivals Tottenham.
Wilfried Zaha twice went down in the box for Palace, while team-mate Benteke, who left Liverpool in the summer, also had appeals for a penalty rejected.
"They are tight but they are probably no worse than Christian's last year," Pardew said.
"Why was Mike Riley giving him the game today? I can't understand it. It's just a little bit frustrating."
Marriner awarded 15 fouls and a yellow card against Palace and five fouls and two bookings against Liverpool.
Liverpool were twice pegged back by headers from James McArthur before Joel Matip climbed highest to restore the visitors' lead before the break.
Roberto Firmino made the game safe for Liverpool with a chipped finish with 19 minutes to go.
Palace, who have taken one point from their past four Premier League games, are 12th in the table.
