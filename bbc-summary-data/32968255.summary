'Bleeding to death' councils need 'quick reorganisation'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council leader has called on the Welsh government to proceed quickly with local government reorganisation because the system is "bleeding to death".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dyfed Edwards, leader of Gwynedd council, said councils could not sustain services because of cuts.
The Welsh government said Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews had indicated a map would be published before the summer.
A draft bill will follow in the autumn.
Mr Edwards, who is also deputy presiding officer of the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We're all in the same situation struggling, but we need to really raise our game... with that in mind I think we should change sooner rather than later.
"If reorganisation is going to happen, let's get on with it... yes there will be upheaval in the short term, but it's that long term gain which is worth the effort."
A Welsh government spokesman said the publishing of the map would give councils an opportunity to express their views. The draft bill will also go out to consultation.
