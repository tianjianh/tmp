[SN]TITLE[SN]
Partick Thistle v Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle right-back Mustapha Dumbuya is out of Friday's Scottish Premiership game against Aberdeen.

Dumbuya remains out with an ankle injury but recent signings Antonio German and Aidan Nesbitt could make their debuts for the Jags.
Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes faces up to four weeks out with a hamstring tear.
However, Ryan Jack is available again after recovering from a similar injury and the Dons have no other injury worries.
A win would draw Derek McInnes's side level on points with Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic, who host Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Saturday and already have a game in hand over Aberdeen.
So who is more under pressure? Title-chasing Aberdeen - still clinging to the coattails of Celtic - or Partick Thistle, suddenly floating perilously close to the relegation dogfight?
The Jags start to eat into their games in hand, they have played three less than Kilmarnock, who trail them by a point, but manager Alan Archibald would surely be privately happy with a draw against McInnes's side.
A win though would lift them above Hamilton Academical and Motherwell into eighth spot in the table.
February has not been kind to them - knocked out of the Scottish Cup by toiling Dundee United and then victims of an 11th hour postponement of their match against Hearts at Tynecastle.
But Aberdeen fans will demand a battling performance after the defeat by Inverness on Monday, a result which rocked their hopes of pipping Celtic for the title.
It is another chance to match Celtic's current points tally although by the time the league leaders kick off on Saturday they will have two games in hand.
Aberdeen will be missing key player, Johnny Hayes, who has torn a hamstring and could be out until well into March. His absence is a huge blow.
Thistle have failed to score in either of the two previous league fixtures between the clubs this season, losing 2-0 at Pittodrie and drawing 0-0 at Firhill.
Oh, and Dons fans will be desperate for a decent refereeing performance. The good news from their perspective is that the referee is not Willie Collum, who awarded a controversial penalty in Inverness. Alan Muir gets the job.
