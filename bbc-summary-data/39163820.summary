[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City v Swansea City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull defender Curtis Davies is fit after a hamstring injury and could feature for the first time since the end of January.

But Evandro will miss a third consecutive game with a calf strain.
Swansea full-back Kyle Naughton is sidelined with a hamstring injury so Angel Rangel is likely to deputise.
Jefferson Montero and Ki Sung-yueng are set to return to the squad after hamstring and knee injuries respectively.
Alistair Mann: "Since getting new managers just days apart in early January, these two sides have made the encouraging improvements those appointments were designed to provoke.
"That said, while Paul Clement has steered Swansea some five points clear of the drop zone, Marco Silva's Hull still remain embedded within it.
"The Tigers still have to face the four sides immediately around them in the table, three of which - perhaps crucially - are at home, beginning with the visit of the Swans.
"Having taken seven of his eight points so far at the KCOM Stadium, Silva will be acutely aware of the potentially irreversible damage a defeat this weekend would inflict."

Hull head coach Marco Silva: "The last two games against them were two wins for us, but the next game is the most important. We need to win.
"We still have six games at home, and three over the next four weeks. We feel good when we play at home."
Swansea head coach Paul Clement: "The first thing is we go there to try and win the game. But if we don't it is very important not to lose based on the gap of points between us and them. A point there would not be a bad result.
"I have watched their games and they were ahead against Leicester, but they probably played them at a bad time compared to when we played them.
"They also lost against Chelsea and Arsenal, but I thought they played very well in both those games."
Swansea look like a different team under Paul Clement, in attack as well as defence.
Hull also improved when Marco Silva took over, but they have started to plateau a little bit and they are still in deep trouble at the bottom of the table.
I am going to back the Tigers to get something here, though.
