[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eurozone inflation slows to 0.2% in June

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The eurozone's inflation rate dipped slightly from 0.3% in May to 0.2% in June, according to official figures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The reading marks the second month of a return to inflation after five months of flat or falling prices.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has been taking steps to reflate the economies of the 19 countries that use to euro.
Other figures showed that unemployment throughout the bloc remained at 11.1% in May, the same level as in April.
Unemployment in Germany was the lowest of the 19, at 4.7%, while crisis-struck Greece was the highest at 25.6%.
In March, the ECB began a â‚¬1 trillion stimulus programme to boost economic activity in the eurozone.
The rise in prices was due in part to an increase in food and beverage costs, which were 1.2% higher.
