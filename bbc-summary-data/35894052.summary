[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marlon Roban, 38, launched an attack on his victim that was caught on CCTV at The Mount jail near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on 30 April last year.
Roban used a shard of glass from a smashed microwave plate, St Albans Crown Court was told.
Judge Stephen Warner said he posed a danger to the public and deserved an "extended sentence" starting in 2019.
Fellow inmates and the victim, who nearly bled to death when the glass severed an artery, refused to give evidence against Roban.
Prosecutor Jessica Clarke said: "One of the shards caused a wound that nearly killed the victim. It struck an artery and he nearly bled to death."
Judge Warner said: "Stabbing a man in the neck near to a vital artery is a serious offence."
He also said he was satisfied Roban posed a danger to the public and there was a real risk of him committing further serious offences.
