BMA Scotland has welcomed the Scottish government's aspiration to reduce junior doctors' working hours.

Junior doctors are currently limited to 48 hours per week, averaged over a six-month period.
Health minister has indicated she will work towards a 48-hour limit per week, with no averaging.
Dr Chris Sheridan, who chairs BMA Scotland's junior doctors committee, said such a move would protect doctors and improve patient safety.
Health Secretary Shona Robison recently met Brian Connelly, whose daughter Lauren died in a crash while driving home from a night shift as a junior doctor.
Mr Connelly has been campaigning for tighter rules on doctors' hours.
Ms Robison said: "I was pleased to meet Mr Connelly recently and discuss how a working week of 48 hours with no averaging of hours could be taken forward.
"Following our meeting I wrote to Mr Connelly to set out that I believe we can deliver this in the future, and that we would be determining a firm and achievable timescale to deliver this.
"This will inform our future workforce planning as part of our ongoing national conversation on the future of health and care in Scotland."
New rules come into effect in February 2016 which, in addition to any new restriction on hours, will ensure junior doctors cannot be asked to work more than seven days in a row.
Dr Sheridan said: "If it is indeed the case that the Scottish government intends to put more rigorous limits on the length of time that junior doctors can be asked to work during a week, then it shows a commendable desire to improve working practices and patient safety.
"Making sure that there are proper safeguards on how long doctors work is not just about the wellbeing of doctors, it is also a vital component of patient safety and ensuring that someone is not being treated by an exhausted doctor.
"We look forward to hearing the Scottish government's intentions in more detail and to working with them on how this would work in practice."
