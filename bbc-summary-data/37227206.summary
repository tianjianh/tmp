Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins says the club could make more signings before the transfer window shuts on Wednesday night.

Swans coach Alan Curtis suggested Alfie Mawson would be their last signing before the 23:00 BST deadline.
But Jenkins is still hopeful of making more additions, most likely on loan.
"I think everybody wants that. It's not always great to get things done last minute, but we'll see what comes," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"We've done quite a lot of our business and if one or two things come our way - one or two loans to add - we would look at that."
Swansea broke their transfer record to sign striker Borja Baston from Atletico Madrid in a deal worth Â£15m earlier in the summer, while Spanish international Fernando Llorente joined from Sevilla.
The Swans have been linked with a move for West Ham forward Enner Valencia, but Jenkins would not name the players they are targeting.
"We were looking at one or two things, whether that's now or we add in January, it remains to be seen," he added.
