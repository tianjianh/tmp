England: Courtney Lawes ruled out of Wales game with injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England lock Courtney Lawes is out of Saturday's Six Nations home game against Wales with an ankle injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old sustained the injury in Northampton's 20-15 Premiership victory over Saracens on Saturday.
He will be replaced by Leicester Tigers forward Ed Slater.
Northampton club-mate Luther Burrell is also in a 33-man training squad, taking over from Harlequins winger Marland Yarde, who suffered a shoulder injury in Saturday's defeat by Sale Sharks.
Bath centre Ollie Devoto has recovered from concussion to make the squad, while Leicester's Manu Tuilagi, who has not played for England since 2014, is also included.
Tuilagi scored his first Premiership try of the season during the 31-27 win over Exeter on Sunday, but Tigers coach Richard Cockerill does not believe Tuilagi is ready to return to Test rugby yet.
England are top of the Six Nations table, one point ahead of Wales, with three victories from three matches.
