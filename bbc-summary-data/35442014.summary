SPFL: Two Premiership games and five others postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Premiership matches hosted by Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Partick Thistle have been postponed because of waterlogged pitches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Games hosted by Raith Rovers, Cowdenbeath, Berwick Rangers and Stirling Albion also failed Saturday morning pitch inspections.
The match at Caledonian Stadium, where Hearts were due to be visitors, was called off before 08:00.
Dundee United's game at Firhill followed three hours later.
But the Championship game between Dumbarton and Livingston and the League Two fixtures between East Fife and Clyde and East Stirlingshire against Arbroath go ahead following successful inspections.
Caley Thistle, whose game was first to be postponed, stated that the prospect of further poor weather also contributed to the decision.
Queen of the South were due to be visitors at Raith Rovers' Stark's Park in the Championship.
Forfar Athletic were the visitors at Cowdenbeath in League One, with Ayr United v Stenhousemuir also off in that division.
Queen's Park were travelling to Berwick, while Montrose were Stirling Albion's visitors.
