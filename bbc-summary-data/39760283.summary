He told supporters in Pennsylvania that he was keeping "one promise after another", dismissing criticism as "fake news" by "out of touch" journalists.
Mr Trump decided to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner - the first US leader to miss the annual event since Ronald Reagan in 1981.
Earlier, big rallies were held against Mr Trump's climate change policies.
At the rally in Harrisburg, the president said the media should be given "a big, fat, failing grade" over their coverage of his achievements during his first 100 days and told the cheering crowd he was "thrilled to be more than 100 miles from Washington".
He quipped that at the same time "a large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling themselves" at the correspondents' dinner "that will be very boring".
Turning to his election pledges, Mr Trump said the first 100 days had been "very exciting and very productive".
He said he was "delivering every single day" to bring industrial jobs back to the US, ending the so-called "war on coal".
The president said the previous administration of Barack Obama "gave us a mess", stressing that he was ready for "great battles to come and we will win in every case".
