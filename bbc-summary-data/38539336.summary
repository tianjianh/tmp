[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 1-3 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster came from behind to stay four points clear at the top of League Two, beating Barnet 3-1 at the Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Akinde gave Barnet the lead after just 13 minutes with his 18th league goal of the season, pouncing on Niall Mason's back-pass.
But the league leaders were level almost immediately when Matty Blair split the Bees defence with a low cross and James Coppinger finished to equalise with 18 minutes on the clock.
Akinde might have put Barnet back in front when he attempted to round the keeper for the second time, but it was Rovers who took the lead.
John Marquis stabbed the ball home to end an almighty goalmouth scramble in the 28th minute and give Rovers the lead before Coppinger curled the ball into the bottom corner three minutes later.
Interim Barnet boss Rossi Eames threw on Simeon Akinola and Nana Kyei after the break but it was to no avail.
