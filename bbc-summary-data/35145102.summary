A new joint task force to help tackle cross-border organised and paramilitary crime is due to have its first meeting next month.

It will be led by senior figures from the PSNI, An Garda Síochána, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs Service and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.
The initiative is part of the Fresh Start deal agreed in November.
The latest details were announced at a meeting of British, Irish and Stormont ministers in Dublin on Monday.
It was attended by Northern Ireland First and Deputy First Ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, Stormont Justice Minister David Ford and the Republic of Ireland's justice minister, Frances Fitzgerald.
Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers were also present.
The task force was described by Mr Robinson said as an "important milestone" in the agreement.
Mr McGuinness said it provided "renewed energy, focus and additional mechanisms" to tackle what he called the "scourge of criminality on our communities".
Ms Villiers said it showed there was a "concerted effort to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime".
"I welcome the establishment of this joint agency task force, which strongly reaffirms the commitment from the United Kingdom government, the Irish Government and Northern Ireland executive to doing all we can to crack down on criminality by paramilitaries and make it absolutely clear that in no circumstances will paramilitary activity be tolerated," she said.
The Fresh Start Agreement outlines plans that would bring together agencies like HM Revenue and Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the National Crime Agency - the UK's equivalent of the FBI - with their equivalents in the Republic of Ireland.
The task force is expected to have a budget of about £50m.
Earlier on Monday, the British and Irish governments also met to discuss implementing last month's agreement.
Mr Flanagan said he and Ms Villiers "shared the deep disappointment" that Troubles legacy issues were not addressed in November.
He said finding a solution was of "paramount importance for victims and survivors" and for "underpinning peace and reconciliation across our islands".
Mr Flanagan added that both governments would continue to work towards establishing the new institutional framework for dealing with the past agreed in the agreement.
"In the meantime, contacts will continue with victims' groups and the political parties in Northern Ireland to discuss their concerns and explore possible ways forward," he said.
Last month, after 10 weeks of talks, the British and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, agreed a way forward on paramilitarism and welfare reform.
However, they failed to break the deadlock over legacy issues arising from Northern Ireland's Troubles.
