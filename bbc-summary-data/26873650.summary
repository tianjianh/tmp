George Galloway's ex-aide Aisha Ali-Khan jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former aide to Respect MP George Galloway has been jailed for contempt of court after failing to destroy "explicit" pictures of her lover and his estranged wife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aisha Ali-Khan, 33, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, served as the Bradford West MP's parliamentary secretary.
Ali-Khan was jailed for three months at the High Court in London because she defied an order to destroy the images.
She was also ordered to pay about Â£10,000 in court costs.
Ali Khan found the pictures after marrying counter-terrorism officer Det Insp Mohammed Azif Khan in an Islamic ceremony in Pakistan in 2009.
Mr Khan's estranged wife, who is still legally married to the policeman, went to the High Court to prevent the pictures being made public.
Ali-Khan was ordered to hand over or destroy the pictures in December but failed to do so.
Judge Richard Seymour told Ali-Khan: "People in your position, when an application is made to be committed to prison, sometimes belatedly do what they have been ordered to do. You haven't."
