A man has been arrested in Sydney after reports of a suspicious package caused police to lock down a part of the central business district.

It was in response to a bomb threat made over the phone, local media said. The incident was not terror related.
The man, 39, is now in hospital for medical assessment, police said. The area has since been declared safe.
Last December, three people died, including a gunman, after a hostage situation in nearby Martin Place.
Superintendent Mark Walton from Sydney Police told ABC News that the area was shut down as police searched the man's vehicle for dangerous items.
An explosive detection dog and bomb technicians cleared the area, he said.
"It's apparent this man made those threats to draw attention to a grievance that he has," Supt Walton said.
The man was being detained under the mental health act and undergoing questioning and assessment, Supt Walton added.
