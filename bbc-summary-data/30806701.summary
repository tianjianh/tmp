Anxiety sufferer: I just want to do normal things

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than one in 10 young people often feel too anxious to leave the house, according to a new Prince's Trust report.

The annual Prince's Trust Macquarie Youth Index surveyed 2,265 16-25-year-olds and found 13% often felt too anxious to go outside.
The report also found unemployed young people were more than twice as likely to feel that way.
One sufferer explains how anxiety has affected him growing up.

Nat Hawley, 23, who also has autism and dyslexia, told Newsbeat he's had anxiety "no matter what issues have been in my life" and that it has stopped him doing "normal things" like socialising.
"Something like going to a club with friends is such an easy and enjoyable experience for most young people but I start to freak out.
"I'm always thinking of what could go wrong, how people are perceiving me, what I look like to them, how they're going to remember me.
"I want to do all those things but something in the back of my mind can make this not possible."
Nat says that he doesn't think a lot of people fully understand the condition.
"For me it's about not being in control of yourself, for getting worried, nervous or scared for something that a lot of people would see as very small situation.
"When I feel anxious it's like my head gets really heavy, I can't make eye contact with people, my lungs get really tight and I struggle to swallow and I always feel like I've got lumps in my throat."
Despite developing ways of dealing with anxiety, Nat says it still affects him on a regular basis.
"The ways that I try to deal with it is to do as much planning as I possibly can, know my situation.
"If I knew there would be a slight little change in my routine, that could keep me up nights or weeks at a time."
Nat's father left home when he was 16 and he was left to look after his mum who had a mental breakdown.
With his GCSEs looming, Nat came close to leaving education to look after his mum.
"I was afraid to leave the house because I had to look after my mum," explains Nat.
"I used to get really bad anxiety when I went out and I was always worried about things like paying the bills or getting enough food to eat."
Nat says he found it hard to cope on his own.
"I didn't really have anyone to talk to about my situation and I was really depressed for a long time."
But he eventually graduated from university and says it's given him a boost.
Nat told Newsbeat he copes much better with anxiety than he used to but that the condition is "always a constant".
"The thing with anxiety is that I know it's to do with me.
"When I think these things, if people are judging me, or looking at me or I'm scared to leave the house - I know it's not true and I know it's not real.
"Even when I'm with friends I'm never totally relaxed.
"Whenever I say goodbye to someone, I always assume that might be the last time I ever see them no matter how much I know that that's an unlikely situation."
