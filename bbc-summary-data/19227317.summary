Lt Chesterman was shot in an ambush in Helmand province after a vehicle in his convoy struck a roadside bomb, the Ministry of Defence said.
The 26-year old, who was born in Guildford, Surrey, and lived in Bristol, had been deployed since April.
His father Paul Chesterman said their family had lost a "fine young man".
He added: "Andrew gave himself fully and wholeheartedly to his career in 3 Rifles.
"His family are immensely proud of him and will carry him very dearly in their hearts."
Lt Chesterman, a Platoon Commander in C Company, was commanding a patrol convoy in the Nad-e Ali district when the lead vehicle struck an improvised explosive device.
In the moments that followed, the patrol was fired upon by a group of insurgents.
He was treated at the scene and taken to Camp Bastion hospital, but could not be saved.
Lt Chesterman studied mechanical engineering at the University of Southampton before attending the Britannia Royal Naval College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
He leaves behind his father Paul and two sisters, Anna and Olivia.
In June, Lt Chesterman was asked to form a Police Advisory Team working with 1st Battalion Welsh Guards Battle Group to improve the mentoring of the Afghan National Police.
Lt Col Charlie Maconochie, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Rifles, said the 26-year old was an "outstanding leader of men".
"Andrew Chesterman will be remembered as a hugely charismatic, completely dedicated and thoroughly professional officer who was destined for a great career in the Army.
"He will be greatly missed by his brother officers and Riflemen alike and his sacrifice never forgotten."
His colleague, Lt James Cowen, an intelligence officer for C Company, said he had lost "a great friend".
"I will miss a great friend, the man that you share that late night brew with before climbing under your mosquito net.
"He has made me a better man in the few short months I have known him and I will always be grateful to him for the lessons he taught me, the laughs we shared and for the friend I will always remember."
The number of British service personnel killed in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 stands at 424.
