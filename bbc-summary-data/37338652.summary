Photos of the construction of a major sewer system in Aberdeen in 1901 have been released.

The Girdleness Outfall Scheme was designed to address the sanitary requirements of the growing city.
The new system had to discharge tens of millions of gallons of waste material every day.
The series of photos are from a Scottish Water employee. They show workers, and different stages of the construction.
The construction included the blasting of about 40,000 tonnes of rock in order to create a trench for pipelines.
Bob Nicoll, of Scottish Water in Aberdeen, said: "I've had the pictures for the last 15 or 16 years.
"They were part of some old archive stuff due to be thrown out but I felt they needed rescued from that as they show an amazing part of the city's industrial history.
"I stored them at a pumping station in Aberdeen and one day was showing one of my colleagues from Scottish Water the pictures. He suggested we put them out on social media for people to see.
"It's amazing to see the work that went into building the sewer over 100 years ago and I'm pleased I saved the pictures from the rubbish tip."
