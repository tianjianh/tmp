[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man in his 40s is being questioned by Irish police investigating the murder of Noel Duggan in County Meath last month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 57-year-old was killed in The Old Mill housing estate in Ratoath on 23 March.
He was shot a number of times while sitting in his car outside his home.
It is thought the gun attack was linked to a gangland feud, which left two other men dead earlier this year.
Mr Duggan, a well-known criminal linked to cigarette smuggling, was a friend of Dublin gangland criminal Gerry Hutch.
The Hutch family was caught up in a feud that led to a hotel gun attack in February.
One man died when gunmen posing as police officers opened fire inside Dublin's Regency Hotel on 5 February, during a boxing weigh-in event.
Days later Gerry Hutch's brother, Eddie Hutch Sr, was shot dead in his Dublin flat, in a suspected reprisal for the hotel gun attack.
Their nephew, Gary Hutch, was shot dead in Spain last September, reportedly as part of the same feud.
