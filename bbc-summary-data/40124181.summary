Uncapped full-back Dollman, 32, suffered a knee injury in Exeter's Premiership final win over Wasps, while prop Lee, 24, also has a knee problem.
Scarlets fly-half or full-back Rhys Patchell and Ospreys prop Rhodri Jones have been added to caretaker coach Robin McBryde's squad.
Wales fly out on 7 June to play Tonga on 17 June and Samoa on 24 June.
"Samson Lee unfortunately his knee flared up against Munster [in the Pro12 final] and it hasn't settled down enough for us to take him to the next level of training," McBryde said.
"With Phil Dollman, the last I heard he was awaiting a consultation following a significant injury to his knee... he's out of the tour."
Dollman had seemed set to earn a long-awaited first cap after a fine season for English champions Exeter.
"The time it [the injury] occurred and the manner in which it happened, it was a bitter-sweet day for Phil having spoken to him.
"The heights of winning, being successful and scoring a try, and then the injury obviously it's tough."
Wales played a one-off warm-up game against Welsh Premiership side RGC 1404 last Friday, winning 88-14 at Parc Eirias.
Harlequins centre Jamie Roberts captained an experimental Wales team in Colwyn Bay.
