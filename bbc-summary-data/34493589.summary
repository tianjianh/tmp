[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic returned to the top of the Scottish Premiership with a narrow victory over Motherwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nadir Ciftci scored early for Celtic but the champions failed to add the goals their dominance deserved.
Motherwell made it more of a contest after the break, although Celtic had two big penalty appeals waved away.
Despite failing to score more goals Celtic deserved victory, as Mark McGhee began his second spell as Motherwell boss with a defeat.
The defending champions go two points clear of Aberdeen, who lost to Ross County on Friday evening and Celtic resume their Europa League campaign in manager Ronny Deila's native Norway against Molde on Thursday.
McGhee's starting line-up was certainly a statement with regulars Keith Lasley, Lionel Ainsworth and Scott McDonald all on the bench.
As for Celtic, Ciftci was handed a chance to shine with Leigh Griffiths on the bench. Captain and midfielder Scott Brown also made the starting XI after recovering from a training ground knock.
The hosts aspired to a 4-3-3 formation, but as Celtic dominated play the formation in reality was more 4-5-1.
It did not long for Celtic to make the breakthrough. Stuart Armstrong and Emilio Izaguirre combined well on the left to set up Kris Commons, and though his shot was parried by Connor Ripley, Ciftci fired in the rebound.
Motherwell struggled to get into the game but did have a spot-kick claim dismissed when Wes Fletcher went down in the box.
Soon after, Commons had a pop from 30 yards, his shot swerving in the air and Ripley tipping the effort just over the bar.
The mercurial Commons would come even closer with a free-kick 20 yards out as his shot came back off the crossbar with Ripley beaten.
Such was the Celtic dominance that one of their centre backs - Tyler Blackett - was able to cross the ball into the box for his central defensive partner Dedryck Boyata - who had joined the attack - but his free header was just wide.
At the start of the second half there were appeals for a Celtic penalty when Brown went down in the box under challenge from Kieran Kennedy, but referee Alan Muir decided the Motherwell defender had made contact with the ball.
At the other end, Efe Ambrose, culpable for the loss of some important goals in recent weeks, almost had another moment to forget as his sliced clearance from a cross went perilously close to finding his own net.
Commons came close again to scoring but fired just wide.
Celtic should have had a spot-kick when the ball struck the arm of Kennedy but there was no whistle from the officials.
Motherwell were offering very little as an attacking threat and yet they almost equalised when Kennedy fired just wide.
They had a big chance following a free-kick when the ball fell to Kennedy in the box, but he failed to control and it ran harmlessly behind for a goal-kick.
Ciftci's replacement Griffiths then stung the palms of Ripley after a turn and shot from the edge of the box. Commons also had a late chance after working his way into the box but was unable to get a clean shot away.
