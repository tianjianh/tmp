West Midlands Police said Mcallister had targeted several girls and women aged between 17 and 21.
He tried to ingratiate himself with local community groups in an effort to disguise his activities.
But he was arrested in 2013 after some of the women spoke out.
After the sentencing, Det Con Katrina Sands praised Mcallister's victims' "incredible bravery" for reporting the crimes.
"This so-called community do-gooder controlled the girls by threatening to harm their families if they didn't do as he ordered," she said.
"He subjected them to physical abuse, including punching and head-butting them, but worse was the shocking degrading sexual acts he made them perform on him."
