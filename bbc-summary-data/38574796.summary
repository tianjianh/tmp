[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Windsor Grammar teacher 'abused boys over a decade'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former teacher carried out a string of sex attacks on boys for more than a decade, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Marshall, 70, denies carrying out the abuse while working at Windsor Grammar School in Berkshire and St Paul's School in London.
Southwark Crown Court was told 24 offences against at least nine boys occurred between 1969 and 1981.
One witness told the trial he "lay there quietly" while he was assaulted by the married father-of-three.
He said the former geography teacher and rowing coach attacked him several times at a "secluded" building used by the school.
"I just felt intense discomfort. I did not know how to stop it from happening," he said.
The former Windsor Grammar pupil, who cannot be named, said Mr Marshall had come across as "a charismatic and charming" person who had showed him friendship and encouragement.
Brian Stork, defending, argued the witness had a "good deal of direct contact" with Mr Marshall for two or three years after the teacher left the school, and had gone on holiday with him.
"Nobody would have forced you to go on a trip abroad with Patrick Marshall. So it's not unreasonable to assume that if you did go on such a trip you went on it voluntarily.
"At no time did Mr Marshall touch you sexually," he said.
The witness replied: "That's completely incorrect."
Mr Marshall, of Farnham, Surrey, faces 24 counts of indecent assault against nine boys, and one count of indecency with a child.
The offences allegedly took place in the defendant's car, the alleged victims' homes and abroad.
The trial continues.
