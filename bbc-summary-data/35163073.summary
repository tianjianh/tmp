[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20-year-old man was beaten to death in retaliation for an earlier clash outside a kebab shop, the High Court in Belfast has heard.

Prosecutors claimed Christopher Meli was attacked in the Twinbrook estate by a large group of both males and females who joined up to "exact revenge".
The details emerged as bail was granted to Stephen McCann, 18, of Bearnagh Glen in the city,
He is one of three teenagers charged with murder.
The judge ruled he could be released from custody after being told no witnesses had implicated him as being directly involved in the killing early on 12 December.
He said the events surrounding Mr Meli's violent death were a tragedy.
"It's a clear example of what can happen when a group of young people behave in a way which can only be described as vicious and savage," he said.
A prosecution lawyer said the case against Mr McCann was based on joint enterprise, a legal doctrine that enables entire groups of people to be prosecuted for murder even though they may have played very different roles in a killing.
The court heard Mr Meli was with some friends - identified as 'Group A' - who were involved in a fight with other teenagers, one of whom suffered a "busted nose".
The prosecution claimed Mr McCann then joined up with others to form a 'Group B' intent on retaliation.
When they encountered Mr Meli again, he was repeatedly punched and kicked about the head and body as he lay on the ground, according to the prosecution.
She said the sustained nature of the attack on him and his friends showed that at least some of 'Group B' were intent on causing serious harm.
The court heard that 10 members of 'Group B' have, so far, been arrested, with murder charges also brought against another 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old youth.
The court was told Mr McCann went to the police later on 12 December to confirm he had been at the scene.
While he told officers, "I was fighting with the wee man who was murdered", he said he had only intervened to stop a clash between Mr Meli and one of those in his group.
He claimed to have thrown one punch in self-defence after a blow was directed at him, the court heard.
Opposing bail, the prosecution also expressed concerns for Mr McCann's safety.
A defence barrister said Mr McCann had provided a full account to police once he learned of the death.
"None of the witnesses who have made statements have implicated him in the murder," he said.
Granting bail, the judge banned the accused from entering the city, or either the Twinbrook or Poleglass estates, and ordered him to live under curfew at an undisclosed address.
