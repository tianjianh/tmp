A woman who was repeatedly raped as a teenager by Ray Teret has described how he "wrecked" her life.

The former DJ and friend of Jimmy Savile abused 11 girls aged between 12 and 15 between 1962 and 1979.
One of Teret's victims, who has asked to be known only as Cathy, has decided to waive her anonymity.
She met Teret at his Greater Manchester record shop when she was looking for part-time work.
Teret first raped her when she was 12 in 1972, with the abuse continuing for a number of years.
"He knew I was a kid, he could see I was a kid. I've had to live with what he has done all my life," she told BBC News.
At Manchester Crown Court, Teret, 73, was found guilty on Friday of 18 charges of sex abuse, including seven counts of rape.
"I came across Ray Teret because they opened up a record shop in the area, so like all kids at the time I liked music so I went into the record shop," Cathy said.
"I remember being too young for a paper round, but I was desperate to get a part-time job so I could buy records. Teret offered me a job helping out in the shop."
The DJ had a long career in broadcasting, working at various radio stations including Radio Caroline and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio.
"It's almost like a trap, that's the only way I could describe it. You get in too deep and you're trapped," she said.
"If you said 'no', it wasn't heard. And I did say 'no', several times, and that wasn't heard. So it was a case of go along with it so it will be over."
Cathy said she approached the police and social services 20 years ago to alert them, but "nobody would listen".
"We need support and we need hearing and we need justice, but it's so difficult because you're taking on society as well."
Cathy said she decided to speak out about her ordeal to support other victims of abuse. She feels some have been negatively portrayed in the media as "star-struck teenagers".
"They know nothing about these girls and what we go through with people like him.
"They know nothing about what it does to us, we're not interested in bloody compensation, we're not interested in stories - we just want justice.
"They have wrecked our lives, Teret wrecked my life."
Teret was jailed for six months in 1999 after being convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 16 the previous year.
While discussing the pressures of giving evidence during a trial, Cathy said: "It was absolutely terrifying, but I've done it and it was worth it.
"Everyone has the right to tell people like him - 'you can't do this, you can't get away with this'."
