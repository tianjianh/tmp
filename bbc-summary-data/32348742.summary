Dolphins are one of Aberdeen's biggest tourist attractions, with the city regarded as being among the best places in Europe to spot them.
Volunteers from RSPB Scotland's Dolphinwatch expect thousands of visitors to try to catch a glimpse of the spectacular sea antics over the summer.
The Dolphinwatch project was pioneered in 2013.
The team will be at Torry Battery from 11:00 to 18:00 every Thursday to Sunday until 16 August.
Dolphinwatch team member Helen Hiley said: "Aberdeen is such a fantastic place to see dolphins and it's amazing to have a wildlife spectacle like this so close to a city centre.
"You often get great views of them feeding and playing at the harbour entrance."
Amateur photographer David McCulloch, who took a recent dramatic shot which has proved popular on social media, described the experience of capturing the image as "out of this world".
