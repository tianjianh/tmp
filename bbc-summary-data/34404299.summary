[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have denied being part of a Â£10m Hatton Garden safety deposit box raid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Reader, 50, of Dartford, and Carl Wood, 58, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, each pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit burglary with intent to steal.
Three other men entered not guilty pleas to the same charges earlier this month, while four admitted the charges.
The heist took place in a vault in the famous London diamond district.
Heavy cutting equipment was used to break into Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter weekend.
More than 70 deposit boxes were ransacked.
Appearing at Woolwich Crown Court, Mr Reader, of Dartford Road, and Mr Wood, of Elderbeck Close, also each denied one count of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, namely a quantity of jewellery and other items.
Three other men - Hugh Doyle, 48, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield, north London; William Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, east London; and taxi driver John Harbinson, 42, of Beresford Gardens, Benfleet, Essex - entered not guilty pleas to the same charges earlier in the month.
All five defendants are due to stand trial on November 16.
The four who admitted conspiracy to burgle at an earlier hearing will be sentenced at a date still to be confirmed.
