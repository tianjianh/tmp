They struck inside two minutes through Moussa Dembele's tap-in from close range and he added a second by finishing Tom Cairney's cross.
Ross McCormack curled in a free-kick from 30 yards just after the half-hour and there was worse to come for City.
Ryan Tunnicliffe made it 4-0 after lobbing keeper Frank Fielding, before Jonathan Kodjia scored an injury-time consolation for Bristol City.

The result left City just a point above the relegation zone, with only Charlton, Rotherham and Bolton below them, while Fulham moved up to 10th, four points outside the play-off places.
The damage was done in the first 36 minutes, with Dembele firstly firing home from six yards after James Husband got behind City's defence.
Aden Flint's ill-advised crossfield pass was then intercepted by McCormack, who fed Cairney and his delivery from the right allowed Dembele to side-foot home his second at the far post.
McCormack's sweetly-struck free-kick and Tunnicliffe's goal after running onto a bouncing ball that split City's back-line put Fulham out of reach.
City at least managed to get on the scoresheet as Kodjia converted a cross from substitute Simon Cox, shooting first time past Andy Lonergan from eight yards.
Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill:
"We made a couple of mistakes to give Fulham a leg-up in the game and we are very disappointed with the goals conceded.
"We came up against opponents with that bit more quality than us and they took their chances. We have to create more opportunities than our rivals to score goals.
"We are in for training tomorrow and will dust ourselves down in time to face Wolves on Tuesday."
Fulham boss Kit Symons:
"First half I thought we were excellent and took our goals really well.
"We could have put the game to bed in the second half with a couple of early chances, but Bristol City kept on going and made it more difficult for us."
On 19-year-old striker Moussa Dembele: "Talks over a new contract are in progress and we want him to sign."
