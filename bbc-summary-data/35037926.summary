MSPs to debate Aberdeen's Marischal Square development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen's controversial Marischal Square development is to come under the scrutiny of MSPs at Holyrood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SNP Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart has secured a members' debate on the Â£107m project.
It is creating offices and a hotel on the site of the former council headquarters.
The motion to be debated on Tuesday evening asks for the concerns of the Reject Marischal Square campaign group to be noted.
Opponents fear council tax payers in Aberdeen could foot a bill for millions of pounds in the event of the complex being under occupied. They also say it spoils the view of historic Marischal College across the road.
The protestors failed in their bid to get the development halted in March.
The council said Marischal Square would act as a catalyst for regeneration and was an important part of its city centre master plan.
Developers Muse said it would be a world class project.
