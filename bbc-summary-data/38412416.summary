[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 0-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forward Scott Kashket scored in his fourth successive game to hand Wycombe the points at struggling Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old netted in the ninth minute, drilling his 20-yard shot into the bottom left-hand corner of Russell Griffiths' goal following a clever lay-off from strike partner Adebayo Akinfenwa.
The promotion-chasing Chairboys dominated the first period and also had two penalty claims turned down - one for handball and the other for a challenge on Kashket who was instead booked for diving.
But Cheltenham regrouped after the break and created a string of chances in the second half.
Harry Pell headed a corner just over the target within a minute of the restart before substitutes James Dayton and Amari Morgan-Smith went close.
With 11 minutes to go, Dan Holman drilled a low shot goalwards on the turn only to be denied by a fine save from former Robins goalkeeper Scott Brown.
And the visiting shot-stopper was twice called on in injury time to keep out long-range efforts from Dayton and Rob Dickie as Wycombe held on for victory.
