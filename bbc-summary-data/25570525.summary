Kate Stone, 44, from Cambridge, was injured by the animal near Fort William at about 02:30 on Monday.
She was treated by paramedics before being taken to Fort William's Belford hospital, and later transferred by air to the Southern General in Glasgow.
She has been put into an induced coma for a week and her condition is stable.
A statement released by a colleague at Dr Stone's print firm, Novalia, said she had an operation late on Tuesday afternoon to try to repair damage to her trachea.
It said: "The operation went well and she remained stable throughout.
"The doctors made a decision to keep her in an induced coma for the next week to minimise any movement that may rupture the wound. She remains in a stable condition and she is now in the healing process from the first operation.
"Her family are with her over this new year period and all her friends are continuing to offer support."
Dr Stone was standing with a group of friends outside a private residence in Lochailort when the incident happened.
She had been on a short break in the Highlands, staying at the Mo-Dhachaidh B&B in Lochailort, which is owned by Gary Burton.
Mr Burton said he heard about the attack when one of Dr Stone's friends returned at about 02:30.
"I think what happened was that the stag panicked," he said. "It was trapped in a fenced garden, having got through a gate. I don't think there was anywhere else to go and it charged out of the gate," he said.
"It's very bizarre and very horrific."
He described it as a "one-in-a-million event".
