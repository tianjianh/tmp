The Living Advent Calendar will run for 24 evenings with a random performance at 18:15 GMT each day.
Organiser Julie Perigo said: "A door or window opens somewhere in the town and a 15 minute performance takes place."
Henley resident Gary Connery, the stunt double who jumped out of a helicopter in the guise of the Queen will be the first performer.
Venues for the calendar include the Leander Club, Henley Fire Station and The River and Rowing Museum.
The event helps raise funds for three charities, Sue Ryder Care, Camp Mohawk and The Chilterns Centre.
