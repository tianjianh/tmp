Davoud Taghinejad, 58, who committed the crimes between 2011 and 2013, is being held in custody to await sentencing on Tuesday.
The assaults involved five girls who were aged between 13 and 17 at the time.
A jury of seven - three women and four men - delivered its verdict at Douglas Court House.
Deemster Alastair Montgomerie said Taghinejad was facing a "substantial" prison sentence.
He added: "It has taken a great deal of courage for the victims in this case to come forward and give evidence.
"They are all young girls and they should be proud of the dignity with which they have conducted themselves during these proceedings.  I hope now they can move on with their lives."
During the two-week trial the jury heard evidence from the girls, some by a live video-link-up.
They told how Taghinejad introduced "games" into their maths lessons.
These games involved the children holding their breath while Taghinejad felt for their heartbeat - and indecently assaulted them.
One girl described how this "game" later progressed into rape.
Taghinejad taught at North Trafford College in Greater Manchester for 10 years before moving to the Isle of Man in 2009.
