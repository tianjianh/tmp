Londoner Waters, 30, who beat world champion Laura Massaro in the quarter-finals, lost 11-6 11-9 9-11 11-5 to third seed Raneem el Weleily in Cairo.
Meanwhile, world number one Nicol David reached her eighth world final after coming back from two games to one down to defeat Egypt's Omneya Kawy.
The Malaysian, 31, will face Weleily, who is in her first final, on Saturday.
After rallying to win 11-9 9-11 8-11 11-5 11-5, David said: "I played with more purpose with my shots and she attempted a few things which were out of reach, and made a few unforced errors."
Weleily, who will play the final in front of her home crowd, said: "Somehow I have to handle it as if it were just another match."
