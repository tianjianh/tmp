South Korean media discovered accounts thought to belong to Kim Han-sol, the 16-year-old son of Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-il's eldest son, on Saturday.
According to reports, the posts revealed a teenager who said he was in favour of democracy and that his favourite film was "Love Actually".
Photos showed Kim Han-sol with bleached blonde hair and dressed stylishly.
He is now believed to have blocked public access to his social networking accounts after being bombarded with South Korean media attention, the Korea Herald reported.
Kim Han-sol's sense of fashion has provoked considerable interest in the South Korean media, with Facebook photos showing him wearing rimmed glasses, earrings and a pendant in the shape of a cross.
A photo taken with a young woman has attracted interest because Mr Kim captioned it with the comment: "I'm going to miss you so much", a South Korean paper reported.
The unidentified girl replied: "I love you too, yeobo." ''Yeobo'' is a term of endearment that husbands and wives in Korea use to address each other, the paper explained.
And in one post, the teenager is said to have asked fellow students if they preferred democracy or communism - and said he preferred democracy.
Kim Han-sol is believed to live with his father, Kim Jong-nam, in China and also in the former Portuguese territory of Macau.
On Friday, the United World College in Bosnia said that he would be enrolling there as a student.
The South Korean press also says it has discovered accounts belonging to Kim Jong-nam, who was passed over by his father as successor to the North Korean leadership.
His page contained posts insulting his half-brother, Kim Jong-un, his father's chosen successor.
The South Korean paper says Kim Jong-nam was posting under the name "Kim Chol", a pseudonym he uses for hotel reservations when travelling to Singapore and Hong Kong.
