The departure of the Portuguese coach was revealed on Monday, with Ahly's Twitter page declaring the 55-year-old's contract had been terminated.
On Tuesday the Portuguese side Porto confirmed earlier reports that Peseiro is the club's new coach.
Peseiro was appointed by Ahly only in October and the club said on Monday it dismissed him because he was "unable to withstand the pressure and criticism".
"The board has decided to terminate Peseiro's contract after he asked not to continue his mission," Ahly said in a statement on their website.
"Peseiro said he cannot bear the recent criticism and pressure anymore, plus that he already endures bad luck.
"Club president Mahmoud Taher tried to persuade the coach to stay put, promising him full backing. But he acknowledged that Ahly fans no longer accept his presence after the recent poor results."
Ahly have appointed Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Shafi as caretaker boss for the second time in a few months.
According to reports in the Portuguese media, Peseiro is on the verge of taking the reins at Porto, who are looking for a new manager after sacking Julen Lopetegui 11 days ago.
