More than 250 emergency service personnel, as well as Network Rail and South Eastern Trains staff, were involved in the simulation in Bromley.
The train crash was created on a section of line between Sundridge Park and Bromely North stations.
Volunteers from the Railway Industry First Aid Association played the 100 casualties in need of rescue.
Richard Welch from London Fire Brigade said: "Whilst this scenario may appear worrying and rail crashes are extremely rare, exercises like this are a vital way of practising our skills and ensuring that we are ready should there ever be a major incident in the capital.
"Days like this are a chance for firefighters to practise search and rescue skills as well as testing how we work with other agencies in the event of a major incident."
