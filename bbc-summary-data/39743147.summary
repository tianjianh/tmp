[SN]TITLE[SN]
Joshua Martin detained for killing six-month-old daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been detained for seven years for the manslaughter of his six-week-old daughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ezmai Martin was not breathing when she was found at a flat in Bordon, Hampshire, in June 2015 and later died.
Her father, Joshua Martin, 19, was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter following a trial at Winchester Crown Court.
The court heard the infant had apparently been "deliberately shaken" and suffered rib injuries.
More on this and other stories from across the South of England.
Her mother Jemma Pethybridge, 19, returned from the bathroom after 20 minutes to find her baby lifeless and with "milky vomit" coming from her nose and mouth.
Ezmai died after being transferred to St George's Hospital in London the following day.
A post mortem examination found she suffered a head injury which had caused a subdural haemorrhage and severe brain damage.
Prosecutors said although no attack was witnessed, there was no other possibility than that Martin had caused Ezmai's injuries.
The court heard Martin "trashed" the flat while his partner and daughter were at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, overturning furniture and pulling down curtains.
Martin, of Salisbury Road, Alton, was sentenced to seven years custody in an young offenders' institution with an extended licence period of 5 years.
