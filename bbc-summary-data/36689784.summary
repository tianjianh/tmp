Nurudinov, 24, lifted an Olympic record 237kg in the clean and jerk, as well as 194kg in the snatch, to give him a combined total of 431kg.
That was 14kg clear of Armenia's Simon Martirosyan, 19, who won the 2014 Youth Olympics title. Alexandr Zaichikov of Kazakhstan finished third with 416kg.
Kiribati's David Katoatau finished sixth in the B final but entertained the crowd with dances after each lift.
