Javier Ortega Desio touched down for Argentina after just two minutes.
However, Scotland soon found their rhythm, with the Grays and Sean Maitland replying before the interval.
Stuart Hogg and Tommy Seymour ran in further scores in a scruffy second half, while a Tomas Cubelli brace added to a penalty try for the Pumas.

A 10-point winning margin did not accurately reflect Scotland's superiority and late lapses in discipline and defence will need to be eradicated with world champions New Zealand coming up next weekend.
But there was much to take heart from as a young side featuring 10 Glasgow Warriors in the starting line-up picked up a first home victory over the South Americans since 1990.
The Scots were moving the ball well from the first whistle but when Greig Laidlaw was pole-axed in the midfield the ball spilled loose for Desio to collect and gallop clear from 40 metres and touch down.
It was not the start Cotter would have envisaged but the Scottish response must have thrilled the New Zealander.
A clean lineout gave the Scots an attacking platform in the Argentine 22 and, after some good carries from Blair Cowan among others, Richie Gray burst through the stretched defence to crash over.
A Nicolas Sanchez penalty nudged the visitors back in front while Laidlaw missed a routine kick following his earlier conversion.
A yellow card for Juan Imhoff was quickly exploited by the hosts after several phases of pressure resulted in Jonny Gray following his brother over the line. Laidlaw added the extras to make it 14-10.
The captain then set up Scotland's third try with the scrum-half catching the Pumas defence sleeping with a quick tap penalty and, after making 30 metres, showed great composure to float a pass to Maitland who coasted over.
Laidlaw converted and followed it up with a successful penalty to stretch the lead to 14 points at the interval.
The Scots were playing with a verve and attacking purpose not seen for some time, with Laidlaw at the heart of it.
The skipper broke through the Argentine defence once again early in the second half and kept his cool to find the pass that sent Hogg over in the corner.
Full of confidence, Laidlaw nailed the touchline conversion and added another three points with the boot just after the hour.
Having lost Rob Harley to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle, the Scots handed the initiative to the visitors and a penalty try was awarded as Cotter's men wheeled round a scrum near their own posts.
Any thoughts of a comeback were extinguished almost immediately when Seymour intercepted a risky pass from Juan Martin Hernandez to run in an easy try, with Laidlaw's conversion taking the score to 41-17.
Harley had just returned to the fray when replacement Jim Hamilton was sent packing after getting caught on the wrong side.
Cubelli dived over from close range to reduce the deficit and the same man grabbed another touchdown at the death.
