Nathan, 23, said he was worried being bisexual would be a problem with his male housemates.
"I was 100% nervous about what the other lads would think.
"I didn't have any queries with the girls because I thought they'd be more accepting but at the same time, I thought, 'I don't care. You take me as I come.' Not one of them was bothered."
He went on: "Gary came up to me and went, 'I just want you to know, we want to feel completely comfortable in this house. We want you to be yourself. You're in the house for you. We don't have any problem if you're bisexual or gay.'
"I feel like I've pulled Geordie Shore up by its ears, and I'm bringing it up to date. I've splashed colour in there, both in a sexual and physical way."
Figure skating champion Chloe, 19, admits she "hooked up" in the house, despite going in "not looking to get with anyone".
"I did end up hooking up with someone," she admitted in an interview for MTV.
"I didn't really get hurt, but I just wish I'd never gone there with this person. But the drink does that to you."
Chloe says she was also apprehensive before filming the show.
"I was really nervous going in the house because girls sometimes get a little bit: 'God, there's a new girl.'
"But I get on literally with anyone. So I was happy about that because I was so nervous in case they didn't like us but thankfully they did.
"Coming out of the house I felt more like a woman. I went in a girl and I've come out a woman because I've been hanging around with older people."
The new series also shows James Tindale announcing that he's leaving the house.
Vicky Pattison left Geordie Shore after nine series in October.
Geordie Shore was first broadcast in 2011 and was a version of MTV's US reality show Jersey Shore.
The new series starts on 7 April.
