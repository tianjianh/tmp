[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Priceless Classics on 6 September will see the orchestra play 10 short pieces at Manchester's Bridgewater Hall.
Holders of pre-booked free tickets will then be able to pay whatever they think the event was worth.
Chief executive John Summers said it would let new audiences "experience the Halle and enjoy some incredible music, but on their own terms".
"If people have not heard the Halle's music before, this is the perfect event for them."
Programmes will be distributed free at the concert, which will feature selections from Bach, Mozart and eight other composers spanning three centuries of music.
The concert will be conducted by Stephen Bell, who has spent the last two years as associate conductor of the Halle's Pops Series.
