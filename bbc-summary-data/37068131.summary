[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: Raith Rovers 2-0 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in eight second-half minutes maintained Raith Rovers' 100% start to the season in front of 5114 people against Dunfermline Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pars' Rhys McCabe shot over early on in the Fife derby, with goalkeeper David Hutton saving well from Lewis Vaughan's free-kick at the other end.
Bobby Barr's left-footed effort found the bottom-right corner from the edge of the box to give Rovers the lead.
Mark Stewart doubled the advantage as the home side stayed top of the table.
It was a deserved three points for the Kirkcaldy side after they dominated the second period and Stewart's goal in particular was a quite sensational strike from 18 yards into the top corner.
Referee Alan Muir booked five players in a feisty first half that was played at 100 miles an hour but provided few chances.
However, both Vaughan for the home side and Kallum Higginbotham for the Pars went close with free kicks.
On-loan striker Declan McManus was also dominant in the second half and he brought a couple of good save from David Hutton in the Dunfermline goal before Barr struck the opener.
Rovers stay level at the top with Hibs after three straight victories and have big games with Dundee United and Falkirk in the next couple of weeks to look forward to.
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "I'm delighted for everyone around the club.
"Dunfermline have held the upper hand in Fife derbies for a while, so today was a big result for us.
"Our keeper, Aaron Lennox, pulled his hamstring early in the first half, so he was struggling to finish and, with him and Kevin Cuthbert both struggling, I may have to ask the board to help me get another keeper in."
Dunfermline Athletic manager Allan Johnston: "It was a frustrating game to lose, but it is only the start of the season and we cannot let it affect us too much.
"However, we have got to learn to defend better as there was not much between the two teams.
"We need the team to learn quickly how to play in this division, but they will and we are still a decent side."
