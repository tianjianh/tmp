The historic win secures the team of a place in the final 16 of the Euro 2016 Championship, alongside Northern Ireland.
Paula McCann captured the celebrations on her way home from the 21:00 BST Novena service at Clonard Monastery.
She said she heard about the victory at the Monastery shop.
"I was delighted to find out that both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had made it through to the next round.
"As I was driving home, I came across a party taking place near to the monastery. It looked like they were having so much fun - I was really tempted to stop and join.
"Some of the fans came over and spoke to us in the car to tell us about the match. It sounds like it was a tricky enough game, but we were all routing for them to get a win and thankfully they did," she added.
However this wasn't the only celebration taking place in Clonard.
Even the priest delivering the last Novena service of the evening showed his support for the Boys in Green.
Northern Ireland will play Wales on Saturday at 17:00, while the Republic of Ireland will face the host nation France on Sunday at 14:00.
