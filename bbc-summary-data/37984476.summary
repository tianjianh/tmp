A statement by the Injured Jockeys Fund added that Tylicki and his family "are very relieved that his condition is improving" but he would remain in hospital "for some time".
Tylicki was injured in a four-horse pile-up at Kempton on 31 October.
Earlier, Tylicki tweeted about the "long road in front of me" in his first public comments since the accident.
The 30-year-old added that he was "struggling and fighting".
He also thanked people for their support, with a fund having raised more than Â£270,000 so far.
Tylicki was paralysed from the waist down following the incident, with champion jockey Jim Crowley and Ted Durcan suffering minor injuries.
A fourth jockey, Steve Drowne, and all the horses, were unhurt.
