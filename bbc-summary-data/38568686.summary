The grey-coloured machinery was taken from the AMD site on Newton Road at about 22:45 on Thursday after the security gate was breached.
At about the same time, the nearby premises of JG Findlay on Old Irongray Road were also broken into and hedge trimmers taken.
Det Con Ryan Kirk said it appeared that the thefts may have been linked.
"We are keen to trace a white or silver-coloured van which was seen in the Newton Road area at around 22:45 on Thursday night and which contained three men in dark-coloured clothing," he said.
"Anyone who may have been in the area and who saw anything suspicious is asked to call police at Dumfries on the 101 number."
