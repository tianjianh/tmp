Cumbria County Council wants to build a new wing at Sandgate School on the Queen Katherine School site in Appleby Road in Kendal.
Sandgate School has split locations in the town and the new development will mean year 7 to 9 pupils joining students at the Queen Katherine site.
The county council said it wanted to integrate children further with the "wider community".
A spokesman said, subject to planning permission, building work would begin in 2017 and the new building would open in 2018.
Sandgate is a 72-place school catering for children up to the age of 19 who have a very wide spectrum of needs.
Councillor Clare Feeney-Johnson, the council's member for schools and learning, said: "This development will create purpose-built facilities for the school and enable all of Sandgate's secondary age students to be on a single site.
"Pupils have been involved in the design process and their feedback has helped shape the layout of the new building."
