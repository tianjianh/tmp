Officers said there was no access to the County Tyrone town via Liskey Road as a result of the incident.
The PSNI warned in a tweet that the alert in Townsend Street was likely to cause some disruption to residents in the area.
The scene will remain closed until lunchtime while officers carry out further enquires.
Sinn Fein councillor Karina Carlin said she heard a bang in the town about 20:30 GMT on Tuesday.
"I went to the scene after the noise but I didn't see anything," she said.
"The police then arrived at the scene and set-up a cordon," she said.
"The police were trying to get residents out of their homes last night, but I urged them not to because there wasn't going to be any meaningful searching until this morning."
