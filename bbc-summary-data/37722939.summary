Barker, 22, won Olympic team pursuit gold in Rio alongside Joanna Rowsell Shand, Laura Trott and Katie Archibald.
She said: "It was a little bit lonely on the podium without any team-mates."
There were also bronze medals for Great Britain in the women's and men's team pursuit and a silver in the men's team sprint event in Paris on Thursday.
"It's been a really, really long time since I've done an individual race that I've actually done well at so it's a pretty new experience for me," added Wales' Barker, who finished second behind Ausrine Trebaite of Lithuania.
"I feel this is like the start of something new for me, taking a little bit of a step back from team pursuit. It's going to be interesting and quite fun."
Britain's Emily Kay, Dannielle Khan, Manon Lloyd and Emily Nelson had earlier landed bronze in the women's team pursuit, with Italy beating Poland in the race for gold.
The GB men's team pursuit quartet - Matthew Bostock, Oliver Wood, Kian Emadi Coffin and Mark Stewart - then equalled their achievement, catching the Dutch to win bonze while hosts France took gold ahead of Italy.
Britain's Jack Carlin, Ryan Owens and Joseph Truman went one better, taking silver in the men's team sprint behind Germany.
