[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola's Brown trial heard how her son Jake suffered a brain injury and a fractured skull before he died.
The 43-year-old from Portsmouth was found guilty in December and given a life sentence with a minimum 14-and-a-half year term in February.
The Court of Appeal said Brown's appeal was in the "very early stages".  A Serious Case Review has been carried out but not yet published.
Brown's trial heard how Jake died on 19 December 2014 due to "an impact to the head requiring substantial force".
Winchester Crown Court also heard Jake had previously suffered 17 broken ribs.
Passing sentence, Mr Justice Dingemans said he accepted Brown was suffering from a mental disorder.
The judge said the boy's mother had been prepared to blame others for his death, including health care professionals, and had refused to accept responsibility.
Brown had not informed her doctor she was expecting the child and social services were alerted to the "concealed pregnancy".
