Jacqueline Gold has been honoured for her services to entrepreneurship, women in business and social enterprise.
She has described how she set out to empower women in the bedroom and now supports women in the boardroom.
Ann Summers has 140 stores across the UK and Republic of Ireland - the Surrey businesswoman's personal wealth is estimated at more than Â£500m.
Ms Gold joined the family firm in 1979, aged 19, and became its chief executive in 1993.
"It's been a very colourful journey for me," she said.
"I have a six-year-old daughter and it gives me the greatest pleasure that she will see her mother go to the Palace and it's fantastic to think I'm a role model for her."
The chain currently employs more than 10,000 people, operates online and offers Ann Summers parties in people's homes.
Alongside her work to build Ann Summers, Ms Gold, who lives in Oxted, has set up the WOW network, which supports and celebrates women in business and through which she personally mentors female entrepreneurs.
She is also vice-president of the Children's Trust and is a supporter of both the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) and the Retail Trust.
The 55-year-old, whose father is publishing tycoon and football club chairman David Gold, said she was delighted about being included in the New Year Honours list.
"When you feel so passionately about what you do and what you believe in, it's hard not to get emotional, so when I heard I didn't know whether to laugh, cry or scream," she said.
After more than 35 years in business, she said she had seen many highs and a few challenges but always stayed true to her beliefs and her ambition to create a business that empowered women.
