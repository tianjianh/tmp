Aberavon search for man was false alarm, coastguards say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coastal search involving lifeboats and a rescue helicopter for a man seen entering the sea in Neath Port Talbot was a false alarm, coastguards say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Milford Haven Coastguard launched the search at 19:40 GMT on Thursday after a couple reported seeing the man enter the sea at Aberavon Sands, Port Talbot.
A man later contacted police saying he saw the search operation and thought it might be for him.
Coastguards described it as a false alarm with "good intent".
