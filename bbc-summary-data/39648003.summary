Leyton Orient: Unpaid staff had 'no communication' from owner Francesco Becchetti

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at Leyton Orient say they have had no correspondence from club owner Francesco Becchetti as they await their wages for March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a statement, club employees say they are "hugely concerned" by the "lack of communication" from the O's hierarchy.
Orient are bottom of League Two and their 112-year Football League stay could end with relegation on Saturday.
"We appeal to the club's directors to communicate the situation and provide us with an update regarding our pay."
The statement added: "A formal grievance was raised by club staff in lin e with the club's policies and procedures, though to this date it remains unacknowledged with no indication as to when, or if, we are to be paid."
The club's staff are due to be paid their April wages in nine days' time.
The East London side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes, and while those debts have now been paid, money is owed to four other creditors.
Orient also survived an immediate winding-up order last month, with Italian Becchetti given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club.
"With debts continuing to mount and us as staff not being paid our contractual wage, it raises questions as to whether the directors are on course to meet this arrangement," the staff statement continued.
"Despite their concern club staff have continued in their respective roles, rallying behind the team in their bid to preserve Leyton Orient's proud English Football League association."
