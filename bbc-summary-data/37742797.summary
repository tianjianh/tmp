The body has yet to be formally identified but police believe it to be that of a 30-year-old woman who has been missing for six days.
Pardeep Kaur was last seen on the afternoon of 16 October in Harlington High Street, west London.
Two men, aged 30 and 31, who were arrested on Wednesday over Ms Kaur's disappearance, have been bailed.
The Met is appealing for witnesses.
Det Ch Insp Mark Dawson said: "At this early stage of the investigation I am appealing to any witnesses in the Carlton Avenue and Bedwell Gardens area who may have been driving to work to come forward as they may have seen Pardeep walking to work at about 06.30 BST on 17 October."
Ms Kaur's next-of-kin have been informed of the discovery.
