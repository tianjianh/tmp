Nearly 1,000 customers were left without electricity in Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon as Storm Barbara moved in from the Atlantic.

Most of the 941 affected were living in south Down. Engineers worked to repair faults as gusts of wind up to 70mph (110km/h) battered the coastline.
Currently, 148 customers across Northern Ireland remain without power.
An NIE spokesperson said any faults were being repaired quickly by emergency teams.
A yellow warning has been issued for Northern Ireland by the Met Office. Weather warnings are in place across the Republic of Ireland, in north-west Wales, northern England, and Scotland.
Northern Ireland Electricity Networks had warned of the possibility of damage to the power network, especially in exposed and coastal locations.
Emergency crews, engineers and local incident centre staff have been put on standby throughout the Christmas period.
The storm has been accompanied by heavy rain, making for poor driving conditions and some surface water flooding, as well as large waves.
"We would like to remind customers that if they do lose electricity supplies they should report the fault online at nienetworks.co.uk or call the NIE Networks Customer Helpline on 03457 643 643. Customers can also follow us on Twitter @NIElectricity for regular updates," said Julie Carson from NIE Networks.
The second highest wind warning - Status Orange - has been issued by Met Ã‰ireann for coastal regions and high ground parts of Donegal and Mayo.
That means to be prepared for possible disruption for weather conditions "which have the capacity to impact significantly on people in affected areas".
In Britain, an amber warning has been issued for north-west Scotland and the Northern and Western Isles, where gusts could reach up to 90mph.
Across Ireland, gusts up to 70mph are expected within yellow warning areas, with stronger gusts expected in exposed areas to the north west in the Status Orange area.
Winds are not expected to be as strong on Christmas Eve as Storm Barbara moves away, but a further spell of windy weather will move in on Christmas Day as Storm Conor moves in.
Strongest winds are expected in northern Scotland but gusts of up to 60mph are expected here, especially over high ground, but are forecast to ease through the afternoon.
The weather warning for wind comes into force at 03:00 GMT Christmas Day until 18:00 GMT.
Almost exactly 100 years ago, another storm brought disruption across Ireland and Britain with flooding and deaths reported as a result on 22 December 1916.
Newspaper reports included details of fairs abandoned in Athlone and Ballymore due to floods, while "hay and oats were tossed in the Clogher Valley".
But it is too early to speculate on what damage Storm Barbara may cause.
