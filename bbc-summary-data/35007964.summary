A new statue of The Beatles has been unveiled in Liverpool - 50 years after their last show in Merseyside.

The bronze sculpture, which weighs 1.2 tonnes, has been given to the city by the Cavern Club - the venue synonymous with the Fab Four in the 1960s.
The depiction of the band walking along the Mersey reflects a real photo shoot.
Sculptor Andy Edwards said he hoped his statue, which stands on the Pier Head, would become "a place of ritual" for people to come together.
"I can remember walking around the waterfront with the original sketch models and everybody wanted to talk to us," said Mr Edwards. "Everybody has a Beatles story.
"Our image of them seems to bring past, present and future together, like a time machine."
The idea for the statue came from Chris Butler, managing director of Castle Fine Art Foundry Ltd, which has a studio in the city.
"This is a statue that needs no title, no explanation, no instruments, no gimmicks," he said of the piece inspired by the 1963 photo shoot. "It's a monument to a moment and the moment started in Liverpool."
John Lennon's sister, Julia Baird, said: "The statue stands in loving memory of the best band in the world - the band that leapt from The Cavern stage to worldwide recognition."
The Deputy Mayor of Liverpool Ann O'Byrne said she was "delighted" to see the new statue.
She said: "Talk to anyone in or outside the city about our history and you can guarantee The Beatles will get a mention, so it feels right that this sculpture of these iconic men stands proudly on our iconic waterfront."
The Beatles made their final public appearance in their home city at the Empire Theatre on 5 December 1965.
