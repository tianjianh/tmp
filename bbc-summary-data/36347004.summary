In far from ideal conditions, the Olympic champion was only 10cm below his season's best, set in April.
"I've opened the season better than I've opened before," said Rutherford. "Touch wood it continues."
Dafne Schippers won the women's 100m and Kim Collins, 40, the men's, while Tiffany Porter won the 100m hurdles.

World 200m champion Schippers took the women's 100m in 10.94 seconds on a chilly Friday night.
Britain's European champion Porter came home first in the women's 100m hurdles, clocking 12.89 secs despite a scrappy performance.
"The championships are the main focus. We're still in some heavy training so I'm pleased to come away with the win," said Porter, the world indoor 60m bronze medallist.

Former Commonwealth champion Kim Collins won the men's 100m in 10.08 secs, pushing reigning 60m world indoor champion Trayvon Bromell into second, with Britons Chijindu Ujah and Richard Kilty third and fourth.
"When you step on the line age has nothing to do with it, you step on the line as men," said veteran St Kitts and Nevis sprinter Collins.
"My personal goal is to be the first over-40 under 10 seconds in the 100m and then retire."
Rutherford, returning from a three-month training block in Arizona to compete in Manchester, said adjusting to the British weather was "a bit of a shock".
"We're hopefully going to have a good run into the Olympics," he added.
"It's always at the back of your mind. Ultimately, you want to set yourself up for a good Olympic Games. Not many people have retained it and I've got a good as chance as any."
Elsewhere, Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey won the men's 150m in 15.10 secs, compatriot Sebastian Rodger claimed victory in the men's 200m hurdles (22.66 secs) and America's Ryan Wilson won the men's 110m hurdles (13.62 secs).
In the women's pole vault, America's Katie Nageotte won with a 4.50m vault, while Germany's Laura Muller won the women's 200m in 23.11 secs.
