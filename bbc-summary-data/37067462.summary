[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-1 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Simon Cox's late penalty rescued a point for Southend as they drew 1-1 with Bristol Rovers at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers seemed set for all three points when Peter Hartley headed them in front midway through the second half but Cox's 81st-minute spot-kick ensured the game ended all square.
The Pirates went close to scoring at the end of an uneventful first half when Ollie Clarke saw a 20-yard shot pushed wide of the left post by Shrimpers goalkeeper Mark Oxley.
After the break, Southend winger Stephen McLaughlin had an effort easily gathered by Steve Mildenhall before Matty Taylor's 20-yard shot was tipped over by Oxley.
Rovers netted from the resulting Chris Lines corner from the left-hand side as an unmarked Hartley headed home from inside the six-yard box.
Southend drew level in the 81st minute when referee Gavin Ward harshly adjudged Ellis Harrison to have handled Jack Bridge's left-wing cross and Cox confidently stroked the penalty past Mildenhall.
