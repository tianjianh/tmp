The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday morning.
The 23-year-old was arrested in Ardcarn Park for endangering aircraft. He has since been released on bail to appear for questioning at a later stage.
In a tweet, PSNI Air Support said the incident had happened while the helicopter was supporting police officers in the area.
Earlier this month, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), called for laser pointers to be classed as "offensive weapons" after a pilot was injured by a beam, shortly after taking off from Heathrow to New York.
