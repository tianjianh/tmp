A driver has defended parking his car across two spaces in a supermarket car park to protect it from "clowns who can't drive".

Luke Varley, from Doncaster, was criticised on a Facebook group dedicated to photographs of people's parking blunders.
The 24-year-old said the abuse was "water off a duck's back".
The sales assistant said he chose to park across two bays to ensure his new car did not get scratched.

Mr Varley's parking was featured within a private Facebook group after a shopper spotted his Vauxhall Astra positioned across two bays.
He said: "I've had a few people tutting and everything - but it's water off a duck's back to me. It doesn't bother me."
He added: "It's out of the way, where people who are disabled or have kids wouldn't park anyway. It's always when car parks are fairly quiet - if there weren't enough spaces I would park properly.
"And I'd never park in a disabled bay or a parent and toddler bay, as they're for another use."
Parking across two spaces has been dubbed "Clarkson Parking", after the TV presenter joked about doing it on Twitter.
Mr Varley told the Daily Mirror he did it due to the "amount of clowns who can't park or drive".
Further comments were made on BBC Radio Sheffield's Facebook page after Mr Varley spoke to the station on Thursday.
One individual labelled Mr Varley "a prat", but others supported his actions in protecting his car.
Adam Clarke said: "Maybe the owner has saved for ten years for that car? Then you get some old people carrier with young kids, who just fling doors open without consideration to the damage they may cause".
A spokesperson for the British Parking Association, which represents parking and traffic management operators, said "inconsiderate parking" causes problems for other motorists.
It advised that failing to abide by the terms and conditions set out on parking notices could lead to a penalty notice being issued by the car park operator.
