Swindon chairman Lee Power confirmed the club have changed their structure following the appointment of David Flitcroft as manager on 5 June.
Former Tottenham and Aston Villa boss Sherwood arrived at Swindon in November to oversee transfer activity.
However, Swindon won just seven of their 31 games after his appointment  and were relegated from League One.
Sherwood's exit follows Power vowing to change the way Swindon works day-to-day in pursuit of promotion back to League One at the first attempt.
Power told BBC Wiltshire last month the club will take a "more traditional route" in recruitment, meaning former Barnsley and Bury manager Flitcroft will have sole control over transfers.
Flitcroft, who has brought Ben Futcher in from Bury as his assistant manager, will benefit from one of the biggest budgets in League Two, but said he still had to get "value for money" from his players.
"Budget doesn't guarantee anything. There have been some big-budget teams that haven't got out of the league in the last few years," he continued.
"We're competing against League One. Even though Swindon is a big draw, we're in League Two, and I think that could potentially be the Achilles heel to signing players.
"But there will be plenty of players that do want to come and it's been very encouraging so far."
Swindon have offered new contracts to captain Nathan Thompson, Yaser Kasim, Raphael Rossi-Branco, Jermaine Hylton and Jon Obika, but are yet to make any new signings this summer.
