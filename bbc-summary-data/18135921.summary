Chelsea fans across the world are celebrating their team's historic Champions League win, ahead of a victory parade in west London.

Hordes of jubilant supporters are expected to salute their heroes as they pass in an open-top bus, following the dramatic victory over Bayern Munich.
The procession is due to start from Stamford Bridge at 16:00 BST.
It comes less than 24 hours after the  
          Blues won 4-3 on penalties at Bayern Munich's home ground in Germany.
Bayern had looked on course to win their fifth European Cup when they scored late in the game to give them a 1-0 lead.
But Didier Drogba equalised from a corner in the 88th minute to take the match into extra time.
A penalty by Bayern winger Arjen Robben was later saved by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, leaving the final to be decided in a shootout.
As well as the Champions League trophy - the first time it has ever been won by Chelsea or any London club - the players, management and staff will show off the FA Cup during the parade.
The  
          Blues beat Liverpool 2-1 at Wembley on 5 May
 to clinch that piece of silverware.
The parade will begin from Stamford Bridge's west entrance before travelling east along Fulham Road.
It will turn right into Hortensia Road and then right again on to King's Road, before then going down New King's Road.
It is expected to take about 35 minutes for the team to arrive at Eel Brook Common, where the bus will make a short stop, before the parade ends at Parsons Green.
During Chelsea's last victory parade, to toast Premier League and FA Cup wins in 2010, some 70,000 fans lined the streets.
Hammersmith and Fulham Council is closing several local roads for the event.
Councillor Nick Botterill, the authority's deputy leader, said: "Chelsea's historic Champions League and FA Cup double is a monumental achievement that will never be forgotten in these parts.
"Like a phoenix from the flames, Roberto Di Matteo turned around what could have been a disappointing year for the Blues to deliver the top prize in world club football to west London.
"We are proud to have three magnificent football clubs in our small borough - but this will forever be remembered as the year the Blues achieved their European destiny."
Sports Minister Hugh Robertson congratulated di Matteo and the club for their "fantastic achievement in Munich".
"It is the end of a long journey for many at Chelsea to lift this trophy," he said.
"Coming after the arrival of the Olympic flame, it marks the start of a fantastic summer of sport."
Speaking about the parade, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers will be in the area "to assist".
"There will be some police presence to make sure everyone is safe," he said.
"We will need to manage the crowd to make sure too many people aren't in one area at one time."
There are no plans for a victory parade for West Ham, who won the Championship play-off final on Saturday.
