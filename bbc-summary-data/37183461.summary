The singer joins Sir Elton John, Alicia Keys, Calvin Harris and Robbie Williams on the bill at London's Roundhouse next month.
The 1975, OneRepublic, Bastille, Michael Buble and Chance the Rapper will also headline the annual festival, which is now in its 10th year.
The event begins on 18 September and runs to the end of the month.
It will be Spears's first UK concert since 2011, when she was on her Femme Fatale tour.
"I'm so excited to go back to London, which is a special place for me to visit. It's going to be a great party," she said.
The announcement came as US network Lifetime confirmed it was making a two-hour biopic about the singer, to air next year.
The 10 performances at the Apple Music Festival will also be made available live and on-demand to Apple Music members.
"Over the past decade, the festival has brought the biggest and best artists from all over the world to London and into the homes of millions of music fans," said Apple's Oliver Schusser.
"This year's Apple Music Festival builds on that incredible legacy and we couldn't be more excited to have another amazing line-up to celebrate our 10th birthday."
