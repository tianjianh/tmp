The 29-year-old joined on a one-year deal earlier this month, having been without a club after leaving AC Milan.
Boateng repaid Las Palmas for declaring him their "most important foreign player" by scoring in the 31st minute.
The Ghana international tweeted his delight at scoring in "the four biggest leagues".
Boateng previously played for Hertha Berlin, Tottenham Hotspur, Borussia Dortmund, Portsmouth, Milan, twice, and Schalke.
Canary Islands-based Las Palmas finished one place above Valencia last season, having been promoted in their previous campaign.
