[SN]TITLE[SN]
Owner 'seriously damages' cottage's special qualities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a 19th Century cottage in Gwynedd has been ordered to restore its original features.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Permission was granted in 2007 for an extension and cow shed conversion at Ty'n y Ffridd, near Bala.
But work carried out was different to the original plans, while other changes had not received permission.
The Planning Inspectorate said it had "seriously damaged the special historic and architectural interest" of the cottage.
Following two appeals, the inspector upheld the requirements of Snowdonia National Park Authority's enforcement notice issued in 2015.
The owner now has two years to take down the extension, remove a concrete block wall and replace the modern windows with traditional ones.
