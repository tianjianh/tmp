[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cold case inquiry has been opened to try to find a father-of-two who has been missing from his home in Norfolk for almost four years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terry McSpadden, 24, of Elm, was last seen early on 2 March 2007, having spent the previous evening in the Locomotive pub in Wisbech.
He has not contacted his friends and family since.
Det Ch Insp Neil Luckett said: "We can find no significant reason for his disappearance."
"Terry was well known in the local community and he was very much a local man," he added.
Mr McSpadden is known to have visited Tesco in Wisbech just before 0100 GMT and is then believed to have returned home.
Since that time there has been no significant information about what has happened to him.
His mother and stepfather, Helen and Gerald Thrower, said in a statement: "Terry disappeared almost four years ago and it is difficult to remain positive. We can't believe he hasn't made contact with his children whom he loved very much."
His stepmother Susan Rolfe and father Stephen said any news would be "a great relief".
Norfolk Police described his disappearance as completely out of character and said they were very concerned for his welfare.
He is 6ft (1.83m), with brown eyes and had short cropped light brown hair. He has a scar under his lower lip.
Det Ch Insp Luckett added: "He was known as a reliable, hard worker by his employers. He had two young children and strong local ties.
"I would like to hear from anyone who has any information about what has happened to him or the circumstances of his disappearance."
