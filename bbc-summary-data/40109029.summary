[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England reached the quarter-finals of the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea with a last-16 victory over Costa Rica.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Everton striker Ademola Lookman fired England into a first-half lead before doubling the advantage after the break.
Costa Rica's Randall Leal saw his late penalty saved by goalkeeper Freddie Woodman but tucked in the rebound.
Paul Simpson's side held on and remain unbeaten having topped their group and will play Mexico in the quarter-finals on Monday in Cheonan.
Costa Rica thought they had drawn level at 1-0 down but had a goal ruled out for offside by the video assistant referee.
England's 19-year-old Lookman dominated the game, striking a free-kick against the crossbar in between two nifty finishes.
Everton team-mate Jonjoe Kenny drilled in a low cross for Lookman's first, before fellow Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin played the ball inside from the left flank and Lookman slotted the ball through the legs of keeper Erick Pineda.
England progressed to the quarter-finals of the tournament for the first time since 1993.
Their opening victory against Argentina ended a 17-match winless streak for the Young Lions.
