Bradley Parker, 19, and Daniel Maston, 18, from Burstwick, died when their Vauxhall Corsa collided with a Land Rover Defender on Newfield Lane, near Lelley.
Mr Maston was driving the car when it crashed at about 14:40 on Sunday.
Hull FC said Mr Parker's name would feature on the club's new strip as a mark of respect.
Mr Parker, from Burton Pidsea, a former Hull FC under-16s captain, left the side earlier this year to start an apprenticeship course.
The Super League club said in a statement: "A talented hooker, he excelled from a young age captaining his school rugby team, helping South Holderness to the Year 11 National Cup Final.
"He also went on to captain East Hull and Hull FC's scholarship side, before his performances earned him international recognition with the England Youth squad.
"On behalf of everyone involved at Hull FC, we would like to pass on our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families involved in this tragic incident, and Brad's contribution to the club from a young age will never be forgotten."
A vigil has been held at the scene of the incident by the family and friends of the two men.
The 69-year-old driver of the Land Rover suffered minor injuries.
Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
