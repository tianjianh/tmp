Zinedine Zidane can continue coaching Real Madrid reserves until his appeal against a three-month ban is heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Spanish court has suspended a ban on the former France midfielder and World Cup winner, 42, coaching Real Madrid Castilla.
The Spanish football federation punished Zidane and fellow reserve team coach Santiago Sanchez for not having the required qualifications.

Real said they would "pursue every legal avenue" to overturn the ban.
The European champions said Zidane was awarded the necessary licence by the French football federation.
He was appointed Real reserve-team boss this summer after working as assistant to first-team coach Carlo Ancelotti last season.
Zidane won the World Cup with France in 1998 and was named World Footballer of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003.
He spent five seasons with Real as a player after joining from Juventus in 2001 for Â£45.8m - then a world record fee - and scored the winner in the 2002 Champions League final.
Castilla were relegated from the second division last season, before Zidane joined the coaching staff. They are currently 14th in Group 2 of the regional four-group Segunda B, the third tier.
