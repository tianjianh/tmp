[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Balint Bajner is exactly the type of striker Notts County need to help their League One promotion bid, according to assistant boss Greg Abbott.

The 6ft 5ins-tall Hungarian, 24, has joined on a short-term deal - thought to be until the end of the season - after being released by Ipswich Town.
Bajner made his debut as a substitute in Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Doncaster.
"He is what we have been searching for since Jimmy Spencer got injured," Abbott told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"He is that player up the top who can keep the ball and bring midfield players into play.
"He looks a little bit ungainly but is really smooth around the ball. He will be a really good addition."
