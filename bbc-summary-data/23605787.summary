A celebration is being held in Glenelg on Thursday to mark the 45th anniversary of what is thought to be the last ferry of its kind.

The MV Glenachulish, which was built in Troon by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, operates on the oldest crossing from the mainland to Skye.
The Chicago Stock Yard Kilty Band, one of America's longest established pipe bands, is to play at the celebration.
In 1921 the band was set up by brothers Robert and James Sim.
The pair had served with Scottish regiments during World War I and their family was originally from Aberdeen.
Between April and October, the Glenachulish makes a short crossing of the Kylerhea Straits between Glenelg on the mainland and Kylerhea on Skye.
A car ferry has crossed the straits since 1934.
The service has been run by Skye Ferry since 2007. The community-owned company was set up after long-time ferryman Roddy MacLeod retired.
Last year, Glenelg hosted a party to mark Mars rover Curiosity's arrival at its namesake on the Red Planet.
