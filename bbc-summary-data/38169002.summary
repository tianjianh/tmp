Grainger, 41, won silver in the double sculls at this year's Rio Olympics - the fifth Olympic medal of her career.
The ball at Battersea Evolution was hosted by double Olympic bronze-winning diver Tom Daley and Strictly Come Dancing co-host Claudia Winkleman.
The GB women's hockey team, who claimed gold in Rio, won the Great Britain's Choice award.
Grainger took a two-year break from rowing after winning Olympic gold at London 2012, following silver medals at Sydney, Athens and Beijing.
But after a selection ordeal where her place was only confirmed six weeks beforehand, she won silver with Victoria Thornley in Brazil.
