Smith, 22, made his debut as an early replacement for Stephen Henderson in the 5-1 defeat at Norwich in February.
He was left on the bench for Forest's next game, as Vladimir Stojkovic was preferred. But, since then, Smith has made seven successive appearances.
"He is confident, young and is learning his lessons. He takes on advice," said Forest boss Mark Warburton.
Henderson was ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing an operation on his Achilles injury, and Warburton added: "Jordan has been thrown in and he has responded.
"It is a challenge at a tough level and he has done well. He is displaying all the right attributes.
"He is a young keeper who is being pushed and challenged but he communicates well with the defenders and they take confidence from him."
Forest are 20th in the Championship ahead of Tuesday's trip to play Wolves at Molineux, just two points clear of the relegation zone.
