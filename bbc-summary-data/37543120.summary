North Lanarkshire Council suspends three staff amid 'corruption probe'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Lanarkshire Council has suspended three members of staff amid an ongoing investigation into corruption claims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The investigation began in April after an anonymous letter made "serious allegations of corruption" about the council's procurement processes.
The staff, from the authority's Corporate Property and Procurement, were suspended on full pay following an internal audit investigation.
The council said a full disciplinary investigation would now take place.
North Lanarkshire Council chief executive, Paul Jukes, said: "I received an extensive report from internal audit last Friday (September 30).
"Having considered the report, I have taken the decision to suspend three members of staff from Corporate Property and Procurement on full pay to allow for a disciplinary investigation to take place.
"The council will have no further comment to make while this disciplinary investigation is carried out."
