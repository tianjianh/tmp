Robinson sealed victory for the Dons when he rose to head home a Barry Fuller cross eight minutes from time.
Victory leaves Wimbledon seventh in the League Two table, two points ahead of eighth-placed Wycombe and with a game in hand.
Crawley slip a place to 18th following the defeat.

"The game was everything I thought it would be. Our pitch isn't conducive to lower-league football let alone any league football.
"It was a scrap and they came to do a job on us. They'd just been beaten 5-0 last week, and we knew that we would have to just keep going.
"If we'd have come away with a point, I still would have said it was a point towards our total."
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"It's disappointing the way we conceded, the game plan was good and I've just said to the boys in there, I want to tell them well done but we've just been beaten again.
"It's there those fine margins where we switched off and it was good play by them. The one time we switched off, it sums us up.
"I am really gutted for the boys. You know it's four games to go till the end of the season and we will see where we are.
"I'm not digging them out, but our concentration levels have got to improve whether the players are here next year or not."
