Gregor Townsend says the security measures in place for their match against Racing 92 in Paris will not be a distraction for his players.

The European Champions Cup match was rearranged after November's terror attacks in Paris.
A man was shot dead on Friday while trying to attack a police station in the city.
"As a playing group we get on a bus and go straight to the stadium, so it won't affect us," Townsend said.
The Warriors squad were in Paris when the terror attacks in November claimed 130 lives. The match against Racing 92 was postponed along with all other sporting events in Paris that weekend.
Townsend says his players will be aware of the heightened security, but is confident they will keep their minds on the match.
''It's the anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attacks and we saw on the news that there had been another incident in Paris, so security will be a priority for us and for Racing," the Warriors head coach said.
"We are certainly aware there will be more security on show around the game and around our hotel.
"But I'm not worried about it being a distraction. The best security is the security you don't see.
"It will be more the supporters who have to take that little bit more time getting through security for the game."
Townsend says his players will be focussed on beating a team he says are the best in France, and features one of the best players ever to play the game.
''In Racing's previous Champions Cup matches, they selected experienced international players like New Zealander Joe Rokocoko and their French internationals.
"They also have Dan Carter who has just recently joined them after winning the World Cup with New Zealand. He's in great form, he had brilliant World Cup and has been outstanding since joining Racing.
''Since the original match in November was postponed they've become the best team on France and are top of their league.
''It's a huge match for use, we are still very much in the mix in the pool. Our destiny is very much in the hands of ourselves and Racing.
"If we win our remaining three matches we win the pool; if Racing win their matches they win the pool.
"If we lose tomorrow we have to look to the last two matches and see what we need to do to finish as pool runners up."
