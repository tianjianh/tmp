[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A long-running industrial dispute at the National Museum of Scotland has been resolved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
National Museums Scotland (NMS) and the Public and Commercial Service union (PCS) said they had reached an agreement over weekend pay.
They began talks last month after PCS suspended a series of planned strikes at the National Museum in Edinburgh.
The dispute centred over the removal of a weekend allowance from new members of staff.
PCS claimed the move had created a "two-tier workforce".
The dispute began three years ago, leading to a number of days of strike action by museum staff.
In a statement, NMS said: "Funding support from the Scottish government and efficiency savings have enabled National Museums Scotland and the PCS trade union to reach an agreement to buy out weekend working allowances and improve the pay of the lowest paid members of staff.
"The buy-out is a single one-off payment to end the allowances. This offer has been combined with a previously-made offer (December 2015) which improves the pay of the lowest paid members of staff.
"PCS membership considered the revised offer last week and agreed the proposals.
"This brings the dispute to an end and means the planned strike action for weekends during April will no longer take place."
The deal means staff will receive wage rises of between £221 and £1,634, with the lowest paid "gaining the most", according to the union.
"Most" PCS members will also receive compensation payments of between £600 and £15,000, with an average of more than £12,000 for those currently receiving the allowance.
The union said it had suspended the first three weeks of a planned six-week long period of "sustained weekend industrial action".
PCS national officer Lynn Henderson said "We are pleased to announce that our members have voted overwhelmingly to accept the offer from management.
"For PCS, the dispute was always about two things - low pay and ending the two-tier workforce. This deal meets both our objectives.
"This settlement is hugely significant for our members in National Museums Scotland who have shown that through united and determined action we can win significant results. even in the face of austerity."
