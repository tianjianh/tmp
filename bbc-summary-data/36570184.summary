Jordan Gibbins, 17, from Lonmay, near Fraserburgh, was alone in a Honda Civic when it crashed one-and-a-half miles south of Fraserburgh at about 03:10.
The road was closed for several hours following the accident for investigation work.
Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who might have seen his grey-coloured car prior to the crash.
Sgt Rob Warnock said: "First and foremost, my thoughts are obviously with the family and friends of this young man at this tragic time.
"I would appeal for anyone who might have seen the vehicle described in the moments leading up to the collision, or has any information about the incident itself, to contact police as we launch an investigation into what happened."
