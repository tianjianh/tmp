Shauna Moreland said she wanted to ask him: "Were you on the (IRA) army council? Did you order my mum's death?
Mr McGuinness has previously said he has no knowledge of the 1994 murder of mother of three Caroline Moreland.
He described the murder as "an absolute tragedy" and denied being on the IRA army council.
Caroline Moreland was taken from her home in west Belfast, tortured and killed.
Her body was found near Rosslea, County Fermanagh.
The IRA claimed she was passing  information to the police.
Speaking to BBC Newsline earlier, Shauna Moreland said :"The questions that I would have for him I would just like an honest opinion instead of the same answer that's given for every question that's posed.
"They don't want to answer, it's just 'we weren't involved, we weren't there'.
"It's not good enough, it's not good enough for people anymore."
Ms Moreland added that other families are also looking for answers about the deaths of their relatives.
"There are 11 or 12 other families. None of us are out to cause trouble or negativity toward the peace process.
She added:  "None of us want to go back to the way it was before. We just want answers and truth. And justice for our relatives."
A Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson said: "Martin McGuinness is more than willing to meet with Shauna Moreland.
"Mr McGuinness has already outlined to the Spotlight programme that it is certainly not the case that he was on the IRA army council.
"The killing of Caroline Moreland, like the deaths of all victims of the conflict, was an absolute tragedy, particularly for her young family."
On Tuesday, a BBC NI Spotlight programme revealed details of final recordings made by Ms Moreland, under interrogation, before she was shot dead.
In a harrowing, and unusual recording, Ms Moreland can be heard "confessing" to having been an informer.
Just before the ceasefires of 1994, she came under the suspicion of the IRA, was kidnapped, held for two weeks, and shot dead.
In the recording her interrogators made, she described how she was persuaded by British intelligence to pass on information.
Senior IRA sources have told the BBC that it is almost certain that one of her accusers was in fact a British agent, one of its most prized and senior - Freddie Scappaticci, who was given the codename Stakeknife.
