Walsall's highly-rated teenage left-back Rico Henry could be set for an extended spell on the sidelines after dislocating his shoulder.

The England Under-19 international had an MRI scan on Monday on the same shoulder he dislocated two seasons ago.
"It's the last thing we need," Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC WM.
"These things never come at good times. But we have to take it on the chin. It's part of football. We'll move on. We've got a Plan B ready."
Henry, 19, suffered the injury making a brave headed clearance after half an hour of Saturday's goalless draw at Oldham.
"He's dislocated it before," added Whitney. "It's the risks we take playing this game.
"He's gone for an MRI as we just needed to see if there was any damage to the structure around the shoulder."
Whitney expects both skipper Adam Chambers and midfielder Erhun Oztumer to be in contention for Tuesday night's trip to Chesterfield.
Going back to Chesterfield conjures up memories for Whitney, who took charge for the first time in March following the sacking of previous boss Sean O'Driscoll - and the Saddlers won 4-1 at the Proact Stadium.
