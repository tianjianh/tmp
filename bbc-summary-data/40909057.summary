The shower was due to peak in the UK on Saturday night, in a display also visible in other parts of the world.
Stargazers took to social media to say they had seen the display, in which 100 meteors had been expected an hour.
The Perseid meteor shower occurs every July and August as the Earth passes debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet.
Former England cricketer Paul Collingwood was among those who attempted to spot the meteors.
He tweeted that the shower had been "impressive".
