CCTV images of a man urinating on a war memorial are "an absolutely disgusting insult to the people who fought for Manchester," a councillor has said.

The man is seen by the city's cenotaph at St Peter's Square on Sunday morning.
Councillor Pat Karney said he had "absolutely no sensitivity" to the fact he was so close to the poppy wreaths.
"We've had a few incidents before, but this is the worst I've actually seen, he just sprayed a sacred part of Manchester," he said.
"He is drunk and men do these things and increasingly young women do these things as well, but it's absolutely no excuse."
The footage was handed to police who arrested and bailed a 24-year-old man.
The cenotaph commemorates soldiers from Manchester who fell in both World Wars and was relocated in 2014 to make way for Metrolink's second city crossing.
