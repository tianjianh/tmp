[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yew Tree Farm, near Coniston in the Lake District, was one of a number of properties she owned.
Open days will be held this Saturday and next, and a Herdwick sheep-themed exhibition is on show in the barn.
The property is now owned by the National Trust.
Current tenant, farmer Jon Watson said: People can go on the creaky floorboards, see Beatrix's furniture and look at her pictures.
"Beatrix bought the farm back in about 1930 and saved it from being turned into a forestry plantation.
"She was a great champion of the Herdwicks. She really believed in them, promoted them where she could and insisted her farm kept them."
The exhibition in the barn is running daily until 10 July and will feature photographs, paintings, spinners and weavers.
Famous for her stories featuring Peter Rabbit, Potter was also a prize-winning breeder and became the first woman to be elected president of the Herdwick Sheep Breeders' Association.
However, she died in 1943 before taking up the position.
She left 4,000 acres of land and countryside to the trust, as well as 14 farms.
