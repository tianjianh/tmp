The crash happened near Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, shortly before 07:00 BST on Sunday.
The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire road policing unit tweeted the driver was "OK this time" but warned people to avoid swerving for wildlife. The duck died in the crash.
"A duck's life is far less valuable than yours," police said.
