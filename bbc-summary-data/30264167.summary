The pair had lost as a mixed doubles team on day one, and went down again as Manila Mavericks lost to Indian Aces.
Murray and Sharapova were beaten 6-1 by doubles specialists Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza, after Murray had earlier lost 6-4 to Gael Monfils in singles.
Ana Ivanovic then beat Sharapova 6-3 as Indian Aces prevailed 24-15 overall.
The four-team event began in Manila on Friday and will move on to Singapore, Delhi and Dubai, with the final on 13 December.
Murray is only scheduled to play over the three days of the Manila leg before the Briton heads to the United States for his annual off-season training block.
Sharapova, the reigning French Open champion, only committed to play the first two days of the inaugural exhibition event.
"This is the first year. Everything is a learning process," said the Russian.
"I felt such a great amount of energy walking out to the court. I really felt the warmth here. I'm very blessed to have good fans who are committed and have followed me through so many years."
Sharapova admitted the 20-second shot clock - one of a number of innovations being used in the team format - was something she had struggled to get used to.
"I feel like pressing 'snooze' all the time," she said of the loud beeping that warns players if they are getting close to the time limit.
Murray will complete his IPTL stint on Sunday when Manila take on Singapore Slammers, with Tomas Berdych due to face the Scot in singles.
