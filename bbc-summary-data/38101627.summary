Loreto Douglas, 64, a child care worker from Derry, was airlifted to hospital but later died from her injuries.
The crash happened on the main Londonderry to Belfast road at about 09:15 GMT on Wednesday.
A man and another woman injured in the crash remain in hospital. Two further men have since been discharged.
On their Facebook page, the Lifestart Foundation in Derry, where Ms Douglas worked, described the loss of their "dearest friend and colleague".
"Loreto has been with Lifestart since the very beginning and she will be sorely missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing her.
"Loreto, good night and rest peacefully, your loving Lifestart family xx."
Lifestart's executive director Dr Pauline McClenaghan said Ms Doulglas was the "most generous, personable and kindest of people".
SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the family support worker was a "lovely lady who dedicated her life to helping others".
Inspt Ian Armour appealed for anyone who was travelling on the Glenshane Road on Wednesday morning and who witnessed the collision to contact police.
