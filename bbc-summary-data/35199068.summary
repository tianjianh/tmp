The 32-year-old man, who teaches at Arden Academy in Knowle, near Solihull, was arrested at his home in Dorridge earlier this month.
West Midlands Police said the allegations "relate to concerns about the man's behaviour with one pupil".

In the letter, Arden Multi-Academy Trust (AMAT) executive principal Martin Murphy said: "Following the police being notified of concerns relating to a member of our school staff, a police investigation has been launched and an arrest made.
"A small number of pupils at the school have or will be interviewed as part of this investigation and their parents are fully aware of the situation."
Mr Murphy added the academy had followed safeguarding procedures and asked parents to "limit any comments or speculation" while the criminal investigation continued.
There are about 1,600 pupils aged 11 to 18 at the academy, which describes itself as a "centre of excellence" which sets its pupils "high academic and personal standards".
Det Sgt Helen Wait, from West Midlands Police's public protection unit, said: "A 32-year-old teacher from Dorridge has been arrested as part of a police investigation into allegations of inappropriate conduct with a pupil.
"The man was arrested at his home around 09.30 GMT on Thursday December 17 2015."
The teacher has been released on police bail while inquiries continue.
