Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges have all received acting nominations for their roles.
The independent drama, which tells the story of a working-class family dealing with multiple tragedies, is also up for outstanding performance by a cast.
Moonlight and Fences have each received three nominations. Both are up for outstanding performance by a cast.
Denzel Washington and Viola Davis have been nominated for lead actor and supporting actress for Fences, a family drama set in 1950s Pittsburgh.
Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali have each received nominations in the supporting categories for Moonlight - a film about a boy growing up gay, black and poor in Miami.
The SAG awards are often seen as key indicators for the Oscars.
The nominations were announced a week after Manchester By The Sea was named the best film of the year by the National Board of Review.
La La Land, which leads the nominations for the Golden Globes, has received two nominations from SAG.
Its two stars - Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - have been nominated in the two lead acting categories.
Captain Fantastic, Lion, Hidden Figures and Florence Foster Jenkins have also earned two nominations apiece.
British nominees include Andrew Garfield (for Hacksaw Ridge), Emily Blunt (The Girl on The Train) and Dev Patel (Lion).
The ceremony will take place on 29 January 2017. Lily Tomlin has already been announced as the recipient of the 2017 SAG Lifetime Achievement Award.
A full list of this year's nominees is available on the SAG website.
