At least 23 people have been killed and hundreds more rescued across the state after days of heavy rain led to flooding in several areas.
The Greenbrier's host course, The Old White TPC in Greenbrier County, has suffered extensive damage.
Tour officials said it is beyond reasonable repair before the scheduled start date of 7 July.
"We are heartbroken by the devastation that the residents of West Virginia are experiencing at this time and the reports of lives lost due to the terrible flooding," said PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem.
"Cancelling the Greenbrier Classic is certainly the most prudent course of action, as our foremost concern is the well-being of those who are having to live through this tragic situation. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
"We know we will have the opportunity to return again next year and we look forward to that time," he added.
"But for now, that is of secondary concern. The priority is safety of the residents and their recovery from this disaster."
