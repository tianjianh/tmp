Dunfermline flat murder case not proven

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A self-confessed heroin addict has been cleared of murdering a Fife man and robbing him of drugs and money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case against Steven Thomson, 29, took a jury just under three hours to return a not proven verdict by majority at the High Court in Livingston.
He had denied killing Duncan Banks by repeatedly hitting him on the head with a blunt object and robbing him of a money, heroin, a wallet and a key.
Mr Banks was found dead on 28 September 2015 in Skye Road, Dunfermline.
He had suffered horrific head injuries including "extensive fracturing" to his skull and deep cuts and tears in his scalp which caused "traumatic" damage to his brain. The court heard him described as a likeable character who "wouldn't hurt a fly".
Judge Lady Rae told father-of-three Mr Thomson that he was free to leave the dock.
During the 14-day trial the jury heard that the murder weapon, thought to be a rusty claw hammer, was never found.
A spare key to Mr Banks' flat and the heroin and cash the dead man had from selling drugs to addicts in the Abbeyview area of Dunfermline were also missing.
The court heard that Mr Thomson, 39, was one of a select few people who Mr Banks allowed into his council flat in Skye Road.
The accused had even stayed over at Mr Banks' flat in the week leading up to his death in September 2015.
Giving evidence in his own defence, he told the jury he had been taking heroin in the flat less than two hours before police believe Mr Banks was murdered.
Mr Thomson's DNA was found on cigarette ends in an ashtray in Mr Banks' living room.
However, he insisted he was not guilty of murder and lodged a special defence blaming another man, Jamie Curtis, 44, for the crime.
He said the large sum of money seen on CCTV stuffed in his wallet later that morning was the proceeds from his own heroin dealing.
He said a fellow inmate at Perth Prison who claimed Mr Thomson confessed to him and another drug user - who gave evidence Mr Thomson had told him he was going to "rob" Mr Banks - were both lying.
Mr Banks' mother Dorothy Banks, 73, had told the jury her son had been in the grip of a drug habit for more than 20 years before his death and said heroin had changed his personality.
She said was being "threatened" over a drugs debt in the week before he was murdered and she last saw him four days before she learned he was dead.
