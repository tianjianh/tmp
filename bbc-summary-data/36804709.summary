Officers said the "unprovoked abuse" had been "disgusting".
The incident happened at about 17:00 on Wednesday 24 February on a tram at Murrayfield.
Officers are trying to identify a man who they believe can help with their inquiries. He is aged between 18 and 25, of large build, with short hair.
He was wearing a light-coloured jacket and had black headphones around his neck.
PC David Hughes said: "We will not and do not tolerate anyone involved in such unacceptable behaviour.
"This level of unprovoked abuse is quite frankly disgusting.
"We have carried out a number of lines of inquiry in an effort to trace the person responsible."
