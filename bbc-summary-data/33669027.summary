The crash happened on Sunday at about 09:00 BST on the A1123 in the centre of Wilburton village.
It is believed the tractor was towing a laden muck-spreader when it crashed into the house.
Investigations are continuing into the crash that blocked part of the High Street. In January 2011 a carrot tractor crashed into the house.
