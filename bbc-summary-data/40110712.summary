Fidel Barzegar, 23, headed a London-based gang which dealt drugs across the south west.
The group used a technique known as "cuckooing", where drug addicts are conned into allowing their homes to be used to deal drugs.
Barzegar and eleven others were sentenced at Truro Crown Court.
All 12 admitted a range of charges.
Members of the gang were caught making about 45 car journeys from London to Cornwall, described by judge Simon Carr as the "tip of the iceberg".
Barzegar was convicted after recorded conversations - in which he referred to himself as King Cornwall and boasted of having £60,000 - were heard by police.
During sentencing, Judge Simon Carr said the group had been involved in a conspiracy to supply drugs "for financial gain".
He added: "Some of you even posed for photos waving large wads of money."
The gang used various addresses around Cornwall to prepare the drugs for distribution on the streets of towns including Bodmin, St Austell, Camborne, Penzance and Truro.
Drugs were driven from London and delivered to local dealers who helped distribute them in 2015 and 2016.
The court heard Barzegar's gang targeted long-term addicts to help prepare and distribute the drugs.
Police raided addresses in Cornwall and London, seizing over 95 grams of heroin and 125 grams of cocaine, with a combined street value of £21,000.
They also found more than £29,000 in cash and £84,000 in bank accounts linked to the group.
Det Sgt Daniel Bickford, from South West Regional Crime Unit, said the group "preyed on vulnerable members of the Cornish communities".
