It is his first trip to the US since being appointed to the role in July.
He is expected to update officials on Stormont's political progress since the Fresh Start deal was reached last November.
He will also discuss the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union on the Northern Ireland economy.
The Northern Ireland Secretary will also meet US business leaders to promote inward investment.
Ahead of the visit, Mr Brokenshire said his "overriding message" to the United States was that Northern Ireland is "open for business".
"The UK has voted to leave the European Union and we are determined to build on our strengths as an open, dynamic, trading nation to forge a new global role," he said.
"The enduring friendship and close economic ties between the United Kingdom and the United States is a solid platform for Northern Ireland firms wanting to do business here.
"Exports from Northern Ireland to the US were up by 73.9% in the last year to Â£1.5bn. Imports from the US are also up by 3.9%."
The secretary of state added that he would do "everything possible" in conjunction with the Stormont executive to ensure that political stability would lead to "an even brighter future for Northern Ireland".
