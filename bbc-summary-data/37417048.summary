Captain Leon Britton has called on Swansea City's players to "respect" manager Francesco Guidolin, as pressure mounts on the 60-year-old Italian.

Swansea have not won a Premier League game since the opening day of 2016-17.
Guidolin has also seen Neil Taylor and Ki-Sung Yueng reacting angrily to being substituted in their last two games.
"I think Ki will be disappointed, we have to be professional and respect the manager and the group of players we've got," said Britton.
"If you have an issue with anything we deal with it in the changing room.
"As much as there's frustration and emotion running high - when you're not performing well we have to remember we are professionals and we have to respect everyone involved in the football club and I hope that's the last we see of that."
In the wake of their 1-0 defeat at Southampton, Guidolin accused midfielder Ki Sung Yueng of not having a good "attitude" when he objected on the sidelines to being replaced.
A week earlier the manger apologised to Neil Taylor for substituting the defender before half time in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea.
Swansea face Premier League leaders Manchester City twice in the space of four days, the the EFL Cup on Wednesday and in the league on Saturday before playing Liverpool and Arsenal.
Britton added: "The performance on Sunday (against Southampton) wasn't good and that is a worry because if you perform like that in the next 10 games, you're not going to pick up any points.
"We want to nip this in the bud and don't want it to fester and we want to put it right.
"We can talk about systems, but when you cross that line as a player it's up to you as an individual to perform."
