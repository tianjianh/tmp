Lenell John-Lewis: Shrewsbury Town sign striker from Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have made their second summer signing by bringing in experienced striker Lenell John-Lewis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old former Lincoln, Bury and Grimsby Town man has joined the Town on a one-year deal from Newport, with the option for a further year.
He follows fellow striker Arthur Gnahoua, who has also joined on a one-year deal from Kidderminster Harriers.
John-Lewis is just one short of 50 career goals in a combined 309 appearances at his four previous clubs.
Having been signed in 2015 for Newport by Terry Butcher from Grimsby, where he was signed by Paul Hurst (now the Shrewsbury manager), John-Lewis missed most of last season through injury.
But he returned to play in their final two games, including the final-day win over Notts County that kept the Welsh side in the EFL - although he had been substituted by the time their crucial late winning goal went in.
