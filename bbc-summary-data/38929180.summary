Notts County's seemingly precarious position in the bottom three of League Two does not mean they face a battle for survival, says manager Kevin Nolan.

Nolan took over on 12 January and, after a win and a draw from his four games, the Magpies are only above the danger zone by one place and one point.
But with 17 matches remaining, Nolan told BBC Radio Nottingham he is confident they will stay up.
"Are we in a relegation scrap already? I don't think so," said Nolan, 34.
"There is a long way to go yet. If we go back 15 games we would be in the top six.
"I am not one to keep looking at tables and asking people to do us favours. It's about us. If we do our job we don't have to worry about anybody else.
"I know, with the quality of squad, if we start getting it right - getting the unit and the balance right - then we should be fine."
Notts face Cheltenham on Saturday, knowing a victory would put them level on points with the 20th-placed Robins.
Player-boss Nolan added: "This league brings up all surprises. We could lose Saturday and go and beat Exeter on Saturday. I am trying to get some consistency and good performances. With good performances consistency comes, and you start getting wins.
"Once Cheltenham is over we will turn our heads towards Exeter.
"The next game is the best game. We will give it our best, and I truly believe if we do we will be okay."
