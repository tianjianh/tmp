Mike Langley, 72, flew with the RAF and as a civilian during his 55-year career.
A foundation to raise money to train airline pilots has been set up after his diagnosis earlier this year.
His daughter Sophie Langley said she hoped the charity would help anyone with a "passion for flying".
Mr Langley began flying at 17. After 36 years in the military he went on to work at the Kidlington-based Oxford Aviation Academy flying school.
The foundation hopes to raise money from the aviation industry to help young pilots attain their commercial wings.
Ms Langley said with training to be a commercial airline pilot costing up to Â£100,000, her father was concerned about training future generations of fliers.
"If you are passionate about flying, it shouldn't be the money that stops you doing it.
"Flying has been Dad's entire life. He has a reputation for never retiring.
"It's amazing he is able to be involved and know the impact he's had on people around him. I'm immensely proud of him," she said.
