The visiting goalkeeper denied Bryan Wharton and Gregor Fotheringham after Ayr's Paul Cairney had missed the target with his effort at Hampden.
The fourth-round replay ended 2-2, with the Spiders' Sean Burns sent off for a second bookable offence in extra-time.
The hosts twice went ahead through Paul Woods and Wharton, with Craig Moore and Conrad Balatoni levelling for Ayr.
Ian McCall's side, who drew 0-0 with Queen's Park at Somerset Park on Saturday, secured a fifth-round home tie against Stirling Albion or Clyde.
The hosts took the lead early on at the national stadium when Burns set up Woods to net inside the area and they led at the break with Wharton scoring shortly after Craig Moore's equaliser.
Former Kilmarnock defender Conrad Balatoni netted late in regulation time to force the additional 30 minutes and Burns' foul on Nicky Devlin resulted in a second yellow and a red card for the midfielder.

And, in added time in extra-time, Ayr introduced their fourth substitute - allowed in extra-time in this season's Scottish Cup - as Michael Rose replaced Devlin. The Honest Men became the first club to take advantage of the new rule.
Rose scored one of Ayr's penalties but Cairney's miss gave Gus MacPherson's side the initiative.
However, Fleming denied Wharton and, after Patrick Boyle had put Ayr 5-4 up, Fotheringham as well.
