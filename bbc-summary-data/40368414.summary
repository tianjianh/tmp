Matz Sels: Newcastle goalkeeper joins Anderlecht on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United goalkeeper Matz Sels has joined Belgian champions Anderlecht on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old joined the Magpies for Â£5m from Gent last summer, but only played nine times in the league as they were promoted from the Championship.
He started the campaign as Rafael Benitez's first-choice keeper, but was replaced by Karl Darlow in September.
Benitez can also choose from fit-again Rob Elliot, Tim Krul and England Under-20s goalkeeper Freddie Woodman.
