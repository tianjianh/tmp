South Africa's Eskom chairman quits amid ongoing power cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of South Africa's power utility has resigned following calls for him to be sacked over allegations of interfering with operations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eskom made the announcement after deliberating with Zola Tsotsi on a motion of no-confidence.
Mr Tsotsi recently made headlines when he suspended four senior executives over ongoing problems at the company.
South Africa has been plagued by power outages in recent months, leading to widespread criticism of Eskom.
An inquiry is underway at Eskom into the reasons behind poor generation capacity and cash-flow issues.
A decision on the suspended bosses will only be taken once the investigation has been completed, the power utility has said.
Economists warn that if the energy problems are not resolved in Africa's most developed economy, it could further stunt the country's growth prospects.
