The woman and her sister, 76, were passengers in a blue Ford Focus driven by the sister's 79-year-old husband.
The northbound car collided with a southbound red Seat Altea on the A76, Catrine, at 11:50 on Monday.
The 32-year-old female Seat driver was not injured. Those in the Ford car were treated in hospital and later released.
On Thursday, the 78-year-old rear seat passenger in the Focus became unwell at home and later died in Ayr Hospital.
A post mortem will take place to establish the cause of her death.
Sgt Kevin Blackley, of Police Scotland, said: "At the time of the crash - it was believed that all three passengers of the Ford Focus had suffered minor injuries and were released after treatment.
"This may obviously still be the case and there may another reason as to her illness, however, because she was involved in the collision a few days prior to her death we are appealing for witnesses who saw it happen at the time.
"Anyone who saw the crash or has any information that will assist officers with their inquiry is asked to contact police."
