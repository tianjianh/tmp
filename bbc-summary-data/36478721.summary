[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Army band has been banned from parading at a football club's ground in a row over a newly seeded pitch.

The Band and Bugles of The Rifles has been told the marching would mess up the turf at Bodmin Town FC in Cornwall.
The mayor of Bodmin, Lance Kennedy, described it as an "unfortunate decision".
The town council, which leases the ground to the club, said it had tried at several meetings to persuade the club to change its mind.

The Winchester-based band had been due to hold a Freedom Parade and perform the Sound The Retreat on Priory Park on 24 June.
But the parade has been cancelled and the band will give a concert at St Petroc's Church instead.
Darren Gilbert, manager of the Carlsberg South West Peninsula League side, said: "The council thinks it can use the ground when they feel like it and it's not OK.
"We are concerned that it could ruin the pitch."
Mr Kennedy said the council had looked at other venues, but none was suitable.
"Bodmin is a former garrison town, the base for the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry, so it is disappointing not to be able to hold an Army parade here," he said.
"It's a pity to deprive the public of an impressive spectacle in the county town."
No-one from the band was available for immediate comment.
