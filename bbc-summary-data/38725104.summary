[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Al Ahly and Zamalek have both made offers that the Rugby Park side would accept for their leading scorer.
Coulibaly was granted permission to join his agents in Egypt to consider moving from Scotland.
Last week, Killie rejected a Â£500,000 bid from Zamalek for the 22-year-old former Tottenham trainee from the Ivory Coast.
Arriving as a free agent after a season at Peterborough, Coulibaly signed a three-year deal with the Scottish Premiership club in the summer.
He has scored 11 goals in 26 appearances for Lee Clark's side.
