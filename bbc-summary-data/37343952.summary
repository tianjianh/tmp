The number of fraudulent insurance claims rose to 2,500 a week last year, according to industry figures.

In total there were 130,000 fraudulent claims, up 6% on 2014, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said.
Dishonest motor claims remained the most common crime, accounting for over half the total.
But fraudulent claims for injury, supposedly as a result of negligence,  such as so-called "slip and trip" claims, was the fastest-growing crime
False claims in this area were up by over a third compared to 2014, the ABI said.
In one case, a chef claimed for neck, shoulder, leg, wrist, back and teeth injuries following an alleged fall on a wet canteen floor.
But CCTV footage used in evidence by the police helped to prove she had deliberately staged the fall.
In another case, a man claimed Â£5,000 for compensation for neck, back and arm injuries, saying he was injured in a car accident in a retail car park.
However CCTV footage used by the police showed he was not in the vehicle at the time of the collision.
The ABI said fraudsters were now more likely than ever before to get caught.
"The chances of getting caught have never been greater, and the consequences, such as a prison sentence and difficulty in getting future insurance and other financial products, have never been more severe and long-lasting," said James Dalton, the ABI's director of general insurance policy.
