Wales manager Chris Coleman has been urged to rest his star men in Wales' final warm-up game before the Euros.

Ex-Wales striker John Hartson is concerned that the risk of injury is too great with the tournament less than a week away.
Coleman's team start their Euro 2016 campaign against Slovakia six days after their Stockholm visit, and already have several injury concerns.
"I don't think he'll take many chances with his big players," Hartson said.
"Chris has to be slightly cautious because there's only six days after Sunday until Wales open against Slovakia."
Hartson, who scored 14 goals in 51 Wales appearances, thinks that short turnaround could lead to Coleman resting Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale among others.
The world's most expensive player was last in action when he helped club side Real Madrid to win their 11th Champions League title.
"He might not play the likes of Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams," added Hartson.
"Bale might have 10-15 minutes to shake off the cobwebs near the end maybe. I just don't think we can risk him.
"It's very close, but I don't think we can risk our big players."
Bale joined up with the Wales squad this week after his Champions League involvement.
After playing Slovakia, Wales face England in Lens on 16 June and Russia in Toulouse on 20 June.
Coleman's team is the first from Wales to qualify for the finals of a major international tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
The manager has already selected Crystal Palace's Joe Ledley who broke a bone in a leg less than a month ago.
Joe Allen and Hal Robson-Kanu are also likely to miss the Sweden clash.
"Chris has to be careful with injuries," added Hartson.
"The last thing he wants is any more injuries to deal with. He needs to make sure everyone is fit and well to play that first game in France."
