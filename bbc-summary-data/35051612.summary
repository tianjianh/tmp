St William's Children's Home abuse victim 'can't forget'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man abused by an ex-head teacher of a children's home has said he "can't forget" the ill-treatment suffered at the hands of the "predator".

Nigel - a former resident of the now defunct St William's Children's Care Home - was one of many victims of principal James Carragher, who has been found guilty of abuse for a third time.
"He's an animal," said Nigel.
The 56-year-old, who lived at the East Yorkshire home from 1971 to 1972, said he still had "nightmares" and "can't get shut of that monster".
"[The] damage caused to me is horrendous," says Nigel, who did not want to give his surname.
"I can't put my arms around my children - I've only just started.
"My temper is evil because that's what he's done to me."
Nigel - whose evidence helped see Carragher jailed after a previous trial in 2004 - described how the defendant made him and other boys stand naked in a "parade" when he took them swimming at night.
"He said 'You don't have to wear trunks. We don't need them'.
"He's the headmaster. I thought it was all a game.
"We got undressed and he made us all stand up in a line and he stood there with nothing on as well... and he started to touch all of us."
Nigel, aged 13 at the time, said he had "no reason to question him" because he thought Carragher was "medically trained" or a doctor-type figure.
Describing the moment Carragher abused him, Nigel said: "I wanted to get away but I was frightened to get away.
"I couldn't because he's held [on to] me."
He also recalled a time when he was abused on his bed by Carragher, now 75.
"I was in a shock and I couldn't move," Nigel said.
"I felt numb. I can't understand why he's done this to me."
He said he could not speak out about the abuse for the fear of being punished and "feeling guilty".
"He told me no one would believe me.
"You couldn't talk to anyone about it [because] you'd get punished for it.
"I couldn't tell my grandma otherwise I'd lose my days out".
The Market Weighton home, which was owned by the Diocese of Middlesbrough, provided residential care and education for boys aged 10 to 16 with emotional and behavioural problems.
Carragher has been found guilty after he was previously jailed twice for abusing boys at the home - the first time in 1993 and then again in 2004 when he was jailed for 14 years for abusing 14 boys, one of whom was Nigel.
Carragher was found guilty of two counts of indecent assault in relation to Nigel's case and served a concurrent two-year jail term for the offences.
"This was a man we trusted," said Nigel, who feels justice has not "gone far enough".
"I live to this day knowing he's touched me. How can I forget that?," he said.
"When I'm asleep I have nightmares of him... the swimming pool.
"I just can't forgive him."
