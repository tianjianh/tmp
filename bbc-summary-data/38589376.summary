Rudy Gestede: Middlesbrough signing happy with striker competition

New signing Rudy Gestede says competition for places with fellow Middlesbrough strikers such as Alvaro Negredo can benefit all parties.

Boro boss Aitor Karanka favours a system with one striker up front, which has been Spaniard Negredo in 18 of 20 Premier League games this season.
Gestede arrived from Aston Villa this month to add to Karanka's options, although David Nugent has joined Derby.
"You have to believe in yourself," the 28-year-old told BBC Tees.
"I learn from him [Alvaro] everyday, he's a top striker, the competition is healthy.
"I will try to show him I can put pressure on him and make sure he does even better and scores some goals for us."
Scotland international Jordan Rhodes and Uruguayan forward Cristhian Stuani provide other alternatives for Karanka.
Gestede returns to the top flight after scoring four goals in 19 games for Aston Villa this campaign, following Villa's relegation to the Championship last season.
Joining a club with a consistent system is of little concern for the France-born Benin international, who has spoken to his new manager about the role he will play at the Riverside.
"I know how they play," Gestede added. "The good thing is Aitor Karanka never changes his tactics, he is one step or two steps forward and he's very clever in what he does.
"He wants me to bring my assets, a presence in the box, I can hold the ball up. He just said bring what you've got and enjoy to play. It's a pleasure to play football at the best level."
