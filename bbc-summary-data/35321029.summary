Wyke College, in Hull, was closed after receiving a threatening email on Friday morning.
Humberside Police sent officers to the school but later said on Twitter the threat was thought to be "one of a number of hoax emails sent to educational facilities worldwide".
Details of other sites targeted have not been released.
The force said the college had been closed as a "precautionary measure" while an investigation takes place.
The spokesperson said: "It is not thought that there is a threat to the safety of the staff, students or public, however Humberside Police officers have been deployed to the location to provide reassurance and complete an investigation into the threats received."
College principal Jay Trivedy said: "There was an email that was sent to our offices this morning and the email indicated that there was a security issue.
"Obviously our students and our staff are our top concern and and what we've done is make the decision to close the college today."
However, he said he was "disappointed and angry" at the disturbance to student.
"It's very sad that something like this can disrupt so many individuals and their work," he said.
