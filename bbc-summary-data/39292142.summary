Leicester Tigers claimed their first silverware in four years as they edged out Exeter Chiefs in a tight Anglo-Welsh Cup final at The Stoop.

Tom Brady intercepted a loose pass from Matt Jess for what proved the decisive try for Leicester in the first half.
James Short had earlier crossed to give Exeter an early lead but Freddie Burns' accuracy off the tee put Tigers ahead.
Sam Simmonds made it a nervy finish with a late try under the posts for Chiefs but Leicester held on.
In a season which has seen Leicester part company with director of rugby Richard Cockerill, a first trophy since their Premiership title of 2013 will boost confidence for the rest of the campaign.
Tigers also become the first club to record a hat-trick of wins in the competition after their triumphs in 2007 and 2012.
Burns, who will leave the club to join Bath next season, was impeccable with his kicking while his opposite number Joe Simmonds had a difficult afternoon.
The Chiefs fly-half missed two relatively straightforward penalty attempts either side of half-time, which ultimately proved the difference between the sides.
Exeter assistant coach Ricky Pellow: "We gave them too much of a lead as they were able to wrestle the momentum away from us.
"We threw everything at them in the second half, but we couldn't break them down early enough. They must take great credit as they deserved to win by withstanding all our pressure in the second half."
Leicester assistant coach Geordan Murphy:  "The guys have been passionate and committed throughout this tournament and some of the defensive shots that went in during the final quarter were fantastic.
"There was real ferocity in the tackle and it was some heroic defence at the end."
Fly-half Freddie Burns: "I'm off at the end of the year, but I have a lot of friends here so it was nice to put some silverware in the cabinet and get an early trophy.
"It was a tough day by place-kicking into the wind and a couple of mine just scraped over, but we didn't really push on in the second half, which made it difficult for us at the end."
