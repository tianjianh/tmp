Cardiff City fans have reacted to the club's decision to change the home kit from blue to red, with a dragon crest.

The changes are to be introduced as part of "major and significant" investment by the Championship club's Malaysian owners.
The rebranding provoked disappointment and anger among some fans of the club, known as the Bluebirds.
But leading fan Gwyn Davies accepted the change, saying: "People have calmed down and had a think about it".
"If we've got to wear red that's part of the price we have to pay."
Until now, City have always played in a blue home strip with a bluebird crest. The blue kit will be retained, but only as the club's away colours.
The move follows fresh discussions between between club directors and Malaysian investors Tan Sri Vincent Tan and Dato Chan Tien Ghee, known as TG.
Chief executive Alan Whiteley said the rebrand was designed to help the Championship club expand its appeal.
The new investment package will also allow the club to resolve its longstanding debt with the Langston company, it revealed.
Money will be invested in a new training ground and facilities, the feasibility of expanding the club's stadium will be examined and the first team squad will also be boosted under the plans.
Mr Davies, of the Valley Rams supporters club, told BBC Wales he was relieved that the club had secured the investment, which would bring stability and progress.
He said he thought the "fuss" made by some supporters when the plan was first leaked last month might have frightened away the club's Malaysian investors.
"None of us want to change to red," said Mr Davies. "It's something we'll accept willingly because of the price that goes with it, and the benefits that will go with it."
He added: "The people against this colour change... I haven't seen a Plan B with them. I haven't seen a viable option. You know, [they must] come up with a viable option.
Mr Davies backed Mr Tan's investment.
"If this is part of his business plan and vision then we've got to accept that," he said. "His fingers will get burned, not ours, if it goes wrong.
"He's got the right business plan, and it's going to work and we're going to succeed, finally.
"We've been crying out for years for the investment and finally it's here."
Some fans remain opposed, however. One fan, Dan Buckley, wrote on Twitter: "I loved this football club. Truly loved it from the bottom of my heart. Words can't describe how gutted I am. Sickened".
Another, John Devlin, tweeted: "Having blue as away kit adds insult to injury".
Cardiff City Supporters' Trust said it welcomed the news about the proposed investment to the club but wanted more information about the level of investment in the club.
Trust chairman Tim Hartley said: "There are still questions that need to be answered such as what happens to the proposed investment if there is no deal over historical debts with Langston and how much will actually be invested and over what period.
"While we understand that the Malaysian owners desire to change the kit colour and badge, many fans will be disappointed by this."
Others have expressed their support, but principally on the basis of the investment going ahead.
"This whole episode strengthens the case for supporter representation on the board of the club, as happens at Swansea City."
Mr Hartley said the trust would meet on Wednesday night, monitor the reaction of its members and report back to the club.
Meanwhile, Cardiff council said it fully supported the club's decision.
Council leader Heather Joyce said: "I have spoken to Dato Chan Tien Ghee today to welcome the financial support that is being given to Cardiff City FC and he has outlined to me his commitment to the club and the city.
"I made it clear that the council appreciates the challenges the club will face in relation to some of the changes that need to be made but we will fully support what is being proposed.
"As a council we are business savvy and recognise the importance of this investment that the owners are putting in and the confidence that the club has in the city."
