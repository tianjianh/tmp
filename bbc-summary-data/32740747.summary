Andre Schurrle: Jose Mourinho texted me to say I'd won the title

Former Chelsea winger Andre Schurrle received a welcome surprise when a message flashed up on his phone recently - it was Jose Mourinho texting to say a Premier League winner's medal was waiting for him.

Schurrle, 24, completed a £22m move from the Blues to German side Wolfsburg in February.
The Germany international had made 14 appearances for Chelsea earlier this season, most of those as a substitute, and had not been expecting to receive any recognition when Mourinho's side sealed the league title on 3 May.
Speaking in an interview with BBC World Service's World Football programme, Schurrle said: "I didn't know that I'd get a medal when I didn't play most of the second half of the season.
"Jose Mourinho sent me a text to say that I'd get a medal and he asked me to come to the last game. That was very nice for me.
"I'm really happy for the boys. They played a very good second half of the season so of course, for me, it's good to get a medal but the boys did the work."
Players must make at least five appearances to be eligible for a medal.
A Premier League title-winner's medal means Schurrle could feasibly end with a hat-trick of medals this season.
He was a World Cup winner with Germany in Brazil last year, while Wolfsburg will play Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on 30 May.
Schurrle feels his World Cup-exploits accelerated his departure from Chelsea, admitting the volume of football he played, coupled with little time off between the tournament and the start of the Premier League, left him exhausted.
"I had the World Cup which was very perfect for me and the start of the season was good as well," he added.
"Then there came a little bit of a period for me where my body didn't feel very good, I was not clear in my head and I didn't have as many good moments for Chelsea.
"I wanted to come back to the Bundesliga, I wanted to feel a little bit more in the team and to get a bit more playing time.
"I love Chelsea still, I'm not frustrated, it was a great experience."
Schurrle had joined Chelsea in June 2013 for £18m, but made just 20 Premier League starts for the club, with a further 24 appearances from off the bench.
Despite ultimately being a bit-part player for Chelsea, Schurrle says he would not hesitate recommending other players to move there if they get the chance.
"It can be difficult to get first team football because you have so many good players," he said.
"I think I took my chances very well because normally every time I got playing time I did something good and I scored.
"The manager doesn't need to change anything because the team is winning, then it's very difficult. You just have to be clear in your head and take the chances when they come.
"If you have the chance, you have got to go there."
Schurrle's interview will be available in full on the World Football podcast, available from Friday, 15 May.
