Amy Winehouse: In Her Own Words has been pieced together from interviews and sessions the singer recorded for the BBC before her death in 2011.
It includes live performances of Love Is A Losing Game and Wake Up Alone which were never broadcast.
The release precedes a documentary film about the star's life.
Entitled Amy it is directed by Asif Kapadia, whose last movie was an acclaimed biopic of Ayrton Senna.
Kapadia conducted more than 100 interviews with 80 people - including friends, family and colleagues of the star, although her father, Mitch Winehouse, has since distanced himself from the film.
BBC Music's companion programme focuses exclusively on interviews and sessions by the London-born star.
She is seen discussing her musical influences, her aspirations and the intensely personal nature of her lyrics.
"I've been through times where I've been so [messed] up that I've had to just write everything down - even feelings I don't want to acknowledge.
"It's good, because someone else might hear that and be like 'I'm not an idiot for feeling them things.'"
She also talks about her tempestuous relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, which inspired much of the Grammy Award-winning album Back To Black.
"I fell bang in love with someone and it didn't do me any favours," she says. "When I split up with this fella, I didn't have anything to go back to. I wasn't working, so I was playing pool for four hours every day, getting drunk, having to be carried home in a wheelbarrow. So Back To Black is about a black mood, I guess."
The quotes, many of which are also being seen for the first time, are drawn from interviews Winehouse gave to the BBC for documentary projects including the Jazz and Soul Britannia series on BBC Four.
Performances have been drawn from The BBC One Sessions (2007), Glastonbury (2004 and 2008), The Mercury Music Prize (2004), Later... with Jools Holland (2006) and The Hootenanny (2006).
Winehouse died at her London home in 2011 at the age of 27.
She had previously struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. The inquest into her death found she died of accidental alcohol poisoning.
Amy Winehouse: In Her Own Words is available now on the BBC iPlayer.
