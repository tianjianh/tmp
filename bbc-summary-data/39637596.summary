James Keatings' stoppage-time strike gave Championship winners Hibernian victory and left Raith Rovers a point above the bottom two places.

Keatings was left unmarked to put Hibs ahead before the break but Declan McManus fired Raith level in the second half.
Grant Holt edged the hosts back into the lead only for fellow substitute Ryan Hardie to equalise.
Keatings would have the final say, his free-kick finding the net.
The Kirkcaldy side, who visit second bottom St Mirren on Saturday, remain three points clear of bottom team Ayr United - Hibs' weekend hosts.
Despite making 10 changes to the side that lost to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup semi-final, Hibs dominated the opening exchanges.
Fraser Murray, making only his second start for the first team, sent a header inches wide of Pavol Penksa's left-hand post and then Brian Graham had a header from a Chris Humphrey delivery tipped over the crossbar by the keeper.
Andrew Shinnie and the impressive Murray fired just over but slowly John Hughes' side began to make an impact on the game, winger Chris Johnston warming the palms of Ross Laidlaw in the home goal.
Hibs took the lead when Shinnie played the ball wide to Humphrey, who utilised his pace to escape Kevin McHattie and cross for Keatings to smash home from close range.
Hibs boss Neil Lennon, serving the first of a two-match touchline ban, must have been encouraged by the performances of some of his fringe players as he watched from the stand, with Murray again going close with a volley.
The small band of visiting fans were on their feet when McManus fired home after getting the better of Alex Harris but referee Greg Aitken had already blown for an infringement.
Bobby Barr then had a snapshot that Efe Ambrose managed to get in the way of but the pressure from Raith eventually paid off.
The home side were slack in midfield and Barr slipped the ball through to McManus, who made no mistake from 14 yards.
McManus twice came close to giving his side the lead. His first effort from the edge of the box beat Laidlaw but came back off the inside of the post and an overhead kick from the striker was turned over by the keeper.
Hibernian introduced Holt in place of Graham and within minutes they were back in front. The Raith defence failed to cope with a ball over the top and Holt ran on to knock it home.
The visitors, though, struck back for the second time when Hardie ran through on goal and, as the home defence stood and watched, the striker took his time to round Laidlaw before blasting into the empty net.
There was one final twist after Jordan Thompson was booked for handball just outside the box, Keatings' free-kick beating Penksa to secure Hibs the three points.
