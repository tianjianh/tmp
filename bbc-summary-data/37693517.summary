Burgess ended last season by playing seven games for Salford Red Devils in the Qualifiers.
The 29-year-old and his three younger siblings, Sam, Tom and George were members of the South Sydney Rabbitohs squad that won the NRL title in 2014.
"Catalans has a very talented playing squad," the former Leeds Rhinos forward said of his move back to Super League.
"For much of last season they looked to be on course for at least a top-four place in the Super League."
Head coach Laurent Frayssinous said: "Luke will bring top level Super League and NRL experience to our squad next season. He will add size and will strengthen our pack, offensively and defensively.
