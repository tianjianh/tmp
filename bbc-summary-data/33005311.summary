[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A zip wire, big wheel and a roof top restaurant are part of a multi-million pound "vision" to transform a derelict Hampshire pier.

There are also plans to bring the pier's theatre back into use as a music venue and new boat moorings.
South Parade Pier Ltd, who bought the Victorian pier in Southsea in 2014, hope to submit plans to Portsmouth City Council this month.
The pier would be a year-round attraction and could open in 2016.
Project co-ordinator Malcolm Belcher said: "It's a vision. It's the owners' ideas of what it could look like.
"Running alongside that is a planning application which will go into the council and that will go towards planning consent for the changes."
"Critical" structural work on the pier is "95%" complete and work to start refurbishing the buildings was due to start imminently.
Mr Belcher said there would be "significant investment" in the project, but declined to say how much.
If plans are approved the Victorian pier could be fully opened to the public next summer.
The Grade-II listed pier was closed in 2012 after being deemed "a danger to the public" and at risk of collapsing.
Mr Belcher said he hoped the prohibitive notice imposed by the council would be lifted soon.
South Parade Pier Ltd bought the pier for an undisclosed sum.
The consortium took control of the pier from previous owners SSP South Coast Ltd in early 2014, before the sale was completed, and started an emergency repair plan to save it.
