Gareth Bale is targeting winning Euro 2016 with Wales after claiming his second Champions League title with Real Madrid.

Bale scored his penalty as Real beat rivals Atletico in a shoot-out, having drawn Saturday's final 1-1.
The 26-year-old's next assignment will be the European Championship in France, his first major international tournament with Wales.
"We will be going for that title as well. Why not," Bale told BT Sport.
Victory in Milan gave Real their 11th European Cup title and Bale's second, after the Wales forward scored in their 2014 final win over Atletico.
There were concerns for his club and country when he struggled with cramp during extra time and appeared to hold his groin after scoring his penalty.
But Bale was fit enough to stay on the pitch for the whole match and join Joey Jones and Ryan Giggs in the list of Welshmen to win two European Cups.
"I can't feel a lot, I am cramping up," Bale said in the immediate aftermath of the game.
"What an amazing feeling. In extra time we showed resilience, what we are made of and winning the 11th [title].
"The boys gave everything. The club, the fans have been amazing on this journey and deserve it.
"Atletico gave it a great game and we feel a little bit sorry for them but you have to win a final.
"Some of their players were struggling but we tried not to show it too much. I was nervous after the penalty, not while taking it."
Bale's involvement in the Champions League final meant he missed Wales' training camp in Portugal as they prepare for Euro 2016.
Chris Coleman's side visit Sweden for a pre-tournament friendly on Sunday, 5 June, before kicking off their campaign against Slovakia in Bordeaux on 11 June.
