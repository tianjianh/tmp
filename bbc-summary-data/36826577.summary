John Oakley will travel from Goole, near Hull, to his home town of Warrington in Cheshire, and is taking Max the dog along for the ride.
The journey will take the intrepid pair through more than 130 locks, and they will share a tent at night.
Max even has his own specially-made life jacket for the trip which is expected to take place in September.
