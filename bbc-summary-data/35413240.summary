Breck Bednar was killed after being lured to the Essex home of Lewis Daynes, 20, who is now serving life.
Breck's mother Lorin LaFave said: "It's very distressing and I know it's him."
The Ministry of Justice said it had found no evidence of electronic communication in Daynes's cell but Essex Police are investigating.

Breck, from Caterham in Surrey, was killed in 2014 after travelling to Daynes's home in Grays.
The trial heard there was sexual activity between the pair and Daynes then slashed his victim's throat.
Ms LaFave, who is from the United States, said she has received two online letters purporting to be from Daynes; one sent in November and the other this week in the run-up to a BBC Three television programme.
In his latest post, Daynes denied he was a "sinister internet paedophile" or a groomer and called the TV trailer "highly dramatic".
He also said police photographs of his home showed a "very clean tidy flat" in a "very nice residential street" and was the opposite of what was described.
"It would take too much time to address all the lies and spin," he wrote.
In his first letter, Daynes said he was responsible for Breck's death, "a boy of just 14," but accused the media and others of exploiting Breck's death to "suit their own agendas".
Daynes was sentenced to life with a minimum jail term of 25 years at Chelmsford Crown Court last year.
Ms LaFave said: "The first one came on Thanksgiving, with Daynes knowing I'm a family person and we would be having a big get-together.
"I had a lot of contact with him when he was gaming and I can tell the way he speaks and have no doubt it's him.
"If he hasn't done it directly, he's had someone do it on his behalf.
"We need someone higher in authority to help and find out where this was sent from."
Essex Police said it was investigating the two online postings.
A force spokesman said: "The police have been made aware of a second letter purporting to be from Lewis Daynes that has been posted on the internet.
"The police service is considering if any offences have been committed by the publication."
Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar was broadcast on BBC Three on Tuesday, 26 January, 2016.
