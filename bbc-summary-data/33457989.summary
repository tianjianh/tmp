Torfaen's £32m post-16 education plan rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £32.5m post-16 training centre in Cwmbran which included a specialist engineering centre of excellence have been rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coleg Gwent and Torfaen council submitted proposals earlier this year as a possible replacement for high school sixth forms in Torfaen.
But deputy skills minister Julie James said there was not enough evidence they were affordable and achievable.
The need for an engineering centre of excellence was also not proven.
Council leaders described the decision as "disappointing", however revised plans are expected to be submitted to the Welsh government by September.
