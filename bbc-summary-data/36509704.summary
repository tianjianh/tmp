The 46-year-old shot a level-par 71 for a one-over total that leaves her tied for 10th place at the second women's major of the year in Seattle.
World number one Lydia Ko (70) leads by one from the American duo of Brittany Lincicome and Gerina Piller, who both shot 71.
New Zealander Ko, 19, is attempting to win a third consecutive major.
She won the first of her career at the Evian Championship in France in September and added the ANA Inspiration in California in April.
Second round co-leaders Brooke Henderson and Mirim Lee each shot 73 to drop two shots back, meaning only three players were under par.
However, 13 players are within three shots of the lead.
