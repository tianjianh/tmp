Swear word in homework for six-year-olds in Lincoln

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school has apologised after six-year-olds were given homework containing a swear word.

The task was copied and pasted from the internet but not checked before being given to a year-two class at Bishop King CE Primary School in Lincoln.
Kate Rouse, the school's head teacher, said the homework "wasn't appropriate" to give to the children.
However, she said it was a genuine mistake and no further action would be taken against the teacher involved.
It was titled "25 Day Handwriting Challenge" and asked children to "Handwrite what pisses you off".
"This member of staff is new to the school and naturally she is very upset about the situation," she said.
"As head teacher I will support all my staff and on this occasion that is no different and I will continue to do so."
The 25 Day Handwriting Challenge appears on several websites, although the original task appears to be aimed at teenagers or adults.
More child-friendly tasks include "Handwrite your favorite [sic] month of the year" and "Handwrite what color [sic] shirt your [sic] wearing right now".
Parent Jay McCulley told the Lincolnshire Echo he was "devastated and shocked" when he noticed the rude word, and his partner Jade Dixon "went absolutely mad".
However, parents speaking to BBC Radio Lincolnshire seemed ambivalent.
One mother said: "I was a bit shocked. Luckily enough she didn't read that much of it. She was so young she didn't quite understand it."
Another mother said: "I thought it was a joke. I haven't actually said anything to the teachers, I've not had a chance, but it's a mistake; mistakes happen I guess."
Another mother added: "The homework probably should be checked but I do think there is too much pressure on teachers.
"They have an awful lot to contend with and I must be honest, most of the teachers, in fact all of the teachers and the staff at this school have been, and are, fantastic."
