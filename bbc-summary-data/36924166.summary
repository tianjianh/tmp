[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who raped four women in West Lothian has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Pollock, 29, from Bathgate, raped two of the women in cars and the other two at houses.
Pollock was found guilty of a total of five rapes and an assault with intent to rape, all committed between 2008 and 2012.
Lord Ericht ordered Pollock be kept under supervision for a further two years and placed him on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
The judge told Pollock at the High Court in Edinburgh: "You continue to deny your guilt of these offences, as is your right, and do not take responsibility for what you have done.
"In all the circumstances you are clearly a risk to women."
Pollock gave evidence in his own defence, and denied all of the charges.
During cross-examination by advocate depute Alex Prentice QC, Pollock was asked: "Would you consider yourself a caring and considerate man, someone who has respect for women?"
Pollock replied: "Yes."
Defence counsel Herbert Kerrigan QC told the court Pollock continued to maintain his innocence.
