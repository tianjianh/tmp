The 30-year-old made one appearance for Vale, in their 2-1 defeat by Carlisle in the EFL Cup first round on 9 August.
"Having moved to England from Portugal over the summer, the striker has found it difficult to adjust to life in the country," a club statement said.
The former Sporting Lisbon player will now return to Portugal.
