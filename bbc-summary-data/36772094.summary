The number of animal cruelty convictions in Wales has fallen by nearly a quarter, the RSPCA Cymru has said.

Its 2015 annual report found cases were down by 23% on the previous year, while a total of 7,589 animals were rescued.
The number of people accepting welfare advice rose from 5,527 to 5,790, and the charity rehomed more than 1,750 animals across Wales.
It also said the numbers of warning notices issued to owners increased.
One of the cases involved a lurcher cross who was dumped injured in a playing field in Flint, Flintshire, after a suspected badger-baiting incident.
Local residents found a female badger in a pool of blood, and the dog - renamed Flint after the town - had its ear torn, part of its nose was missing and had puncture wounds over its body.
Flint needed two operations, dental treatment and weeks of pain relief and antibiotics. Flint was successfully rehomed after an appeal.
Another case saw a litter of eight abandoned puppies found in a bin in Queensferry, Deeside, in March 2015. Some still had their umbilical cord attached. They were eventually found new homes.
Assistant external relations director Claire Lawson said: "Although 2015 was another very busy year for the RSPCA in Wales, progress continued in the fight to reduce cruelty and alleviate suffering.
"There was a fall in the number of cruelty complaints and prosecutions, but a rise in the number of welfare and warning notices we successfully implemented and so we know our education and advice is working."
