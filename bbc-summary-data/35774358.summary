Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government would seek to raise greater awareness of the facility at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Sleat.
She was responding to a call from MSP David Stewart for more support for what he described as a "first class" studio.
MSPs have been debating for several months the need for more film-making facilities in Scotland.
There have also been calls from within the film industry for a national film studio for Scotland.
Ms Hyslop said she had visited the studio at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, adding that it was used regularly for the making of the Gaelic drama Bannan.
She said: "I shall undertake to make sure we do everything with other agencies as we can to help publicise it."
Earlier this month the Scottish producer of the multi-Oscar-winning film Mad Max: Fury Road said it was a "disgrace" more progress had not been made on a national film studio for Scotland.
Iain Smith said Scotland's film industry was "under-performing" in comparison to other parts of the UK.
A plan is being considered for an expansion of a studio in Cumbernauld, at a site currently used by the TV series Outlander.
Proposals have also been submitted for a complex at Straiton in Midlothian.
