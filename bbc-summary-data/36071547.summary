McDonald's 'disappointed' by Labour conference stand ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burger chain McDonald's has said it is "disappointed" by Labour's decision to ban the company from its party conference in Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour's ruling National Executive Committee rejected its application to set up a stand at the annual gathering.
The decision, which is thought to have cost the party £30,000 in sponsorship money, was criticised as "snobby" by one Labour MP.
A Labour spokeswoman said: "We do not comment on commercial decisions."
A McDonald's spokesman said: "We are disappointed with the decision that has been taken."
The company had reportedly wanted to mount an "interactive experience" display in support of British farm produce and is planning to rent space at the Conservative and SNP conferences.
Former Labour minister Ian Austin tweeted: "Why has @UKLabour turned down £30k from McDonald's? My first job was in their branch of Dudley High Street."
Labour MP Wes Streeting told the Sun on Sunday: "I'm exasperated that we should throw away £30,000 worth of sponsorship like this.
"It smacks of a snobby attitude towards fast-food restaurants and people who work or eat at them."
Hiring out exhibition space to charities and companies is a major source of income for Britain's political parties.
The Labour Party has come under fire in the past for renting stands to controversial companies, including, in 2013, tobacco giant Philip Morris.
