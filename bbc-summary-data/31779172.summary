[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Longton Cottage Hospital closed in September amid staff shortages at hospitals run by Staffordshire and Stoke Partnership NHS Trust.
Thirty seven beds have since been reopened on a temporary basis, along with 28 beds in Stafford.
Latest figures showed local A&E performance to be the worst in England.
Last week, just 63.7% of people attending emergency units at the Royal Stoke University Hospital and Stafford's County Hospital were seen within four hours, compared with a national target of 95%.
The next worst performing trust was the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which treated 70.3% of patients within four hours.
Staffordshire and Stoke Partnership NHS Trust, which runs community hospitals in the area, said reopening Longton Hospital was expected to cost up to Â£90,000 a week.
