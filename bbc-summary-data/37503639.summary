A Wrexham dairy has submitted proposals to expand facilities to meet production demand and recruit 60 more staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A council report said the Â£14m expansion was needed as Tomlinson's Dairies, Minera, had outgrown its facilities.
It plans to double production to 195 million litres of milk a year.
Wrexham planners have recommended the three-phase application for approval ahead of a planning committee meeting on Monday.
The dairy currently employs about 170 staff.
The business was established in 1983 by brothers Philip and John Tomlinson, expanding from a doorstep round using milk from the family dairy farm at Minera.
