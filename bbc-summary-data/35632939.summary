[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three-weekly bin collections in Conwy voted through

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conwy has opted to collect non-recyclable rubbish every three weeks - and not four, as proposed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council currently collects waste every fortnight, spending about Â£2.9m each year to dispose of its rubbish.
A report found more than half could be recycled, with Conwy calling the loss of resources "unacceptable".
On Tuesday, the council voted in favour of three-weekly collections, but it will run a pilot of four-weekly pick-ups in one area of the county.
Clwyd West assembly member Darren Millar had urged the council to scrap the proposals and consider alternative ways to promote recycling instead.  Hundreds signed his petition calling for the proposals to be ditched.
He said: "I have been bombarded by emails, letters and comments on social media from residents who are dead set against these proposals."
Conwy currently recycles 59% of its waste - more than the statutory target of 58% for 2015/16 - but like all local authorities in Wales, it will have to achieve 64% by 2020 and 70% by 2025.
It would not meet those targets without considering "a more sustainable approach to the collection and recycling of waste", the authority's report said.
