Jeremy Corbyn 'can give Welsh Labour an election boost'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn can boost the party's prospects in May's assembly election, AMs have said.

Labour AMs in key marginal seats told Sunday Politics Wales Mr Cobryn has boosted party membership and enthused supporters.
Some party figures have concerns about how voters will see his left-wing policies, particularly in seats where there is a challenge from the Tories.
First Minister Carwyn Jones met Mr Corbyn for the first time this week.
The new UK party leader has said he will visit Wales once a month in the run up to the election.
Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan said Mr Corbyn's success has almost doubled the party's membership in her area.
The Conservatives won the seat in the general election, but the constituency has been closely-fought between Labour and the Conservatives in recent years.
"One of our key tasks in Welsh Labour is to convert all that enthusiasm for the hard work we need to get done in the Labour party - the door knocking, the envelope filling, the telephone canvassing", she said.
Ms Morgan, who supported Yvette Cooper in the leadership election, warned that Welsh Labour's voice could be drowned out by the focus on its new parliamentary leader.
She said: "What we've got to make sure is that we do hear the voice of the leader in Wales and the voice of Welsh Labour, because what we've done in Wales and what we plan to do is a really good platform to fight the election."
Another Labour backbencher claims the new UK party leader can give the party a fillip in another key seat.
Labour lost Gower to the Conservatives at the general election - a seat it had held for more than 100 years.
Swansea East AM Mike Hedges, who backed Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, said some Labour voters in Gower stayed at home during the general election "because they couldn't see enough of a difference between Labour and the Conservatives".
He added: "He might enthuse a large number of people who I know living in places like Clydach and other working class villages around Clydach who stayed at home."
Llanelli MP Nia Griffith said there will not be any no-go areas in Wales for Mr Corbyn.
Speaking to Sunday Politics Wales, the shadow Welsh Secretary rejected the idea that Mr Corbyn would not visit marginal constituencies ahead of next year's assembly elections.
"He has an appeal right across the spectrum," she said. "He appeals to the idea that he is genuine and sincere".
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies warned on Saturday Mr Corbyn and Mr Jones were the "two most dangerous men for Wales' future".
But Vale of Clwyd AM Ann Jones said the Conservatives' claim that Labour are a threat to national security is "appalling".
"I was disappointed to see the prime minister say that people like me are now a national threat because of my UK leader.
"The real threat to hard-working families - those who are now working but still having to go to food banks because of the Tory cuts - the Tories have got a lot to answer for, they are the real danger in Wales."
