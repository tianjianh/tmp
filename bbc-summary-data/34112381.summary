[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A special £20 coin is being made to commemorate the Queen becoming Britain's longest reigning monarch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On 9 September 2015 the Queen will have ruled for more than 63 years and 216 days.
She'll have overtaken the record set by her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, more than a century ago.
The silver coin features the new picture of the Queen that was unveiled earlier this year.
