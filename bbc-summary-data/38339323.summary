Truro City must take the form they showed in the FA Trophy into the league, says boss Lee Hodges.

The White Tigers lost to National League high-flyers Forest Green late in extra time in their first-round replay.
"The way they performed over the two games was phenomenal and they've set those dizzy heights now," Hodges said.
"It's no good putting all that hard work into trying to win games and then going to underperform and get beaten at a whimper," he told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"Now they've set those standards they have to go and fight like they have done in those games."
City drew 1-1 with Forest Green at the new Lawn before losing 1-0 at Treyew Road on Tuesday and are 14th in the National League South table.
