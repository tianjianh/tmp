Wilson, who can play in defence or midfield, had two loan spells with the Cherries in 2007.
The 28-year-old spent six seasons at Stoke, making more than 150 appearances, and has been capped 24 times by his country.
He missed out on the Republic's Euro 2016 squad with a knee injury.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes said last week that Wilson was set to leave the club. "It's fair to say that Marc probably feels his future lies elsewhere and it's fair to say I probably agree with him," he said.
Wilson did not feature for Stoke in their 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough against Middlesbrough on the opening day of the Premier League season on Saturday.
"I enjoyed my years at Stoke but I spoke with the manager Mark Hughes and we both agreed it was time to move on - I am excited now to start a new chapter in my career," he told Bournemouth's official website.
"I didn't come to AFC Bournemouth to play in a team that's going to get relegated. I see a lot of positives in this team."
