Six Nations 2017: England leave out Jonathan Joseph for Italy game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England centre Jonathan Joseph has been left out of the squad preparing to face Italy in the Six Nations on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph, 25, has played in all 15 Tests under Eddie Jones but is back with Bath after being cut from a 24-man squad.
Elliot Daly is favourite to start at outside centre, with Ben Te'o also pushing for a starting berth, while James Haskell is set to return on the open-side flank.
England will confirm their starting XV and replacements on Friday morning.
They need to shed one more player from the retained squad when they select their matchday 23.
If selected in the run-on XV Haskell would be making his first start since June 2016.
The 31-year-old spent six months out with a foot injury before featuring as a replacement in victories over France and Wales in this year's Six Nations.
Prop Mako Vunipola and wing Anthony Watson have been included after recovering from injury, but both may be used from the bench against the Azzurri.
England trained last week with Owen Farrell at fly-half and Teo'o and Daly in the centre, a combination which has yet to start a Test.
In recent matches Farrell has played at inside centre, outside starting fly-half George Ford.
But assistant coach Steve Borthwick says vice-captain Farrell, who is set to win his 50th cap, will be an influence wherever he is selected.
"It's great we have versatility there, it allows flexibility," Borthwick said. "He is a great player and a fantastic leader."
Italy have recalled Exeter centre Michele Campagnaro as they make four changes for Sunday's match.
Three come in the backs, with fly-half Tommaso Allan and wing Giulio Bisegni joining Campagnaro in the starting XV.
Braam Steyn replaces Maxime Mbanda at blind-side flanker as Italy search for their first win of the tournament.
Conor O'Shea's side are bottom of the Six Nations table after heavy defeats by Wales and Ireland.
