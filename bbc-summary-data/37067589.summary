[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Stead struck the winner as Notts County came from behind to earn victory at Hartlepool United in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stead curled home with 14 minutes remaining to cap a fine comeback at the Northern Gas and Power Stadium after Louis Lang cancelled out Toto Nsiala's opener.
Hartlepool flew out of the blocks and took an eighth-minute lead when Nsiala bundled home at the back post after Lewis Alessandra beat his man and sent in a pin-point cross.
There was plenty more action in an entertaining opening period, Stead and Matthew Bates hitting the woodwork at either end.
The former struck the post again early in the second half, before Lang capitalised on Pools' defence switching off by slotting a deserved equaliser into an empty net.
Stead would eventually produce the decisive moment, turning coolly in the area and sending a left-footed strike beyond Trevor Carson.
Pools pressed for a leveller to preserve an unbeaten league start, but their efforts proved in vain as the Magpies collected a first win of the campaign.
