[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first of 15 National Trails being made available on Google Street View has gone live.

The entire North Downs Way, a 153-mile trek from Farnham to Canterbury and the White Cliffs of Dover, can now be viewed online.
The trails cover some 2,500 miles in England and Wales.
Rangers and volunteers will eventually film every mile using Google Trekker equipment - a backpack fitted with a cluster of 15 lenses.
Other National Trails currently being mapped include the Yorkshire Wolds Way, which is the first of the trails to have all its stiles removed to make it more accessible.
A spokeswoman for Google said the Trekker technology enabled images to be gathered while manoeuvring through tight, narrow spaces or locations only accessible by foot.
She said the idea was to make the trails accessible to everyone.
Previous locations captured by the Trekker technology include parts of the Peak District, Loch Ness and Machu Picchu.

Volunteer Dennis Atherton, who is mapping the Yorkshire Wolds Way, said carrying the 23kg (50lb) camera equipment is not easy, especially when passing under trees.
Anne Clarke, of Walk Unlimited, which is co-ordinating the filming, said people considering a visit will be able to see exactly what the routes are like.
She said: "These routes are really special and when people see them online they can't help but be inspired.
"I think sometimes people think places like the Yorkshire Wolds Way are long-distance trails and are too hard.
"If they can see it, it will make them think 'actually, it's beautiful, I'll give it a go'."
It is hoped the National Trails project will eventually extend to include the England Coast Path, which is due for completion by 2020.
