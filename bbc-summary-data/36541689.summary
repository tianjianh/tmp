The 24-year-old joined the Bantams on a three-year deal last summer after being released by Blackburn and scored once in 16 appearances.
He previously played under Iron boss Graham Alexander when the duo were at Fleetwood.
"We're really pleased because I think he will bring a lot to the team," Alexander told the club website.
