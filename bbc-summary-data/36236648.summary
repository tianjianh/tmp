[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher Paul Mansell struck off for messaging pupils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who messaged two female pupils on social media has been banned from the classroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Mansell was arrested after allegations of inappropriate contact first emerged in 2008, a professional conduct panel heard.
No further action was taken. In 2013, while teaching in Lichfield, it emerged Mr Mansell had exchanged messages on Snapchat with another pupil.
The panel issued a prohibition order after finding three allegations proved.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership hearing in Coventry was told Mr Mansell admitted exchanging messages with a girl in 2013 while teaching at Friary School in Lichfield.
He also admitted using the pseudonym "Steve Baker" to message the girl on Snapchat, which, the panel said, was to "conceal the fact" he was contacting her.
Mr Mansell further admitted exchanging messages on MSN with a second girl around 2007, around the time he was working at Perryfields High School, Oldbury, as part of a Graduate Teacher Programme.
Allegations of sending inappropriate images to the first pupil, and engaging in inappropriate physical contact with her, were not proved.
The panel said that Mr Mansell was a "competent teacher and well-regarded by his colleagues".
It added that while a prohibition order would be "potentially devastating" for Mr Mansell, "the reputation of the profession was more important".
