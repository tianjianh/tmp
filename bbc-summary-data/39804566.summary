Several explosions were reported in the factory in Arganda del Rey, 27km (16 miles) from Madrid, the regional emergency service said on Twitter.
The cause of the incident is still unclear. The area has been evacuated.
A thick plume of smoke could be seen from afar. It was not known whether or not it was toxic.
But air quality measured locally showed normal readings, the emergency service said (in Spanish).
