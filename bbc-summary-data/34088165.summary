According to Harry Fogg who lives in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, the answer is firmly "No!"
The 83-year-old has become a food critic and has written a restaurant guide for older diners.
He catalogues eateries across Tameside, Oldham and Derbyshire - as well as judging the food, Harry lists features he says are important to older diners - including how quiet the venue is and ease of access.
Mark Edwardson reports.
