Three Lincolnshire hospitals are to be refurbished after an NHS Trust was granted £25m in funding.

Lincoln County, Boston Pilgrim and Grantham and District hospitals will use the cash to update wards, modernise buildings or extend car parks.
The money has been secured through ProCure21+, a Department of Health scheme for developing NHS services.
United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) said the work would ensure high-quality and more efficient services.
The trust was taken out of special measures earlier this year after it was criticised for its lack of staff and poor patient care in 2013.
The latest work, expected to be completed by March, will involve changes to maternity wards at Boston Pilgrim and Lincoln County hospitals and improved facilities for dementia patients.
Paul Boocock, the trust's director of estates, said lighting, heating and ventilation would also be updated at the sites to reduce costs in the long term.
"It's an important step in transforming our clinical services and ensuring they are safe and sustainable for the 21st Century," he said.
"By modernising our buildings, we can better meet high-quality clinical standards and become a more energy-efficient organisation."
The work comes ahead of a major review of health and clinical services in Lincolnshire.
A public consultation will be held later this year to get people's views on the future of care and services, including the possibility of one central maternity unit in the county.
Christine Talbot, chairwoman of Lincolnshire County Council's health scrutiny committee, said while the funding was "good news" she had concerns about money being spent when services could change following the review.
