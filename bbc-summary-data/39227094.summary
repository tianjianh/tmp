"We're in the position we are now because we've played well throughout the course of the season.
"Of course you want to win every game, but you have to be realistic as well. We're not in a position where we can beat everybody.
"The thing is in how we've played and lost in the past couple of games away, is the little mistakes we've made not because the other teams were better than us."
