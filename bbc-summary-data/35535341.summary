[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sinn Féin to select fourth assembly candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Féin is to meet next week to select a fourth candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone for this year's assembly election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A team of three male candidates was selected last month which resulted in Michelle Gildernew being left off the ticket.
The meeting gives the former MP and minister another opportunity to be put on Sinn Féin's list.
Ms Gildernew had been replaced on the ticket by current MLA Phil Flanagan.
Analysis: 'Major embarrassment' for Sinn Féin
He had missed out on selection at a previous convention almost two months ago.
In December, Ms Gildernew was selected to run alongside sitting MLA Sean Lynch and local councillor John Feely.
However, Sinn Fein's ruling council (Ard Comhairle) ordered a revote.
The party did not specify why, but it has been reported that concerns had been raised about procedural errors.
A new convention at the end of January in Enniskillen replaced Ms Gildernew with Mr Flanagan, who will now stand alongside Mr Lynch and Mr Feely.
In December, the outgoing MLA Bronwyn McGahan announced she would not be seeking re-election.
However, Ms McGahan did put her name forward for the latest convention but was not successful.
