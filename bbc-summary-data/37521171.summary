There are 280 centenarians living in Northern Ireland, and almost 90% are women, new figures suggest.

The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) said the number of people aged 85 and over has risen by 1,000 each year for a decade.
The proportion of the NI population older than 85 is, at 2%, lower than in other UK countries, said NISRA.
But over the decade ending in 2015, Northern Ireland had the largest level of growth (37%) among this age group.
A record number of people in the UK - some 14,570 - were aged 100 or older, the latest official data shows.
That number has quadrupled over the last two decades, according to Office for National Statistics figures for 2015.
