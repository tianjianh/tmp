Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani is in talks to buy a major stake in Championship side Leeds United, BBC Sport editor Dan Roan reports.

In May, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino said he regretted buying the club, and that he wanted to sell his 80% stake.
A proposed sale to a Leeds fans' group collapsed in October 2015, despite a deal being agreed in principle.
Previous talks over a sale to Red Bull also fell through with the deal reportedly close to completion.
The Yorkshire Evening Post reports that a sale of the club to Radrizzani is not close, with talks at an early stage.
Radrizzani co-founded leading sports media agency MP & Silva in 2004.
He was photographed with Cellino at last weekend's opening game of the season between Leeds and Queens Park Rangers.
Cellino bought Leeds in April 2014, but his ownership of the club has been the subject of regular protests by supporters since then.
The Italian was banned from running the club in December 2014 until the end of the 2014-15 season after being found guilty of tax evasion by an Italian court, but later had his suspension quashed when his conviction was overturned.
He has sacked six managers and head coaches since taking over at Elland Road, with Garry Monk appointed as his latest head coach in June.
