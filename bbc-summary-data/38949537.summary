Police said the large crowd of 14 to 17 year olds gathered at Belmont Park on Saturday night.
PSNI said the young people had come from Belfast and further afield.
Chief Inspector David Moore said: ""Police seized a large amount of alcohol at the scene and there was also evidence of drug misuse."
"We can't underestimate how dangerous this kind of behaviour is.
"I am also reminding parents that they need to be aware of where their children and young people are, what they're getting up to and to talk to them about the danger of getting caught up in the moment and the possible outcomes they could face if they are found committing any offences."
