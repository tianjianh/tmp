Held on 4 and 5 June, the competition forms the third stage of the UCI World Cup Downhill championships and was first held 14 years ago.
The organisers have now released details of this year's crowd.
They said 8,300 fans turned up on the Saturday and there was a record single day attendance of 10,800 on Sunday.
The organisers said the figures made this year's the most well attended UCI World Cup Scottish event so far.
Saturday's attendance was 23% higher than for the same day last year, which was affected by bad weather.
The competitions are held on a course at Nevis Range, near Fort William.
British downhill rider Rachel Atherton won the women's final for the ninth consecutive time.
Salisbury-born Atherton finished 12 seconds ahead of second placed Tracey Hannah, from Australia.
Manon Carpenter, from Caerphilly, South Wales, recovered from a crash to finish third.
South African Greg Minaar won the men's final. The USA's Aaron Gwin was second and Danny Hart, from Redcar, third.
