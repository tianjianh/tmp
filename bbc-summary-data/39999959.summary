Rory Doyle, 41, went on a 24-minute wrecking spree at the site at Chivenor Cross, near Braunton, north Devon.
He ripped up the road surface, demolished lampposts and dug up drains.
Doyle, who admitted criminal damage, has been given an 18-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to pay £2,500 in compensation.

Exeter Crown Court heard he was angry about the manner of his sacking, following a dispute with his foreman, in April 2016.
Doyle, of Waterloo Road, Torquay, said his foreman was bullying him and paying him less because he was a contract worker.
He told a workmate: "I swear blind I will come back and tear the place up. They don't realise things swing both ways."
Doyle has also been handed a five-month curfew and ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid community work and to attend anger management sessions.
Judge Mrs Justice May said: "It would appear he was trying to undo all the work he had done in the previous week."
The total cost of the wrecking spree was estimated at just over £100,000.
This included a £22,000 penalty payment the contractors incurred for overrunning.
Greg Richardson, defending, said Doyle was a hard-working man and the only breadwinner for his family, who would suffer if he went to jail.
He said: "He would like to express his regret for letting his anger get out of control and get the better of him in a serious way.
"He felt that as an agency worker he was bullied in the workplace and particularly put upon by the foreman."
