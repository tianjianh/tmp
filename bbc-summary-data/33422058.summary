A minute's silence has been held at a peace centre in Warrington to mark the 10th anniversary of terrorist attacks on London transport.

Fifty-two people died and more than 700 were injured in the July 2005 bombings on three Tube trains and a bus.
The Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace is holding a memorial event involving invited schoolchildren.
The centre was set up in memory of of Tim, 12, and Johnathan, three, who were killed in the 1993 Warrington bombing.
The 7 July suicide attacks - carried out by four bombers linked to al-Qaeda and carrying rucksacks of explosives - was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil.
Pupils from Priesthorpe School in Leeds - where the London transport bombers were from - and Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester are at the foundation's event which includes an anti-terror workshop.
It was a very moving session to remember the victims of the London bombings with schoolchildren from Manchester and Leeds taking part.
In a room, chairs were arranged in the form of a Tube carriage. Each person took their seat in one of the seats before reading out words written on a card about a victim or a survivor.
On a screen to the right, there were photographs of some of the victims of the 7 July attacks.
Each child was given a prop - a book, a newspaper, an umbrella - to represent the people who were thrown together in this carriage.
The service had a big impact on those children who were here as part of the centre's THINK project which addresses extremism and goes out to schools across the north.
For the past 10 years, the foundation has worked with survivors of the 7 July terror attack, providing support through initiatives such as the counter-extremism education project THINK.
Chief executive Nick Taylor said: "We are fully aware that violent extremist groups use prejudice and discrimination as a way to gain support.
"It's vital, therefore, that we make young people realise that there is another way so they can turn their back on extremism, and become positive leaders within their peer group and society as a whole."
