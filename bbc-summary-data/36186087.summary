Swansea City defender Angel Rangel says meetings between the club's players helped them to avoid relegation from the Premier League.

A poor run of form saw manager Garry Monk leave in December, with Alan Curtis put in temporary charge before Francesco Guidolin's appointment.
The Swans' 3-1 win against Liverpool on Sunday ensured a sixth season in the top flight.
"We said we have to show character and resilience to get points," said Rangel.
"The main message was that we have taken the Premier League status for granted at some points and it was important to get that [safety] first and see how far we could go.
"When you have three managers in a season, you know it's not going to be easy."
At Christmas, Swansea were without a win in seven league games and were 18th in the Premier League table, two points from safety.
But Sunday's victory capped off a turnaround which has seen the club rise to 13th, 11 points above the relegation zone.
"At some moments there haven't been convincing wins but they have been wins, especially against Aston Villa and Norwich, they were vital for us," Rangel added.
"Winning that gave us confidence but overall, at any cause, the most important thing is to stay in the Premier League and we've done that."
After finding opportunities limited at the beginning of the campaign under Monk, Rangel has been a key part of the side under Guidolin, starting the last nine games.
"It was great in January when Francesco got the job and I got back in the team and did my best," he said.
"I was happy to help the team and get safe again.
"Getting relegated wasn't in my plans at all when I came to Swansea."
