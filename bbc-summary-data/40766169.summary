T20 Blast: Essex v Gloucestershire washed-out by rain at Chelmsford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rain washed out all play in Saturday's only T20 Blast match between Essex and Gloucestershire at Chelmsford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South Group match was abandoned shortly after it looked as if the teams would play a five-overs-a-side contest with Gloucestershire set to bowl first.
Both sides take a point each, with Essex Eagles remaining bottom of the group with six points from nine games.
Gloucestershire Gladiators move up a place to sixth with eight points having played eight of their 14 group games.
