[SN]TITLE[SN]
Permanent home for Great Tapestry of Scotland selected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A permanent home for the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the Scottish Borders is to be built in Galashiels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors voted in favour of the location for the project at a total cost of about £6.7m.
It will see the town's post office brought back into use, a former Poundstretcher store demolished and a new building erected.
Scottish Borders Council had originally selected Tweedbank for the project but agreed to change location.
The decision brings to an end a long-running debate over the scheme.
A site at the terminus of the Borders Railway had been selected but that was before the Galashiels option emerged.
Since then, the local authority has examined both locations and had been advised to select the project which was seen as having greatest regeneration potential.
The Scottish government will contribute about £2.5m towards the scheme and Scottish Borders Council has earmarked £3.5m.
That leaves a funding shortfall of about £700,000 for the Galashiels option, but it is hoped that other organisations will provide support.
Public opinion in the region remains divided over the benefits of the project.
Community group Energise Galashiels said it could be a "game-changing boost to the town".
However, others have criticised the level of spending on the scheme at a time when local authority budgets are under considerable pressure.
