The BBC One period drama and baking contest are on a shortlist of six shows from 2015,  which also includes the Peter Kay comedy Car Share.
The award is the only trophy at the prestigious ceremony to be awarded purely on the basis of a public vote.
It will be handed out at the awards ceremony in London on 8 May.
Last year's winning show was Benedict Cumberbatch's hit drama series Sherlock.
The shortlist for this year was compiled by a panel of leading entertainment and media journalists who "spent hours locked in heated discussion to decide upon the nominees", said the Radio Times.
"British television is on a roll and viewers are revelling in this new golden age of choice and creativity," said RT editor Ben Preston.
"This shortlist is truly six of the best - six great but very different shows which all captured the public imagination and got the nation talking."
Poldark was a remake of the 1970s costume drama series adapted from the novels by Winston Graham and which starred Robin Ellis.
Set in the 18th Century, the story follows the life and loves of the dashing Ross Poldark, played by Aidan Turner.  The show made a heart-throb of Turner - previously known for playing a vampire in BBC Two supernatural series Being Human.
Meanwhile The Great British Bake Off, judged by top chefs Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood and presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, began in 2010 but continues to increase in popularity and was the most watched TV show of 2015.
More than 15 million people tuned in to see Nadiya Hussain crowned best amateur baker.
Car Share was co-written by its stars Lancashire comedian Kay and Sian Gibson and centred around two colleagues sharing their journey to and from work.
BBC One drama series Doctor Foster, which starred Suranne Jones in the title role, will also face the public vote. The five-part series revolved around a GP and her adulterous husband's deteriorating marriage.
Also nominated is Channel 4's thriller Humans, starring Gemma Chan, and rounding off the shortlist is the Netflix documentary series Making A Murderer.
Amanda Berry, chief Executive of Bafta, said: "The six shortlisted programmes showcase truly entertaining and captivating television from last year.
"Every programme that made the list caught the public's attention and created conversation over the past year, which makes this a tough but exciting decision to make and I'm looking forward to finding out who the winner will be."
Voting runs from 29 March to 5 May with the winner announced at the awards at London's Royal Festival Hall.
The other Bafta TV nominations will be announced on Wednesday morning.
