The latest Sportscotland Avalanche Information Services season has seen SAIS teams encounter a mixed bag of conditions in Scotland's hills.

Previous winters featured frequent snowfalls, freezing temperatures and months-long coverings of deep snow.
SAIS teams recorded cascades of loose, dry snow called sluffs also rime ice and plenty of avalanches.
But this winter snow has had to compete with rain and warmer weather.
Between December and mid-April, SAIS assesses avalanche hazard in six areas - Lochaber, Glen Coe, Creag Meagaidh, Southern Cairngorms , Northern Cairngorms and Torridon.
As well as providing detailed analysis of the potential risk of avalanche, the various teams photograph conditions in the hills.
