[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ending child poverty in Wales by 2020 is still a "key priority", the minister responsible has said.

Lesley Griffiths was speaking ahead of the launch in Wrexham of new plans to tackle the problem.
Boosting incomes for poor workers and helping families manage household budgets will be two new objectives.
Ms Griffiths had told AMs in January it was "50/50" whether the 2020 target would be kept because the work involved was "increasingly complex".
On Friday, she said: "Although levels of poverty in Wales remain stubbornly high, important progress in key areas has been made."
There had been a fall in the number of children living in workless households, and the number of 16-18 year olds not in employment, education or training (NEET), she said.
