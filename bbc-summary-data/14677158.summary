The British Embassy in Rabat said Roger and Mathilde Lamb from Pensham, near Pershore, died in separate falls.
A spokeswoman said Mrs Lamb fell from a window of an apartment in the resort of Essaouira while Mr Lamb fell downstairs at a different building a few days later. They both died in hospital.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said the exact circumstances of the deaths were being investigated.
The FCO is providing consular assistance to the family.
In a statement, the couple's families said they were "deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths".
The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira.
Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives.
He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday.
"We heard first of all that he was badly injured. And then on Monday we heard that he had died," he said.
Mr Lamb, who was an engineer and a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was working in Christchurch, New Zealand, while his family remained at home in Worcestershire.
The families said their main concern was for the couple's children.
"Roger and Tilly's families have been deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths while on holiday in Morocco," the statement said.
"Our principal concern at the moment is to provide love and support to their four sons who have had to suffer the loss of both a mother and a father in swift succession.
"The boys are being well cared for by relatives.
"We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the British consular authorities in Morocco for their invaluable assistance."
The mayor of Pershore, John Grantham, said people who knew the couple had been saddened by the news.
He said: "They're clearly very upset, it's been quite a shock."
Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, had relatives in Wiltshire.
A spokesman for Wiltshire Police confirmed that her body was being repatriated to the county.
