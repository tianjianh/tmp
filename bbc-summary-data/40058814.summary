Baby M's remains were found in Manor Park, Church Hill, in Aldershot on Friday 19 May.
Police said witnesses reported seeing what appeared to be pools of blood on the pavement opposite Kwik Fit.
It is thought the baby was left in the park between the evening of Sunday 14 May and Tuesday 16 May.
More on this and other stories from across the South of England.
Officers say concern is growing for Baby M's mother and their priority is to find her so she can get the medical attention she needs after giving birth.
Ch Insp Debbie Brooks of Hampshire Constabulary said: "We hoped we would have found her by this point but unfortunately this is not the case.
"If you think you may have seen someone in a distressed state, squatting or leaning against the trees please contact us.
"Finally I'd like to reiterate our appeal to Baby M's mother. We are worried about you, we want to get you the medical care we know you need."
Sharon Bunford, senior midwife at Royal Surrey County Hospital, said: "We are worried about you, we are sorry for your loss, we want to get you the help you need.
"You may be suffering from bleeding, pain or infection. You might have flu-like symptoms such as fever and shivering.
"Please come and see a GP or come to hospital so we can help you."
A memorial service for the child was held in the park on Sunday.
