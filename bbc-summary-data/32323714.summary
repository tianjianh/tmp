Pennie Davis death: Jurors warned to be 'cautious' over evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jurors in the case of a mother-of-five killed in a "particularly brutal attack" should treat evidence they have heard with caution, a judge has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pennie Davies, 47, was found dead in a field in the New Forest on 2 September last year.
Justin Robertson, 36, denies murder while Benjamin Carr, 22, has denied arranging for her to be killed.
Judge Justice Andrew Popplewell QC told the jury both men "had their own interests to serve" in court.
Mr Carr, of Edward Road, Southampton and co-accused Samantha Maclean, 28, of Beech Crescent, Hythe, both deny conspiracy to murder.
Summing up at Winchester Crown Court, the judge said the prosecution's case was that Mr Carr had recruited Mr Robertson to kill Mrs Davis over fears she would go back to police with sexual assault allegations made against him.
Mr Robertson, the judge told jurors, "denied being involved in any such plan."
He had claimed a set of keys found near Mrs Davis's body which linked him to the crime had been "planted".
During trial, Mr Carr had said he recruited Mr Robertson to "scare" Mrs Davis and warn her away from his family, but not to harm her.
The judge said Mr Carr had told the court he and Robertson "hadn't considered the possibility" Mrs Davis could scream and resist during the incident.
"He said that it was simply a case of hoping that putting the frighteners on her would keep her out of his life," the judge said.
Both men had given evidence during trial to support their own case while undermining the other's, the judge told the jury.
"Treat it with caution," he said, "because they have their own interests to serve".
Ms Davis had seven knife wounds to her torso and five to her right arm, the "depth and number" of which may have led jurors to conclude she had been subjected to a "particularly brutal attack", the judge said.
Ms Maclean's case was that "she did not know of any plan" to kill Ms Davies, the judge said.
He is expected to finish summing up on Thursday.
The trial continues.
