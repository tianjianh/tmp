[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 63-year-old, who represented the West Midlands, had served in the European Parliament since 1999.
He was diagnosed with bowel cancer shortly after being re-elected in May and died on Friday night.
The Prime Minister said Mr Bradbourn had a "truly admirable" dedication to public service and described him as a "well-respected and effective" politician.
Mr Bradbourn was appointed an OBE in 1994 for his public and political service.
He had been a town planning officer in local government for more than 20 years before becoming political adviser to the Conservative group on Wolverhampton City Council.
Born and bred in the Black Country, Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Bradbourn took "immense pride in championing the West Midlands" and would be "sorely missed".
Ashley Fox, leader of the Conservative MEPs, said: "His no-nonsense approach to politics made him a powerful voice for the West Midlands as well as a resolute defender of the British taxpayers' interests in Brussels and Strasbourg."
