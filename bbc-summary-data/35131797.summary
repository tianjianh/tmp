Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard some employees at Linde Heavy Truck Division used powered drills, grinders and ratchets for up to six hours a shift.
The company had pleaded guilty to breaches under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
It followed an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.
Judge Richard Twomlow said workers sustained injuries which had "an obvious effect on their daily lives".
He said workers were unable to grip objects, woke up with their hands in a locked position and were unable to do up shirt buttons.
He added that the issues "came to light as a result of the company complying with regulations".
Merthyr Tydfil's truck division of Linde has since shut.
