Comments: If you were a wrestler what name would you pick?

Ayshah recently went to Liverpool to find out if she's got what it takes to become a wrestling superstar.

She got tips from wrestlers Finn Balor, Enzo Amore, Big Cass and Bayley!
She also found out, that to become a wrestler you need a great name.
From Dwayne 'The rock' Johnson to Undertaker, Roman Reigns, Gran Metalik and Goldust, wresting has some pretty great character names.
So we wanted to know, what would your wrestling name be?
