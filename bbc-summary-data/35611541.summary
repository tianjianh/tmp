Chris Simpson says he needs to develop a "super-strength" to beat the likes of James Willstrop and Nick Matthew.

The 28-year-old form Guernsey has never beaten either of the UK's top two and lost to Willstrop in the semi-finals of last week's national championships.
"It's very hard to say what you need to do to beat them consistently because there's not many people, if anyone, doing that in the world at the moment.
"For me it's trying to develop a bit of a super-strength," he told BBC Sport.
"I feel my game's very consistent and I can compete with them in most areas, but both of those players have a real super-strength that they know they're the best in the world at - and at the moment I don't feel like I have that super-strength.
"From my point of view that's something I have to develop to start beating the best players in the world."
