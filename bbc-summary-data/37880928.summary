[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Morris scored his 15th goal of the season as League One leaders Scunthorpe took all three points at Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morris steered Paddy Madden's cross home at the near post as the Iron secured their sixth away victory.
Both sides had efforts blocked on the line in the first half, while Sky Blues striker Marvin Sordell tested keeper Luke Daniels just before the break.
Ruben Lameiras and Jamie Sterry had chances for an equaliser after Morris' goal, but Scunthorpe held out.
The victory extended their lead at the top to five points, with Bolton - who began the day in second place - not in action at Peterborough until Sunday.
And the margin could have been greater if Tom Hopper had not shot wide late on after beating the offside trap.
Coventry had won three of the four previous league games under interim boss Mark Venus, and remained 18th in the table despite their sixth home defeat of the campaign.
