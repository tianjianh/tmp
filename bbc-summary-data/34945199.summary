Scottish SPCA in illegal snares plea after cat loses leg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal charity has issued a warning about illegal snares after a family cat lost its leg in East Ayrshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The four-year-old cat, named Stripey, was found with a copper snare attached to his leg on disused land near the site of a former school in New Cumnock.
A vet later had to amputate the limb to save the cat, leaving the owners with a treatment bill of about Â£1,000.
The Scottish SPCA has asked anyone with information about the this or other illegal snaring cases to contact them.
A spokesman for the charity said: "Stripey's owners live opposite the playing fields and luckily a neighbour alerted them after spotting the cat in distress.
"When his owner found him, he could immediately see that Stripey was very badly injured as his leg was hanging off.
"The vet prepared his owners for the worst case scenario, which was that he may have to be put to sleep. This was incredibly upsetting for them as Stripey has been a much loved family pet for four years."
The charity said the copper snare recovered was designed to target rabbits.
However, it was untagged and non-locking, both of which constitute offences under the Snares (Scotland) Order 2010.
The cat was found on land near the former site of New Cairn Primary School, which was demolished a number of years ago.
