'Haunted' Carbisdale Castle near Ardgay up for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former stately home said to be haunted by a ghost called Betty has been put back up for sale after a plan to turn into a hotel was abandoned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carbisdale Castle, near Ardgay in Sutherland, is owned by the Scottish Youth Hostel Association (SYHA).
It stopped running the property five years ago and a deal to sell it to a developer fell through this month.
Selling agents Savills have put the category B listed 40-bedroom castle on the market for offers over Â£900,000.
The previous asking price was offers over Â£1.2m.
Its ghost is well-known among people who have stayed at Carbisdale when it was a hostel. SYHA even dubbed one of the top-floor bedrooms as the "spook room" because of claims it was haunted.
Betty is said to appear dressed in white in various parts of the property.
The ghost does not get a mention in the sales material.
The castle and its entrance gates are listed as category B, which means they are structures of regional historical importance.
The Dowager Duchess of Sutherland had Carbisdale Castle built near Ardgay between 1907 and 1917 following the death of her husband, George Granville William Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Third Duke of Sutherland.
Lady Mary was the duke's second wife and after he died she became embroiled in a legal dispute over his will with her stepson, the fourth Duke of Sutherland.
When the row was settled the duchess used her inheritance to have Carbisdale constructed.
During World War Two, King Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav were given sanctuary at the castle during the Nazi occupation of Norway.
