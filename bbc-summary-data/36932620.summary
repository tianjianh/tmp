The circuit takes in the Strand, Buckingham Palace, St Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Embankment and the new East-West Cycle Superhighway.
Amateur riders in the Prudential RideLondon event are alongside stunt riders performing at a separate event.
An elite women's race will take place later while a men's race featuring Tour de France champion Chris Froome.
The three-day event began on Friday at the Lee Valley VeloPark in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park with a handcycling race and under-14 and under-16 challenges for budding cyclists.
Ahead of the event London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would take part and challenged Froome, who last weekend became the first Briton to win Le Tour three times, to take part.
"I've challenged him to a race," said the mayor.
"If he's got any sense he'll say no to save my pride, but it's really important, people being confident about riding bikes, not just those middle aged men in lycra like me but also people who are occasional riders."
Professional stunt bike riders displayed their skills at an event at the Green Park.
Stunt cyclist Andrei Burton broke three world records within 15 minutes, organisers said.
Burton side-hopped 157.5cm up to a platform, vertically dropped 3.34m onto a tiny target and popped his back wheel left-to-right 75 times over a wooden bar.
After being handed his new Guinness World Record certificate, Burton said: "Three world records before breakfast - how good is that?
"It feels brilliant though."
Several roads have been closed to traffic in central London and the City of London over the weekend for the event with closures in place from 05:00 BST to 18:00 BST, Transport for London said.
