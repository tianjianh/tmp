Gary Holt: Norwich City first-team coach leaves to seek boss job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City first-team coach Gary Holt has left the Championship club by mutual consent after two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 43-year-old ex-Scotland and Canaries midfielder returned to Carrow Road in 2014 after leaving his role as Falkirk boss to coach under Neil Adams.
He continued the role when Alex Neil took charge in January 2015, and has seen them promoted to and relegated from the top flight in 12 months.
Holt now intends to seek a head coach or managerial role.
"I've had some great and memorable times at Norwich City both as a player and as a member of the coaching staff," he told the club website.
"Now the time is right for me to seek a fresh challenge as a head coach or manager and I want to thank everyone at the club and the fans for their support for me over the years."
