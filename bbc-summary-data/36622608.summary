Aberdeen bypass work being allowed to restart after flooding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some work is being allowed to restart on the Aberdeen bypass after it was halted while flood water from the huge site was dealt with.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A seven-day halt to construction was agreed last week with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa).
Heavy rain had caused muddy water to run into nearby watercourses.
Sepa said that while certain activities had now been authorised to resume, detailed discussions were ongoing with contractors about other sections.
