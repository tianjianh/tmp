[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 2-2 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover's National League play-off hopes suffered a major blow after they were held to a draw at home by Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dover realistically needed to win to have any chance of overhauling Aldershot for the final play-off position and sit three points adrift with a goal difference inferior by six, with just a game to go.
The hosts enjoyed the better of the opening exchanges but Oliver Norburn opened the scoring for the visitors in the 31st minute when he was at the back post to convert from close range after a long ball from the right.
But Dover were level five minutes before the interval when they were awarded a penalty and Ricky Miller sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.
Anthony Dudley then fired Macclesfield ahead in the 73rd minute when his shot went through the legs of goalkeeper Mitch Walker.
Dover at least earned a point through Ross Lafayette's late goal but it kept their promotion hopes only barely alive.
They travel to Barrow on Saturday while Aldershot host relegation-threatened Braintree.
