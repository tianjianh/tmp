A BMW driver clocked 129mph on an Anglesey road as he feared he would miss a ferry to Ireland, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Habib Malik, 48, from Birmingham, was banned from driving for 56 days and fined Â£150 after admitting breaking the 70mph (122 km) speed limit on the A55.
He was caught speeding on 15 June as he tried to reach Holyhead.
Magistrates in Flintshire told him he would not have made the ferry or seen his family again if he had had an accident at that speed.
Dublin takeaway owner Malik said he was ashamed and embarrassed by his "totally unacceptable and inexcusable speed" as he tried to make a 20:00 BST ferry.
