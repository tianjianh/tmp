Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared on the Greek island of Kos on 24 July 1991.
Earlier this month, it was alleged digger driver Â­Konstantinos Barkas may be responsible for his death.
A search team of 19 officers, forensic specialists and an archaeologist have been digging for six days.
BBC reporter Danny Savage, who is in Kos, said: "They are clearing an area where the digger driver who is believed to have accidentally run Ben over on the day that he disappeared was working at the time.
"They are clearing the trees and then they will be bringing in the earth mover to start digging up the site.
"There is an air of optimism. They are here on pretty solid information that they believe Ben was killed in an accident on that day in July 1991. They believe that they can find the remains of Ben."
The search was briefly held up on Friday after officers uncovered ancient graves and were asked to stop by the landowner.
However, the search resumed after concerns about the tombs were resolved.
