Last posts: The Moray Firth's relics of World War Two

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seventy-five years ago the Battle of Britain was being fought in the skies above southern England.

On the ground, across Britain, preparations were being made to counter the invasion expected if Germany gained air superiority over the RAF.
Large concrete box-like structures - pillboxes, gun houses and anti-invasion cubes - began to appear on key roads and on beaches.
Many of these defences can still be found on the Moray Firth's shores.
With walls covered in thick green moss and surrounded by tall pines, or barnacle-encrusted and sinking into the orange sand of a beach, the old defences look like the video game Minecraft gone to seed.
The boxy concrete structures are relics of Britain's action plan in 1940 to defend the coast against amphibious landings.
On Moray Firth, the coastal defences ran all the way from Cullen Bay to Findhorn Bay.
At Lossie near Lossiemouth, heavy gun emplacements and pillboxes to protect machinegun posts were constructed. Polish soldiers were regularly tasked in the building work.
Many of Lossie's defences survive today, preserved because the area now forms part of Forest Commission Scotland-managed woodland.
But just along the coast at Roseisle, a commission-owned seaside forest near Burghead, some of the defences are losing a battle with nature.
Beyond the pines, anti-invasion cubes and the hulks of pillboxes are slumped sideways on a curving stretch of beach.
Some of the cubes have been smashed by storms and the broken pieces are gradually being ground down into particles of sand themselves.
Allied pilots eventually won the Battle of Britain and the threat of invasion lessened.
Moray's defences were never used in anger, but remain to be a reminder of how seriously that threat was taken.
Matt Ritchie, Forestry Commission Scotland's archaeologist, said: "At over 8km in length, the coastal defences in Lossie Forest comprise the longest and best-preserved length of anti-invasion cubes and pillboxes in Scotland.
"The abandoned defences remind us of a time of preparation and defiance, when Britain felt very vulnerable and alone."
He added: "But be sure to take care as you walk among the remains."
