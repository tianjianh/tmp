The concrete Northam Bridge, which carries the A3024 road as a dual carriageway, needed waterproof coating.
The Â£1.2m works started in January and were expected to be completed in May, but the bridge has now reopened.
Jacqui Rayment, from Southampton City Council, said delays caused by the works were "absolutely necessary".
She added: "I'm sure drivers will welcome the news that we have been able to fully reopen Northam Bridge ahead of schedule.
"The bridge is a critical element of Southampton's transport and road network, which is why it was so important that this work went ahead when it did to protect the structure and ensure its future.
"Southampton and the wider regional economy is dependent on these key routes and we have avoided extensive future problems through these timely interventions."
On the first morning of the roadworks, some motorists faced delays of up to an hour as lane closures were put in place.
It's reopening was greeted with a sigh of relief on Twitter, with Mads tweeting: "Northam Bridge being reopened is a dream."
