A sculpture consisting of thousands of ceramic red poppies marking the 100th anniversary of World War One has gone on show at its first location in Wales.

The Weeping Window was part of an installation displayed at the Tower of London in 2014 to mark British and Commonwealth deaths in the war.
It goes on public display at Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, on Tuesday for six weeks as part of a UK-wide tour.
The castle is home to the Royal Welch Fusiliers museum.
The regiment fought throughout the war, including at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, and included a number of poets including David Jones, Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Hedd Wyn.
The event, which is free for the public to view, sees a cascade of poppies flowing from the wall of the castle to the ground.
It will also be accompanied by an exhibition entitled Remembrance for Peace, featuring Wales' Book of Remembrance from World War One.
The exhibition is staged by 14-18 NOW, the UK-wide arts programme marking the war's anniversary across the four years.
Executive producer Nigel Hinds said: "Caernarfon Castle is a poignant and fitting place for the poppy sculpture Weeping Window to be presented as part of its tour of the UK.
"It is particularly fitting that the poppies will be at the castle over the centenary of the last weeks of the Battle of the Somme, in which the Royal Welch Fusiliers played such an important role."
Julie James AM, deputy minister for skills, said: "The loss suffered by those affected by the First World War was felt for generations, and this exhibition offers an important opportunity to remember and commemorate all those lost."
