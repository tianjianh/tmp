Dutch football giants Ajax have paid tribute to East Kilbride FC for equalling their world record run of 26 consecutive wins.

East Kilbride reached the landmark at the weekend with a 4-2 victory over Vale of Leithen.
The run started back in March, with a win over Whitehill Welfare.
Manager of the Lowland League side Martin Lauchlan said the achievement was fantastic , while Ajax called the feat a "great job".
The amazing run has brought praise and attention from across the football world, but the club's status may not see it being officially recognised.
Lauchlan told BBC Scotland's Off The Ball programme:  "For part-time players it's a terrific record, it's not just unbeaten - it's wins, the boys have been fantastic for me since I took over.
"We can only beat what's in front of us, I'll let other people argue if it's going to be recognised or not, we'll just keep the run going. It's the old clichÃ©, we've played one game at a time and we've done very well."
The game that sealed the 26-match run went down to the last five minutes and saw East Kilbride come back from 2-1 down.
Lauchlan added: "The ultimate aim is to get into the top flight of Scottish football, there's 80,000 people in East Kilbride so I think they deserve a football team.
"We're just going to try our best this season, we've started extremely well, the record's great, but at the end of the day we've not won anything yet."
The Guinness record for most consecutive association football victories was set at 26 by Ajax, between 3 October 1971 and 29 March 1972.
The team comprised players including Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens and Piet Keizer.
