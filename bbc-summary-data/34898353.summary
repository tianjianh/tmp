The 32-year-old world number three - a four-time runner-up - secured a 11-6 11-7 12-10 victory to become the second Frenchman to win the trophy.
Gaultier, a two-time British Open champion, follows compatriot Thierry Lincou, who won the title in 2004.
"There's no words that can describe this feeling," said Gaultier.
Gaultier, who will become world number one when the new world rankings are published on 1 December, added: "It's unbelievable. It's better late than never. Since I was a kid it was always my dream to win this tournament."
