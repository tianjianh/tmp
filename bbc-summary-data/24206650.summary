Channel Island 'well equipped' for university students

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey could cope with an influx of up to 2,000 students and staff, the organisation behind plans for a university has insisted.

Susan Jackson Associates wants to set up a university for the Channel Islands, based in Guernsey.
The island's government has said, while it would bring economic benefits, the impact of such a large influx of students could not be underestimated.
But Susan Jackson said the extra numbers would dovetail with tourists.
"It's actually scarcely more than the annual population variation through the normal annual economic cycle," she told BBC News.
She said the islands already cater for thousands of  holidaymakers during the summer months, so were well equipped to deal with students during an academic year which would run from October to June.
"Our university would be contra-cyclical to the tourism industry as it will be mainly a nine month - non summer - industry."
The States of Guernsey will be asked to support the principle of a Channel Island university at its meeting next month.
