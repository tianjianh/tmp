Election 2015: Jones appeals to 'anti-Tory majority'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones is urging the "anti-Tory majority in Wales" to back Labour in May's general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahead of a speech in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, on Friday, Mr Jones said a "progressive alliance" of voters was building to "kick out the Tories".
Meanwhile, the chief executive of Flintshire-based Iceland has explained why he is backing the Conservatives.
Malcolm Walker warned a change of direction "could risk all that has been achieved in growth and job creation".
He will meet Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb at Iceland's headquarters in Sealand later.
Mr Walker was one of the 100 business leaders who signed an open letter backing Conservative economic policies earlier this month.
Speaking before the meeting on Friday, he said he needed a UK government that "understands and supports business needs, provides the country with economic stability, puts growth at the heart of its plans and creates conditions that help businesses to flourish, such as lower taxes.
"I believe that a turn away from the direction we have pursued for the last five years could risk all that has been achieved in growth and job creation."
But Mr Jones said a change of direction was what most people in Wales wanted and many voters were moving to Labour.
"The vast majority of voters, up to 75% of them in Wales, will be going to the polls in less than two weeks with one big thing in common - they want an end to Tory rule at Westminster," he said.
"But, many of them are going to wake up disappointed if we let Tories in the backdoor by splitting the progressive vote where Welsh Labour can win."
Analysis by political correspondent Daniel Davies
With the SNP on the rise in Scotland, every Welsh seat becomes all the more important to Labour.
In the final two weeks of the campaign, where does Labour find those votes that could be crucial to help Ed Miliband into Downing Street?
Carwyn Jones's intended audience is voters tempted by Plaid Cymru and people who sympathise with Labour, but who have not voted in recent elections.
Last week, Plaid leader Leanne Wood told me on BBC Wales' Sunday Politics that her MPs might, in some circumstances, not support a minority Miliband government.
It prompted warnings from Labour that voting Plaid risked letting in the Conservatives.
The first minister is developing the theme today, with his attempt to put himself at the head of an "anti-Tory majority".
Also on Friday, Ms Wood called on young people to make their voices heard and join her party.
Ms Wood, who will be campaigning in Aberystwyth, said she had "witnessed at first hand the democratic revolution" of Scotland's independence referendum.
"I spoke to a number of 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland who had the right to vote for the first time," she said.
"I know that young people here in Wales have the same yearning to shake up the system as they had there."
