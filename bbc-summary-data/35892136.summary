Burnley academy graduate Long, who can play at centre-half or right-back, has made 27 appearances for the Clarets.
The 25-year-old has not featured for Sean Dyche's side this term, but made 13 appearances on loan at League One side Barnsley earlier this season.
"He's a wonderful size and he's good on the ball," Dons manager Karl Robinson told the club website.
"We saw him play for Barnsley this season and he was exceptional in the games that we watched."
