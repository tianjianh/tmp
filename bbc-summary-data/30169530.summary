Liam Payne has confirmed that Four is "definitely not" One Direction's last album.

Speaking to Scott Mills during the Radio 1 Chart Show, which saw their fourth release in being named number one in the UK, he said they're already talking about the next one.
"I think we're going to go about it differently this year," he said.
"We're just going to chill with it a bit this year but there's definitely another album coming."
"I had one of the songwriters around my house the other day and we were sitting down and talking about how we're going to go about it."
Liam's comments follow reports that Four, which is One Direction's third consecutive UK number one, would be their last.
He explained: "People will ask us 'Is this the last album?' and we'll just say 'yes' for a joke.
"Whatever you say you are held to account for. It's ridiculous. About 97, 98 per cent of the stuff we say is stupid stuff.
"People, especially in other countries, take it genuinely seriously.
"It's quite hard actually because I don't think we don't grasp the consciousness to be serious about things yet."
Speaking to Scott from a hotel room in Florida, Liam added: "We just make these jokes and we get in trouble and we end up on the front pages.
"When you read the articles back, they've asked you a question and you've answered in a jokey way and then they write a different question.
"It's totally taken out of context and you're like 'That was a bright idea'."
He went on to say how important it was for their latest album, which sold 142,000 copies this week, to make it to the top of the chart.
"This was our album that we really worked on," said the 21-year-old.
"With the other albums we've had a lot of help with, so for this one to be number one is actually a bit more special."
When asked about the reception Four is getting, Liam said: "It's our fourth album, you think 'Are people going to get bored?'
"We've just been really conscious to work hard on the music and make it something different.
"I think we're getting quite good at surprises now."
He went on to describe feeling "like a president" when the band arrived by speed boat to launch the album at Universal Studios in Florida and that it crosses his mind most days that his life is "a little bit strange".
He added: "I was told there was going to be 200 people but there. There was like 10,000. It's pretty amazing I don't understand how."
Liam said the band "still travel together", flying around the world on the same private jet.
"Our jet's a very strange jet," he explained.
"Louis just carries a Sharpie everywhere with him. He does it with his friends when they come back, if they fall asleep they get something drawn on their face or a few choice words on their arm.
"There's loads of crisps and Haribo and rubbish food.
"We always order McDonalds or something. They won't bring it out in a bag, they won't do that on a jet. They serve it on a plate.
"It's not as glamorous as you think. The word jet is the most glamorous thing about it.
