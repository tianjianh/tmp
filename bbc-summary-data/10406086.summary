A council facing a £10m deficit over five years has agreed a package of £1m of savings, which includes job cuts.

South Northamptonshire Council announced nine vacant posts, including a head of service, will not be filled and another four jobs will go.
The council said the aim to minimise cuts to frontline services and officers would focus on improving the efficiency of the local authority.
It said it hoped to avoid charge increases, but could not rule them out.
Ian McCord, portfolio holder for resources at the council, said: "Further cost reductions will be required.
"When reductions in central government grants and other external factors become clearer, we will announce what further steps need to be taken.
"We will continue to provide the services that our residents need in a cost effective way, and to look at other innovative ways to tackle this issue.
"The council has an estimated five-year deficit in its revenue budget of nearly £10m as a result of the recession.
"This is due to the associated loss of income, anticipated cuts in the revenue support grant, and changes in funding for services such as concessionary fares. Consequently, councillors have some very difficult financial decisions to make."
The decision to find £1m of savings was made at a full meeting of the council on Wednesday.
