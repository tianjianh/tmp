The Kelso-based Borders Search and Rescue Unit was called out in the early hours of the morning.
The elderly woman, who has dementia, had been reported missing from her home in Eyemouth.
A police helicopter spotted her at about 04:00 walking on the rail lines and the rescue team took her to safety.
BSARU team leader Stuart Fuller-Shapcott said: "When she was spotted actually on the lines, it suddenly became extremely urgent.
"With me was a police inspector, who immediately liaised with train operators to make sure any traffic on the railway was stopped."
The helicopter directed search teams to the location, where the woman was found moving slowly with two sticks on rough railway ballast.
"She was confused and had sustained minor injuries in reaching the lines through hedges and fences, and in stumbling repeatedly on the difficult ground," said Mr Fuller-Shapcott.
"We ferried her to safety on a stretcher, from where she was transferred to a road-ambulance and taken for observation to the Borders General Hospital."
