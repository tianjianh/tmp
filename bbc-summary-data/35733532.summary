Jennings scored the only goal on 13 minutes with a header from an acute angle following a corner.
The hosts tried to force the issue in the second half but fashioned little, Rob Sinclair missing an opportunity to stretch Forest Green's lead late on.
Rovers stay two points behind Cheltenham, while Gateshead drop to ninth, three points off the play-offs.
Forest Green assistant manager Jamie Day told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"We played really well for the first 25 to 30 minutes and showed what a good side we are. We could have been two or three up. That's probably the only criticism.
"After that, the boys had to dig in a little bit but they were first class. You come to places like this and the home team is going to get back into the game.
"But they defended incredibly well, so credit to them. We had a good shape, the back four was very solid and the boys dealt with what they had to."
