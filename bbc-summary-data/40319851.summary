Shirley McCay scored the opener in the 35th minute when she reacted quickest to a bobbling rebounded ball from Zoe Wilson's initial sweep.
Anna O'Flanagan dragged a good chance wide before Seul Ki Cheon netted with a superb drag flick.
Katie Mullan ensured victory over the world ranked number nine team with a goal on the reverse.
Ireland defeated Olympic bronze medallists Germany 2-1 in their opening match on Thursday but lost 5-2 to China in their second fixture on Friday.
Speaking after the victory over Korea, Ireland head coach Graham Shaw said "We controlled the phases a lot better today than we did against China.
"It's very pleasing to see the areas we discussed being implemented and we're very happy with the performance and result.
"This 4 Nations has been invaluable for us in our preparation for World League in Johannesburg and we'd like to thank German Hockey for the invitation."
Ireland were using the tournament to prepare for World League 3 in July and the Eurohockey Championships in August.
