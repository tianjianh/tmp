Tom Curran, from the governing Fine Gael party and who has a gay son, said it was the happiest day of his life.
Gerry Adams, the president of the opposition Sinn Fein party, said it was "a good day for equality and Ireland".
Campaigners against gay marriage have expressed disappointment but some offered their congratulations.
Mr Curran, the Fine Gael General Secretary, said: "We have gone back to the old values of decency and honesty and treating everybody as the same.
"So I tonight will go to bed knowing that my son is now treated the same as my other two sons and my daughter."
Ireland's Health Minister Leo Varadkar, the country's first openly gay cabinet minister, called the referendum a "social revolution".
Irish celebrities have been adding their voices too, including comedian Dara O Briain and talk show presenter Graham Norton.
There has also been praise from high-profile celebrities from around the world.
Politicians have been weighing in too.
Among the 'no' campaigners, Senator Ronan Mullen said he was disappointed but added, "There's a lot of goodness in why people were voting 'yes' and why people were voting 'no'".
Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said the Catholic Church would need a "reality check" after the vote.
"It's clear that if the referendum is an affirmation of the views of young people, the Church has a huge task in front of it," he said.
David Quinn of the Iona Institute, a Catholic think-tank said it had been an impressive victory for the 'yes' side.
And BBC News website readers have been sending in their comments.
Joe Darcy emailed: "I have a 30 year old gay daughter. In all her life I have never heard her say she was proud to be Irish. Until today."
Clare Eagleton said she was glad that Irish people had voted yes, but said it was strange that non-gay people should have their say.
"Gay people must feel very odd knowing people are voting about an aspect of their lives that will have no bearing on the vast majority of people."
