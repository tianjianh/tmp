"A great three points on the back of Friday night. We couldn't have got off to a better start and I thought for the first 15 minutes we were excellent but fair play to Southport I thought they came back into it.
"The lads stood strong and it's a really good three points for us.
"We won the game and it's just a case of us trying to keep our shape and discipline which was good. We've just got to try and look after the ball better."
