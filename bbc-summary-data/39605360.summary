[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Dobbie gave the home side the lead with a fine finish but Sons soon hit back.
Goals from Sam Stanton and Thomson before half time gave them a lead they would not surrender.
The win takes Dumbarton into seventh spot in the Championship, three points above the relegation play-off spot and five clear of bottom club Ayr United.
The first half was an open affair and Dobbie produced goal 24 of a prolific season with a clinical finish, turning sharply and shooting past Alan Martin after 15 minutes.
That lead lasted just five minutes, though. John Rankin brought down Lewis Vaughan at the edge of the box and Hibs loanee Stanton produced a stunning effort to score past Lee Robinson.
Thomson netted the winner after 39 minutes, rising at the far post to nod Christian Nade's cross beyond Robinson.
The second half was as dull as the first was exciting, with Dobbie and Thomson trying their luck with no joy.
Gregor Buchanan should have made it 3-1 in 80 minutes but he was unable to find the net with his header.
Match ends, Queen of the South 1, Dumbarton 2.
