The Markinch-based company went into administration on Monday with the loss of 325 jobs.
Despite being 70% employee-owned, staff were given no warning about the situation.
A Scottish government taskforce was also due to meet to discuss what support it can give to the workforce.
About 150 workers are being kept on in the short term to process existing orders.
The news comes on the back of a wave of closures in Fife including Longannet power station and Velux.
Former staff have been invited to a recruiting event in Markinch on 6 May.
It has been organised by Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace), the Scottish government's initiative for responding to redundancy situations.
It will feature about 20 exhibitors including a mix of support agencies, training providers and employers who are looking to take on staff.
The taskforce has been set up by the Scottish government and Fife Council with funds of Â£6m.
Business minister Fergus Ewing said the potential impact to the wider community "cannot be underestimated".
"Pace is a successful initiative which has helped many facing redundancy in the past and I am confident that next week's event will go some way to assist those who have been dealt this devastating blow," he said.
"We will bring support agencies, training providers and employers who are interested in recruiting together to help Tullis Russell staff back into employment.
"The taskforce, co-chaired by the deputy first minister and leader of Fife Council, will meet for the first time to agree next steps and determine the focus and priority of the Â£6m spend as part of the wider economic support for this community and the Fife economy."
