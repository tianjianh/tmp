[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queen of the South 0-1 Hibernian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John McGinn's solitary goal gave Hibernian a deserved victory over Queen of the South.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotland international's third goal of the season was a well-worked effort from a James Keatings corner early in the second half.
Neil Lennon's men squandered a handful of chances at Palmerston.
Queens rarely troubled the visitors' defence as Hibs extended their lead at the top of the Scottish Championship to eight points.
In wet conditions Hibs dominated possession in the early period and could easily have been in front with a bit more composure in front of goal.
Grant Holt fired an awkward bouncing ball over from 10 yards after latching on to a David Gray headed knock-down.
Keatings turned well on the edge of the box before curling a 20-yard strike inches over, then it was the turn of Andrew Shinnie, who ended a powerful run with a right-foot shot that went wide.
Holt became angered by team-mate Jason Cummings as Hibs looked for a breakthrough. The veteran striker was in the process of trying to get his head to a McGinn cross when Cummings tried an acrobatic overhead kick, almost decapitating his fellow striker with his boot as he attempted to connect with the ball.
Queens failed to threaten at the other end with Ross Laidlaw in the Hibs goal only tested once in the first half, having to cut out a cross from Jordan Marshall.
Hibs' goal appeared to come straight off the training ground. Keatings' delivery from the right picked out McGinn arriving late into the box and his left-foot volley took a deflection as it landed in the back of the net.
Within a minute Queens came close to an equaliser when Joe Thomson's shot had to be turned round the right-hand post by Laidlaw.
Another Keatings set-piece delivery, this time from a free-kick, almost produced a second when Holt, with the deftest of flicks, steered the ball wide.
Stephen Dobbie had a chance to level but the Queens top scorer blasted over from the edge of the box.
And Hibs did enough to secure their fifth successive win in all competitions.
Queen of the South manager Gary Naysmith: "The players gave me everything they've got in terms of energy and commitment.
"We just switched off for 15 seconds at the corner and didn't see John McGinn coming in late, even though we had everybody back, but that's what's cost us the game.
"Hibs had more of the possession and probably controlled the game - we expected that. Just after they scored we had a great chance when their keeper made a fantastic save from Joe Thomson's shot and I thought for the last 25 minutes we gave as good as we got."
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "I thought we were excellent and the scoreline could have been a bit more in our favour.
"For long periods I thought we controlled the game, probably didn't penetrate as we would have liked first half, but in the second half we had a really good spell for about 25 minutes. Obviously, we got the goal and their goalkeeper made a couple of fantastic saves to keep them in it.
"John McGinn was exceptional and deserved his goal. He was the one player even in the first half trying to thread balls through and cut Queens open.
"We've only 19 fit players today and I would like to get at least one more player in certainly to bolster us."
