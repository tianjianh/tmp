[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bath park-and-ride decision put on hold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on exactly where a new park-and-ride site will be built on meadows near Bath has been put on hold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bath and North East Somerset (Banes) Council voted through the plans, but the specific location was not decided.
A cross-party review into the three proposed sites at Bathampton Meadows will now take place.
It follows a council meeting that lasted until the early hours, which was attended by about 200 members of the public.
A final decision on the specific location is now due to be made early next year.
A group of campaigners staged a protest outside the Guildhall in Bath, where the meeting took place.
The park-and-ride site is needed to help alleviate traffic congestion in the city, according to the Conservative-led council, but more than 5,500 people have signed a petition against the plans.
Mark Stephens, from the Save Bathampton Meadows campaign group, said he believed the city was "being really let down".
"My principal concern is that this scheme is being sold as busting congestion and improving air quality, but there's no evidence it's going to do that."
Anthony Clarke, cabinet member for transport, said: "We remain committed to an east of Bath Park and Ride as it has an important role in improving transport, tackling congestion and supporting our local economy.
"We look forward to seeing the recommendations that come back from the cross-party working group, which will assist the cabinet in coming to a decision early next year."
Conservative MP for Bath, Ben Howlett, said he was "delighted" with the decision to allow the project to go ahead.
"I know there have been vocal opponents of the scheme, but as the MP for Bath it is important I continue to champion what is best for Bath," he said.
"From the numerous conversations and correspondence I have received it is clear to me that the majority of Bath residents are in favour of a fourth park-and-ride scheme for the city."
