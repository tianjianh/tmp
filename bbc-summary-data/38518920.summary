UK City of Culture: Hull charter exhibition marks city's history

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition has opened telling the story of the first four centuries of Hull through its city charters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hull Charters Exhibition features the city's first document, which dates back to 1299, when King Edward I bought the settlement of Wyke on Hull.
It was then renamed Kingston upon Hull - meaning king's town.
The charters also showed how Hullovians were granted privileges, rights and responsibilities as the city grew and developed.
From relatively small beginnings, Hull grew into a major commercial hub, organisers said.
City archivist Martin Taylor said: "It really is something, a real connection with the city's past to see our birth certificate, the 1299 Charter. The original medieval parchment dated 1 April 1299 which brought what we now know as the city of Hull into being."

Other kings and queens gave charters to Hull over the years, granting new privileges and confirming existing ones.
The charters also instituted local government consisting of a mayor, a sheriff, and 12 aldermen.
The exhibition is being held at Hull History Centre, and will run until 24 February 2017.
It is part of Hull's 2017 City of Culture celebrations.
