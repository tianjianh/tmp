A missing Post Office worker whose bones were found in a boot on a beach has been declared dead by a coroner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North west Wales senior coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones confirmed the death of Avril Whitfield, 57, from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, who went missing in April.
Her remains were discovered by a man walking on the beach at Llanddwyn, Anglesey, in September.
"There was nothing to indicate that the foot had been forcibly removed from the leg," the coroner added.
A toothbrush, hairbrush and other materials were taken from Ms Whitfield's home and DNA tests found a "perfect match" with the bones.
Mr Pritchard-Jones said: "The samples in the boot definitely belong to the person who owned the toothbrush and hairbrush.
"It's now a matter for police to carry out their inquiries to try to find out what happened to Miss Whitfield, how she came to be in the sea."
The inquest was adjourned to a later date.
