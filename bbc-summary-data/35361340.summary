A 13-year-old girl who was mauled by a friend's dog said she is determined the scars will not ruin her life.

Georgia Sigourney needed 50 stitches to her face after being savaged by the Siberian Husky named Dakota.
She was 12 at the time of the attack at the Peterborough home of family friend Sarah White in October 2014, the Peterborough Telegraph first reported.
White was convicted of possessing a dog dangerously out of control earlier this week.
Doctors said they do not know whether Georgia will be scarred for life.
She said: "When I first came back from hospital I did ask 'can you take the mirrors down?' because I'm not very used to things like that.
"I don't stay away from dogs... but I don't play with them because I want to keep my distance from them."
Her father Chris Sigourney said he did not want White - who is due to be sentenced next month - to go to prison but "she needs to appreciate that she is responsible".
The case originally went to trial last year but collapsed over a legal technicality.
The family fought for it to be heard again and a new trial took place at Peterborough Crown Court.
White claimed she was looking after the animal for a friend, but the jury found her guilty.
