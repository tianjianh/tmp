Fans will flock to the ExCel centre for the latest in comics, graphic novels and related memorabilia.
Talks and autograph sessions are also held with comic book creators.
Jaw-dropping costumes can be seen at the event, although organisers stipulate they must have "enough body coverage to be worn in public".
