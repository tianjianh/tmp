[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being invited to give their views on plans for a permanent site for Travellers and Gypsies in Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys council revealed its preferred site, the cemetery car park on Newtown Road, at a Machynlleth town council meeting last month.
An engagement event takes place at Machynlleth bowling club on Monday from 14:00 GMT until 18:00.
Powys council officers will be on hand to provide information and answer any questions.
Machynlleth is one of three areas in the county deemed to need a travellers' site to meet rules set out by the Welsh Government.
An assessment carried out last year found sites were also required in Brecon and Welshpool, but Machynlleth has been described by Powys council "as an immediate or urgent need".
People will be able to provide comments formally on the proposed development when the council submits a planning application.
