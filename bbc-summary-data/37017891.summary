Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves continued their unbeaten start under Walter Zenga as they played out a goalless draw against Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts missed an early penalty when Adam Webster fouled Jon Dadi Bodvarsson, who saw his spot-kick saved by Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
Ipswich's Daryl Murphy had a goal ruled out by the linesman when he headed in from a Christophe Berra cross.
Helder Costa almost sealed a late three points for Wolves with a long-range volley, but Bialkowski dived to save.
The result meant the hosts slipped to eighth in the Championship table despite recording their sixth clean sheet in their last seven home league games,
Meanwhile, Ipswich lie in 12th, with Mick McCarthy's side having kept their first clean sheet of the season.
Wolves had signed Congo international captain Prince Oniangue prior to the match, but the former Reims midfielder had joined too late to feature against the Tractor Boys.
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga:
"I am always happy because my players did everything that they could. We cannot win every game but we understand that it is the right way for Wolves to come strong.
"I repeat again that the players are amazing and they did a great job this evening. I say thank you to the players because one point at the moment is a very important point. We have to build up the season.
"This is the style and we know that we have to put the ball down and play faster with our quality. We chose the right time to put [Helder] Costa on.
"He can create some problems and he did. Unfortunately he did not score but if he had scored we would have all gone crazy."
Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy:
"I am delighted and fuming at the same time because I think that we have been denied a really good goal. It is a shambles really.
"I have looked at it and Freddie [Sears] is in front of the goalkeeper and it flies past him - and I'm not even convinced that he is in an offside position.
"I think there is a defender who is level with him and even if he is not I saw a goal recently when a player shot and someone was in front of the goalkeeper, and it was a goal. They are the rules now, unless you motion towards it.
"I think that it is a really poor decision and I'm annoyed about that - but I'm thrilled and delighted by the performance."
