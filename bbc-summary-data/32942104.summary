"To say that today is a good day for me or for Fifa, this would be totally wrong.

"I have never lost my mind.
"I'm not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I'm not a fool].
"What was wrong with me is at the end of the World Cup in Brazil I should have stopped."
"Fifa is still working well."

"At the end of my term I will give up Fifa in a strong position."
Blatter proves to be far from psychic about the end of his reign, speaking after he won won a fifth term as president,May 2015.
"Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts.

"That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?"

Blatter says he believes Uefa is behind a campaign to remove him from the presidency, January 2015.
