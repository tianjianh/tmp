Essex chairman Nigel Hilliard steps down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Essex chairman Nigel Hilliard has stepped down with immediate effect, but will stay as a member of the county's general committee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 64-year-old, who played for Essex's second XI, became chairman in 2001.
"This has not been an easy decision but with my other interests taking more of my time, I cannot give the role the time it deserves," he said.
Deputy chairman John Faragher will take on the acting role while a permanent replacement is found.
