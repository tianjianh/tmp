The Ballymena & Antrim athlete cut 0.55 seconds off her previous best as she clocked 56.42 to finish second.
The 23-year-old's time was only 0.22 off the Olympic Games standard.
McMahon, a European Championship semi-finalist in 2014, will now chase the Rio Games qualifying mark over the coming weeks.
This year's Europeans take place from 6-10 July.
The Northern Ireland woman's previous best time this year was 57.78 seconds.
Meanwhile, Paralympic star Jason Smyth clocked a 100m time of 10.56 seconds at the same meeting.
Four-time Paralympic gold medallist Smyth is also targeting an Olympic Games spot this year but he will need to register 10.16 seconds to achieve that notable feat.
Smyth also helped an Irish 4x100m relay quartet finish second in the B final in Geneva as they clocked 39.55 seconds.
In other news, North Belfast's Gladys Ganiel won the women's race at the Irish Runner 5-Mile event in Dublin.
Ganiel, who is a reserve for Ireland's Olympic Marathon team, clocked 28 minutes and 36 seconds.
