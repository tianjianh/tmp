Welsh athlete Stanford, the 2013 world champion, won her first race of the season, finishing six seconds ahead of fellow Briton Jodie Stimpson.
"I'm delighted to walk away with the win and I guess it bodes well for the rest of the season," said Stanford, who is preparing for the Rio 2016 Olympics.
"It was a bit of a confidence boost and I loved being back out there."
The 27-year-old added: "I was quite apprehensive before the race and didn't really know what to expect.
"We'd been training really hard since the New Year but I didn't feel like I was in the best race shape.
"Obviously that's not the aim for this time of year, the aim is to keep building towards August."
Stanford won in 59 minutes 49 seconds in South Africa, ahead of Stimpson with Bermuda's Flora Duffy coming third.
Commonwealth champion Stimpson has missed out on Olympic selection after Wales' Helen Jenkins got the nod from British selectors.
Stanford and her training partner Vicky Holland had previously booked their places in GB's three-athlete team for Rio by finishing second and third respectively in the 2015 World Triathlon final last September.
Holland and Stimpson had won the Cape Town race for the previous two years, while Jenkins had won the previous World Series event on Australia's Gold Coast.
Swansea-born Stanford was delighted to have continued Britain's success not only in South Africa but in the World Series.
"It's great to be part of the team at the minute and atmosphere is fantastic," Stanford told BBC Wales Sport.
"We push each other on to better performances and I strongly believe in the mantra of success breeds success.
"We're pushing each other on to keep delivering the goods for Great Britain."
