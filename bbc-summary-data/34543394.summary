[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derry school canteen assistant gets £30k damages over cup drying injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school canteen assistant who sliced open her wrist while drying a mug is to receive nearly £30,000 in damages.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A High Court judge awarded the payout to Catherine Rooney after deciding that cleaning the cup fell within regulations on work equipment.
Mrs Rooney had been washing up in the kitchen area at Anne's Primary School, Londonderry, in March 2011.
The court heard that the handle on a mug broke off and sliced into her lower arm, damaging a tendon.
She later underwent surgery on her injuries at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and was off work for about a year.
She had taken off her gloves while drying the crockery.
In her action against the Western Education and Library Board it was accepted that her induction training did not include using gloves while drying items.
The claim centred on whether Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 applied to her case.
Mrs Rooney's lawyers argued that a cup does constitute equipment, while the defendant contended that it did not come within a list of work tools.
Ruling on the action, the judge held that pots, pans, cups and glasses being used to provide food and drink at the school fell within the regulations.
"This plaintiff cleaning the cup in question was using it, as part of the equipment of the kitchen as it had become, in her capacity as an employee of the defendant at her work," he said.
On that basis he held the defendant liable for breach of statutory duty.
Dealing with the level of pay-out Mrs Rooney is entitled to, the judge noted she has been left with a permanent scar.
He made an award of £25,000 general damages, plus a further £1,944 in special damages.
Loss of earnings put at just under £3,776 also featured in the outcome, along with interest and legal costs for the plaintiff.
