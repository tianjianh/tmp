Johns, 25, is undefeated in his 13 professional MMA fights, including his UFC debut in Belfast in November.
The Welshman takes on England's Entwistle at UFC Fight Night 107 at London's O2 Arena on Saturday.
"I'm feeling brilliant, it's an amazing atmosphere and I can't wait. It is a Battle of Britain," Johns said.
He added to BBC Wales Sport: "It's the first ever Wales v England fight and fingers crossed the Welsh will have that first win.
"It feels strange. This is a home fight for me but I'm behind enemy lines."
Johns had no problem making the bantamweight ahead of his fight, however his his opponent Entwistle came in 3 pounds over.
"I can't slate anyone for missing weight as I have done that in the past. It means that I get a bit of his money so I'm looking for a big pay cheque, now," Johns said.

Johns is one of 12 British fighters on the bill for the event as the UFC arrives in London.
It is the first UFC event of 2017 to be held in Europe as the sport looks to win more fans, with around 15,000 people expected at the O2 Arena on Saturday.
"It's a massive stage and will only get bigger from here, but I'm not looking forward to the fight or Entwistle. This is going to be a hard fight. Stylistically this is going to be a different match up but I'm ready to gom" he added.
"I'm going to punch him in the head as that's the only trick I've got, but tomorrow it will be 14-0. I will stay undefeated and the journey goes on."
