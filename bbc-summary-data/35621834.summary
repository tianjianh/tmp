A set of bells have been returned to a church near Swindon, where they will go on show as a "museum piece".

A blessing is taking place for the five 17th Century bells at All Saints Church at Liddington, which were sent away for restoration last year.
Project manager Tony Pullan said he was "pleased to see them back".
A new set of six bells is due to be installed in the belfry in July, which will allow bells at the church to be rung for the first time since 1979.
"They'll be installed back in the tower on Monday, and they'll be on view for anyone who's interested - it'll be a museum piece," said Mr Pullan.
"They're being brought back for preservation, not for use."
Once the old bells have been re-hung in the tower a new belfry floor and ringing chamber will be installed, as part of the ??200,000 project.
The casting of the new peal of six bells will take place in May, and they are due to be hung below the original set.
