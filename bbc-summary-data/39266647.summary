Coty, which makes cosmetics and perfume, said it intends to shut its plant in Seaton Delaval.
The US-based company said after a study of global manufacturing capacities it wanted to consolidate its fragrance operations into "fewer core centres".
The factory will close by the end of 2018, subject to consultation and board approval.
Coty said in a statement: "These proposals are the result of a detailed study of our expanded global manufacturing capacities and capabilities for each of our divisions following the merger with P&G Specialty Beauty brands and with the objective to enable our future growth.
"Specific timelines are still under consideration and subject to consultation in relation to these proposals."
Kay Plumley, site leader at Seaton Delaval said: "I am committed to fully supporting all our colleagues through the coming months.
"Our priority is to work closely with them and their families throughout the consultation and to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and with respect."
Councillor Grant Davey, leader of Northumberland County Council, described it as "worrying news".
He said: "The loss of so many jobs would have a massive impact, not just on individuals and their families but also the wider economy and future prosperity of the area.
"Along with our partners, we are exploring all avenues to see what support the council can provide in the short, medium and long term."
