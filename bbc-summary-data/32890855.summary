Black Angel was made on a shoestring budget by Roger Christian, who won Oscars for his work on Star Wars: A New Hope and short film The Bottom Dollar.
He plans to shoot scenes for the new feature in Scotland where the original Black Angel was filmed.
Proposed locations include Eilean Donan Castle, Glencoe and the Isle of Skye.
The original short was commissioned by Star Wars creator George Lucas.
Locations included Steall Falls in Glen Nevis, Loch Eck in Argyll and Dunoon Riverside Health Club's swimming pool.
Another location was the ruin of Bernera Barracks, an 18th Century red coats base in Glenelg.
The 25 minute-long film was made on a budget of Â£25,000.
Black Angel was shown in cinemas before screenings in Europe, Asia and Australia of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.
It is an Arthurian tale of a knight, played by Tony Vogel, who rescues a princess while he is returning home from the Crusades.
Following screenings in 1980, the film's prints disappeared for decades and were believed to have been lost before they were found by a film studio archivist in 2012.
Last year, for the first time in 34 years, Black Angel was given public screenings in Scotland.
A 45-day crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo has been started to raise Â£66,000 towards the cost of producing the feature length film.
Christian said: "I have to return to Scotland, it is a major part of Black Angel.
"I need Eileen Donan Castle as it was such a mystical and mythological element of Black Angel. A truly romantic vision that is an essential element of the film.
"I wanted to film in Glencoe originally, so am determined to film there this time. Maybe Skye, it's fascinating and quite appropriate for Black Angel."
The film-maker added: "Sadly I need studios for sets, so have to go to Hungary where existing sets and studios exist and tax credits make it financially viable.
"Also, the film starts in the desert so we will be in Morocco for that."
Filming could start in September with John Rhys Davies, Welsh star of Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones, and Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, best known for his appearance in sci-fi movie Blade Runner, attached to the production.
Christian, who also worked on Star Wars films Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, believes the time is right for the movie because of the successes of TV series Game of Thrones and the Lord of the Rings franchise in attracting huge audiences.
He said: "Black Angel is exactly for that audience - a legend full of drama, romance and action as a lone warrior with the help of a renegade princess and guided by an ancient sorcerer tackle the evil Black Angel and his army of undead."
