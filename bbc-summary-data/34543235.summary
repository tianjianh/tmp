Southampton: Ronald Koeman will not leave for Netherlands job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has said he is committed to the club and that there is "no possibility" of him becoming the Netherlands' next manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dutch coach Danny Blind's position is under scrutiny after his team's failure to qualify for Euro 2016.
Former Netherlands star Koeman, 52, said: "I like to stay, and I have after this season one year more. There's no way, no possibility [I could leave]."
"Maybe [I could be Dutch manager] in future depending on a lot of things."
