The Leaders Debate or The Weakest Link?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Thursday night before a Bank Holiday weekend is usually a time well spent down the local boozer.

But for seven politicians it was a chance to convince the nation that they were worthy of their vote come May's general election.
ITV's The Leaders Debate was a two-hour marathon - that if the broadcasters were to be believed - promised even more drama than the channel's usual 8pm hosts, Emmerdale.
So what did we learn and did it live up to the hype?
The seven fluorescent blue podiums left some viewers wondering if they were witnessing the return of one of our most iconic quiz shows.
And seemingly acutely aware of her set dressings, host and chief moderator Julie Etchingham did her best to channel her inner Anne Robinson.
Donning a sharp suit 17-year-old baby-faced assassin Jonny Tudor was arguably the real winner of the night.
The politics student asked the first of four questions from the audience and was then constantly name checked by the panel of leaders.
"I initially felt quite taken aback about being on first name terms with the prime minister, and that was quite exciting for me," he said.
But despite Jonny's obvious charms, the lady to his side left many wondering whether they were actually witnessing the most unromantic date in history.
Not to be outdone by Jonny - Victoria Prosser interrupted Prime Minister David Cameron as he tried to answer a question on prospects for young people.
The psychology graduate, who was asked to leave after her verbal salvo, told reporters: "My cause is speaking the truth and making sure as many people as possible start questioning people at the top, the 1%, who are not working in our best interests."
While we were promised drama on stage, it was audience that kept on giving.
In 2010 Nick Clegg took the political world by storm by addressing audience members by their first name.
This time round Labour party leader Ed Miliband made a habit of eyeballing the cameraâ€¦.to mixed reviews.
Despite wall-to-wall pre-debate build-up, overnight figures suggest coverage hadn't reached saturation point.
The programme averaged around 7m viewers, peaking at 7.4m.
That's somewhat down on the 9.4m that watched Gordon Brown, Nick Clegg and David Cameron lock horns in 2010, but a decent return for the seven-way verbal joust.
It also accounted for over 90% of all TV-related chat on Twitter, with around 1.5m tweets sent.
