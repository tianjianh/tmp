Jamel Boyce, 17, was left critically ill after being stabbed in the chest and leg in Clapham, south-west London, on 14 October.
His mother Pansy said it was "impossible" to describe the pain her family was suffering.
But she hoped the image would show the devastating impact of knife crime.
Detectives said the "minor scuffle" with four males may have appeared trivial to onlookers, but the teenager collapsed soon afterwards.
Jamel, a business student, was at a McDonald's in Clapham High Street when there was a dispute with the people he was with at about 15:00 BST on 14 October.
Four hours later the teenager was attacked in a road around 200 yards from the restaurant.
Bystanders gave him first aid before the arrival of paramedics who took him to hospital.
Mrs Boyce said: "It breaks my heart to release this picture of Jamel but it shows plainly the devastating impact that carrying and using a knife can have.
"I would hate for any other mother or family to go through what we are going through right now.
"If you know what happened, and who did this to my son, please look into your conscience and speak to police."
