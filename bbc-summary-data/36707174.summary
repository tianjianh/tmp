The sides, who will meet again at the Grange on Wednesday, were forced off before the Scots had a chance to bat.
Rahmat Shah reached 100 not out, while Najibullah Zadran was also unbeaten on 89 from 47.2 overs before the rain came.
Hampshire seamer Brad Wheal was Scotland's most productive bowler, taking two wickets for 51 runs.
With Scotland 13th in the world, they were hoping for vital ranking points against the team three places above.
