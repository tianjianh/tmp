BBC Children in Need presenters Tess Daly and Greg James kicked off this year's show with the promise they would "give everything" to pay tribute to long-running host Sir Terry Wogan.

The broadcast on BBC One is the first since the death of Sir Terry, its longstanding presenter, in January.
A fundraiser of the year trophy was awarded in memory of Sir Terry.
Eddie Redmayne took part in a sketch and Ricky Gervais, in his David Brent guise, is also part of the line-up.
There were also special editions of Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders, and a preview of the Doctor Who Christmas episode is also due to feature.
British Olympians Joe Clarke, Helen Glover, Lutalo Muhammad and Hollie Webb took part in the Strictly special.
Muhammad, who came within a fraction of a second of winning gold in taekwondo at Rio 2016, beat the other medallists to win the special edition of the dance show with his partner, Karen Clifton.
Redmayne featured in a special sketch recorded on the set of his Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which has just opened in cinemas.
The sketch included singer Britney Spears, former Great British Bake Off stars Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, Peter Capaldi as Dr Who, Simon Cowell and Sir Alan Sugar, among others.
The EastEnders cast took part in "an extravaganza", featuring Danny Dyer in a Top Gun spoof and some of the cast performing the 1980s song Foot Loose, while Rob Brydon hosted a junior edition of Would I Lie To You?
More than 1,500 children across 10 different UK locations are coming together to sing live during the show.
Gervais, meanwhile, is performing the title track from the film David Brent: Life on the Road, released earlier this year.
Tributes were paid to Sir Terry on the night, with a video montage showing his best moments from Children in Need.
The winner of the first Sir Terry Wogan Fundraiser of the Year Award - launched last month - was announced as Lauchlan Muir from West Lothian, Scotland, a boy who raises funds by being a "human statue".
Earlier, Radio 1 presenter James, who is co-hosting the show for the first time this year, paid tribute to Sir Terry, saying: "It is up to us to continue his legacy."
He referred to the famous remark made by Sir Terry on his last BBC Radio 2 breakfast show - "thank you for being my friend".
James said: "That sums up the man perfectly. To return the favour, the best way to do that is to give everything tonight."
Daly and James opened the show, with Graham Norton and Ade Adepitan presenting the central part of the night.
Marvin and Rochelle Humes are to close the show and reveal the final total.
There are also performances from Michael Buble and Little Mix.
Last year's Children in Need raised more than Â£37m on the night.
It was hosted by Dermot O'Leary after Sir Terry pulled out due to ill-health.
