Charlotte Eades, who died in February at the age of 19, was diagnosed with glioblastoma when she was 16.
Her YouTube channel, where she discussed the difficulties of dealing with her illness, has received almost 750,000 views.
Cancer charity CLIC Sargent also  made a short film about Ms Eades.
Her mother, Alex Eades, and her 21-year-old brother Miles have set off from Eastbourne to walk the South Downs Way to Winchester and back in 16 days.
They want to raise money to fund research and clinical trials into glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer in adults.
Mr Eades said the walk was "quite a big task".
"Hopefully we can advance, through our fundraising and subsequent research, the treatment for glioblastoma so it's not quite so traumatic and life-ending," said Mr Eades.
Her mother, from Brighton, said Ms Eades would be "very proud".
"I think just carrying on her memory would mean an awful lot to her," she said.
