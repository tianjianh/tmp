BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is former British tennis number one Tim Henman.

Henman, a four-time semi-finalist at Wimbledon who is now a regular in the BBC Sport commentary box, is back on court this week in the ATP Champions Tour at the Statoil Masters at the Royal Albert Hall.
The 40-year-old will take on the likes of former US Open champion Andy Roddick in a round-robin singles event and teams up with the American in the doubles.
Henman played a lot of football as a boy but says he never had ambitions to turn professional despite showing off his skills last summer when he beat the likes of Clarence Seedorf and Alan Shearer at the BBC Sport Copa-uppy challenge - keepy-uppies with a tennis ball.

He is an Oxford United fan and used to watch the U's play at their old home, the Manor Ground, in the 1980s.
"When I was growing up, Oxford were in the top division and Robert Maxwell was the money behind the team," he explained.
"Jim Smith was the manager and we had John Aldridge, Dean Saunders, Ray Houghton playing for us. Winning the Milk Cup at Wembley in 1986 was great. It's been a slightly different time since then."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
From the midweek Premier League programme, Lawro got seven correct results from 10 games, with one perfect score.
But his score of nine points was beaten by England Women's captain Steph Houghton, who also picked seven correct results, but with two perfect scores to give her a total of 11 points, and send her to the top of the guest leaderboard.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
