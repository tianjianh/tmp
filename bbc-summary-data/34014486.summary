Ann and Ken Fredericks, from Florida, eat one piece of the fruit cake every year to celebrate the day they got married.
They say their children are appalled that they're eating such old food but insist that it still tastes as good as ever.
The cake was made by Ann's mum back in 1955. So how does it taste? Watch this clip to find out.
But just remember it's definitely not advisable to eat food that is passed it's sell by date.
