[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers have made winger Ben Marshall unavailable for selection by boss Owen Coyle because of interest from Championship rivals Wolves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marshall will not be considered for the game against Birmingham City on Saturday after Wolves made an offer for the ex-Leicester City man last week.
The 25-year-old recently turned down a new contract offer from Rovers.
"I've told him that he won't feature in the game," Coyle told BBC Radio Lancashire
Marshall joined Rovers from Leicester in 2013 and has made 25 appearances this season, scoring once in a 4-2 home win over Rotherham in September.
"I had a good open and honest discussion with him and I've explained I'm not, and we as a club are not, prepared to go through what we had with the Shane Duffy scenario," said Coyle.
"I need a group who are committed and totally focused on beating Birmingham.
"Whether anything transpires between Wolves and the offer for Ben Marshall time will tell."
