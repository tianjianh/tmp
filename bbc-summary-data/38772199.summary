Dorset beach crawl man 'lucky to be alive' after leg break

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who crawled with a broken leg for more than two hours after falling from rocks on the Dorset coast has said he is lucky he to be alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tim Robinson, 54,  from Hilton, Derbyshire, slipped while walking under Golden Cap, east of Lyme Regis, on the Jurassic Coast, on 8 January.
He said he had to get off the beach due to the rising tide and the possibility of being crushed by "car-sized" rocks.
He was saved after using a pocket torch to send a Morse code signal.
Mr Robinson, who was looking for fossils, said he was "foolhardy" to have not taken his mobile phone with him while he explored the beach.
He said: "I stepped from one large rock to another and the second one had slimy seaweed on it and my foot slipped... I heard this crack and my leg had snapped."
The 54 year old, who has been a member of the Territorial Army for 26 years, said his "training kicked in" when he realised he had broken his leg.
He said he considered waiting for his wife to raise the alarm, but realised this was too dangerous as water levels were rising and he feared large rocks could fall from the cliffs.
In fading light he crawled for three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) using his small torch to send Morse code messages.
He saw lights being flashed back and as he got nearer he realised it was his wife, who had come out to find him.
"She said 'what have you been up to?' and I said 'I think I'm going to need an X-ray,'" said Mr Robinson.
He was later rescued by the RNLI and the coastguard.
Mr Robinson is facing another operation on his leg, but hopes to get back to full fitness in the near future.
