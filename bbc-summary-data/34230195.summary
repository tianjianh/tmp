Windass turned home Piero Mingoia's cross for his first in the 33rd minute before a mistake by goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik allowed him to steal the ball and fire home moments later.
Mingoia drilled in a third and Billy Kee made it 4-0 from Matt Crooks' pass.
Lee Holmes claimed Exeter's first and substitute Joel Grant also netted, but the visitors were already well beaten.
