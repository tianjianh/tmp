'Reasonable progress' in superfast broadband rollout

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The rollout of superfast broadband across Wales is making "reasonable progress", the auditor general said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh government signed a deal with BT in 2012, backed with Â£205m of public money, to provide broadband to 700,000 homes and businesses where there was no planned commercial rollout.
Auditor General for Wales, Huw Vaughan Thomas, wants the Welsh government to do more to tell people about it.
The Welsh government expect the rollout to be complete by the end of 2016.
The report by Mr Thomas said broadband access was available to just over half of the target number by the end of 2014, but many difficult-to-connect places remain.
It also noted initial weaknesses in the programme and project management by the Welsh government, but said there are now "clear and appropriate arrangements in place".
