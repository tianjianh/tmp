Chris Palmer's body was found near York's Ouse Bridge at 14:45 BST on Sunday.
Mr Palmer, a student at York College, fell into the River Ouse from the middle of the bridge at around 03.15 on Saturday.
Insp Dave Hunter, of North Yorkshire Police, said his family had been informed.
Onlookers tried to throw Mr Palmer a lifebelt before the emergency services arrived, but it is thought he got into difficulty and was unable to swim to safety.
His friend, Celine Metcalfe, paid tribute to her friend: "Everyone tried their best [to save him]. He was an amazing guy, no one will ever compare.
"No one will come close to him - he's someone who will be missed by many. He was so caring."
Insp Hunter said: "This is clearly a very tragic incident and it is important that the man's family receive specialist police support at this difficult time.
"We ask that people show the family respect and allow them to grieve in private."
Insp Hunter said: "We realise the emergency response to this incident caused a great deal of disruption during a busy day in York.
"We thank people and nearby businesses for their continued patience and support during the operation, particularly those who have provided vital information to assist police inquiries."
Several people have died in the River Ouse over the past few years, including Megan Roberts, Ben Clarkson, Tyler Pearson and Mandeep Ahluwalia.
