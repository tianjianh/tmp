Forces from Italy, Spain and Belgium made 28 arrests and searched 29 locations in Italy and Spain, a statement said.
The gang's key players were identified as Italian and Moroccan.
They collaborated with a vast network of associates across the EU in a sophisticated operation, police say.
Authorities seized some 40 cars, an estimated value of €3m (£2.54m, $3.37m), according to Italian police.
Computers, fake IDs, and €25,000 (£21,200; $28,100) of counterfeit money were also recovered.
Investigations into the gang began in Italy in 2015 after multiple reports from victims whose cars had been stolen. Italian authorities identified patterns in the crimes and links to incidents in other countries.
Separate investigations were carried out in Belgium and Spain.
The operation was coordinated by EU law enforcement agency Europol and Eurojust, the EU body that coordinates investigations.
Eurojust spokesperson, Ms Teresa Angela Camelio, said: "[The] action clearly demonstrates that the most sophisticated international criminal schemes can be dismantled thanks to excellent judicial and police cooperation at EU level."
