[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dublin man 'shot before being dismembered'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish police investigating the murder of a man, whose remains found in a canal, believe he was been shot before his body was dismembered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth O'Brien's torso was found on 16 January in the canal near Ardclough in Kildare.
The cause of Mr O'Brien's death has still be determined, but RTE are reporting that gardaí believe he may have been shot.
The 33-year-old Dublin man had recently returned to Ireland from Australia.
On Sunday, gardaí found bags containing suspected human limbs in the Grand Canal at Sallins, Co Kildare.
They are still awaiting the results of DNA tests to confirm the identity of remains.
On Tuesday, the Garda Underwater Unit resumed searches on the Grand Canal.
The unit has already recovered a motorised component for a power tool which may have been used in the dismemberment of Mr O'Brien's body.
The area has been sealed-off as crime scene since Sunday.
Boating has been restricted along the Royal and Grand canals until Sunday while the searches continue.
Gardaí have searched five crime scenes, identified by information supplied from the public.
They believe the brutality of the murder and the dispersal of the remains over such a large area points to the involvement of an organised crime gang.
