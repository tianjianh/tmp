The city centre gallery will close on 31 August for a £4.5m facelift to bring it up to the required standards.
Work has started to move 2,500 artworks into a "special climate controlled storage facility", the authority said.
There will be new lighting, humidity and temperature control systems when the gallery re-opens in early 2017.
Councillor Steven Bayes said the refit would allow the gallery to "host world-class visiting exhibitions".
"The renovation of the Ferens is a key part of getting the city ready for its year in the spotlight," he added.
"At the same time, it is an investment in the gallery's long-term future that will help to seal its reputation as one of most important cultural attractions in the North. "
Funding for the £4.5m renovation has come from the city council, HM Treasury and Arts Council England.
