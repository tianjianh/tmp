Derbyshire have appointed New Zealand international Hamish Rutherford as their vice-captain for all formats.

The 26-year-old batsman will assist new County Championship skipper Billy Godleman and Wes Durston in both one-day formats.
Rutherford has played 16 Test matches - the last of which came in January 2015.
"Hamish is an experienced international who already has a great relationship with the lads," coach Graeme Welch told the club website.
