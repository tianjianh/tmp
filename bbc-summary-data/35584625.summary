Indonesian jazz pianist Joey Alexander is the youngest performer ever to be nominated for the prestigious music award.
He did not win a Grammy but while the young musician performed on stage, the cameras panned across to singer Bruno Mars, who was watching with glistening eyes.
Many from Joey's homeland also expressed their admiration and support for the young star.
You were definitely the star of the show," tweeted Indonesian music composer Sherina Sinna. Movie-maker Joko Anwar also described him as a "hope".
Josiah Alexander Sila was born in Bali's Denpasar city to Christian parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran a tourism business.
His parents have described their son's talents as a "gift from God".
There were no formal jazz classes in Bali where he grew up, so the young musician took part in jazz sessions with more experienced performers.
It was then that his parents decided to make the move to the Indonesian capital Jakarta - home to one of the world's largest jazz festivals - to pursue Joey's musical dream.
He went on to win music competitions before his family moved to New York in 2014.
The child prodigy taught himself to play piano at age six, after his father bought him an electronic keyboard.
Joey has said that learning music came naturally for him, thanks to listening to songs from his father's personal jazz collection.
"My dad played a little bit of piano and guitar, but not that professionally," Joey said in an early interview, about falling in love with the piano.
"I saw him play and I said, 'I want to play. I want to try this instrument.'"
The young musician considers Harry Connick, Jr. and Herbie Hancock among his main musical influences, and also admires Clifford Brown and Miles Davis.
There could be something in the blood because he is also the nephew of Indonesian rock singer Nafa Urbach.
Renowned Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, discovered Joey after seeing him perform in a YouTube video in 2014.
Praising the young pianist on Facebook, he then invited him to play at the Jazz at Lincoln Center's gala, making him him an "overnight sensation".
Joey went on to make his US debut, performing at several Jazz festivals.
Joey's debut album titled, "My Favourite Things" was released on 12 May, 2015. He was 11 years old at the time of its release.
He  became the first Indonesian act to crack the US Billboard album charts, debuting at number 174.
The record re-entered the charts and peaked at number 59 in January 2016.
