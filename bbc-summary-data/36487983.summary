[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The display at Compass Gallery includes a British poster for Whisky Galore in 1949 and the French version posters for King Kong in 1933.
Also in the exhibition are those for 1950s movies Bus Stop, starring Marilyn Monore, and Attack of the 50ft Woman.
Hollywood film posters for audiences in Belgium and former East Germany also appear with USA and British ones.
The posters have been loaned to the gallery by Reel Posters in London.
For Scottish visitors, the poster for Whisky Galore is expected to be among those of greatest interest.
The film, and the book by Compton MacKenzie it was adapted from, was inspired by the grounding of the ship SS Politician off the island of Eriskay in the Western Isles on 5 February 1941.
Its cargo included more than 250,000 bottles of whisky.
