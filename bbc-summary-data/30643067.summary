The Prison Officers' Association said it was believed the inmate at HMP Elmley had taken synthetic cannabis.
The Ministry of Justice said both officers were taken to hospital, one with a suspected broken leg, following the assault on Tuesday night.
It said the matter had been referred to the police and an investigation was taking place.
A third officer was assaulted at the prison last week.
In November, an inspection report highlighted staff shortages and overcrowding at the jail.
It also found that high-risk inmates were not being properly assessed and managed.
About 150 prisoners were then temporarily moved from the prison just before Christmas to "help provide a more stable environment".
Extra prison officers were also deployed at Elmley.
Nine people have died at the prison in 2014, including four from suspected self-inflicted injuries.
