[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sami Khedira put the visitors ahead after just seven minutes following a deft one-two with Miralem Pjanic.
Napoli captain Marek Hamsik levelled after the break from Dries Mertens' reverse pass.
Mertens then hit the post from a tight angle after beating goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to Kwadwo Asamoah's back-pass but Juve held on.
The build-up to the game had been dominated by the return to Naples of former striker Gonzalo Higuain, but the 29-year-old was unable to have a meaningful impact on the match.
Roma's 2-0 victory over Empoli on Saturday had cut the advantage of Massimiliano Allegri's side to five points, while Napoli remain third, four points ahead of Lazio.
Elsewhere on Sunday, fifth-placed Atalanta thrashed Genoa 5-0 away and bottom club Pescara held AC Milan to a 1-1 draw at home.
