Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says it will be difficult to extend the loan spell of striker Kieffer Moore.

The 24-year-old has scored four goals in two games since joining the Gulls from National League rivals Forest Green Rovers for a four-week spell.
"We'll struggle to keep him for too long," Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"I'm working very hard to free up some money and to speak to (Forest Green manager) Mark Cooper to see if we can keep him for longer."
Moore's goals have seen the Gulls take four points from two games and end an eight-game losing streak.
"I tried to sign him about a year ago when he first came back from Norway and it didn't quite work out," added Nicholson.
"We finally got him and he's had a great impact on the team, he's raised everyone's standard and has had his own rewards with his goals."
