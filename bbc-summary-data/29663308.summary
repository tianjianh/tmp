Clashes continue over new Scottish powers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish and UK ministers are continuing to argue over more Scottish Parliament powers, exactly one month on from the independence referendum.

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said SNP ministers must accept the "No" vote, instead of getting on the "betrayal bandwagon".
Incoming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said it was the Westminster parties who were squabbling over devolution.
The Smith Commission is currently looking into more Holyrood powers.
Representatives from each of the Scottish Parliament parties are aiding the commission, set up by Prime Minister David Cameron, to agree a way forward by the end of November.
Following the 18 September independence referendum, Mr Carmichael said UK ministers had hit the ground running on the issue, and urged Ms Sturgeon to do the same.
"During the referendum campaign we set out a timetable for the devolution of further powers and we're not only meeting it, we're beating it," he said.
"I would call on Nicola Sturgeon to show genuine leadership and accept the result.
"There have already been cries of reneging on the more powers vow, even though the Smith Commission hasn't even proposed anything yet.
"The betrayal bandwagon is already getting dusted down. This is simply not good enough. The Scottish people have made their democratic decision and it must be respected."
Hitting out at the Scottish secretary's "desperate" comments, Ms Sturgeon said the UK parties were falling out with each other over more powers for Holyrood and introducing "English votes for English laws" at Westminster.
"In the month since the referendum, we have produced our submission to the Smith Commission, continued our engagement with the people of Scotland on more powers and witnessed a phenomenal rise in SNP membership as more and more people realise that it is the SNP that delivers for Scotland," said Ms Sturgeon, who takes over from Alex Salmond as SNP leader next month.
"It is time for the Westminster parties to show the same spirit of co-operation and compromise, to stop squabbling with each other and to join us in working for Scotland's best interests instead of their own."
