Blackbrook Zoological Bird Park, near Leek, Staffordshire, is now known as Peak Wildlife Park.
Dr Jake Veasey, one of the new owners, said it would concentrate on preserving rare species, including the Humboldt penguin.
"I think conservation is the mandate of zoos - it's what we're here for," he said.
The 35-acre site was purchased last year by Dr Veasey and Colin MacDougall, who between them have been involved in zoo management and wildlife conservation for over three decades.
The zoo had a guide price of Â£300,000-Â£350,000, although administrators would not reveal the final sale price.
The wildlife park said it had changed the way animals are kept there, moving away from cages and aviaries in favour of open spaces where the public can walk among the animals.
"The animals benefit because they get much bigger spaces and the public benefit because they can really get in amongst them," Dr Veasey said.
The Humboldt penguins will be housed in three pools, which they will share with the other South American wildlife, the park said.
