Director Quentin Tarantino has revealed he plans to retire after completing his 10th film, saying he likes the idea of leaving audiences "wanting a bit more".

He told an American Film Market (AFM) audience in Santa Monica: "I don't believe you should stay onstage until people are begging you to get off".
The Pulp Fiction director was speaking at an event to promote his current project, western The Hateful Eight.
"I've got two more to go after this," the 51-year-old continued.
"I like that I will leave a 10-film filmography," said the director, whose other titles include Reservoir Dogs and the two-part Kill Bill.
"It's not etched in stone, but that is the plan."
Tarantino said directing was "a young man's game" and that he intended to spend the remainder of his career "writing plays and books".
The director's statements drew light-hearted mockery from his fellow panellists, who included his regular collaborator Samuel L Jackson.
"What's Quentin going to do with himself if he's not doing this?" said the actor, who worked with Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and other titles.
The Oscar-winning writer and director announced in January he was putting The Hateful Eight on hold after its script was leaked online.
He reversed his decision later in the year, saying the film - about a group of outlaws left stranded by a blizzard - would be made after all.
