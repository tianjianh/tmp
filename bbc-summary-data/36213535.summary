But most of the Somerset batsmen failed to exploit good batting conditions, Keith Barker and Chris Woakes both picking up three wickets, backed by two from Jonathan Trott,
After rallying from 117-4 in a stand of 110 with Peter Trego, Abell made 104.
Despite Trego's 94, Somerset missed a third batting point but did take two wickets as the Bears closed on 27-2.
Having proved generally below par with the bat on a lovely early summer's day at Edgbaston, the visitors then came out firing with the ball in a lively seven-over session.
First they had former Bears skipper Ian Westwood lbw to Lewis Gregory before nightwatchman Boyd Rankin was brilliantly caught off Craig Overton at leg gully by James Hildreth, who had earlier been the only other worthwhile Somerset contributor with 38.
After Barker knocked back Marcus Trescothick's off stump and Chris Rogers was caught behind fourth ball inside the first hour, eight batsmen failed to reach 15.
An attack which persevered to keep the pressure on all day, was boosted by Trott taking 2-26 in 10 overs.
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell, who left the field in mid-afternoon with a hamstring twinge, is expected to be fine to bat on day two.
Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott told BBC WM:
"They've not got a huge score but it's a decent score on this wicket. There's a bit in it for the bowlers. We've got to fight to get on top. We're going to have to bat well.
"It's been a while since my last Championship wicket, so I was as surprised as everyone else in the crowd. We just needed someone to do a job from that end - the wind was tricky because we've got a lot of bowlers who like to swing the ball away, so I said I'd bowl gun-barrel straight for a bit. A little bit of seam movement helped too. It's always nice to help.
"Tom Abell looks a very talented young player. He's a good all-round sportsman. I've heard he's a good hockey player as well. You can certainly see that in his game. He looks an organised player. He's certainly one for the future, for Somerset and beyond hopefully.
Somerset batsman Tom Abell:
"I probably haven't been pulling my weight so far this year if I'm brutally honest, so it was really pleasing to score a few runs. I don't want to be relying on the likes of Tres and Hildy and Chris Rogers at the top of the order.
"It was a real challenge against Barker and Woakes with the new ball. I was just looking to stick in and try and weather the storm.
"It was a big relief for me after the start I've had. I can't speak highly enough of the contributions of Hildy and Tregs, just taking the heat off me a little bit, both being natural strokeplayers."
