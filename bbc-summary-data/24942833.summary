A Canadian woman has been convicted of stalking US actor Alec Baldwin and sentenced to six months in jail.

Actress Genevieve Sabourin, 41, was found guilty of stalking, attempted aggravated harassment, harassment and attempted contempt of court.
The judgement in New York came a day after Sabourin was sentenced to 30 days in prison for contempt of court.
Baldwin, 55, testified during the trial that Sabourin had besieged him with unwanted phone calls and emails.
He denied having a relationship with the woman and accused her of subjecting him and his wife Hilaria to "dangerous" harassment.
The actor testified that he had met Sabourin over lunch with a mutual friend in 2000 when he was filming in Montreal.
He said he had met her again in 2010 to offer her career advice - a meeting Sabourin claimed had ended with a sexual tryst.
The actress said she had merely wanted him to explain why he did not want to see her anymore following their alleged brief romance.
Judge Thomas Mandelbaum said on Thursday that she had no right to pursue contact with the star that she knew would be unwelcome.
He said she had waged a "relentless and escalating campaign of threats" against the Baldwins and had shown an "utter lack of respect" for the law.
Sabourin was composed but defiant after the verdict was announced, telling the judge she was "innocent" and had not done anything wrong.
Baldwin, star of Beetlejuice and The Hunt for Red October, has been best known in recent years for his Jack Donaghy role in the sitcom 30 Rock.
He can currently be seen in UK cinemas in Seduced and Abandoned, a satirical documentary about the state of modern movie-making.
