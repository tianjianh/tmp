Alan McManus reckons there is a "good chance" a Scot will triumph on home soil, as the world's top talent descend on Glasgow.

The Scottish Open takes place 12-18 December as part of the Home Nations Series.
McManus told BBC Scotland: "Generally when the guys play at home you do get someone who goes deep in the tournament.
"Hopefully it will be myself, but if it's one or two of us then that'll be good. Certainly (a win) for the punters would be massive."
The tournament is the first World Snooker ranking event held in Scotland since the World Open in 2010, when Ronnie O'Sullivan was soundly beaten in the final by Neil Robertson.
In the opening round at the Emirates Arena 128 players will take to the tables, including ten Scots, and among the draws a clash of the local favourites - McManus and world number six John Higgins from Wishaw.
McManus admits there used to be more all-Scottish battles, particularly in the years following the snooker boom of the 1980s, although believes his countrymen are still holding their own.
"To a man everyone one of us fight hard, we always do," added the 45-year-old.
"You've got John [Higgins] and Stephen [Hendry], although he's now retired now, they're two of the best players in the game but I think collectively we all really work hard and try hard - we're like that as a nation the Scots.
"You look at rugby, the football we've been struggling with that down the years and if a few of the Scots boys can do well in the snooker then that's good for us as a nation."
