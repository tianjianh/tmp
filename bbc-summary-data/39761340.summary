The 14-year-old girl was stuck up to her waist when she was pulled from the sand on Machynys beach, outside Llanelli, at 19:20 BST on Saturday.
Coastguards attended along with the RNLI, police, fire and ambulance crews.
Incident commander Steve Richards, of Llanelli Fire Station, has warned people to be aware of the sinking sand and high tides.
"If you are venturing out to the beach around the Llanelli area, let people know where you're going and make sure you have a mobile phone with you," he said.
"The girl was very lucky to get out of that sand with the speed of the tide yesterday."
