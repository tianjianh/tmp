Two men face trial over shotgun 'murder bid' in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men are to stand trial charged with attempted murder following a shotgun attack in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Carvill, 23, and Marc Hanley, 25, are accused of targeting Liam Bolger and Jay Fraser in the Linthouse area of Glasgow on 11 July.
Both men face a separate allegation of trying to kill Mr Fraser a month earlier in the city's Govan area.
At the High Court in Glasgow, both accused denied the charges and a trial was set for next April.
The attempted murder charge claims Mr Carvill and Mr Hanley discharged a loaded shotgun at Mr Bolger and Mr Fraser to their severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of their lives.
The separate allegation states that they tried to kill Mr Fraser, who was repeatedly struck on the head and body with a knife, the previous month.
Mr Hanley also faces an allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
