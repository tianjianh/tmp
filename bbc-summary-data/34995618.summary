Library acquires Kenneth Williams' diaries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Personal letters and diaries belonging to Carry On star Kenneth Williams have been acquired by the British Library.

The collection includes 43 diaries and approximately 2,000 letters spanning the actor's career, from the age of 18 until his death in 1988.
It was gifted to the library by his friend and neighbour Paul Richardson.
The 1950 edition of the diary, as well as a letter from the archive, will be on display in the Library's permanent exhibition space later this month.
It is believed that roughly 85% of the archive is unpublished material never before seen by researchers, offering unique insights into the life of a gay man before the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1968.
Williams' was an assiduous diary keeper for more than 40 years, and was known to tease his contemporaries with the words: 'You'll be in my diary!', but few have had the opportunity to read them.
"In the pages of the diaries, Williams is instantly recognisable as the acerbic and fastidious character well known to several generations but also, more surprisingly, is shown to be a reflective and poignant observer," said curator Kathryn Johnson.
"The diaries and letters also record the actor's experience of the dying days of the repertory theatre system and the growth of modern celebrity culture, something he seemed both to love and loathe," she continued.
'Perfect place'
Williams, well known for his TV and radio appearances on shows such as Just A Minute and Round the Horne, left his entire estate to Richardson, following his death from an overdose of barbiturates, aged 62.
Richardson, who has bequeathed the collection to the library, said he was "delighted".
"Knowing Kenneth for so many years I know he would have been pleased and honoured. He was a great admirer of the British Library and a regular visitor. I feel this is the perfect place for his diaries and letters to be, preserved for the future and to be appreciated by the public and scholars," he said.
The British Library also announced two major exhibitions for next year, including Shakespeare in Ten Acts.
The exhibition, which opens next April to mark 400 years since the playwright's death, looks at 10 key performances that made Shakespeare the cultural icon he is today.
An exhibition on the history of maps examines some of the rare cartography in the British Library's collection.
It will also uncover the fascinating story of how maps left the hands of the few and became everyday objects for the first time in the 20th Century, from the London A-Z to maps of Hundred Acre Wood in the Winnie the Pooh books, which introduced millions of children to the concept of cartography for the first time.
