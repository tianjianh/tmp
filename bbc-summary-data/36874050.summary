There will be extra police patrols at railway stations across Yorkshire as part of a crackdown on "alcohol-fuelled anti-social behaviour".

British Transport Police (BTP) said additional officers would be at Hull, Leeds and York stations.
The patrols will take place in the evening as people arrive for a night out.
BTP said similar patrols in other areas had resulted in a "significant drop in instances of anti-social behaviour".
The officer in charge of Operation Stronghold, Insp Gary Jones, said it was "about reassuring the public".
"Put simply, Op Stronghold Is about having officers at key locations at key times to reduce crime and keep the travelling public safe," he said.
"We want everyone using the rail network at the weekend to enjoy a safe and secure journey."
The operation will run over the next two weekends.
