The New Saints' Champions League hopes are hanging by a thread after losing the home leg of their first qualifying round against Europa FC.

Alex Quillo gave the Gibraltese side an early lead from Kike Gómez's cross.
Scott Quigley equalised a minute before the break, taking a through ball and turning his defender before lashing a brilliant shot over Javi Munoz.
But Europa snatched a vital lead when Gómez curled home a beauty after Liam Walker broke down the right.
Saints have reached the second qualifying round in each of the last five seasons, but interim manager Scott Ruscoe will need his side to produce a better performance in the second leg.
"I'm disappointed because that's not a true reflection of how TNS play and how we've done in Europe over the last few years," Ruscoe told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've talked about how we've gradually improved over the years and maybe you could say we froze, just didn't play our normal game.
"The Champions League is what we strive to play in year after year, it's what supports the club for the following year in terms of wages and things like that.
"So I've told the lads it hurts me, I hope it hurts them because they've not shown a true reflection."
After the defeat at Park Hall in Oswestry, the Welsh champions travel to Faro, Portugal, on Tuesday, 4 July for the return leg against Europa.
"We'll work on the things that we didn't do well tonight, we'll put them right over the next few days and we'll make sure we give it a good go next Tuesday," Ruscoe added.
"The players have another 20 or 30 per cent there, they've fallen below their peak but they can go and do it next week."
