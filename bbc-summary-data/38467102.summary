The dramatic incident was caught on CCTV near Krizma, in Bradford, in the early hours of Christmas Day.
Officers had been called to a disturbance outside the venue in Sackville Street at 04:20 GMT, and the shots were fired as an officer interviewed a victim in the car.
A 21-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody for questioning.
He was held on Friday morning after armed officers carried out a series of operations in the Bradford area.
West Yorkshire Police said the shots were fired from a car, believed to be a black Seat Leon that was later found burnt out in Low Green Terrace in the Great Horton area of the city. 　
The force wants to trace two more men in connection with the incident.　
A 19-year-old man from Bradford has been charged with assault in relation to the disturbance outside the club.
Det Supt Pat Twiggs said: "This was clearly a targeted, highly dangerous act which could have easily resulted in fatal consequences and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice. 　
"Firearms incidents will not be tolerated and I am appealing to anyone who might have any information."
He said he was especially looking for anyone who had seen the vehicle or the occupants, or anyone who may have seen the disturbance outside the nightclub.
