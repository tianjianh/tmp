[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hospitals treating Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton, Derbyshire, and Chanda Chauhan, 49, from Wednesbury, said they had been sent home.
Mr Thorpe suffered a collapsed lung and a fractured leg, while Ms Chauhan had internal injuries following the crash on the Smiler ride on 2 June.
Three others remain in care at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.
They include Leah Washington, 17, from Barnsley, who had to have her left leg amputated.
Walsall Manor Hospital, which was treating Ms Chauhan, confirmed she had been discharged.
She was sitting in the second row of the Smiler, and had surgery to her stomach, her daughter said.
Mr Thorpe left University Hospital, Coventry, on Friday and is now recovering at home, the hospital said.
Miss Washington's boyfriend Joe Pugh, 18, also from Barnsley, is being treated for two broken knees and "extensive" hand injuries.
Lawyers for Vicky Balch, 20, from Leyland, Lancashire, said on Tuesday she was "battling" to avoid an amputation.
Merlin Entertainment, which owns Alton Towers, has said it has contacted those injured and all 16 on board at the time of the crash will receive compensation.
