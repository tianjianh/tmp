NASUWT: NI's biggest teachers' union rejects pay offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's largest teaching union has said it rejects the latest pay offer for its members.

Teachers have been offered a rise of just over 1%, according to the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT).
It said any increase needs to be above the rate of inflation.
But the Department of Education said talks over pay are continuing and it accused the union of breaching a confidentiality agreement.
The NASUWT has written to Education Minister John O'Dowd to give its reasons for rejecting the offer.
"Since 2010, inflation has risen by 15%, yet teachers' pay has risen by 2%," said the NASUWT's Justin McCamphill.
"An offer of 1.37%, which does have strings attached to it, is nowhere near enough to address the real cuts in teachers' pay.
"The education system is currently undergoing radical change, and teachers are subject to continuing and increasing pressure.
"Year-on-year, teachers continue to deliver high standards of education but their commitment and dedication should not be taken for granted."
The Department of Education said it would be "inappropriate" to comment further as the talks have "have not reached a conclusion".
