[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A children's home in Somerset has been given the lowest possible rating of "inadequate" by Ofsted following a recent inspection.

Inspectors said the local authority-run home was unsafe for the young people living there and cannabis was being used without staff taking action.
Somerset County Council said the report was "disappointing" but action had been taken to address the points raised.
Two other council-run homes in the region were closed in September.
There were concerns about safeguarding and staffing at West End Cottage in Chedzoy and Appledore in West Pennard.
Subsequently, both were shut by Somerset County Council following inadequate Ofsted inspection reports.
Ofsted inspectors visited the third home in November and also criticised the leadership at the site, saying interim arrangements made while it was without a registered manager were "weak".
It also noted that some young people living there were in sexual relationships which had not been discussed with staff to check if they are safe.
A spokesman for Somerset County Council, said: "A permanent manager has been in place since early December and risk assessment processes have been improved along with steps to ensure the consistency of their care.
"We will continue to provide support around drug use, sexual health, self-harm, education and employment opportunities and encourage young people to access them."
