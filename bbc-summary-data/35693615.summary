Doherty headed home Jeremy Helan's free-kick to earn the hosts just a second win in 10 games.
Nathan Byrne had given Kenny Jackett's side the lead after the break when he bundled over the line from close range.
Aden Flint levelled from Joe Bryan's free-kick for the strugglers but Doherty's late goal means the Robins have not won at Wolves since 1931.
City head coach Lee Johnson accused Wolves of "unsporting behaviour" as they put the ball out for a throw-in following an injury to Luke Freeman, from which Wolves earned the free-kick that provided their winning goal.
Johnson's men are now just two points clear of the Championship relegation zone after a third defeat in four games.
They had chances to take the lead themselves but Freeman and top scorer Jonathan Kodjia failed to hit the target and Byrne made them pay for their wastefulness.
Doherty blocked a Kodjia shot on the line before Flint's goal looked to have earned Bristol City a vital point.
Wolves, who have now won their past two home games, host West Midlands rivals Birmingham on Sunday, while City travel to Fulham on Saturday.

Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett: "We had a good start to the second half and Michal Zyro made a difference when he came on at half-time.
"I thought we deserved and should have got a clean sheet out of the game and I was disappointed with their goal. We should have dealt with the cross better.
"But at 1-1 we found the key moment in injury time and it was a good quality ball in and Doherty was in the right place to earn us three points."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "I was disappointed for a couple of incidents in the lead-up to the second goal and devastated to concede a goal in the final minute.
"It is frustrating and I am an angry man for a number of reasons. But I have got to settle and stay calm and controlled.
"I am really frustrated as the fans did not deserve to go home without a point. We were the side that looked like they were going to go on and win it."
