Hugo Palmer: Trainer admits 'kit bag mix-up' behind banned pre-race substances

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trainer Hugo Palmer has admitted "a kit bag mix-up" was to blame for prohibited pre-race substances being taken into stables at Ascot by his staff.

Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day.
"It was an oversight," Palmer told BBC Sport. "The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables."
The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot.
Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race.
Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.
Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down.
"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them."
BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: "Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day."
All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested.
Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training.
"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find," he added. "When you find them, you want to try and keep them."
