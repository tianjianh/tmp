In a statement, Dexter's family said: "When Dexter was born our family became complete and we were happier than we could ever have imagined.
"Watching him grow into such a happy joyful child made every day a pleasure and we felt honoured to have him in our lives.
"Dexter made everyone smile with his beautiful face and cheeky grin. He was always polite and kind to everybody and all who met him fell in love with him."
The family also said he loved music, adored his older sister, was a skilful footballer and had just learned to ride his bike without stabilisers.
"Our lives will never be the same without Dexter, he was the life and soul of our family. Our hearts have been broken and can never be fixed," the family said.
"We now have to learn to continue our lives without our cheeky little boy and remember the joy and happiness he brought us in the short time he was allowed to be with us."
A 29-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control, is due to answer bail on 19 October. The dog was seized by police and placed in kennels.
