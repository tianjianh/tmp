Josh Dawkin: Crowd-funding page to help St Ives Town striker 'pay bills'

A crowd-funding page has been set up to help "pay the bills" of a non-league footballer who suffered a horrific leg break during a match.

St Ives striker Josh Dawkin spent seven hours in surgery after breaking his tibia and fibula in a tackle against Chippenham on Saturday.
The ex-Norwich player is self-employed and unable to work while injured.
"At times like this football is irrelevant," boss Ricky Marheineke told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"It's just making sure his well-being is OK, he's looked after and got everything he needs during this difficult time and us at the club and me as the manager to make sure he gets that support.
"He's in good spirits. He's obviously still in some considerable pain, but he's on the crutches and now on the road to recovery."
Players of the Southern League Premier Division side are not on contracts, and are therefore not paid when they are injured.
However, the crowd-funding page has been set up by the chairman's wife, Maureen Clarke, after a similar initiative for a Slough goalkeeper that broke his neck in a match earlier this season.
As of Friday, the total donated stood at £1,525 of their £2,000 target.
Marheineke added: "It's about the football community pulling together in times like this and making sure that these players that provide us with so much entertainment and the reason we watch football, when they do pick up injuries they don't suffer.
"It's a real show of strength from everybody to go out and support Josh. I hope that continues and we raise enough money so that he doesn't have to pay the price for playing football."
