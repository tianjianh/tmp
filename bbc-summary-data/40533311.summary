[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men have been jailed for assisting a murderer who stabbed a man to death in Conwy county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Kingsbury, 35, died after the attack in Old Colwyn on 5 January.
Dean Cody, 31, of no fixed address, was jailed for life and must serve at least 21 years in prison after being found guilty of murder at Caernarfon Crown Court.
Thomas Revatto, 50, Colin Lyness, 31, and Stephen Cody, 53, all of Colwyn Bay, were convicted of helping him.
The court heard Lyness drove Dean Cody to a house after the murder, while Revatto was a passenger in the car.
Stephen Cody later moved the car.
He was jailed for 27 months, Lyness was jailed for 22 months and Levatto was given an 18-month sentence.
Speaking after they were jailed, Det Ch Insp Arwyn Jones said the force was pleased the men had been brought to justice.
He said: "David Kingsbury was a young man, whose life was cut short by the actions of Dean Cody.
"Despite a claim of self-defence by Cody, I believe David Kingsbury bared no threat to him whatsoever, a view now evidently shared by the jury having found him guilty of murder."
"In addition to his guilty verdict, I am also extremely pleased his associate Thomas Revatto has been found guilty of assisting him.
"Despite his claims, it was clearly evident that he, along with Stephen Cody and Colin Lyness, who'd earlier pleaded guilty to assisting an offender, were determined to assist Cody in evading the police and being brought to justice as he, and they have today."
In a statement, Mr Kinsbury's family described him as a "happy go lucky, caring person" who would "always be in our hearts".
