Burnley boss Sean Dyche says his team can return to the Premier League following their relegation from the top flight after just one season.

The Clarets beat Hull 1-0 after Danny Ings' first goal in 11 games but results elsewhere meant they dropped into the Championship.
"I certainly believe [we can bounce back]," Dyche told BBC Sport.
"When I see how the players have performed there is growth. I can only imagine that we will be competitive."
Burnley's first win in seven league games proved futile after relegation rivals Sunderland, Aston Villa and Leicester all won and Newcastle picked up a point.
Despite moving off the bottom of the table above QPR, it was only a sixth win of the season for the Clarets.
Burnley are the division's lowest scorers and Ings' 10th strike of the season ended a team goal drought of more than 10 hours.
Dyche praised his players' "terrific" spirit this season, with his squad having one of the lowest wage bills in the top flight. But he was clear about the reason for his side's relegation.
"Scoring goals, simple as that," the manager said. "The shape has been good, if you look at the scorelines we have been in every game. The energy, the will and belief has been terrific. We have the quality but it's about finding it at the right times.
"The players will grow from this experience, so will I, so will the staff and so will the club."
Asked what he would say to people who suggested Burnley should have spent more money, Dyche replied: "They don't know the insides of the club.
"Two-ish years ago we sold Charlie Austin [for a reported £4m to QPR] because we had to, it was a necessity. The club was really going into financial trouble. There has to be a reality to every situation and I've stood strong with that message, with the board, the players and the fans. We are always very honest in how it has to work.
"A lot of things need changing at the club; new training ground, new facilities, the club is a whole lot stronger than it was. Of course, the money you need now with Premier League we are not talking one or two million, we are talking tens of millions to be really competitive."
Dyche joined the club in October 2012, replacing now Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, and his biggest signing has been the £3m spent on midfielder George Boyd last September.
In comparison, Leicester have twice broken their club record fees this season, spending £8m on Argentine striker Leonardo Ulloa before purchasing Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric for £9m.
Hull have brought in striker Abel Hernandez for £10m and paid £8m for midfielder Jake Livermore.
Dyche added: "We are a change from the norm. People try to throw money at the problem but we haven't done that and there are great signs that we can move this club forward."
Dyche signed a rolling contract at Turf Moor last summer and was not in the mood to discuss his future so soon after Burnley's demotion.
The former Watford boss said: "Make no mistake - I want to be in the Premier League so there is disappointment and frustration but next season is for other thoughts after the next few games.
"There is a desire for me to get through today and see my family and make sense of everything. For the moment my thoughts are for my players.
"There will be a time to think about the bigger picture, but my immediate gut feeling is that you want to work and progress and learn.
"Wherever it takes you, who knows? But for the moment I am Burnley manager and that's all I'm thinking about."
