[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gunman caught with five rounds of ammunition jailed for five years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 59-year-old man who was caught with a gun and ammunition in central Glasgow has been jailed for five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orlando Gray had a self-loading pistol and five rounds of ammunition when he was arrested by armed police in Renfield Street on 20 January 2009.
Police were led to Gray while watching another man, Steven Scott, whom they had been told was trying to buy a gun.
Gray admitted having the gun and ammunition and failing to appear at a trial on 8 March 2010.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that he fled to Jamaica but was detained there on 10 May last year and later returned to the UK.
Scott went to trial in 2010 and was convicted of possessing a firearm without lawful authority and possessing a knife. He was jailed for one year.
Police had been monitoring Scott's movements after being tipped off that he was attempting to obtain a firearm and ammunition.
An associate of Scott paid Â£2,000 into his account and the money was transferred to Gray's account.
Solicitor advocate Liam O'Donnell, defending, told the court that Gray had committed the offence because of financial difficulties.
Mr O'Donnell said: "He [Gray] denies being involved with organised crime. He was the man who delivered the gun."
Sentencing, Judge Lord Kinclaven told Gray: "You were the deliverer of the weapon. You present a medium risk of re-offending and have a minor record for drug offences.
But said: "The most you have ever received is 14 days imprisonment prior to this."
