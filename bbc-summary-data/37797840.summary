The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed talks about a 10-episode revival are under way.
There are said to be no deals in place with the show's stars or creators yet.
Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes were together again in Los Angeles on Thursday night for a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.
The cast were brought together for the first time in a decade in September by one of the show's creators, Max Mutchnick, for a short film based around the US election.
The 10-minute clip has had more than six million views on Youtube.
Speaking at the time, Messing - who plays Grace - told the Hollywood Reporter she would "never say never" about a revival.
She hinted that a streaming channel could be a natural fit because a return to network TV could be a problem, due to the cast members' busy schedules.
"I think that the logistics of all of our lives - there would just be way too many things to hammer out. But for something shorter-lived and maybe having the limitations of being on network TV lifted may give us a fun, fresh opportunity because we could be really, really naughty!"
Will & Grace ran for eight seasons between 1998 and 2006 and won 16 Emmy awards.
The show, about interior designer Grace and her gay flatmate Will, earned praise for bringing gay television characters into the mainstream.
The cast was rounded off by Will's best friend Jack and their socialite friend Karen.
It is still a hit on syndicated TV.
