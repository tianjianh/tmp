The woman, now in her 50s, said she was aged four or five at the time and lived in Nazareth House, Londonderry.
The inquiry is investigating abuse claims against children's residential institutions in NI from 1922 to 1995.
The woman claimed she had been sexually and physically abused by nuns and older girls, and said she had prayed she would never have children herself.
"I couldn't bear to see them going through the pain and hurt I suffered," she said.
The inquiry, being held in Banbridge, County Down, is chaired by retired judge Sir Anthony Hart and is considering cases in 13 residential institutions.
Public hearings are due to finish in June 2015, with the inquiry team to report to the Northern Ireland Executive by the start of 2016.
