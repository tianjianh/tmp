Stephanie Hirst, formerly known as Simon, hosted the commercial Top 40 show nationally between 2003 and 2006.
The Barnsley-based DJ left radio stations Capital FM Yorkshire and Gold last June after confirming her gender change.
She will join BBC Radio Manchester for a weekly show, saying she "wanted to ensure that my return is gentle".
Numerous sources told BBC News last year that Ms Hirst was suspended by bosses at Global Radio when she disclosed that she wanted to be a woman.
The company said at the time: "Hirsty made the decision to take time out to focus on the process he was going through. We were sad to see Hirsty leave but we were happy to offer him our full support."
When asked about claims that she was treated wrongly by her former employer, Ms Hirst said last October: "Everyone was supportive. There is nothing more I can add that can be of use to you."
Ms Hirst, who has won three Sony Radio Awards, said her new role "allows me time to grow into a broadcaster as Stephanie".
Kate Squire, managing editor of BBC Radio Manchester, added: "It's fantastic that Stephanie is returning to the airwaves - she's a brilliant broadcaster, and should be on air."
Ms Hirst first presented a radio show at the age of 16 on Radio Aire in Leeds. Since January, she has been a regular contributor on the ITV programme Lorraine.
Her new show, which will focus on 1990s music, will start on 4 July at 22:00 BST.
BBC Radio Manchester reaches a weekly audience of 229,000 listeners, according to figures from radio body Rajar.
