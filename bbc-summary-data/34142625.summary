Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield will host the arch segment, also known as "Wave", until January.
The installation in London last year marked 100 years since the start of World War One and drew more than five million visitors.
Each poppy represents a British and Commonwealth death during the war.
The Yorkshire Regiment raised 24 Battalions served by 65,000 men, of whom 9,000 died.
