Super League: Leeds Rhinos 20-18 Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos clung on to record only their third Super League win of the season against a gritty Hull FC.

The hosts led at the break when Jordan Lilley converted a penalty goal after Jimmy Keinhorst and Chris Green exchanged first-half scores.
Kirk Yeaman looked to have extended Hull's winning run with his try, but Lilley crossed to overhaul the deficit.
Jamie Jones-Buchanan battered his way over late on to put Leeds 20-12 up and Danny Houghton's try came too late.
It was Leeds's first win in five and ended Hull's run of five straight wins.
The game was played in near-constant rain and the subsequent conditions certainly affected the standard.

Keinhorst's try, as much as Leeds looked more like their 2015 vintage in scoring it, came on the back of Hull errors.
Big forwards and short balls were the key to Green's crash over, as the vaunted expansive game of Hull's recent wins was sacrificed for direct running.
Lilley's penalty goal option emphasised the need to take points opportunities before the break.
Yeaman's score was tinged with controversy as it looked like he might have been ahead of play from the kick.
However, Lilley's smart finish gave Leeds hope and Jones-Buchanan had Headingley rocking with his drive over.
Houghton added anxiety to the mix with a late score but the hooter came to lift Leeds spirits.
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott:
"I'm pleased for the players and the fans have been great throughout this tough period.
"You don't realise how good a club you've got until you go through some tough periods. The club has been really supportive.
"There's some benefits in winning that one and I'm pleased, but at the same time it wasn't great and we've got some work to do.
"All the way through that second half, we certainly defended anxiously and looked tired. We're not that tired, but they're walking around like they're mega tired at the moment. That's the situation we're in.
"The thought of losing again would have probably got to them."
Hull FC coach Lee Radford told BBC Radio Humberside:
"We could've won it, but we could've lost it. I think Leeds deserved it, but there was nothing in it.
"They're a phenomenal side. They've got players missing, but if you look at that team out there it's the team that did the treble last year.
"We knew it was going to be really tough, but we gave it a real go and it was a real ding-dong.
"Conditions played a massive part in being able to play much rugby, it was horrible to watch from both teams."
