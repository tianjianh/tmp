A campaign has been launched by Police Scotland to give students advice on how to keep safe.

The drive is aimed at almost 500,000 students starting at or returning to colleges and universities this month.
Officers are working with student associations to promote safety messages and ensure students start their university careers in the right way.
Safety tips include using privacy settings on social media and not leaving parties with strangers.
Ch Insp Scott Tees said becoming a student can be a "life-changing and life-enhancing" experience.
But he told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he wanted to ensure students' safety.
He highlighted online, property and personal safety.
"We understand that part of student life is to go out and socialise but what we do say to students is to plan their night out," he said.
Students should consider how they are getting home, make sure they do not leave alone and to look out for their friends, the police officer added.
"We would hope that students will take a few minutes to download our Police Scotland student safety guide, which contains useful tips on how to stay safe, be that on campus, at home or socialising both online and in person."
Alastair Sim, director at Universities Scotland, said: "We want all of our students, from home and overseas, to enjoy their higher education experience to the full.
"Universities take their responsibilities for the safety of all students incredibly seriously and we encourage all students to note Police Scotland's helpful safety advice as the new academic year gets under way.
"We hope all students and staff in our university communities will continue to look out for one another on campus, at home and online."
