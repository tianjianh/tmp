[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Wolves went top of Super League with a 52-18 thrashing of bottom side Leeds Rhinos.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts, 18-12 up at half-time, ran in six tries after the break, including a second for Gene Ormsby, two from Daryl Clark and Kurt Gidley's score.
Warrington knocked Hull FC off top spot thanks to a better points difference.
The loss of Zak Hardaker with a shoulder problem was another blow for defending champions Leeds, who have now gone six matches without a win.
Brian McDermott's side have not won at the Halliwell Jones Stadium since their historic play-off semi final victory in 2011 and, despite a promising opening quarter, were never in the game.
They made a flying start through Jimmy Keinhorst's score but were put under immense pressure by the home team, who scored three tries of their own.
Returning playmaker Chris Sandow was at the heart of their efforts, notably supplying Tom Lineham with a beautifully weighted kick for his try.
The visitors showed character to drag the game back to six points at the break but the loss of Hardaker shortly before half-time compounded their considerable injury problems in 2016.
After the break Warrington flexed their muscles with 34 points, but there was also an ugly punch-up between Ashton Sims and Brad Singleton that will likely see both facing a suspension.
