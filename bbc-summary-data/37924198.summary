Christopher Davies said he went "off his head" after his colleague Barry O'Reilly, a day short of his 38th birthday, gave him cannabis mixed with Spice during a fishing trip on 15 May.
A witness said the 28-year-old, of Town Lane, Higher Bebington, put Mr O'Reilly underwater and "battered him".
Davies was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court after admitting manslaughter.
Det Ch Insp Paul Denn, from Merseyside Police, said the friends, had been "getting on well" before their first joint fishing trip at Claremont Farm in Wirral.
Davies said he and Mr O'Reilly had been smoking cannabis during the day, and that the victim told him he had put the synthetic drug Spice into the substance.
Mr O'Reilly was attacked after he "made light" of Spice's impact on his friend, the court heard.
Davies brought Mr O'Reilly to his knees in the pond with a heavy punch before holding him under the water and ignoring his pleas to let him go.
Shortly afterwards, a witness dragged Mr O'Reilly out of the water with the help of Davies but failed to revive him.
Davies later said his reaction was due to the drug.
Judge Clement Goldstone QC said he did not believe the crime would have been committed had the pair not been taking Spice.
Then known as a "legal high", Spice - a synthetic cannabinoid that acts like cannabis - has been banned after a law came into force on 26 May.
However taking the drug is not illegal.
In a statement, Mr O'Reilly's family said: "We can hope in the very least that Barry's death is a cautionary tale for anyone using these types of drugs."
Det Ch Insp Denn said: "Our advice to people has always been not to take any substances if they don't know exactly what's in it or where it came from."
Judge Goldstone called for the government to "reconsider its attitude towards the possession of such compounds... which are widely acknowledged as being significantly more dangerous than cannabis itself".
Davies' defence team said he deeply regretted what happened.
