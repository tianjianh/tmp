New firm for Cardiff-Anglesey air link after liquidation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new operator has been appointed to take over the Cardiff to Anglesey air service after the previous one went into liquidation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Citywing was liquidated after Van Air's permission to fly was suspended.
But Economy Secretary Ken Skates said on Saturday evening that Eastern Airways would take over the route and there would be no disruption.
All tickets for the Cardiff-Anglesey Citywing service for travel next week will be honoured.
Citywing also ran services from Gloucestershire Airport and between Blackpool and the Isle of Man.
Before Mr Skates' announcement, all flights had been cancelled and passengers were told their Citywing tickets could instead be used on train services out of Cardiff and from stations between Bangor and Holyhead.
The north to south Wales service, which has been running since 2007, receives a Â£1.2m annual subsidy from the Welsh Government.
Citywing ran flights between Cardiff and Anglesey Airport at Valley near Holyhead during the week.
Eastern Airways, formed 20 years ago and based at Humberside Airport, already has domestic services to Aberdeen, Newcastle, Stornoway and Wick John O'Groats from Cardiff.
It also flies to the Norwegian cities of Bergen and Stavanger from south Wales.
Some 8,937 passengers used the service between Valley and Cardiff Airport between September 2015 and August 2016.
Mr Skates said: "I am grateful to Eastern Airways, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Cardiff and Anglesey airports and the RAF at Valley for their support and help in making sure this necessary transition between providers has happened so quickly."
Passengers travelling next week have been asked to bring proof of their Citywing booking with them to the airport.
The CAA suspended Czech-registered Van Air's licence to fly in the UK following an incident in the Isle of Man.
Van Air had sub-contracted Danish operator North Flying for the short-term operation of the route.
Citywing said: "The company has tried to offer a service whilst suffering considerable losses but these have proved unfortunately to be commercially unsustainable.
"This decision has not been taken lightly and has been made to protect creditors.
"On behalf of all at Citywing, we all apologise for the inconvenience caused and thank you all for your support over the last four years."
