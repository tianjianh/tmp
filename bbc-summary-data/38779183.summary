[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2-2 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greg Tansey's late strike rescued a 2-2 draw for the Scottish Premiership's bottom club Inverness, who fought back from two goals down against Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Set-piece headers from Marcus Haber and Darren O'Dea gave the visitors a half-time lead.
Billy McKay pulled one back from the penalty spot after the break, and had a second spot-kick saved by Scott Bain.
His blushes were spared by Tansey, who rifled home from the edge of the box after Bain again denied McKay.
For the opening half hour, Inverness looked to have reacted to stinging criticism from boss Richie Foran and adapted well to a new formation with two up front.
They were hungry and creative and came close when Carl Tremarco struck the post from close range.
A quick-thinking Iain Vigurs free-kick released McKay, his cut-back was put home by a Dundee defender but McKay was ruled offside just when home supporters sensed a positive afternoon ahead.
Henri Anier was also denied by the excellent Bain as Inverness ploughed forward.
It went badly wrong with well executed goals and superb goalkeeping extending Inverness' winless run, despite fighting back from two goals down.
Dundee rode their luck a little early on but went ahead thanks to a superb delivery from Cammy Kerr straight into the path of Haber who powered his header home.
Their second was simple. Tom Hateley's corner was headed in by an unruffled O'Dea.
They got to half-time then handed Inverness a lifeline when Julien Extabeguren was unnecessarily penalised for holding.
McKay scored the penalty and was offered another chance when Anier went to ground. This time the superb Bain smothered it and Dundee looked good for the win.
They had a number of fabulous chances to extend their lead. Paul McGowan hit a post, then blazed over when clean through on goal before Henrik Ojamaa saw his close-range effort kicked clear.
Bain did well to save again from McKay but the rebound fell for Tansey and he coolly found the corner.
Inverness' winless run has now reached 13 and they face a very tough run of fixtures following their Scottish Cup fifth-round tie at Celtic next weekend.
Foran will be pleased with many elements of this display. It's results they need, though, and they're looking ever more fragile.
Inverness assistant manager Scott Kellacher: "We asked the boys to be brave, get on the ball, pass it and that's exactly what they did. We need to defend balls into the box better but apart from that the heads never went down.
"The boys did great, terrific. They just keep going. The amount of chances we've created today, we need to start taking them if we're going to win games.
"We'll keep going. It's a special group. they've been through good times, they've been through bad.  We need to keep believing in ourselves and hopefully we can turn it around."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "There were chances at both end. At 2-0 we looked comfortable. We give a needless penalty away to give them a lifeline but after that we still had great opportunities. We should have killed the game off.
"Scott (Bain) is a real class act. His form has been excellent of late. I was pleased with how we performed in the final third today.
"We create chances. I think Ojamaa and Haber had a good understanding. The pleasing aspect is we created. The disappointing thing was we should have seen the game out. That's something we've got to look at."
