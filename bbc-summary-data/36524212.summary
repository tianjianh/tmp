Jakub Blaszczykowski curled in a left-foot shot for the winner after 54 minutes and Poland will now play Switzerland in the last 16 on Saturday.

A win by a bigger margin could have seen Poland leapfrog Germany, who beat Northern Ireland, to top the group but they rarely looked like adding to their lead.
And while they will celebrate their progress, they will also have concerns over the form of striker Lewandowski.
He scored 42 goals for Bayern Munich in 2015-16 and was the top scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with 13 goals.
The 27-year-old was rightly regarded as Poland's key man for the tournament, but has not had a shot on target in his three games so far - and is without a goal or assist in 523 minutes of European Championship finals action since a scoring against Greece at Euro 2012.
Lewandowski should have ended that run early on when he was found by a right-wing cross only to sidefoot wide from eight yards, while he also produced some clever footwork before scuffing a shot wide.
His strike partner Milik did not fare much better, having an early shot saved when through on goal, and he also headed wide later on when he stole in at the near post.
"It will only be a matter of time before Lewandowski and Milik start to score," said Match of the Day pundit Mark Lawrenson. "I don't think you would want to play against them."
Ukraine were the first side to be eliminated from Euro 2016 and, with the pressure off as they played for pride, they performed with a bit more freedom, enjoying 66.5% of possession.
Olexandr Zinchenko, 19, is Ukraine's youngest goalscorer and the midfielder showed glimpses of why he is regarded as one of his country's stars of the future.
He produced a delightful ball to release Roman Zozulya, whose shot was blocked by Michal Pazdan, and came close to scoring when he headed over from close range.
However, by failing to score his team depart as the first team to go five matches without a goal at European Championship finals.
Ukraine captain Ruslan Rotan: "The result was negative. There are a bunch of reasons for this. We could talk about the atmosphere in the team, but I can only say that it was positive - the players found common ground and had a good time together.
"The biggest thing, that we need to work on is our psychological level. Maybe we don't have the right mentality."
Poland coach Adam Nawalka: "That Lewandowski hasn't scored yet is not a problem whatsoever. He is doing a lot of hard work and has had a big influence on our wins and how we have played.
"He's incredibly important for us. He's a player who can help us. He plays in a supportive way throughout. It's just a matter of time for him, he's creating a lot of chances, and I think he'll score in the next match."
