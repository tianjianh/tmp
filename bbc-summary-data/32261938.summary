Dean Bowditch tapped in for the Dons before Rob Hall doubled the lead with a cross that evaded everyone.
Will Grigg added a quick-fire third from the penalty spot before Hall scored a fourth with a deflected effort in a spectacular first half.
Hall completed his hat-trick before Jay Simpson grabbed a consolation goal and Dele Alli struck the Dons' sixth.
MK Dons remain in third in League One, and are eight games unbeaten, while Orient slip into the relegation zone with three games left to play.

MK Dons manager Karl Robinson told BBC Three Counties Radio:
"We knew the enormity of the challenge, we knew we had to win here today.
"I think all of the players deserve a special mention, because I thought they were outstanding. It was a really good afternoon.
"We have to be in that winning mentality, where we want to win in everything that we do. It's a phenomenal run we're on, we're seven or eight now unbeaten.
"If we end up on 91 points and don't go up I think it would be quite remarkable, it's important now that we refocus our minds totally on Doncaster."

Leyton Orient captain Nathan Clarke speaks to BBC London 94.9:
"I'm lost for words unfortunately, we came here off the back of some good results and good team performances but we did so many things wrong.
"As players we haven't just let ourselves down, we have let a good number of our travelling fans down - we need everyone to stick together.
"As professionals that shouldn't happen and we need to put this to one side. With only three games left we can't dwell on this."
