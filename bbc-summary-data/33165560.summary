[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An off-duty police officer who tried to save the life of a teenager caught in the Hillsborough disaster has told her parents he did his "very best" for her.

Russell Greaves gave first aid to 19-year-old Sarah Hicks on the pitch after her father left with her younger sister in an ambulance.
After giving evidence at the new inquests, he addressed her mother and father, Jenni and Trevor, in court.
He said Sarah was "with someone who cared and was not alone".
The detective constable, who was at the match as a spectator, said his words "could not remove their sense of loss, pain or utter devastation" but he wanted "to take this opportunity to say to them that I did my very best for Sarah in the circumstances - I could not have done more".
On Tuesday, Trevor Hicks described to the inquests in Warrington how he gave his daughter Sarah and her 15-year-old sister Vicki mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they lay unconscious.
He told the court he moved from one daughter to the other, shouting their names and asking for help before taking the "very difficult decision" to travel to hospital with Vicki, leaving Sarah behind.
The sisters were among 96 fans who were fatally injured in a crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
