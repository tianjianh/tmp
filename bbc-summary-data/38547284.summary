The new Metrolink 5.5km (3.4 mile) line, which will go from Pomona to Trafford Park via the Imperial War Museum, was approved in October.
Initial "enabling and utility works" are due to start from Monday, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said.
TfGM warned of lane closures along the route and said it was holding public information sessions from Tuesday.
The line is expected to open in 2020, increasing the size of the Metrolink network to more than 106.5km (66 miles).
The Trafford Park line will call at six new tram stops - Wharfside, Imperial War Museum, Village, Parkway, EventCity and the Trafford Centre.
TfGM said 89% of people were in favour of the extension plans in a 12-week public consultation in summer 2014.
Funding has been secured by Greater Manchester Combined Authority through the "earn back" funding arrangement as part of the Greater Manchester devolution deal, said TfGM.
