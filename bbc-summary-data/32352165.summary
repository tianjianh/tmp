[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coffee, a campervan and some election manifestos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I've spent a lot of time in Cardiff's cafes during the last few days - purely in the line of duty, you understand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I've been chairing a panel of three looking at the political party's election manifestos.
Here are a few things we learned:
1. Everyone is in favour of "fair funding" but no-one agrees on what it means. In one manifesto, the Conservatives say it depends on there being a referendum on Wales gaining income tax powers; in another manifesto, they say it doesn't.
2. Parties that say they will balance the books are still reluctant to set out where they would cut spending or increase taxes.
3. Labour say they would "seek" to give the Welsh government control of tolls on the Severn Bridges. The bridges may mostly be in England although the toll booths are in Wales.
3. UKIP are in favour of a Welsh bank holiday on St David's Day. The Lib Dems say they'd let the National Assembly for Wales decide.
4. If you're going to use stock photos for your manifesto, it's probably best not to use ones that have already been used to advertise sexually transmitted diseases in New Zealand and a detox clinic for substance abusers in Utah.
Next week I'll be on the BBC Wales Election 2015 tour, calling at Barry, Carmarthen, Tregaron, Connah's Quay, Llandudno and Cardiff. Do come and say hello - you'll find me inside a large inflatable tent or "the politics pavilion" as a colleague refers to it.
