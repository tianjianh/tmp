[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Kent go top after draw with Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent moved to the top of Division Two despite skipper Sam Northeast being denied the chance of a century in each innings against Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northeast, who made 191 in the first innings, was 70 not out with Kent 238-3 when rain ended the game as a draw.
Having resumed 163 behind on 32-0, Kent never looked in danger of collapse despite the early loss of Sean Dickson.
Tom Latham (74) and Joe Denly (64) added 103 and Denly then put on 93 with Northeast, who hit nine fours.
Kent took 10 points from the game to go four points clear of Essex at the top, but having played a game more.
Derbyshire, for whom Ben Cotton, Wayne Madsen and Neil Broom each took a wicket, have still to win a match this summer and are seventh in the table.
