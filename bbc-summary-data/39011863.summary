[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham goalkeeper Connor Ripley saved penalties at the death and five minutes into stoppage-time as his side held FA Cup quarter-finalists Millwall to a goalless draw at Boundary Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The play-off chasing Lions earned their eighth consecutive clean sheet but they were denied at the death as Ripley twice kept out striker Lee Gregory.
Ripley made the first save diving away to his right after Gregory had been tripped by Chris Taylor.
Deep into injury time Millwall were awarded their second spot-kick for a handball by Michael Ngoo, but Ripley produced more heroics going to his left.
Earlier, Millwall had gone close through Harry Smith before Paul Green headed over for Oldham.
The hosts threatened again when Tope Obadeyi fired wide at the end of a mazy run, while Millwall saw a chance blazed off target by Aiden O'Brien.
Millwall thought they were in front on 64 minutes, only for Oldham skipper Peter Clarke to make a goal-line clearance from Fred Onyedinma.
At the other end visiting keeper Tom King denied Ollie Banks, but it was to be Ripley who stole the show as Oldham secured a point.
