'Indie' music shop Ripping records to close in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Independent music shop Ripping Records in Edinburgh is to close its doors after 41 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The shop on the city's South Bridge will close on Saturday 26 November when 61-year-old John Richardson retires.
Mr Richardson said he became interested in music when he was run over by a car, which damaged his leg so he was unable to play most sports.
He said he now plans to do voluntary work for animals and to take a big holiday.
He says he will visit all the places he has not seen while working six days a week in his shop.
Over recent years big chains such as Virgin and HMV have closed down as music sales moved to the internet.
Ripping Records managed to survive changes in music-buying habits by carving out a niche as the "go-to-place" for gig tickets.
Over the years huge queues have formed at the doors of Ripping Records with crowds wanting tickets for T in the Park causing the road to be closed in 2009.
Mr Richardson told BBC Scotland it was as though he'd never had a proper job.
He said: "You get up, you come in and you play records all day and talk to really nice people who are interested in what you're doing.
"I had a couple of health scares earlier this year, which came to nothing, but they got me thinking I should maybe retire when I'm still really enjoying it.
"I'm a bit sad because customers have been saying it is the end of an era when I've told them of my plans to retire.
"I've been speaking to some of my customers for 40 years and I have made a lot of friends."
