Emin, probably best known for her unmade bed installation, follows in the footsteps of Sir Peter Blake, Damien Hirst and Vivienne Westwood in designing the award.
Last year, hat designer Philip Treacy put his own stamp on the statuette.
Emin said: "I was thrilled to be asked to rework the Brits trophy."
She added: "It's so nice as a visual artist to have an involvement with the creative side of the music industry and it's such a sweet celebration of the amazing talent we have in Britain today."
My Bed, which Emin created in 1998, was recently sold at auction for Â£2.2m. The new owner, Count Christian Duerckheim, has agreed to loan the work to the Tate for at least 10 years.
Next year's Brit Awards will be held on 25 February at London's 02 arena, with a set created by Es Devlin, who has also worked for the likes of Take That and Kanye West.
Actor James Corden has stepped down from hosting the event after five years, and a new presenter has yet to be named.
