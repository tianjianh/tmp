[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 2-4 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mitch Hancox scored a first-half hat-trick as he inspired Macclesfield to National League victory at Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hancox's cross gave Anthony Dudley a simple finish to put the visitors in front, and by the end of the first period the defender had ended the match as a contest.
David Stephens smashed home to put the hosts back on level terms, but Hancox made it 2-1 when he knocked in a rebound.
Hancox netted his second from Rhys Browne's cut-back in stoppage time, and there was still time for him to complete his hat-trick before the half-time whistle with a low shot in off a post.
Bruno Andrade pulled one back for Boreham Wood, but it was no more than a consolation.
