[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion scored their first away goal in five matches as they held Preston to a draw at Deepdale.

Jackson Irvine put the Brewers ahead, when he pounced on a loose ball from Matt Palmer's corner to fire under keeper Chris Maxwell.
But Callum Robinson poked home Greg Cunningham's cross to dash Burton's hopes of a first away win this season.
The hosts pushed hard for a winner as they dominated the second half, but Albion held on.
Burton had not scored an away goal for almost seven hours, but went close twice early on when Ben Turner headed Palmer's corner against the bar and Irvine's deflected shot was pushed over by Maxwell.
Irvine's goal finally broke the deadlock, but the home side came close several times before Robinson's equaliser and it was one-way traffic after the break as Tom Clarke headed onto the roof of the net and Ben Pearson sent a drive just wide
Simon Grayson's side have lost just one of their past 10 Championship outings, but results elsewhere meant they fell a place to 12th in the table.
Burton, who have yet to win away from home this season, moved up to 19th, but remain just a point above the relegation spots.
Preston boss Simon Grayson said: "We started sloppily, they had early opportunities and got the goal. We were a long way short of our best.
"Everything we didn't do in the first half we did in the second half. We passed it quicker and stopped them from playing.
"If we'd started the first half as we started the second I think we'd have knocked the stuffing out of them and won the game. But we haven't and you have to earn every point in this division."
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "This result will do us good in terms of our spirit, but it also shows that we have what it takes to survive in this league.
"After we had dominated that match so much in the first half and had so many chances, we could have felt sorry for ourselves after half-time, but we didn't.
"Our reaction to conceding that goal was terrific. We came out and showed real spirit.
"Apart from one game against Reading last week we've shown that we can compete with everyone in this division."
