The incident happened at about 02:45 on Monday at the Co-operative on Lauder Road in Kirkcaldy.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said that investigations into the incident were ongoing. There are no reports of any injuries.
The truck, a six-tonne Benford Swivel Dumper, smashed down a wall of the building.
It was later reported stolen from a business in Hayfield Industrial Estate.
Det Insp Graeme Dursley of Police Scotland said: "The premises will remain closed while we conduct our investigations at the scene and a full assessment of the damage to the building will need to be carried out.
"I'd urge anyone who may have been in the area of Hayfield Industrial Estate or Lauder Road in the early hours of the morning to get in touch.
"If you saw any suspicious behaviour or may have witnessed the truck travelling between these two locations, then please come forward."
