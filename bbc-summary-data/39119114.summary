Raith boss Hughes says SPFL should be embarrassed after Stevenson plays in goal

The SPFL should be "embarrassed" by the decision that forced Raith Rovrs to select midfielder Ryan Stevenson in goal, says manager John Hughes.

Rovers had no fit keepers for Tuesday's Championship trip to Ayr United, but their request for a postponement was rejected by the SPFL board.
After Ayr won the match 1-0, Hughes told BBC Scotland: "It's just making a mockery of it, isn't it?
"They need to have a right good look at themselves."
The Kirkcaldy club had gone without a goalkeeper on the bench for their previous three matches.
Conor Brennan injured a foot in Saturday's loss to Queen of the South, while Kevin Cuthbert and Aaron Lennox are recovering from injuries sustained earlier this year.
"I hope they're embarrassed," said Hughes of the decision to play Tuesday's fixture.
"The guys that sit and vote and put their hand up for it to go ahead, half of them couldn't kick the blankets off the bed, never played football. That's the problem - they don't know what it's all about.
"Maybe for the best of Scottish football, we'll take the hit, but this can't happen again in Scottish football.
"We've got four loans in, so we'd have to try to get someone to go back to their club before we could [sign a goalkeeper on loan].
"We'd be looking at someone who is under 21 for the loan and, if we'd brought in a young keeper, I don't think he'd have done any better than Ryan Stevenson.
"He had a great save in the first minute. He acquitted himself very, very well."
Farid el Alagui's header moved Ayr, who are second-bottom of the Championship, to within one point of eighth-placed Rovers.
And, while Ayr manager Ian McCall believed his side were on a "hiding to nothing" because of the "whole circus" surrounding the game, he felt it did not affect the outcome.
"It didn't really influence the game," he said. "He had no chance with the goal and he made a couple of good saves."
Stevenson, 32, played in goal for the final five minutes of Partick Thistle's 4-0 defeat by Hearts in October 2015 after Ryan Scully was sent off with the Jags having used all of their substitutes.
But he wants his stint in goal on Tuesday to be his last.
"It was a strange experience," said Stevenson, who revealed he was wearing gloves belonging to Dundee United goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
"I didn't want to let the boys down and I suppose it's something I can tick off the bucket list.
"I think that's the gloves hung up now. I've got them in the bag and I'll get the shirt framed.
"It's not something you'd have thought you'd have to do in a professional game.
"Hopefully, it's something I'll not be repeating again."
