In pictures: Changing face of Britain's canals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's relationship with the canals of the Industrial Revolution has lasted for some 300 years. In that time they've moved from being vital trade routes to ignored and forgotten relics, but in the past few decades canals have enjoyed a resurgence. Now, in many cases, they're seen as great places to keep fit by, live near and take holidays on.
