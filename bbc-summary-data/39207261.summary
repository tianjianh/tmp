The group will play five gigs inside a "unique installation" created by artist Liam Gillick, accompanied by a 12-piece synthesiser ensemble.
There will also be an exhibition of art inspired by the band and their original incarnation, Joy Division.
The full line-up for the 18-day biennial festival has just been announced. It begins on 29 June.
The festival is renowned for staging world premieres by leading artists and performers.
Artistic director John McGrath said this year's event would reflect the current global upheaval and uncertainty.
"Everything has changed in the last 12 months, and our artists are responding in real time," he said.
"This is where MIF's commitment to commissioning new ideas from artists comes into its own."
See the full line-up on the Manchester International Festival website.
