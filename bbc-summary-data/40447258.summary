The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said an engine on the Easyjet flight had struck a bird.
On its website, Easyjet apologised to passengers for its flight returning to its airport of departure "due to birds hitting your plane".
The aircraft has landed at Inverness with fire crews on standby as a precaution.
The crew was forced to turn the aircraft back to the Highlands airport shortly after taking off.
An Easyjet spokesman said: "The pilot returned to Inverness in line with our procedures and as a precaution only.
"All passengers disembarked normally and Easyjet is positioning in a replacement aircraft to fly passengers to Gatwick. Passengers are being provided with information and refreshment vouchers in the terminal.
"We would like to apologise for any inconvenience as a result of the delay.
"The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is Easyjet's highest priority."
