Hartlepool United manager Paul Murray believes Sidney Schmeltz will have a positive influence following his move to Victoria Park last week.

Murray signed Nicky Featherstone and Dutch winger Schmeltz on Friday, and the latter came on to inspire a second-half comeback against Newport County.
Schmeltz's cross was fired home by Michael Duckworth to seal a 2-2 draw.
"I know what he'll do for the crowd and the other players, getting the best out of them," Murray told BBC Tees.
The 25-year-old played in the Eredivisie in his native Netherlands with Willem II before moving to Oldham in June 2013, where he worked with Murray prior to his release last summer.
"I know the fans were thinking 'what are we taking someone like that for?' but I know what Sidney is capable of," said Murray.
"I'm sure once he gets fully-fit he'll do some damage to the full-backs in this league - but he's not ready to start at the minute."
After defeat by Cambridge in Murray's first match in charge, the point against Newport ended a three-game losing streak for Pools.
And for Murray, the manner in which the draw was earned was another positive.
"When I was here as a player, we did capitulate at times," he admitted.
"To show that spirit and desire to get back in the game and to nearly win it was superb. That has to be the catalyst to get us up the league."
