Underlying earnings rose more than 20% to â‚¬2.52bn ($2.84bn; Â£1.85bn), beating analysts' forecasts.
Revenues in the January-to-March period rose 14.7% to â‚¬20.9bn.
Growth in North America as well as Europe powered results, with the Munich-based firm citing strong demand for luxury SUVs, such as its X5 model.
BMW also reaffirmed its guidance for solid growth this year.
Sales of luxury vehicles and motorcycles will stay strong, the company said.
During the first quarter, motorcycle sales reached a new high.
However, the carmaker said some markets, including Russia, presented challenging conditions.
