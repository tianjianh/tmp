Themes range from jewellery inspired by urban graffiti to laser etchings illustrating the progress of dementia.
Thousands of visitors are expected at the 10-day degree show, which opens to the public on Saturday following its traditional preview evening.
The university said the event generated more than Â£1.5m for the local economy.
The show takes place throughout the college of art and design's two buildings and 14 floors.
One of the students exhibiting is Amy Crawford, who is unveiling her work six weeks after she almost died from sepsis.
The college's previous alumni include fashion designer Hayley Scanlan, illustrator Johanna Basford and Star Wars animator Matt Cameron.
College Dean, Prof Paul Harris, said: "It is hard to describe how exciting and vibrant a time this is for everyone involved.
"The buzz has been building for months and the students who have poured their heart and soul into their work over several years are reaching the end of their undergraduate careers."
Despite representing the culmination of years of work, Prof Harris said the show was "far from the end" of the students' journey into art and design.
He said: "They may become practising artists or they may go on to work in film, games and animation studios.
"They might find themselves working with some of the world's largest tech companies or leading the next big start-ups.
"They may go on to do something completely different but we are confident that what they have learned in their years here will stand them in good stead, regardless of which field they choose to work in."
