The former North Antrim MLA Daithí McKay has revealed he has quit Sinn Féin.

Mr McKay stood down from the assembly in August over claims he coached a loyalist blogger to give evidence to a Stormont inquiry into Nama.
Nama is the Republic of Ireland's "bad bank", set up to deal with toxic loans after the 2008 property crash.
A Sinn Féin councillor and 17 party activists quit in protest at how Mr McKay had been treated.
In his first broadcast interview since his resignation, Mr McKay said he "regrets nothing".
"People always make mistakes," he told BBC Radio Foyle.
"I think that's important to realise but there's nobody out there who hasn't made a mistake in their work or life.
"I moved on from all this the day after I resigned and I think most of the public have moved on from this as well, so I don't dwell on it and I don't think there's any need to dwell on it."
A spokesperson for the party said: "Daithí McKay served as a Sinn Féin MLA from 2007 to 2016 and was a talented and respected public representative.
"He acknowledged that he made a serious error of judgement over his involvement with loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson and took the correct decision to stand down as an MLA.
"His membership of Sinn Féin was also suspended at this time.
"He has now decided to leave Sinn Féin and we wish him well in the future."
