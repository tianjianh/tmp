The American, 35, won 6-4 6-3 in one hour and 19 minutes against the 19-year-old in Melbourne on Tuesday.
World number two Williams, who is targeting a 23rd career Grand Slam title, said she "has nothing to lose".
"Every match I'm playing for fun. I get to travel the world and do what I do best - play tennis," she added.
Williams will face Lucie Safarova in the second round after the 29-year-old Czech beat Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer 3-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-1.
Fifth seed Karolina Pliskova, who beat Williams in last year's US Open semi-final, is through after a 6-2 6-0 victory over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo.
"Even when you're not playing your best, somehow you have to win," said the 24-year-old.
"I know I can be dangerous deep in the tournament, quarters and semis, and when there are big players I can beat them."
