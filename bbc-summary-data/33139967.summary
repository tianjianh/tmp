Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November.
It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat.
The comet has moved nearer to the sun since and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
The Philae craft made three short contacts of about 10 seconds each at roughly 9.30pm on Sunday.
