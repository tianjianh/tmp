Martin Fitzpatrick pled guilty to attempted murder after attacking Alyn Stocks, 40, in Glasgow's Shettleston area in July last year.
Fitzpatrick's cousin was a neighbour of the victim.
Mr Stocks and the woman had been arguing over claims that each of their dogs had caused trouble in their tenement.
Fitzpatrick, from Easterhouse, eventually got involved and stabbed Mr Stocks 10 times.
Sentencing was deferred for reports and Fitzpatrick was remanded in custody.
