Sportech wants to sell the betting firm, which began 93 years ago and was once the main way to gamble on football, to focus on its US business.
It will be bought by Burlywood Capital, an investment fund run by the founder of online betting site Sportingbet.
The new owners then plan to list the Football Pools on London's Alternative Investment Market.
The deal depends on Burlywood Capital raising the financing and approval from Sportech shareholders.
Sportech combined the pools brands by buying Littlewoods Gaming in 2000, Zetters in 2002 and Vernons in 2007.
The pools are now played by about 300,000 people, though at their height 10 million players took part.
The game had sales of £33.8m and profits of £15.2m last year.
Players pick up to 12 football matches that they predict will finish in a draw.
Famous winners include West Yorkshire factory worker Viv Nicholson who scooped £152,319 in 1961, the equivalent of £3.1m today, and vowed to "spend, spend, spend" her winnings.
