[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William McMahon, 68, from Kirkcaldy, was sentenced at the town's sheriff court on Monday.
McMahon was found guilty of intentionally or recklessly injuring a fledgling gull contrary to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in August.
It follows an investigation by the Scottish SPCA. The animal charity welcomed the fine.
John Chisholm, of the Scottish SPCA, said: "McMahon was witnessed taking a large golf umbrella out the boot of his car and proceeding towards the gull chick, which was in his garden.
"When the bird ran into the next garden, McMahon was seen leaning over the fence and striking it with the umbrella.
"The gull was clearly injured and concerned locals put it in a box before contacting us for help."
He added: "We took the bird to our National Wildlife Rescue Centre where it was found to have a broken leg.
"Sadly, it was in a great deal of pain due to the severity of the fracture and had to be put to sleep to end any further suffering.
"This was a deliberate and callous act of animal cruelty against a defenceless young bird and we welcome McMahon's conviction."
