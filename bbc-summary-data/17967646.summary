Brian Matthew McKibben, 28, from Tonagh Gardens in the city, is accused of stealing cash and cigarettes from a woman in the Old Warren area last Wednesday.
It was also alleged that he robbed a takeaway restaurant at knifepoint on Thursday before stealing cash from a service station two hours later.
He was remanded in custody.
Lisburn Magistrates' Court heard that he stole Â£70 from the Chinese takeaway and an undisclosed sum of cash from a till the service station in Lagan Valley.
A PSNI detective constable told the court he believed he could connect Mr McKibben to each of the charges.
