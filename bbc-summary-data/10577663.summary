Scotland's oldest cinema is set to revive the 'jeely jar' ticket, with a special offer dating back to the 1920s.

In exchange for an empty bottle or jar, children will get a free ticket to a showing at the renovated Hippodrome cinema in Bo'ness, near Falkirk.
The picture house was re-opened last year after a Â£2m restoration.
The offer will see film fans who donate a clean, empty jam jar (with its lid) given two tickets for the price of one at special screenings.
This season's offer will allow movie-goers access to the silent Buster Keaton classic, Steamboat Bill Jr.
The jars will be used by the Georgian Kitchen in nearby Callendar House in Falkirk for jam-making.
Astrid Shearer, audience development officer at the cinema, said: "We're really proud of the Hippodrome's unique heritage and we like to think that, although we do show the latest releases, we also celebrate our place in cinema history, and give our audience the opportunity to see some exceptional and rarely screened films."
