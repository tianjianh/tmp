GHA Coaches: Parents need new school transport plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents in Wrexham have been told to make new arrangements to get their children to school after the collapse of a coach firm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ruabon-based GHA Coaches ceased trading on 15 July, with the loss of 320 jobs.
Wrexham council said some commercial services used by children not eligible for free school transport have not been replaced for the new term in September.
Those affected are St Joseph's School, The Maelor School, Ysgol Rhiwabon and Ysgol Dinas Bran.
Wrexham council's lead member for transport, David Bithell, said: "Due to the difficult situation since the collapse of the private transport company GHA coaches, we wished to alert students, parents and carers of the loss of previously operated commercial services that some pupils used for transport to and from school.
"Whilst the council has issued a number of tenders for new replacement bus services, these are not a complete duplicate of the previous services."
The council is not providing transport for any sixth form students starting year 12 in September.
GHA operated public and school services across Wrexham, Flintshire, Denbighshire and parts of Cheshire and Shropshire.
Meanwhile, 200 buses and coaches belonging to  GHA are to be sold off.
Administrator Grant Thornton has organised a three-day online auction, starting on Tuesday, with money raised from the sale expected to go towards paying creditors.
Further auctions will be held in October and November.
The collapse has led to local councils seeking new contractors to run the routes but some areas are still without buses, leaving passengers facing disruption.
