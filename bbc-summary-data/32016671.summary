Two shots were fired as the suspects attacked the building on High Street, Boston Spa, on the outskirts of Leeds.
Although no one was shot, one post office worker suffered minor injuries as he tried to stop the pair, who escaped with an amount of cash.
One vehicle used in the robbery, a Nissan Juke, was found on fire at Beeches End in the commuter village.
Det Insp Phil Jackson said: "We are in the early stages of our investigation into this armed robbery, which is being treated as an isolated incident.
"From our inquiries it would appear that a firearm has been discharged twice, once inside the premises and once outside. No one was injured as a result of these discharges.
"It was initially reported that two female suspects entered the post office but it has now been established that the suspects were dressed as women and wearing wigs.
"We believe that two vehicles were used in this incident and in addition to the two suspects who entered the post office there may have also been a driver involved.
"One of the vehicles, a Nissan Juke, has been located burnt out in Beeches End. The other vehicle involved is believed to be a white Mercedes."
