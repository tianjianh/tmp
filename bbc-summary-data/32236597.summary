A poster featuring a kilted man in front of an image of Glen Coe is being displayed on 50 large digital screens in the US city.
The VisitScotland poster reads: "Visit Scotland. The land that inspired Outlander".
It also urges New Yorkers to "Give in to your kilty pleasures".
Based on a series of novels from American author Diana Gabaldon, the TV series follows the story of Claire Randell, a nurse from 1946 who is swept back in time to 1743.
It was filmed at various locations across Scotland, including Doune Castle near Stirling.
The promotion drive will also see VisitScotland members march along New York's 6th Avenue with an Outlander-themed banner during the Tartan Day Parade on Saturday.
The parade will include 300 Outlander fans and will be led by Graham McTavish, who plays Dougal Mackenzie in the show.
VisitScotland has also teamed up with Showcase, the Canadian channel broadcasting Outlander, to offer viewers a holiday for two in Scotland.
The advert for the competition is being broadcast during the first and second episodes of the series this month, with shots of Scotland appearing alongside clips from the show.
VisitScotland chairman Mike Cantlay said: "Outlander has captured the imagination of people across the globe, particularly in North America, and it is vital that we make the most of this fantastic opportunity.
"Our intensive marketing activity during Scotland Week, and beyond, will encourage more and more people to come to Scotland - the land that inspired Outlander."
