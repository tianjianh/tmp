Jim Mallinder: Northampton Saints' need to 'freshen things up' part of Alex King's exit

Northampton Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder said the club's need to "freshen things up" contributed to attack coach Alex King's exit.

King left on Friday with the club ninth in the Premiership table.
"This is my 10th season and actually we haven't made many changes to the coaching set-up," said Mallinder.
"We made one a few years ago and went on to win the Premiership and a European competition. Hopefully this little change will do the same."
Former England international King joined as an attack coach from Clermont Auvergne in 2013 and helped the club lift the Premiership and European Challenge Cup in 2014.
But after two wins from their opening six league games, King - linked to Eddie Jones' England set-up last year - left Franklin's Gardens before Saturday's European Champions Cup win over Montpellier.
"In the short term we'll [replace King] in house," Mallinder told BBC Radio Northampton.
"Alan Dickens is an outstanding coach, he went with the England Saxons over the summer and picked up lots of ideas.
"He does love the attacking side of the game and sees this as a big opportunity for him to step up.
"We'll also be looking to bring somebody in. Whether that's an attack or defence coach is still to be decided."
