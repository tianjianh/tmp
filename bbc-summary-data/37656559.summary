Police investigating the rape and murder of a teenage girl 45 years ago are pursuing two "significant" new leads.

Dorothy Leyden's body was found in April 1971, hours after she had been to a concert at the Golden Garter nightclub in Wythenshawe, Manchester.
The 17-year-old's body was discovered on waste ground in Collyhurst, but her killer has never been traced.
The new leads emerged following a BBC Crimewatch appeal.
Greater Manchester Police said "two names" had been put forward as potential suspects.
Det Sgt Julie Adams, of the force's cold case unit, said: "We've had a really positive response. We received 20 pieces of information which I have reviewed.
"We've come up with two names that are very, very exciting to us, that we are going to continue to do some research on."
Dorothy Leyden's sister, Pat Atkinson, made an emotional appeal during the Crimewatch episode.
The programme told how the teenager had spent the evening with friends seeing a performance from Motown's Jimmy Ruffin, before heading into central Manchester.
She later got out of a taxi she had shared with friends at Piccadilly Gardens bus station and it is thought she decided to walk home.
Her body was found the following day behind the now demolished Spread Eagle pub.
Officers previously believed she may have been murdered by serial killer Trevor Hardy, but this theory was dismissed in 2008.
Det Supt Martin Bottomley said forensic evidence proved he did not kill Dorothy.
He added: "The suspicion that Hardy was responsible may have allowed the real killer to hide for all of this time."
