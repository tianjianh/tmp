Two men have died after their car hit a wall in Neath Port Talbot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Police said the black Ford Focus hit a wall near a McDonald's on Old Road, Briton Ferry, at about 04:00 BST.
The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as officers had previously searched for the vehicle, following reports of suspicious activity.
Witnesses are asked to call police on 101.
The men who died are believed to have been the only occupants of the car.
Firefighters used cutting equipment to free them, and a rapid response paramedic along with two ambulances attended, but the men were pronounced dead.
Police want to speak to anybody who saw the Ford as it travelled eastbound from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, along the M4, and over Briton Ferry bridge.
They want to contact the occupants of a black vehicle - believed to be a taxi - seen on the Briton Ferry roundabout at the time of the incident.
In a statement, South Wales Police said: "In accordance with force policy and statutory guidance, South Wales Police can confirm the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission as prior to the collision, officers were searching for the vehicle after receiving information from Heddlu Dyfed-Powys Police that it had been seen acting suspiciously in the Ammanford area."
