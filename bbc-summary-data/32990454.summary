The UK's only flying Lancaster bomber is to miss much of the 2015 display season after an engine fire.

The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) aircraft had to make an emergency landing at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in May.
Following the incident, the Lancaster was unable to take part in VE Day commemorations.
It will now miss a number of airshows, including RAF Cosford and the Weston Air Festival in Somerset.
Engine number four on the aircraft has been removed while an investigation into what caused the fire is carried out.
Warrant Officer Kevin Ball, from the BBMF, said: "The problems for us are really in the support structure - a lot of the cowlings were damaged - so it's getting those repaired."
He said: "It's not so much the engine itself - it's the surrounding structure, electrical looms and so on."
Last year, the only other flying Lancaster, which is based in Canada, visited the UK.
It also suffered technical problems and had to be loaned a spare engine by the BBMF.
This engine will now be fitted to the Lancaster once other parts have been replaced.
WO Ball added: "We are looking to possibly air test during the last week of August, first week of September.
"If it all comes together maybe we will see her flying before the end of the season."
More than 7,300 Lancasters were built during World War Two but most were scrapped in the years after 1945.
The BBMF's Lancaster, known as Thumper, is allowed to fly a strictly limited number of hours each year, in order to extend its airworthiness.
