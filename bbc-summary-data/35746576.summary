[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The roof shared by the two semi-detached houses in East Creech, south of Wareham, was in danger of collapsing after being engulfed by flames, the fire service said.
A 70-year-old man has been treated by ambulance crews for a chest injury. No other casualties have been reported.
Dorset Fire and Rescue said the fire was "deep-seated" and continued to burn throughout the day.
The fire was "quite well advanced" before crews were alerted at about 09:00 GMT.
They were expected to remain there into the evening.
The cause will be investigated but it is not thought to be suspicious, the fire service said.
