[SN]TITLE[SN]
Irish border 'could be like Norway-Sweden'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has not considered an arrangement where Northern Ireland could stay in the European customs union if the UK leaves, according to Brexit Secretary David Davis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK will have to decide if it leaves the union when it leaves the EU.
It would mean goods moving across the Irish border would be subject to customs procedures and tariffs.
Mr Davis said the Norway-Sweden border was an example of how the border could operate.
He said that despite it being a customs frontier it is "a very open border."
If Northern Ireland was to stay in the customs union it would mean customs checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
A think tank has suggested that Northern Ireland could remain within the Customs Union even if the rest of the UK leaves.
The Nevin Economic Research Institute (Neri) said leaving the customs union poses a "unique threat" to Irish cross-border trade.
Neri said such checks at sea ports or airports are "less cumbersome or trade inhibiting" than those on land borders.
However, it acknowledged that such a proposal would have "significant political problems".
