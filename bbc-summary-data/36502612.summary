A cat that went missing six months ago has been returned home after being found 150 miles (240km) away.

Six-year-old Buddy, a long-haired tabby from Hucknall in Nottinghamshire, went missing last September.
He was found after a member of the public in Hounslow, Greater London, saw him looking lost and confused and called the RSPCA.
A vet who examined him before he was returned to his owner John Pidgeon, said he was "underweight but fine".
Mr Pidgeon said: "He came back yesterday and has settled in really well."
He said Buddy may have jumped in a car and been taken to London by mistake, but he is not sure what happened.
"I was asking people - do you think he will recognise me? But he came home, just had a brief look round and is now right at home.
"I wasn't expecting it at all, when I got the call from the RSPCA inspector ... and she told me where she was and where she had found him I couldn't believe it.
"I'm absolutely thrilled to have him back."
Mr Pidgeon said he was away in Scotland when his cat went missing, but his stepfather was feeding him every day.
RSPCA inspector Leanna Hone said: "I have no idea how Buddy managed to travel 150 miles or what he has been doing since September.
"It's lucky he had his microchip kept up to date and I'm so pleased we were able to reunite him with his owner."
