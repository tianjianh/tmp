Norfolk PCC Stephen Bett announces preferred Chief Constable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer who has risen through the ranks from constable is the preferred candidate to become head of the force in Norfolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Bett has nominated Deputy Chief Constable Simon Bailey as his preferred choice for Chief Constable.
Mr Bailey's nomination will now be referred to the police and crime panel for confirmation on 25 October.
Mr Bett said the recruitment process had been completely open.
"Mr Bailey has proved himself to be highly competent in all his Association of Chief Police Officers roles to date.
"I am confident he is the right person to take the Norfolk Constabulary forward in these challenging times.
"He is an excellent leader and I will look to him to ensure that Norfolk remains an exemplary force driving through efficiencies and economies.
"I hope that the police and crime panel will endorse my choice".
Mr Bailey has been a police officer for 27 years, serving predominantly as a detective.
In 1998, he was seconded to the National Crime Squad and as detective inspector he was responsible for managing covert operations targeting organised crime gangs.
In 2000, he worked on the investigation into the murder of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson, who was killed by a loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland in 1999.
He worked for three years on the probe before he returned to Norfolk as a detective superintendent with responsibility for intelligence.
Mr Bailey was promoted to Deputy Chief Constable with responsibility for legal services, human resources, and force performance in September 2010.
He was promoted to temporary Chief Constable when Phil Gormley left to join National Crime Agency in June this year.
