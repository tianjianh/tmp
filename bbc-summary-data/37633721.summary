[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier has described in court the moment he was threatened with a knife before being kidnapped by his Army comrade and love rival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Dicks said he screamed for help as he grappled with former friend John Watson in a cul-de-sac in Windsor.
The court heard Mr Watson had been lying in wait for Mr Dicks outside the home of his estranged wife.
Mr Watson, of Pirbright Camp in Woking, Surrey, denies attempted murder and kidnapping.
He also denies a charge of having a knife in a public place.
Reading Crown Court heard Mr Watson had been waiting for the father of two to emerge from the home of Lynsey Watson, with whom Mr Dicks had been in a relationship following the breakdown of their respective marriages.
Mr Dicks, 28, said he was "terrified" when he was overpowered and bundled into the back of a car with his hands and wrists bound with cable ties before being driven to a secluded spot.
The court heard Mr Watson had tried to wrap cling film around his face but he managed to break free and fight back, suffering stab and slash wounds before being saved by police.
Mr Dicks described being injured in the struggle as Mr Watson forced a knife against his chest.
Asked by prosecution counsel Daniel Fugallo if he was aware it was causing injury to his hands, Mr Dicks replied: "I didn't care."
Mr Dicks subsequently underwent surgery on his right hand.
Under cross-examination, Mr Dicks denied that he had produced a knife and attacked Mr Watson first.
The court heard the men became friends while stationed at Combermere Barracks, near Windsor, last year.
Mr Watson has already admitted one charge of having a bladed article in public.
The trial is expected to last two weeks.
