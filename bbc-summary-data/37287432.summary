A car bomb attack claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS) has killed at least nine people in the centre of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials say.

An explosives-laden pick-up truck exploded shortly before midnight (21:00 GMT) in the predominantly Shia Muslim commercial district of Karrada.
Twenty people were also injured by the blast, which set several shops on fire.
The blast was not far from the site of a lorry bombing in July that left more than 300 people dead.
An IS statement said the Sunni jihadist group had targeted a gathering of Shia civilians on Monday and boasted how it had managed to carry out the attack despite heightened security in the area.
The streets of Karrada are lined with shops and restaurants, and they are usually packed ahead of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which starts next week.
The area bombed in July, which was targeted  as Muslims prepared for the other major festival of Eid al-Fitr, had only recently been reopened by the Iraqi authorities.
In a separate development on Tuesday, the UN World Food Programme said it had delivered food to more than 30,000 residents of Qayyarah for the first time in two years, after Iraqi government forces ousted IS militants from the northern town.
The WFP's country director, Sally Haydock, told AFP news agency that Qayyarah was "in a dire state" and that locals were "suffering extreme hunger".
Safe drinking water, electricity and medical services were almost impossible to access, and black smoke was also rising from nearby oilfields that were set alight by militants as they withdrew from the town two weeks ago, Ms Haydock said.
The Qayyarah operation was part of a wider offensive by government forces aiming to retake the second city of Mosul, 60km (35 miles) away, which IS militants overran in 2014.
The UN Refugee Agency warned last month that 1.2 million people could be displaced by the assault on Mosul.
