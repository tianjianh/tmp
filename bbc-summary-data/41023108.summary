[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Can Manchester United make it a hat-trick of 4-0 wins? Will Huddersfield and West Brom maintain their 100% winning starts? Are Newcastle or West Ham going to break their duck? Here is your chance to predict the next round of Premier League fixtures.

The Red Devils take on Leicester in Saturday's evening game and BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is backing them to continue their winning start at Old Trafford and also to challenge for the title this season.
"You can see that they know they have a good side and that they will be close in all competitions," he told BBC Sport.
What do you think will happen? You can make your own predictions now - take on Lawro and other fans, create your own league and try to make it to the top of the table by playing the new-look BBC Sport Predictor game.
More than 150,000 of you have signed up so far, and Lawro has slipped down the overall table a bit after only amassing 70 points in round two.
There is plenty of time for him to catch up - he will be making a prediction for all 380 games this season, against a variety of guests.
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is American actor Channing Tatum, who stars in Steven Soderbergh's comeback film Logan Lucky.
Tatum said that he played varsity soccer when he was younger but was asked by the parents of the other children to switch to American football because he was "more of a slam-into-each-other type of player".
He also revealed that his co-star on upcoming spy sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vinnie Jones, gave him a signed copy of the infamous photo in which the ex-Wimbledon midfielder grabs Paul Gascoigne in an intimate area. He admitted it was the "favourite thing I have ever been given by a co-star".
Another of Tatum's recent co-stars, Jamie Bell, has recruited him as an Arsenal fan. "I got educated on the Premier League by him," he told BBC Sport.

You can also hear more from Lawro on Saturday when he joins Phil Williams to take your calls on BBC Radio 5 live's 606.

Match report
Chelsea v Everton (13:30 BST)
After losing their opening game at home to Burnley, Chelsea were excellent against Tottenham last weekend, winning 2-1 at Wembley. It was like a set of good players saying to themselves 'what was that all about last weekend?' They have some very, very good players and won the league last year at a canter.
Everybody was ready to say 'played two, lost two, what is manager Antonio Conte going to say?' and wonder whether he was going to leave the club. But it was a big win for them and I expect them to win again this weekend.
Everton have made a really good start. Everything about it has been impressive. The only thing is that, at the moment, Wayne Rooney is the only one who looks like he is going to score.
Everybody knows they are looking for a striker, it is just a case of who they can get in. But they have a good manager and have made good signings already.
They got battered 5-0 at Chelsea last season and while I don't expect that to happen again, I do think they'll lose.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
West Brom v Stoke (13:30 BST)
It is played two, won two for West Brom. But they are another team struggling for goals and looking to get attacking signings finalised.
There are no worries for the Baggies because Tony Pulis does what he does. But if he can just get himself a 15-goal striker, what a difference it would make. Whether they would get the chances to score 15 goals in a season in that West Brom side is debatable.
Stoke never looked like worrying Everton on the opening day but got a great result against Arsenal last weekend. They have something about them this season. Taking striker Jese on loan for a year from Paris St-Germain could be a masterstroke. He will be happy just to play and to go somewhere that he is wanted, which makes a huge difference to a player.
Mark Hughes is a good manager but Stoke are also a really good club to manage. They are run with great common sense by Peter Coates. They are pragmatists.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Liverpool v Arsenal (16:00 BST)
I was at the corresponding game last year and Liverpool dispatched Arsenal quite comfortably. Like last year, they will be better against the good teams who do not change their style of play just because it is Liverpool.
I saw them against Hoffenheim on Wednesday and they remain great going forward but they can't defend.
Liverpool have been vehement in saying that they don't want to sell Philippe Coutinho but the latest reported bid from Barcelona is bonkers money. If he really wants to leave then I think he will have to come out and say he doesn't want to play - that is the only thing that will no force the outcome.
Liverpool face an Arsenal team that still has more questions than answers about it. They were fortunate to beat Leicester and, against Stoke, while they can have a moan about some of the decisions, it exposed that familiar soft underbelly.
You can play all the nice football in the world but if you can't deal with the humdrum aspects of football you will be susceptible to results like that.
The problem for the Gunners is that every time they lose you are waiting for the 'Wenger out' to start.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Tottenham v Burnley (16:00 BST)
In fairness to Tottenham, they played OK last weekend. Chelsea were just better than them. It is important for Tottenham to start getting wins under their belt at Wembley and to start to dispel the myth of it being a hoodoo.
I said in week one that they would struggle to finish in the top four because of the Wembley situation and I am not going to change my mind. They will be in the mix for the top six though. They are not a bad team because they lost at home to Chelsea.
They have made some signing this week - the Colombian defender Davinson Sanchez from Ajax and goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga from Southampton. I would think they will be looking to get two or three more in.
But it is a trip to Wembley for Burnley and while they lost last weekend to West Brom they put in a really good performance to beat Chelsea on the opening day. I can't see them winning this though.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Phil Dawkes.
On the second weekend of the new Premier League season, Lawro got four correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 matches, for a total of 70 points.
He lost to actor Will Poulter, who got six results correct with two perfect scores.
*As Cram and Foster both provided predictions on week two, only Foster's score contributes to the guest total.
