Three men in their twenties were found in Gloucester Road at around 20:00.
Two were taken to hospital with serious injuries. A man, 22, died at the scene. A fourth man presented himself to hospital with stab wounds.
An eyewitness told the Express they saw a woman believed to be a relative of the dead man running down the street screaming "he's dead, he's dead".
The Met said next of kin had been informed but no arrests had yet been made.
Several residents told the BBC there had been problems in the area since the local police station closed.
One woman said she "knew something like this was going to happen".
Another added: "Things have been heading that way for a while. This is not a very god area, there's drugs and all kinds of things going on."
Another resident, Miroslaw Misiukiecz, said: "I was attacked around three weeks ago on my doorstep by a young man.
"It's since they closed the police station at Norwood Junction a couple of years ago. Before it was safe, but now it's not."
The wounded men are aged 21, 22 and 27. Their injuries are not considered to be life-threatening, police said.
Ch Supt Andy Tarrant said such attacks were "rare" and Scotland Yard were "doing everything we can to catch those responsible."
