[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Air-cleansing nanotechnology was used to make the 10m by 20m (33ft x 66ft) poster on a University of Sheffield building.
It bore a poem, In Praise of Air, written by University of Sheffield professor Simon Armitage.
Twelve sections of the poster have now been stretched onto frames to raise money for the British Lung Foundation.
The poster, featured on the side of the Alfred Denney building since 2014, removed more than two tonnes of nitrogen oxide from the environment.
It was a collaboration between the School of English and the Faculty of Science, which helped raise awareness worldwide of the damaging effects of traffic pollution on public health.
The 12 sections to be auctioned for the British Lung Foundation are signed by Mr Armitage, 53, who was born in Huddersfield and is an acclaimed poet, playwright and novelist.
To celebrate the end of the university's catalytic poetry project, Mr Armitage will be giving a poetry reading before the artworks are auctioned at 99 Mary Street, Sheffield, at 19:00 BST.
In Praise of Air by Simon Armitage
I write in praise of air.  I was six or five
when a conjurer opened my knotted fist
and I held in my palm the whole of the sky.
I've carried it with me ever since.
Let air be a major god, its being
and touch, its breast-milk always tilted
to the lips.  Both dragonfly and Boeing
dangle in its see-through nothingnessâ€¦
Among the jumbled bric-a-brac I keep
a padlocked treasure-chest of empty space
and on days when thoughts are fuddled with smog
or civilization crosses the street
with a white handkerchief over its mouth
and cars blow kisses to our lips from theirs
I turn the key, throw back the lid, breathe deep.
My first word, everyone's  first word, was air.
