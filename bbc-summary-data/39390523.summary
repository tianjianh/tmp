[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 0-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley condemned National League bottom side Southport to a ninth defeat in 11 games with a narrow victory at Haig Avenue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rory McKeown's cross-shot hit the bar as Southport made a confident start, but after the break the visitors took control.
Kevan Hurst tested Craig King's handling with a decent effort just after the break, but there was little the Southport goalkeeper could do to deny the 31-year-old's superb volley with 18 minutes remaining.
The victory, which ended a three-match winless run for Guiseley, leaves Southport 10 points off safety with only six matches to play.
