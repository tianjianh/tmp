A seaside town's mayor says a pair of skinny dippers who joined in an annual Boxing Day charity swim spoiled the event for many people.

Dozens of swimmers took part in the annual Llandudno dip watched by a large crowd off the resort's North Shore.
But mayor Myra Wigzell said two swimmers were naked which led some parents to hurry their children away.
Police are studying CCTV to identify the naked swimmers and say officers will attend next year as a precaution.
Ms Wigzell, who was at the swim, says it is a family event and the actions of the pair were in "extremely bad taste".
"It's always been excellent fun with lots of people dressing up," she said.
"The event has grown over the years and is looked forward to by everybody in the area and they often take the whole family out on Boxing Day to witness it.
"Unfortunately this year two people took it into their heads to skinny dip... which was unpleasant really.
"But the worst aspect of it was that one of them felt it necessary on the way out to extend or embellish his front with what appeared to be a long sock which made it into an even more unpleasant breach of public decency."
She said a lot of people attended the event and many probably would not have noticed what had happened.
"But some of the parents and grandparents who had their children with them who realised what was happening, I was told they hurried them away," she said.
"It really wasn't the sort of thing you wish to expose your children and grandchildren to in what was something that was supposed to be a pleasant event in the town."
She said it was probably intended as a "high-spirited prank" but the naked swimmers did not realise how inappropriate their actions were.
North Wales Police said the skinny dippers did not appear to be official swimmers but had just joined in.
Insp Ian Verburg said: "We are looking to find out who these individuals were by studying CCTV.
"It doesn't seem like they were part of the official group taking part in this charity event.
"There haven't been any official complaints but I will make sure there's a police presence at next year's event as a precaution."
The Boxing Day dip in Llandudno has been taking place for around 20 years and dozens of swimmers brave the water to raise money for charity.
