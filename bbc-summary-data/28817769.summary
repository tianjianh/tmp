The display in Headcorn is one of a series of events taking place across the UK reuniting the two planes.
There were over 7,000 of the type of aircraft produced between 1941 and 1946 but now there are only two flying.
One, nicknamed Thumper, is maintained by the RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the other, Vera, by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.
The two planes made aviation history on Thursday when they flew together above Eastbourne for their first public display as a pair.
