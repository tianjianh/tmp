Seven sports set to receive no government funding to prepare for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games have appeals heard on Monday and Tuesday.

The sports are to receive no investment for the four-year cycle leading into the Tokyo Games.
Badminton was the biggest loser, with £5.7m of funding withdrawn.
Others hit are Olympic sports table tennis, weightlifting, archery and fencing, plus goalball and wheelchair rugby on the Paralympic programme.
Badminton was hit despite exceeding UK Sport's performance target at the 2016 Rio Olympics and being the only one of the seven sports to win a medal there - bronze for Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis.
Powerlifting is also challenging UK Sport over the decision to allocate its £1.3m of funding for its Paralympic athletes to the English Institute of Sport (EIS) to manage, rather than British Weightlifting's own programme.
UK Sport says it must prioritise sports with the strongest medal potential for Tokyo.
The appeal process is essentially a second opportunity for officials to demonstrate why they deserve funding for the four-year cycle leading into the Tokyo Games.
The findings will be revealed by the end of the month, with those still unhappy with any verdict able to make a formal appeal to the arbitration service Sport Resolutions UK.
Archery, badminton, weightlifting and powerlifting appeals will be heard on Monday, 6 February, with fencing, goalball, table tennis and wheelchair rugby putting their cases forward on Tuesday.
