Jac Evan Davies died following a blaze at his family home in Alltwen near Pontardawe in the early hours of 27 July.
His mother Jennifer Davies, 28, escaped the blaze along with her 11-month-old baby and daughter Kelsey, six.
Her other son Riley, three, was rescued by a firefighter.
South Wales Police later arrested and bailed a 28-year-old woman on suspicion of child neglect.
"A 28 year-old woman has been released without charge following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service," a police spokesman said.
The inquest for Jac Davies is still to take place.
