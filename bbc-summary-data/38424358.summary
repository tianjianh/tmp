[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andrew Crofts' last-minute volley secured Charlton a draw at Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers seemed set for a fourth victory in succession when Simon Cox fired them in front midway through the first half.
But the Addicks hit back at the death to pick up a point.
In-form Southend, who have now not lost for 12 games, went in front after 24 minutes when Cox neatly teed himself up before netting a well-taken left-footed shot from 12 yards.
However, Joe Aribo and Jorge Teixeira were then both denied by Southend goalkeeper Ted Smith before the Shrimpers almost made it 2-0 when Stephen McLaughlin fired against the right post.
In reply, Ezri Konsa and Jordan Botaka were both superbly denied by Smith before Aribo curled an effort against the crossbar.
The Shrimpers replied with Will Atkinson having an effort tipped over by Dillon Phillips before Marc-Antoine Fortune bundled the ball wide from close range.
And the wasted opportunities returned to haunt Southend as Crofts slammed home an 89th-minute volley via the underside of the crossbar.
