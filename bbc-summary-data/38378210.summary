'Temporary' one-way system end in sight after three-and-a-half years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary one-way system which has been in place in a Borders town for more than three-and-a-half years looks set to come to an end.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work on a retaining wall at the Glen Hotel on Yarrow Terrace in Selkirk is scheduled to start in January.
Scottish Borders Council and the hotel owners have reached an agreement to allow the repairs to begin.
The works are expected to take about 10 weeks to complete and cost about Â£100,000.
The completion of the repairs will allow the reopening of the northbound lane of Yarrow Terrace.
It has been cordoned off to motorists for safety reasons while negotiations about the wall continued.
A temporary one-way system has been in place since May 2013 while these discussions carried on.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "This has been a long standing issue but it was important that an agreeable resolution was found for all parties.
"We understand the considerable disruption caused to local people while negotiations have been ongoing and thank them for their patience.
"Once the work on the wall is completed, the temporary one-way system will be removed and Yarrow Terrace will return to a two-way road."
During the initial stages of the repair works, Yarrow Terrace will be closed to all traffic at the location of the retaining wall.
Alternative traffic management arrangements will be put in place and detailed information of any diversions is expected to be issued early in the new year.
