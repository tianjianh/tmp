Deflate-gate: Tom Brady's four-match ban appeal rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's bid to overturn his four-match 'Deflate-gate' ban has been rejected by a United States appeals court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision comes after a legal battle lasting over a year.
The 38-year-old could still appeal again to the US Supreme Court.
Brady was punished by the NFL for his role in a scheme to deflate match balls to give his side an advantage during an NFL play-off game, but he denies he or the club did anything wrong.
Brady was originally suspended in 2015 and was unsuccessful in his first appeal but the decision was later overturned by a federal court.
However this suspension was restored by the Court of Appeal in April after it was challenged by the NFL.
Brady's latest appeal against that decision was denied on Wednesday.
As it stands the quarterback would miss the first four matches of the season which starts in September.
