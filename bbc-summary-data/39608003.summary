A family-owned shop has closed its doors for the last time after about 150 years of trading under the same name.

Ruddocks of Lincoln has been on its present site on the city's High Street since 1904 selling stationery, games, toys and gifts.
Henry Ruddock, the owner, said: "Costs are going up and business declining".
Jules Jackson, a shop assistant working at the store, said she was "gutted" at the closure and working there felt "like a family".
Mr Ruddock said it was "immensely sad" that the shop was closing but he could not "put sentiment in the till".
He blamed the rise of internet shopping and changing consumer habits for the shop's closure.
"The sums just don't add up, in one way it's really quite simple", said Mr Ruddock.
The shop closed its doors at the end of Saturday's trading.
The business had its first shop on High Street by 1820 and was in business before that date. The Ruddock family entered the business in the 1870s, said Mr Ruddock.
The closure was announced on 6 March and since then the shop "have had lots and lots of people coming in and saying goodbye", he said.
About 20 staff were employed at the shop.
The Double Tree hotel in the city said in a tweet: "You have been at the heart of the community for so many years and could never be replaced, this is sad news for #Lincoln".
Another twitter user Mrs Tiggy tweeted "So sad to read this, one of my favourite shops in Lincoln. The high street will not be the same".
A separate family-run design and print business is not affected by the shop's closure.
