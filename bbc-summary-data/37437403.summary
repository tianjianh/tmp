One of the main roads through Coventry will be renamed in honour of football legend Jimmy Hill.

The A444, currently known as Phoenix Way, is expected to be officially renamed Jimmy Hill Way at a special ceremony later this year.
Hill, who died in December aged 87, is seen by many as Coventry City Football Club's most successful manager.
Coventry City Council's decision comes after a campaign from the Coventry Telegraph newspaper.
Council leader George Duggins said: "We're really pleased that we are able to honour the man that revolutionised football, both for this city and throughout the sport.
"He transformed Coventry City Football Club into a major league team and introduced a range of revolutionary changes."
The A444 runs past the club's former Highfield Road home and past the Ricoh Arena, where the team currently ground shares with Wasps Rugby Club. There is a statue of Hill outside the Ricoh Arena.
Bridges that go over the road are being restored and the lower sections painted light blue as a further tribute.
Councillor Jayne Innes added:  "It will be a prominent, and fitting tribute to the man that did so much for the game and our city."
Hill led Coventry City to two promotions before leaving to work with ITV in 1967. He returned to Coventry as managing director in 1975, later becoming chairman, while still working as a presenter and pundit on the BBC's Match of the Day.
A memorial service for him was held at the city's cathedral in February.
