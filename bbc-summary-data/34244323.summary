[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man has donated £100,000 to international charities working to improve the lives of Syrian refugees.

Half of the money will be split between five appeals run by members of the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC).
The International Development Committee (IDC) said the other half would go towards helping refugees arriving in Mediterranean countries.
IDC Chairman Phil Gawne MHK said the money had been given to co-ordinated schemes in order to maximise impact.
He said: "There is a clear desire to help, but it is important that we do so in a co-ordinated way so that funds raised have the maximum impact and quickly reach the vulnerable people they are intended for."
The British Red Cross, Christian Aid, CAFOD, Oxfam and Save the Children will all receive £10,000 for their work in Syria.
Including this latest aid, the Isle of Man Government has donated nearly £450,000 to support the international community's response to the crisis.
Last month UK Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the UK would accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.
A Cabinet Office spokesman said as a Crown Dependency the Isle of Man cannot act on its own but must work within the UK's policy on refugees.
He said: "Following Mr Cameron's announcement, Cabinet Office is currently seeking clarification of the conditions guiding the UK scheme to understand whether the Isle of Man may have any role in helping to deliver this commitment.
"Should this be the case, Council of Ministers would have to consider a number of practicalities, including financial and other necessary support."
