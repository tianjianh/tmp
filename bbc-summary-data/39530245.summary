Dave Bartram was attacked on his rounds in Nottingham last month, which resulted in a visit to the doctor and an early cancer diagnosis.
The Angel pub in the city hosted the concert, a market and screening of "The Cockle Man" film to support him during his recovery.
The 70-year-old has taken his basket of seafood around the pubs for 50 years.
The benefit will see music, clothing and food stalls and a question and answer session with Mr Bartram himself.
Adam Stephenson, manager at the The Angel, said: "This is the first pub that Dave had a drink in 50 years ago.
"So it feels appropriate that we should do our bit for him and host this great evening of entertainment."
Luke Greenhill, who set up the event, said: "The cockle man is such a part of Nottingham.
"From my 10-year-old son to my 83-year-old grandma, everybody knows him.
"We had been planning to do something with him but when we heard about the attack and the cancer, it was our chance to step up."
Mr Bartram, who was the subject of a film titled The Cockle Man in 2014, has sold prawns, cockles and mussels since 1964.
In March, two thieves attacked him in a back alley, and tried to steal his children's charity collection tin.
During a medical examination after the assault, Mr Bartram learned he had cancer.
He said he has "struggled" on but has cut down his hours due to the pain from his ribs.
