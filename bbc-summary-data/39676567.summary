[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 1-1 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham finished 13th and Eastleigh 15th in the National League after this uninspiring draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After few first-half chances, Wrexham broke the deadlock through Jordan White two minutes after the restart.
But, on 73 minutes, Matt Tubbs flicked in James Constable's cross to level.
It left the hosts with only one win from their final five games of 2016-17, while Wrexham had the same record to end their campaign, to also finish in the bottom half.
Wrexham boss Dean Keates was unhappy that a foul was not given against Eastleigh in the build-up to Tubbs' goal.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "I don't want to talk about the officials, but I've seen it back and it's embarrassing.
"They put us under pressure and were getting on top. The lads defended well, but it's two points dropped and it's disappointing.
"We did okay in patches in the game, but obviously it's been a disappointing season."
