[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh Zoo has warned people "not to get too excited" after tests revealed their giant panda has conceived.

Experts said it does not mean Tian Tian is pregnant because the process is "extremely complex".
In March the female giant panda was artificially inseminated.
Edinburgh Zoo acquired the pandas on loan from China in 2011 and previous attempts to mate the pair have failed. They are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.
Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Scientific data does suggest Tian Tian has conceived, however this is not pregnancy.
"Giant panda pregnancies are extremely complex. Pregnancy begins when implantation takes place and this has not yet occurred.
"There are many hurdles to get through yet, so we would request that people do not get too excited at this very early stage."
