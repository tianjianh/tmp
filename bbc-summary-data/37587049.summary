The victim, who was wearing a school uniform, was snatched from a street in Oxford and forced into a car, then sexually assaulted by two men.
Thirty Thames Valley officers are working on the case, the force said.
Police said they are following a number of lines of inquiry and continuing to talk to the victim.
She was found at midday on 28 September by a member of public after knocking on doors to get help in Cavendish Drive, Marston.
In a statement released on Friday, Thames Valley Police said officers were "continuing to investigate the circumstances" surrounding the abduction and rape.
Det Supt Chris Ward, of the Major Crime Unit, said the force was first informed of the kidnap at 08:51 BST.
"We immediately followed the national guidelines for responding to a kidnap and a significant response following those guidelines was commenced," he said.
"I am unable to provide any additional details of the operational activities."
He added that police had been reviewing "huge quantities of CCTV content" from the Summertown and Marston areas and had responded to over 260 calls from people who had phoned in with information.
Mr Ward said he was "grateful to the public for their patience and support". The offenders were described by the victim as white and used a silver hatchback.
The first spoke with a northern accent, was in his mid-20s, and was balding with shaved dark blond hair. He had blue eyes, a medium build and was about 6ft (1.82m) tall.
The second man had brown gelled hair, was clean-shaven with brown eyes, and was in his late teens or early 20s, with a slightly smaller build than the other offender.
