Prison cell murder accused 'took synthetic high Spice'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prisoner accused of murdering his cellmate with a flat screen TV was suspected to have taken a synthetic high, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Palmer admits killing Terrence Ojuederie, 42, in their cell at HMP Peterborough but denies it was murder.
The court heard Mr Palmer, 26, may have taken the synthetic cannabis drug Spice before the attack and his defence said it may have been taken involuntarily.
He was swaying when his cellmate was found on the floor, the trial heard.
Prison officer Mohammed Abubaker told Peterborough Crown Court Mr Palmer had called him to his cell in the early hours of 9 December 2015, saying he felt sick.
He said Mr Ojuederie, who was from Watford, was awake on the bottom bunk and he "seemed fine".
He said he then asked if Mr Palmer had taken any Spice, to which the prisoner replied "I don't know".
Mr Abubaker said Mr Palmer then called him back to the cell at about 01:30 GMT, stating: "I don't know what I've done, I don't know what I've done."
He returned to the cell to find Mr Palmer swaying from side to side, holding his palms upwards and with his cellmate lying on his back on the floor, Mr Abubaker told the court.
"All he [Mr Palmer] was saying was 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'," he said.
When Mr Palmer was met by police, he told them "I don't know what happened", the court heard.
When cross-examined by defence QC Abbas Lakha, Mr Abubaker said there was nothing to suggest a fight or argument in the cell before the incident.
Mr Lakha said it was not disputed that Mr Palmer, whose address was given in court as HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, killed Mr Ojuederie.
But he said it was possible that the defendant had "involuntarily" used Spice and and the effects "might have led him to launch the attack".
The trial will continue on Wednesday.
