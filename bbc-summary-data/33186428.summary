The man, who has not yet been identified, was last seen alive at 20:45 BST on Tuesday 9 June in St Stephen's subway.
Two people saw the man, 29, in the early hours of Wednesday before he was found dead at 07:00 BST, police said.
A post-mortem examination revealed he died from injuries to the spleen and the death was declared "suspicious".
Det Insp Marie James said: "We are still trying to create a timeline of the man's final movements and the circumstances which led to his death.
"We would particularly like to hear from two people who saw the man in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
"Other witnesses have suggested a male teenager, possibly a college student, passed him in the subway at around 05:00 BST and later returned to buy flowers from the flower stall by the subway to leave inside.
"The second person we wish to trace is a man who gave assistance at the scene when his body was discovered.
"This man is described as being smartly dressed, wearing a jacket and glasses.
"I would also appeal again for people to contact me if they know details about any of his friends or family as we have still been unable to trace next of kin despite numerous inquiries."
