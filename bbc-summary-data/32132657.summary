The 20-year-old was raped at about 22:15 on 24 March in a wooded area close to Castle Gate near the South Lanarkshire town's railway station.
Police interviewed people in the area between 21:00 and 23:00 on Tuesday in an attempt to gain further information.
Officers said they identified possible new witnesses.
Det Insp Tom Carty, of the specialist crime division, said: "Last night's stop and interview operation was definitely a worthwhile exercise.
"Officers were able to speak to people in the area, identify potential new witnesses and acquire new information.
"I would continue to encourage anyone who has information about this incident to contact police."
The victim was attacked from behind as she walked home from the railway station.
The suspect was described as being white, aged 30-50, and about 5ft 9in tall. He had red hair, red facial hair and was wearing dark clothing, including a hood.
Police said previously they wanted to trace a man walking his dog in Main Street at about 21:30, a couple walking in nearby Castle Avenue and a man seen running in Kylepark Avenue at about 22:40.
Det Insp Carty said officers were "doing everything we can to find the culprit".
