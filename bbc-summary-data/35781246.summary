An audit is due into the financial practices of the Shane Warne Foundation amid claims only a small proportion of funds was spent on intended projects.
Warne fired back at critics when asked about the upcoming audit, repeating claims his charity had nothing to hide.
"You can all get stuffed if you want to have a go at us for it but we are very, very proud," he told The Project.
"It is really disappointing that people want to come after some good people that have raised a lot of money and made a serious difference to seriously underprivileged children."
He also posted to Twitter after his appearance: "Tip, if u want people back don't be inappropriate, arrogant or smug."
Warne was recently eliminated from the Australian version of the reality television show I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!
During his time on the show, which is based in the South African jungle, Warne was bitten on the face by a python and forced to hold a tarantula.
He is expected to face further questioning over his charity when he returns home from South Africa.
