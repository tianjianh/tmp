[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man behind a "callous" cold-call scam which defrauded hundreds of people and resulted in an annual turnover of £7m has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Rivers was head of Derby-based Wyvern Media group, which pressured firms into buying worthless adverts.
Nottingham Crown Court heard he admitted fraudulent trading after more than 500 complaints were lodged.
He was jailed for six years. Four other members of staff were jailed, with a further five given suspended sentences.
The court heard the company had 12 offices throughout the Midlands and south-west of England and at one point employed 250 people.
Rivers, 55, of Coleshill, Warwickshire, was described by Judge Stuart Rafferty as the "head, heart and soul" of the company, which had about 18,000 customers per year and an estimated annual turnover of £7m.
Trading standards officers found small firms were targeted by Wyvern with high-pressure sales techniques and multiple calls.
Once paid for, the adverts would only appear in low circulation publications put out by the media company itself.
Businesses were sometimes billed for unsolicited extra adverts.
The highest amount lost by one firm was £31,305.
Mark Hughes, from Nottinghamshire Trading Standards, said: "You would see what we call 'feeding frenzies', where they would pass details of a company around the group which would then be targeted for more advertising.
"This group were quite callous if someone made a complaint - they would threaten those individuals with legal action and, indeed, would take individuals to county court to recover the money they thought they were owed."
One victim was Jutta Patterson, whose animal rescue centre lost more than £5,000 and almost closed.
She died of cancer in 2015.
Her husband Terry said: "She couldn't sleep at night, she started smoking more and didn't eat properly... I think it affected her a lot."
