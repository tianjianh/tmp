Singapore lifts ban on 240 publications

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Singapore's conservative government has lifted a ban on 240 publications, ranging from communist material to adult content.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newly allowed books include the erotic English novel Fanny Hill, first published in 1748, and The Long March, a Chinese communist text.
But several adult magazines remain banned, as do publications by the Jehovah's Witnesses Church.
The government said the development reflected changes in society.
The Media Development Authority said it "routinely reviews prior classification decisions, in order to ensure that they keep pace with societal norms", the Strait Times reported.
Some of the publications that were unbanned were out of print while others were considered acceptable under today's content standards, it said.
Publications in Singapore are banned under the Undesirable Publications Act, which restricts the distribution and possession of publications considered contrary to public interest.
Works by the Jehovah's Witnesses Church were banned in 1972 on the grounds the church objects to compulsory military service and the singing of national anthems.
