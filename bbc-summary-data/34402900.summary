A charity has called for urgent action to address Southampton's increasing and above-average number of "preventable" diabetes-related amputations.

Diabetes UK has criticised Southampton City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and called for a specialist 24-hour footcare referral service.
The charity has also created a display of 148 shoes representing the number of amputations over the past three years.
In a statement the CCG acknowledged it needs to improve its amputation rate.
The average number of diabetes-related amputations in Southampton has risen from 3.8 per thousand people in 2009 to 4.3 between 2011 and 2014.
This is above the national average of 2.6 per thousand people and is the seventh highest rate in England.
Diabetes UK said an estimated 80% of amputations could be prevented by increasing awareness and improving access to structured care.
Jill Steaton, from Diabetes UK, said Southampton's amputation rate showed "no signs of slowing down" and there had also been a delay setting up a planned referral service.
She added: "We are continuing to see too many people losing their feet and limbs when better healthcare could have prevented this from happening."
Gerry Buxton, 60, from Eastleigh, had both his legs amputated 13 years ago because of diabetes-related ulcers and has donated his shoes to the Diabetes UK display.
He said: "I support anything that brings the issue forward to the general public."
Shoes were also donated by other amputees and by celebrities, such as X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke and TV presenter Fred Dinenage.
A Southampton City CCG spokesperson said it was working with Diabetes UK and the health service to address the issue.
People can view the display outside the Bargate Centre, a closed-down shopping complex in Southampton city centre.
