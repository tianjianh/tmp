[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southampton 0-0 Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool remain top of the Premier League despite failing to score for only the third time this season in their goalless draw against Southampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool forward Sadio Mane twice went close to opening the scoring on his return to St Mary's before the break, only to be denied by a superb Fraser Forster save and Virgil van Dijk's last-ditch block.
Brazilian duo Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino missed good chances when clear on goal, while another former Saint, Nathaniel Clyne, headed wide late on.
Perhaps affected by the international break, Liverpool lacked the fluency that has characterised their impressive start to the season.
However, they were also met with a resolute Southampton defence.
The hosts had chances of their own, with Charlie Austin heading Cedric Soares' cross wide, but defeat would have been harsh on Liverpool who remain ahead of second-placed Manchester City by virtue of scoring more goals.
This fixture has gained added interest in recent years, with Liverpool spending almost £100m on buying some of Southampton's best players.
Croatia centre-back Lovren, who cost the Reds £20m when he moved from the South Coast, is one of those players and he enjoyed a relatively comfortable afternoon.
Right-back Clyne was a constant threat on the overlap, only to spurn the chance to punish his former side by heading substitute Daniel Sturridge's cross well wide on 80 minutes.
Lively Senegal forward Mane came close to ensuring a triumphant return for the Saints' old boys but his curling first-time effort from Georginio Wijnaldum's pass was tipped over brilliantly by Forster.
The impressive Van Dijk also made a crucial block before Mane faded after the break.
It was perhaps Adam Lallana - the former Saint who was not on the pitch - whose absence was most keenly felt by Liverpool.
The in-form midfielder was injured on England duty during the week and Liverpool lacked the cohesion he brings to their prolific attacking triumvirate.
Southampton kept their opponents quiet in the first half, despite the previous three meetings between the two sides producing 14 goals.
Liverpool only burst into life following Mane's two chances at the end of the first 45, and that marked the start of a flurry of Liverpool chances after the break.
Coutinho took an unusually laboured touch when clear through to allow Jose Fonte to recover, before the Brazilian turned provider with a deft throughball to Firmino, only for his compatriot to poke wide when unmarked 10 yards out.
Liverpool, however, will be pleased to secure only their second clean sheet of the season against a Saints side who did not register a single shot on target.
Despite breaking Liverpool's own winning streak of four games, a point means Saints are now without a win in four Premier League games.
The Dutch defender had one nervy moment, appearing to pull Firmino's shirt on the edge of the area to prevent the Brazilian going through, but referee Mark Clattenburg quickly waved away Liverpool's protests.
Otherwise he was excellent, making a key block on former team-mate Mane and ensuring his fellow defenders were never overwhelmed by Liverpool's attacking talents.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: "We could have won the game, but in the end I am happy with performance. It was an away game at Southampton and a good performance - with a clean sheet.
"Usually you lose in game like this, because body language is such you end up doing something different and giving one chance away and they score.
"When you are ready for work then you deserve the minimum of a draw. Not the best day in our life, but for sure not the worst.
"It is tight at the top but not only for us. That is good. All teams are the same. This league is tough and we are here because of this and we like it."
Southampton boss Claude Puel: "I think it was a good performance today. We played against a very good team with good players.
"It was difficult to play against them because they work very well with a lot of the ball. So it was important to keep discipline to get a point.
"We have 15 international players and it is difficult to work without these players during the break. However, what we showed was a good spirit, attitude and discipline. We tried to play good football but it was difficult against this team."
