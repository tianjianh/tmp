One of the biggest clubs in Birmingham has had its licence revoked.

Gatecrasher, on Broad Street, had its licence suspended after a knife attack in the club and an alleged fight with doormen on 31 October.
West Midlands Police called for the licence to be revoked, citing previous violent incidents.
The police case was not contested by the club's owner. Birmingham City Council's licensing sub-committee unanimously agreed to the revocation.
The future of the venue, which can hold 2,400 people, has not been confirmed by its owner.
A council statement said police officers had "absolutely no confidence" in the ability of current premises licence holder Simon Raine to operate the club.
"It was explained that Mr Raine had conceded that he must dispose himself on any interest in the premises, and that what was required was an entirely independent third party operator that had no connection with him," it said.
"In the event of any successful sale, it was acknowledged that the third party could apply to transfer the licence and seek to reach agreement for the continued operation of the premises licence."
Mr Raine said "a lack of trust on both sides" between Gatecrasher and West Midlands Police made the continued operation of the club unworkable, adding he hoped police investigations into the disorder would lead to further action.
"I have no intention of fighting with West Midlands Police or the city council," he said.
"A harmonious working relationship is required in order to operate successfully in the late-night economy, especially working with a venue of this size and stature in a multicultural city that Birmingham is."
