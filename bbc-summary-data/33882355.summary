[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents of children due to go to a summer camp whose director has been charged with possession of indecent images have been offered refunds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
LL Camps in Bushey, Hertfordshire, was closed by Ofsted last week and director Ben Lewis has been charged with possessing indecent images of children.
Following the closure, parents vented their anger on the firm's Facebook page at the initial lack of information.
But camp co-founder Tal Landsman has now said refunds will be issued.
Ofsted closed the camp on 6 August and the company's website was taken down soon after.
One parent whose child was due to attend the US-style day camp wrote it was an "utter disgrace".
Another was concerned about parents who "could not afford alternative care without the refund".
A man whose children had gone to the camp told the BBC: "Fortunately, for us they were only going for one further day, and then they were going to a different camp.
"Had it been the situation that they were due to be there this week and all of next week, we'd be in a bit of bother."
But on Wednesday, Mr Landsman confirmed parents would be able to fill in a refund form which has been placed on a holding page on the company's official website.
Mr Lewis and Mr Landsman opened the holiday club in 2010.
