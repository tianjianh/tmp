[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of the Wales Green Party has resigned from the post.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alice Hooker-Stroud took the helm of the party in December 2015.  She will be replaced by deputy leader Grenville Ham.
Ms Hooker-Stroud said that the lack of funding for smaller parties in the UK meant it was "untenable" for her to carry on in the voluntary role.
She said: "Parties that have a lot of money can do a lot, and those who have a smaller amount can do less."
Ms Hooker-Stroud, who will step down from the job at the end of March, said that because the party does not take funds from large businesses means members have the "biggest say".
"But it has contributed to my role being effectively a voluntary one, which for me has sadly become untenable," she said.
"The financing of political parties in general needs urgent reform so that politicians aren't just the mouthpieces for big business, and so that alternative voices are heard."
Mr Ham runs a not-for-profit engineering company and is a former Welsh Assembly election candidate.
He is standing in this May's council elections in Brecon.
