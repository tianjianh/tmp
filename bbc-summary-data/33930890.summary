The blast was at Adams Food on Sunnyhills Road in Leek at about 08:20 BST, said Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service.
The man was discharged after treated at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.
Powder explosions are caused by a high concentration of powdered combustible material in the air coming into contact with a heat source.
Examples of dusts in the food industry which could could be linked to explosions included flour, custard powder, instant coffee, sugar, dried milk, potato powder and soup powder, said the Health and Safety Executive.
A spokesman for Adams Food said: "There was an incident at our production facility in Leek this morning.
"A member of staff working on the production line received minor injuries. Emergency services were called and the incident is now fully under control with all other production lines operating as normal."
