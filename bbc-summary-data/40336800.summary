Talks to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing institutions are continuing, with just nine days left before the government's deadline.

To focus minds, the government gave the parties a discussion paper setting out key areas for agreement.
They were given until lunchtime on Tuesday to respond to the draft paper.
It includes changes to the petition of concern, equality and respect around the Irish language, Ulster Scots and an armed forces covenant.
It also suggests a public consultation on plans to deal with the legacy of the Troubles, and details ways of making Northern Ireland's government more accountable. Details of the paper were published by journalist Brian Rowan.
Shadow secretary of state Owen Smith has said the government still has to convince the Stormont parties it will be impartial in the talks.
"I've not yet had that reassurance from [secretary of state] James Brokenshire or heard it from the other parties," said Mr Smith.
"In the conversations I had with parties last week when I took on the post, they were still concerned that it would be difficult for the British government to illustrate impartiality and I still think they've got a job of work to do persuade people of that."
Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing executive since March and without a first and deputy first minister since January.
The institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin about a botched green energy scheme.
The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, stood down, in a move that triggered a snap election.
The parties have until 29 June to reach agreement and have been warned that if they cannot, direct rule could follow.
The deadline was set by Secretary of State James Brokenshire.
Speaking at a press conference at midday on Tuesday, Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly said it was Sinn Féin's intention to re-establish the institutions but that "that has to be on the basis of integrity and respect and a number of outstanding issues."
"This is about implementation of previous talks," he added.
He said that the continuing talks between the DUP and the Conservatives in London "could have an impact" on the talks at Stormont.
"Of course, what happens in Britain, and the DUP are hitching their wagon to the Tory government, will have on impact on what's happening here, we just don't know what it is yet," he said.
Mr Kelly also made it clear that Sinn Féin was not prepared to drop its demand that DUP leader Arlene Foster cannot become first minister while the inquiry into the RHI scandal continues.
Meanwhile, the DUP will resume negotiations with the Conservative Party in London on supporting a Tory minority government.
The party has been locked in negotiations with the Tories for more than week but it is still not clear when they might sign off on a deal.
It was thought an agreement might be reached before the Queen's Speech on Wednesday, but the parties have refused to be drawn on a timeframe.
