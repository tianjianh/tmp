A personal trainer in Leeds has lost his freelance job at a gym after pasting a huge sticker of a bound and gagged woman onto the back of his pick-up truck.

James Hellewell used the hashtag #Rapetruck but claimed it was all "a joke".
But after complaints to West Yorkshire Police he was told to remove it.
He agreed to take it down and tweeted that he didn't mean to cause offence.
Total Fitness, where James Hellewell was a personal trainer, says it has ended all association with him.
In a statement West Yorkshire Police told Newsbeat: "It was clear that a number of people had found the image offensive and had been alarmed and distressed by it being displayed in public."
The sticker caused a massive debate online.
"There's a lot of people who seem to be applauding or amused by #rapetruck What is wrong with people? Rape is not funny" says @NikkiBakes.
Others on Twitter called it "great banter".
James Hellewell says it was his mum posing in the photo and was only ever meant to be a joke.
Feminist campaign group Vagenda's Twitter feed said: "I'd like to direct any man who has told me rape culture doesn't exist to just go and have a look and a read of that."
