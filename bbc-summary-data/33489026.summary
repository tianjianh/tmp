Kezia Dugdale has secured the majority of supporting nominations in her bid to become Scottish Labour leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Dugdale received 90% of the support from constituency Labour parties who nominated a candidate.
She is also backed by 80% of the local councillors who nominated a leadership candidate, and 10 trade union and affiliate groups.
She is standing against Ken Macintosh in the contest to replace Jim Murphy.
MSP Richard Baker has secured the most constituency Labour party nominations in the contest for deputy leader.
Ms Dugdale, a Lothians MSP, is supported by 30 of her fellow parliamentarians, while Mr Macintosh, currently the party's social justice spokesman, is backed by seven and the Scottish Co-Op group.
He has 10% of the support from constituency Labour parties, and 20% of the support from councillors.
Following the close of supporting nominations, Ms Dugdale said: "To have the support of the overwhelming number of local party members, councillors and trade unions is an honour.
"I take nothing for granted and will work hard to change this support into votes when the ballot opens a week on Monday.
"The support I have received so far shows I am winning the argument amongst party members, but the real task is to win back people across the country."
Mr Macintosh has previously said he offers "a change in direction" for the Scottish Labour party.
He said: "I want to break up the party machine and put the members and supporters in charge of this party."
Mr Baker secured 20 constituency Labour Party nominations, compared with 18 for rival deputy leader candidate MSP Alex Rowley and 11 for Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson.
Mr Baker said: "I'm grateful to members across the country who have put their trust in me through constituency nominations.
"My platform is clear: I want us to be a strong, united party in next year's election, with policy formed by members across Scotland."
