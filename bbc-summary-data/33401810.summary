At least five worshippers were killed in Sunday's attack as they were entering the church in Potiskum in the north-east of the country.
The Islamist extremists of Boko Haram have carried out a six-year campaign of violence in Nigeria's northeast.
The recent attacks have brought condemnation from Nigeria's president.
Muhammadu Buhari, speaking on Friday, described as a "heinous atrocity" the latest wave of violence.
The recent attacks include:
Sunday's attack was carried out at the Redeemed Christian Church of God on the outskirts of Potiskum in Yobe state.
Witnesses and the police told AFP news agency that the pastor, a woman and her two children were among those killed.
Boko Haram took control of a large area of north-eastern Nigeria last year and declared a caliphate (a state governed in accordance with Islamic law).
However, Nigeria's military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, has recaptured most of the territory.
In an effort to counter the growing violence, Nigeria is leading a military effort with neighbouring countries. Mr Buhari called for the regional military force to be deployed more rapidly.
According to Amnesty International, at least 17,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since 2009, when Boko Haram launched its violent uprising to try to impose militant Islamist rule.
Will new military HQ make a difference?
Why Boko Haram remains a threat
The group is still holding many women, girls and children captive, including 219 schoolgirls it kidnapped from a school in Chibok in April last year.
