[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronnie Moore celebrated his first home game as Eastleigh manager in style with a win at home to Solihull Moors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neither side was able to take the initiative before the break. Omari Sterling-James ventured forward and drilled against the base of a post for the Moors and that was the closest either side came.
Ryan Cresswell broke the deadlock early in the second half when he advanced to head in an inswinging corner.
Another defender, Reda Johnson, soon made it two as he connected with a long Michael Green throw and dispatched past Nathan Vaughan.
The comfortable win saw Moore end his new club's four-match losing streak with a fully deserved clean sheet.
