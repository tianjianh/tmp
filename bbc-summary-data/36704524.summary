Based on the hit movies that starred Danny Glover as a veteran police officer and Mel Gibson as his volatile new partner, the TV show stars Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford.
The first film came out in 1987 and had three sequels over 11 years.
The TV series will air on the Fox channel in the US in September. The UK screening date has not yet been given.
Set in modern day Los Angeles, ITV said the show marked "the return of acquired content to the primetime schedule" of the channel.
"It's rare that we find an acquisition with that sweet spot potential - the best production values and hugely entertaining drama, that we think can appeal to the biggest and broadest audiences and take up a place in ITV primetime," said Kevin Lygo, director of television for ITV.
Sasha Breslau, who bought the show for ITV, said it was a "superb" reboot, "with the perfect mix of action, heart, humour and terrific chemistry" between Wayans and Crawford.
"I'm thrilled and excited to see the show take its place alongside ITV's popular homegrown dramas," she said.
It was announced in October 2015 that a version of Lethal Weapon would be coming to TV.
Other classic films including Rush Hour, Uncle Buck, Training Day and Minority Report are also being remade for television.
Wayans starred in My Wife and Kids and Crawford appeared in the show Rectify.
