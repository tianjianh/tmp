Hundreds of potential victims have come forward with information on a convicted paedophile who abused children at a London independent school.

US national William Vahey, 64, taught history and geography at Southbank International School in London from 2009 until 2013.
Since his death last month it has emerged he preyed on dozens of boys.
The investigation is being led by the FBI, with help from the Metropolitan Police.
The teacher, who is also believed to have abused children at other schools around the world, killed himself two days after police in the US filed a warrant to search a computer drive belonging to him containing pornographic images of at least 90 boys aged from 12 to 14, who appeared to be drugged and unconscious.
The FBI revealed it has been "contacted by several hundred individuals from around the globe wishing either to reach out as potential victims or provide information in the ongoing investigation".
Images of between 50 and 60 students at Southbank were found on the computer drive, with the school's chairman of governors, Sir Chris Woodhead, saying he had been left sickened by the revelations which emerged in April.
Many parents at the school have said they do not want to be informed of any details relating to possible offences against their children.
On April 22 officers executed a search warrant at Vahey's address in north London, where officers recovered a laptop and 11 memory sticks.
Vahey was convicted over a child sex offence in California in 1969 but appears to have failed to sign the sexual offenders' register, which allowed him to slip through the net and go on to work in several schools around the world.
He was found dead in Luverne, Minnesota, on 21 March.
