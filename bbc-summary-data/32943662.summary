Residents awoke at about 07:00 to find the unexpected visitors outside their homes.
More than a dozen animals are understood to have escaped a nearby field and made their way along Redmires Road in the Crosspool area.
South Yorkshire Police said it received a call but residents and local farmers had rounded up the wandering bovines.
Baffled residents took to social media to express their shock at the unusual scene.
Steve Ned tweeted: "Cows on the loose in Crosspool - it's the end of days!"
While confused Tom Stayte, who snapped a number of pictures of the scene, said: "More pictures of the cow weirdness in Crosspool."
