[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda Myles, 34, of Swansea, used her silver Peugeot 406 as an "awful" weapon, Swansea Crown Court heard.
One victim was carried 50m (160ft) on the bonnet before being catapulted on to a verge and knocked unconscious.
Myles was convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, charges she denied.
The court heard the incident on June 25, 2014, happened after Myles accused Stacey Stokes and Jamie Huxtable of being involved in the theft of a child's motorcycle.
Later the same day the pair were walking along Mansel Road in Bonymaen when Myles drove her car on to the pavement and hit them from behind.
Mr Huxtable was severely bruised and Miss Stokes was left unconscious.
Judge Peter Heywood said Myles had used her car as an "awful" weapon and it was "miraculous" neither victim suffered broken bones or serious injuries.
Myles drove off after the attack but was later caught by police.
After her arrest she admitted owning a silver Peugeot 406 but claimed she sold it to two men on the day of the incident.
As well as her jail term, Myles was banned from driving for two years.
