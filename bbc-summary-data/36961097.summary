Ayr United 1-2 Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen safely made it through to the last 16 of the Betfred Cup with victory over Ayr United at Somerset Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons were ahead early when Ayr's Darryl Meggat turned Wes Burns' cross into his own net, and Niall McGinn made it two.
But after Adam Rooney hit a post Alan Forrest pounced on a loose ball to pull one back.
Wes Burns hit the crossbar twice and Andrew Considine put a shot wide as the Dons struggled to put the game to bed.
After early exits in both Cup competitions last season, this was a welcome result for Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes on the long trek down to Ayrshire.
It did not take long for Aberdeen to get themselves in front. It was good play from Burns on the wing, and his ball was aimed towards the ever dangerous  Rooney, but it was the unfortunate Meggat who got the final touch to put the ball past his own goalkeeper.
But Ayr could have been level straight away when Forrest raced away from Anthony O'Connor, but Dons goalkeeper Joe Lewis denied him.
However, the home side were struggling to make inroads against the Scottish Premiership team and McGinn made it 2-0 when he volleyed in Shay Logan's cross.
Rooney headed off a post before Burns fired a shot just wide as Aberdeen refused to take their foot off the pedal.
But against the run of play Ayr pulled one back when Forrest pounced on a scramble in the box and turned the ball in.
Burns, on loan from Bristol City, has been given his chance with the loss of Jonny Hayes to injury, and he was keen to make an impression.
He twice hit the bar in the second half; first after a 30 yard run through the Ayr rearguard, and the second after cutting inside and finding the woodwork.
But as the game wore on Aberdeen were finding it increasingly difficult to create chances and find the killer third goal, and Jamie Adams was not too far away from turning in Brian Gilmour's corner as Ayr sensed an equaliser.
Then when Andrew Considine was robbed in possession after a poor pass from Dons goalkeeper Lewis, Nicky Devlin raced forward but blasted his shot well wide.
In the end it was comfortable enough for Aberdeen to make it through to the third round.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "The first half we were so much in control of the game you would have thought it would be a bit more comfortable for us, but it just shows you you're never there in the Cup until the final whistle goes.
"Ayr deserve so much credit; not just their spirit but their confidence and belief to go and get something from the game. I thought they were excellent. As was the referee, I need to say that. There was a couple of penalty appeals that they have, the two boys have thrown themselves, but he dealt with them well.
"It was our third trip in six days. The players have been constantly travelling, it's a big physical demand."
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "We lost a daft goal early and that really settled Aberdeen. I couldn't hand on heart say Aberdeen didn't deserve to win but we had two or chances and a very decent chance for a penalty kick, in fact I thought it was a stonewall penalty kick.
"I've kept faith with the vast majority of the players that got us (promoted) so they've got to enjoy it, but if they play like that they'll do fine.
"He (Gary Harkins) would be a good player for us. We'll see what happens."
