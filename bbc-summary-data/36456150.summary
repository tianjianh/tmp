Coastguards found the woman, who has dementia, on Sunday morning after a three-hour search of the Penzance area.
Lyn Hughes, manager of Tolverth House in Longrock, said "all procedures were followed" and the woman "escaped through a fire exit".
The care home has been rated as requiring improvement in its safety by the Care Quality Commission.
Ms Hughes said: "The patient escaped through a fire exit which had recently been fitted with new locks. All procedures were followed.
"She was checked every hour [by law residents must be checked every two hours] and once staff realised she was missing the authorities were alerted."
Penzance, St Ives and Lands End coastguard rescue teams joined the police and the Penlee RNLI lifeboats and a coastguard rescue helicopter in searching several miles of coast.
Andy Cattrell, senior coastal operations officer, said: "We and the police were very concerned. She was 90 years of age, a vulnerable patient of a local care home. With someone that age, she needed finding."
