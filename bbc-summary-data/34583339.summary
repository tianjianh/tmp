Swansea City have apologised for screening a replay of a tackle by Stoke City's Jack Butland in their 1-0 Premier League loss on Monday.

The goalkeeper slid out studs first to challenge Swansea forward Andre Ayew.
The incident was replayed on the Liberty Stadium big screen and provoked an angry reaction from home fans.
Swansea could face a charge as Premier League rules state "the screen shall not be used to show action replays of negative or controversial incidents".
England keeper Butland escaped punishment from referee Robert Madley for his 17th-minute challenge outside the area, having initially played the ball straight to Ayew.
But Stoke manager Mark Hughes was unhappy with the incident being shown on the big screen.
"I didn't appreciate the incident being shown on the videos around the stadium. I thought that was unnecessary," the former Wales boss said.
"I wouldn't like to think it was deliberate, because when those situations happen it causes a reaction in the crowd and we had to deal with that."
A Swansea spokesperson said the replay was because of "human error". The club have made a verbal apology and will now put that in writing.
