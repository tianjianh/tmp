Leon Barrett-Hazle, 36, was knifed several times during the fatal attack on the 11A service in Handsworth, Birmingham, on Monday.
Kieran Gillespie, 25, of Wellesbourne Road, Handsworth, is due to appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Friday, West Midlands Police said.
Mr Barrett-Hazle's family said they were "devastated" by his death.
In a tribute, they described him as "wonderful, warm, kind, generous of heart and much-loved".
"Words cannot express the immense grief and pain we are suffering, but memories of your infectious smile and happy-go-lucky style will help fill the massive void in our lives," they said.
Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses.
