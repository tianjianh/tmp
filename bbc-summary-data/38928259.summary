The local history group in Llanfair Clydogau, near Lampeter, has secured Â£9,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
"It is quite rare for a community like ours not to have a memorial but this funding will help us put things right," said Alan Leech from Hanes Llanfair.
Members are searching national and local archives for the project.
