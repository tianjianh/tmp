The National League club's ground is undergoing refurbishments this summer.
The Hive, home of Barnet, hosted Arsenal for the 2017 Spring Series as a new pitch was laid at Meadow Park.
"We're delighted to continue our long-standing relationship and pleased to contribute to these improvements," said Arsenal club secretary David Miles.
Boreham Wood chairman Danny Hunter told his club's website: "This long-term partnership and a grant from the Premier League, through the FSIF (Football Stadia Improvement Fund), have helped us to undertake an incredible range of Premier League-type ground improvements."
Meanwhile, former WSL 1 champions Arsenal have given a new deal to Netherlands international goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal.
The 27-year-old, who joined the Gunners in 2015, has agreed an undisclosed-length contract with Pedro Martinez Losa's side.
