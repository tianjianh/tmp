"The overt sexualisation of women on TV is an issue for me. I find that really hateful," she told Radio Times.
The actress added: "If you do show that on screen, then at least give a nod to it being really inappropriate and cruel; that it is not humane."
Norris, 49, is to appear in the Cold Feet reunion series later this year.
The actress described herself as a "feminist", saying there was still progress to be made in the depiction of women on TV, but that it was not an issue you could protect children from.
"Although we've moved forward in some areas, I think we've regressed in a lot of others," she said.
Speaking about her son and daughter, she added: "I think you can help educate them to deal with it, so I just keep talking to both my children."
She also revealed she did not initially think the Cold Feet reunion was a good idea, and when she was asked if she liked the prospect of going back to the show, she said; "I didn't, to be honest.
"It was really good, of its time, and I didn't want to undo anything positive that we had created back then.
"But I was persuaded it would be interesting to see how they have been dealing with things."
ITV's hugely successful show, which was originally broadcast from 1997 - 2003, followed the ups and downs of three 30-something couples, and made household names of the cast.
It was not initially well received by critics but became a firm favourite with viewers, with more than 10 million people tuning into the final episode in the UK.
