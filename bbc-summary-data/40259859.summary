The 27-year-old former Aberdeen and Chievo player joined the Gulls in February and has made 14 appearances.
He also scored both goals in 2-0 win on the final day against North Ferriby to guarantee the club's survival.
"He did a great job for us under pressure last season, whilst playing slightly out of position," said boss Kevin Nicholson.
