[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Bridge-Simmons and Tyrone Platt, both 20 and of no fixed address, were given six year sentences for false imprisonment and robbery.
They lured their victim to a house in Home Farm Close, Northampton, locked him up and punched him, before walking him to a cash machine to withdraw Â£300.
Northampton Crown Court was told the victim's car was also stolen.
Bridge-Simmons pleaded guilty to aggravated theft of a car and was disqualified from driving for two years.
He and Platt were also convicted of actual bodily harm.
The pair met their victim using Grindr in July.
The court was told when he arrived at their meeting place he was shown around the house and taken to a bedroom where he was repeatedly kicked and punched.
Platt took him to the cash machine and on their return, the victim discovered Bridge-Simmons had stolen his car and crashed it into a Mini Cooper, causing it to crash into another house.
The victim was told to go home and report his car stolen, but instead he went to a police station to describe what had happened, the jury was told.
Det Cathy O'Connor from Northamptonshire Police praised his bravery in reporting the "premeditated and perverse crime".
