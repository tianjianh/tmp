Derry's Shiels defends 'England's reserves jokes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The manager of Derry City Football Club says remarks he made criticising Irish international footballers were "jokes".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenny Shiels described Republic of Ireland players as "England reserves" and Northern Ireland players as "England reserves' reserves."
The Candystripes boss maintained that he had made the remarks to journalists "in jest" after a football match.
Irish International James McClean denounced Mr Shiels' remarks as "ridiculous".
After a 3-1 defeat away to Dundalk in the League of Ireland Premier Division, Shiels told members of the press that International football "is not what it used to be."
"There's no pride in it anymore because you could have a pint of Guinness and play for Ireland," he said.
"There are Italians and Scottish people playing for Ireland," he said.
"When you look at the people who can go and play.
The Republic of Ireland are England reserves and Northern Ireland are England's reserves' reserves.
"It's diabolical. I've no time for it all."
James McClean was one of a number of players, including Darron Gibson and Shane Duffy, who declared for the Republic of Ireland despite representing Northern Ireland at a younger level.
He played for the Candystripes for a number of years before making a big-money move to Sunderland in 2011.
McClean told the Derry Journal: "What right or what credentials does Kenny Shiels hold to make such ridiculous comments on international football?"
"For me, playing in the Aviva Stadium in Dublin in front of thousands of people and wearing that green jersey means so much to me and my team-mates.
"I feel very proud and very fortunate to have been given an opportunity to wear that jersey. I do everything in my power to give 100% when wearing it.
"So how dare Kenny Shiels make such ridiculous comments when he knows very little about playing international football?"
Kenny Shiels, whose son Dean has been capped 14 times by Northern Ireland, told the Belfast Telegraph his comments had been taken out of context.
"I was having a joke with reporters from Dublin and Dundalk and that's all it was - a bit of banter; something said purely in jest a couple of months ago," he said.
"We were winding each other up and McClean knows that."
