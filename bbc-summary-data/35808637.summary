Almost £2m is to be used to help thousands of young people in Northern Ireland to develop a love of nature.

The cash will be used to provide environmental projects linked to schools and youth groups.
They are being co-ordinated by the Ulster Wildlife and Belfast Hills Partnership groups using lottery cash.
About 15,000 children and young adults aged between 11 and 24 will be encouraged to participate over the next five years.
Ballymacaward Primary School near Lisburn, County Antrim, has been involved in one such project.
The school's pupils have raised several hundred juvenile salmon in their class in recent months.
They have just released the fish into the Colin River in west Belfast in the hope that they will eventually return there to spawn.
School principal Brendan Sadlier said the class had enjoyed the project and it had brought the curriculum to life.
Jennifer Fulton, Ulster Wildlife's chief executive, said: "Helping young people experience nature and make a difference to their environment is a big part of our work.
"They are the leaders of tomorrow and their interest and involvement will help secure a better future for our wildlife and special places."
Ulster Wildlife will deliver their projects through Young Farmers clubs, the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme and special schools.
The Belfast Hills Partnership will work with thousands of people a year through schools and youth organisations on issues like pollution, wildlife and the archaeology of the area.
