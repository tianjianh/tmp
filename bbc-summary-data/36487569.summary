New firefighting recruits to start work in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sixteen new recruits will be joining the fire and rescue service in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows concerns last year over staffing levels in the region, which meant some appliances in the north east of Scotland could not be used.
The thirteen men and three women have spent the past 14 weeks training at the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service College in Portlethen.
They will now be deployed to stations throughout Aberdeen.
