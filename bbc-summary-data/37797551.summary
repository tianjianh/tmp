United beat Crystal Palace at Wembley in May to win their first silverware since 2013.
However, the club released a team photo in which only the Community Shield - new manager Jose Mourinho's first success in the role - on display.
The FA Cup Twitter account posted a downcast emoji in response.
The FA Cup trophy was not the only thing missing from United's 2016-17 group shot.
German World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger, 32, who has been training away from the first team despite having a contract until the summer of 2018, was also absent.
Schweinsteiger retired from Germany duty in July.
