[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were on a 10-match losing streak in the league coming into the match but went in front after 25 minutes when James Vaughan headed down for Scott Burgess to net with a well-struck volley from just inside the box.
Rovers had already squandered two clear chances before Rory Gaffney netted a 32nd-minute equaliser, shooting home at the second attempt when Bury failed to clear a Lee Brown cross.
Another centre from the left in first-half stoppage time, this time from Charlie Colkett, was spilled by Bury keeper Ben Williams, allowing Taylor to slot the hosts in front.
Ollie Clarke's low drive from 20 yards made it 3-1 after 61 minutes, but Bury hit back with substitute George Miller shooting home when Rovers failed to clear a 75th-minute free-kick.
Peter Hartley restored Rovers two-goal lead with a shot following an 82nd-minute corner and Bury's misery was compounded two minutes from time when Neil Danns received a straight red card for an off-the-ball incident.
