Giving evidence for the prosecution, Sharon Port said she felt "sick" with worry when he told her about the body.
Port, 41, is accused of murdering four young men with lethal doses of drugs after luring them to his flat.
He denies 29 charges including four counts of murder, as well as drugging, rape and sexual assault.
Ms Port, 44, told jurors her brother called on 27 August 2014,  around the time of the death of Slovakian Gabriel Kovari, Mr Port's alleged second murder victim.
She said her brother did not want to tell her what was wrong at first.
Eventually, she said, Mr Port told her a man was in his bed after staying the night, but he could not wake him up.
"He just said there was a body in his flat and I just told him to go to the police straight away. I was in a bit of a shock," she said.
"They had taken drugs but I didn't know what," Ms Port said.
She told jurors: "I was sick about it. It's not the sort of thing you hear every day. I was very worried. I wanted him to drop everything and go to the station then ring me when he got out and tell me what happened."
Ms Port said she was so concerned that she began driving to her brother's flat in Barking, east London, from her home in Clacton-on-Sea.
While she was en route, Mr Port called to say he had been bailed by police, the court heard.
When she went to his flat, he appeared "stressed and tired", she said.
The following March, when Mr Port was jailed for perverting the course of justice, he told his sister the man who died was called Anthony and he was from Lithuania, the court heard.
Mr Kovari's body was found by a dog walker in a churchyard near Mr Port's home on 28 August 2014.
Mr Port is also accused of killing Anthony Walgate, 23, originally from Hull, Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend, Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham, east London.
