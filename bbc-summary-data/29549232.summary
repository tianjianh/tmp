China's media watchdog says that stars who have used drugs or visited prostitutes will be banned from state television and other media outlets.

The ban is meant to keep the industry healthy, reported China Daily.
The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said recent cases had set a bad example for the country's youth.
A series of celebrities including Jackie Chan's son have been arrested on drug charges this year.
The Chinese government said celebrities who break the law should not be invited to appear in programmes, and transmission of their works should be suspended.
The ban also covers online media, film and publishing.
Jaycee Chan, along with Taiwanese actor Kai Ko, were detained in August after police found they tested positive for marijuana. More than 100 grams of the drug were found in Mr Chan's home.
Another actor, Gao Hu, was detained the same month for possession of marijuana and methamphetamines.
Film director Wan Quan'an and actor Huang Haibo were also arrested on suspicion of hiring prostitutes.
Following the statement's release, productions which starred Huang, Gao and others were dropped from broadcast, reported state news agency Xinhua.
A spokesman from the China Radio and Television Association was quoted as saying: "Their actions have hurt the entire industry and have brought extremely bad and adverse consequences to the whole society, therefore we strongly condemn their actions."
The BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says all the cases received widespread coverage on social media, and can be seen as part of a wider government crackdown on excess within the elite.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been on an anti-corruption drive since he took office in 2012.
In February, the public security ministry ordered national police to get tough on drugs, gambling and prostitution.
