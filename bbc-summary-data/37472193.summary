English Heritage has organised the trek on horseback and foot from York to East Sussex to mark the 950th anniversary of the famous clash.
The volunteers will arrive on the battlefield 950 years to the day since Harold fought William of Normandy.
Nigel Amos, leader of the march for English Heritage, said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity".
King Harold defeated a Viking army at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, on 25 September, 1066, before travelling south to face the Normans.
On 14 October, he fought and was killed at the Battle of Hastings.
William then seized the English throne.
Emily Sewell, head of events for English Heritage, said 1066 and the Battle of Hastings was "one of the most famous battles and most transformative years in English history".
Nigel Amos, who is leading the march on behalf of English Heritage, added: "There's nothing like a personal experience to understand what it was like and offer an even more authentic window on that world to inspire and inform others."
