Low budget Elvis runs solo Martlesham Marathon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who did not get a place in the London Marathon last weekend has decided to run the same distance around his village green dressed as Elvis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Goldsmith, 41, said: "I wanted to leave it for a week to let London take the attention it deserves."
Mr Goldsmith will attempt to run 17 laps of a circuit around Martlesham Heath near Ipswich on Sunday.
He will be raising money for the St Elizabeth Hospice where both his parents spent their final weeks.
Mr Goldsmith, who grew up in Martlesham and now lives in neighbouring Little Bealings, does a "low budget" Elvis impersonation under the name Harry Isaac Presley.
In 2010, he raised money by holding a three-day Elvis singing marathon at a pub in Ufford.
He will be the only one attempting to complete the full, unofficial run which he has billed as the "world's dullest marathon".
"Not because Martlesham Heath is dull, but because it's going to be gruelling and repetitive, but at least it finishes at a pub.
"The hospice is a safe and supportive place when you know your loved ones are at the ends of their lives and I've tried raising money for it ever since my parents Dave and Jo died in 2009 and 2014 respectively."
Mr Goldsmith's solo marathon is due to start at the Douglas Bader pub at 12:00 BST and the route takes in the village green and Eagle Way.
He has successfully got a place at two London marathons before but, by his own admission, he "capitulated" during mile 16 on both occasions and had to complete each race by walking.
