Watson and Kontinen had 14 chances to break their opponents in the opening set of their match, finally converting one in the ninth game of the first set.
The second set was a tighter affair. Again, the 2016 champions had several opportunities to break, but wasted them before coming unstuck in the tie-break.
However, they took full advantage of their chances in the decider when they broke in the fourth game before going on to secure a second successive appearance in the final.
