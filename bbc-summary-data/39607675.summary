What happens when travel is disrupted by stag and hen parties?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 20 people on stag parties were removed from a plane at Manchester Airport on Friday. We asked BBC News website readers for their experiences of being stuck with rowdy passengers...

Robert Fort, Yorkshire Dales
"My wife and I took a Friday evening Jet2 flight from Leeds to Majorca a couple of years ago.
"Two separate hen parties of women aged 30 and 40 brought alcohol on board and reduced stewardesses to tears.
"They were drinking champagne out of the bottle and being drunk, noisy and abusive.
"One elderly lady passenger next to my wife was visibly distressed.
"I was set to jump up and have a word but my wife said she would talk to to them as we decided it may inflame the situation if I had approached them.
"They did eventually calm down because several of them fell asleep."
David Butterfield, York
"On a flight to Tenerife from Manchester a group of about 15 young men in their late 20s to mid 30s were already drunk before the gates were opened for boarding.
"One of the men thought it would be fun to stand in the aisle and rocking my wife's seat.
"I got up to ask them to stop and was accused of starting a fight.
"In the end the stewardesses who seemed used to this kind of behaviour did their very best to keep them under control.
"The flight was full and no-one wanted to swap seats unsurprisingly.
"Unfortunately it seems many people get drunk before getting on the flight and once on the plane the drinking continues.
"The raucous din was unbelievable and menacing. It was a most uncomfortable flight."
Peter Llewellyn, Clitheroe, Lancashire
"I was on a flight to Alicante with Ryanair from Leeds Bradford last year and the plane was disrupted prior to take off by a stag group and a separate hen party.
"Both groups were drinking heavily very early in the morning at the airport on very cheap alcohol.
"Police came on board and spoke to the groups but no individuals were taken off.
"During the whole flight, the stags were disruptive and refused to listen to cabin crew.
"The ridiculous aspect was that both groups were served with more alcohol in the air even though some had already been sick on the plane.
"We all want to enjoy a holiday but the amount and availability of cheaply priced beer, spirits and shots at airport bars is not helping the situations highlighted."
