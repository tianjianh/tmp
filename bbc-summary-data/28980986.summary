Last year's critically acclaimed Chichester Festival production will transfer to the Duke of York's Theatre in October.
The cast will feature Adrian Edmondson, alongside Miles Jupp, Neil Morrissey and Robert Webb.
The play tells the story of four businessmen on a team-building exercise that goes wrong.
Set in the Lake District, they find themselves battling the elements - and each other - as the farcical adventure unfolds.
The production will be directed by the Chichester Festival's Angus Jackson.
First staged in the West End at the Apollo Theatre in 1994, Neville's Island was nominated for an Olivier Award the following year.
Written by Tim Firth, it was later adapted for television in a production featuring Timothy Spall and Martin Clunes.
