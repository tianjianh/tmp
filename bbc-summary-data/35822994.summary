[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mobile phone operator EE is to create 138 new jobs at its call centre in Merthyr Tydfil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm will hold a recruitment fair for customer service and sales staff, who would start work between March and September.
More than 750 people already work at its Rhyd-y-Car Business Park site.
Merthyr Tydfil MP Gerald Jones said the jobs would give people in an area with one of Wales' lowest employment rates a foot on the career ladder.
