Devon and Cornwall police officers tasked with call centre work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police and community support officers are being taken off patrol in Devon and Cornwall to deal with a backlog of call centre work, the BBC has learnt.

About 50 officers have been diverted to process reports of crimes filed on the internet and by email.
The force said "the significant majority were on restricted duties".
But the BBC has been told some were neighbourhood patrol officers and communities were "noticing fewer police on the beat".

Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Hogg said earlier this year the 101 service was currently not fit for purpose and had got worse.
Devon and Cornwall Police has since encouraged people to use email or an online form to report crimes to cut delays calling the 101 non-urgent number, which has been criticised for long delays.
In a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said: "In response to the 101 delays, the force moved around 50 people including officers, PCSOs and other staff to assist the contact centre.
"The significant majority of these were on restricted duties therefore were unable to undertake front line duties or their usual job role.
"The team have been recording crime information, to release our call handlers to answer 101 and 999 calls.
"This is a short term position and we expect all the staff to be returned to their original roles by Christmas."
