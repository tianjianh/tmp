Paramedics were called after the baby boy reportedly stopped breathing at a house in Birchfield Road, Walton, on 2 September.
Two men, aged 34 and 29, were arrested on suspicion of wounding, and a 25-year-old woman was held on suspicion of inflicting GBH, Merseyside Police said.
The baby remains in hospital after suffering head, arm and rib injuries.
His condition is described as serious but stable, police said.
The three suspects - who were previously arrested on suspicion of assault - have been released on bail.
