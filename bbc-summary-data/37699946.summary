Ade Azeez headed against the crossbar before nodding Thistle in front from Abdul Osman's cross.
Azeez drew a save from Scott Bain shortly after the break but then set up Kris Doolan to score following Kevin Holt's mistake.
The Jags lost keeper Ryan Scully and Osman to injury late on after both were injured defending a corner.
Dundee's first-half problems stemmed from an impressive start for the visitors typified by a strong performance by Azeez.
The striker hit the woodwork, was perfectly tackled by Darren O'Dea in the act of shooting but was then well placed to angle a strong header across the Dundee goal and beyond the diving Bain for the striker's first goal in the Premiership this season.
There had been an air of inevitability about the goal and it added to the woes of the already impatient home support who took some solace from a more spirited end to the half by Dundee.
If Dundee had hoped that the new partnership between Marcus Haber, on his debut, and Rory Loy would spark quickly there was little evidence of that happening although the strikers could point to a lack of service.
Azeez and Doolan were combining for Thistle and Azeez should have done better when played through by his strike partner, his shot blocked by the advancing Bain.
Almost by way of apology for his poor finish, Azeez robbed the indecisive Holt deep inside Dundee's half and rolled into the path of Doolan to score easily.
Three points on the opening day of the Premiership season gave Dundee the perfect start and few would have suspected that their next 10 games would yield just three points.
With six consecutive defeats there is very little to comfort Dundee. The current run is reminiscent of the form that saw them relegated in season 2012-13 but with less than a third of the season gone they are still only a couple of wins away from moving back into the pack.
For Thistle it was their first win against Dundee in eight attempts but it came at a cost with Scully being led off the field in the final minutes and then taken to hospital with a suspected dislocated shoulder, having come into collision with Osman among others in a crowded box.
Osman also appeared to be in pain as he was replaced.
Thorsten Stuckmann got a brief debut in goal for the Jags and David Wilson also got on but the points were already safe for Alan Archibald's side, who move up to ninth.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "It was a real disappointing performance from us, it wasn't good enough and we didn't deserve anything from the game.
"We had a little spell in the first half for 15 minutes when I felt we were okay but overall the performance wasn't good enough.
"We have to look at a team for Saturday and try to pick the players up and try and get a result from somewhere. We are on a bad run, we are in a position where we are in trouble but we have to remain positive. We are not winning games and that cannot continue."
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "That is the performance we have been waiting for all season, getting it right at both ends tonight with both strikers scoring and getting a fantastic clean sheet as well.
"We are delighted for Azeez, he has worked ever so hard and most of the games he has had chances but he took his goal well tonight and also had an assist.
"We don't enjoy luck with goalkeepers, Ryan Scully has been taken to hospital with a suspected dislocated shoulder, fingers crossed he is okay but it doesn't look good."
