Kyle Ebecilio: Nottingham Forest terminate midfielder's loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Midfielder Kyle Ebecilio's loan with Nottingham Forest has been terminated and he will join Dutch side ADO Den Haag until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old, on loan from FC Twente, was due to stay for the season but will now join the Eredivisie side.
The former Arsenal trainee made five appearances for Forest but his stint was blighted by injury problems.
His departure would free up funds for boss Dougie Freedman to add to his squad on transfer-deadline day.
