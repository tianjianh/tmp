Bangladesh claimed an unwanted world record as they lost to New Zealand in the first Test in Wellington.

The visitors scored 595 in the first innings but were bowled out cheaply in the second before New Zealand chased down a 217-run target to win.
It meant Bangladesh broke a 123-year record for the highest total made by a losing side in a Test.
An unbeaten century from captain Kane Williamson and 60 from Ross Taylor led New Zealand to a seven-wicket victory.
Bangladesh had earlier been bowled out for 160-9 - captain Mushfiqur Rahim was taken to hospital for checks after being struck on the head by a bouncer and retired hurt.
Mushfiqur, who hit 159 in the first innings, had scored 13 in the second innings when he was hit on the helmet by a Tim Southee delivery.
New Zealand lost both openers before Williamson and Taylor's third-wicket stand of 163 secured victory.
"To bounce back and achieve that was brilliant," Williamson said.
Mushfiqur, who confirmed  he was fine after being struck on the helmet, added: "Probably we let ourselves down in the bowling department."
Australia previously held the record for the highest first-innings total by a losing side, with 586 against England in Sydney in 1894 before being beaten by 10 runs.
