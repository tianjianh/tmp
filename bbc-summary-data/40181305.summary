America's Cup 2017: New Zealand capsize in semi-final but lead 3-1

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand suffered a spectacular capsize in their America's Cup semi-final against Great Britain but took a 3-1 lead into the third day of racing.

Having lost the first race of the day, GB needed five wins from the last six races to turn the series around.
And at the start of the second race, New Zealand capsized as the catamaran fell forwards and left some of its crew suspended in the hull above the water.
All of their crew were accounted for and the GB boat was awarded the win.
New Zealand have a two-race lead over Ben Ainslie's Land Rover BAR team in the best-of-nine play-off series.
Racing continues on Wednesday and New Zealand could advance to the challenger final with victory in both races.
In high winds in Bermuda, the Kiwi boat rose rapidly on its hydrofoils and appeared to lose control before its bows plunged into the water and the boat flipped sideways.
The British boat was black-flagged and support crews began the process of righting the Kiwi catamaran.
"In 30 years of racing I've never seen anything like that," Ainslie told BT Sport.
"It's the first time we have sailed in this much wind. It's full-on and it's mind-blowing.
"Thankfully everyone is fine on the Kiwi boat and we will come back out and do it all again tomorrow."
In the other semi-final, Japan recorded two more race wins over Sweden to lead 3-1.
The first team in each semi-final to win five races progresses to the challenger final for a chance to take on the American team.
Defending champions USA advanced automatically to the America's Cup matches and they will have a one-point lead over their challengers after topping the qualifying group.
Great Britain began the day trailing 2-0 after suffering a broken wing on the first day of their semi-final against New Zealand.
The British boat were forced to retire from the first race, before forfeiting the second.
BBC Sport's Tony Husband in Bermuda
By any standard we've witnessed one of the most dramatic days in America's Cup history. This was racing right on the edge in treacherous conditions out on Bermuda's Great Sound.
For much of the year this North Atlantic island is a sun-drenched paradise, but the clouds darkened, the wind blew up a mighty storm and the best sailors in the world were pushed to the limits. And that's where mistakes can happen.
The capsize was dramatic. Experienced sailors pointed to the young Kiwi helm Pete Burling being out-smarted by Ben Ainslie ahead of the start, forcing the error which sent the boat tripping over itself and into the water. Fans in the grandstand could barely believe what they were seeing.
The Kiwis have been so dominant in this America's Cup, the mightiest of the Challengers suddenly stricken in the Sound.
It left Burling sitting at the helm 15 metres up in the air, no doubt wondering how bad the damage is and whether this competition has just witnessed a huge turning point, just when it looked like the British were at the point of no return.
