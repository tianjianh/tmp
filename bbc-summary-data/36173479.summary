More cuts will 'threaten National Library of Wales'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Further cuts would "threaten" the National Library of Wales' ability to deliver services, its new president has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhodri Glyn Thomas called on the next government of Wales to protect the institution and said politicians should "acknowledge that the library fulfils a unique role, which is irreplaceable".
The Aberystwyth facility had coped with nearly a decade of cuts, he said.
He stressed it now needed a new strategy and budget from government.
"The National Library plays a very important role in the life of the nation and must be given the resources to fulfil its responsibilities," he added.
