Exhall Colliery disaster: Tragedy, survival and heroism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One hundred years ago a fire started by a spilled oil lamp swept through a Warwickshire coal mine. The Exhall Colliery disaster of 21 September 1915 may have claimed the lives of 14 men, but with 375 having been working there at the time, it was also a story of remarkable escapes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tale of the Exhall Colliery disaster is one of tragedy for many, including a young father killed on his first day back at work after an illness.
Yet it is a story of extraordinary survival for a boy found alive under a pile of bodies and one of heroism for a man whose actions saved hundreds.
The legacies of those who lived and died 100 years ago continue through their descendants and the story is still as moving.
Miner Robert Tallis had been off work sick - but with a week's holiday fast approaching - he trudged back down the pit, near Bedworth, to earn money to support his wife and young daughters.
None of them could have known it was the last time they would see him alive.
A paraffin lamp overturned in the pit and 30-year-old Robert was one of 14 men who suffocated in the ensuing blaze.
Robert's daughters, five-month-old Florence and six-year-old Vera, were among 39 children who lost their fathers.
But 361 men trapped underground emerged from the darkness unharmed, all thanks to the quick-thinking actions of the overman, Israel Marshall.
Thoroughly rehearsed for such a calamity, Israel pulled a partition across the underground roadway to contain the smoke, giving the men vital time to fight their way out.
Survivor Fred Cole, 18, told a local newspaper: "We managed to get to the pit bottom and could see the smoke going through the doors in the return airways which had been kept closed.
"We couldn't get up the shaft as the ropes had been burnt away, so we were told to go through the old workings.
"We went through a few at a time, bent double in the pitch black."
Bert Pearson, described as a young lad, was also found alive - trapped beneath the fallen bodies of three miners.
The weight of his workmates collapsing on top of him had caused Bert lose consciousness - but it saved his life.
Stuck at the bottom of the pile, he was prevented from breathing in the deadly fumes.
As the air in the tunnels improved, Bert awoke to find he was trapped.
Rescuers recovering a body heard him call out and rushed him to safety.
But for the men who lost their lives that day, their memory lives on through their descendants.
Robert Tallis' great granddaughter Rebecca Littleford-Wilson honoured his legacy at the unveiling a ring of 14 trees in St Giles Meadow, Exhall.
She said: "My nana, Florence Priscilla, was only five months old when he died. However I grew up knowing all about the disaster and lived vicariously through her tales.
"I remember vividly her telling me how she wanted to hear what it sounded like to be able to call someone 'dad' and was promptly reprimanded by her friend, 'he's my dad, not your dad'.
"Her mum, Florence Elizabeth Tallis, who was 31 at the time, never remarried and lived until she was 91.
"I know that my nana would have found the commemoration a true honour, as do we all. Sadly she passed away in Bedworth 11 years ago.
"Robert and Florence had two girls and those two girls had just one daughter each: my Auntie Sheila and my mum Gill."
She said the family still had Robert's last wage packet of four sovereigns.

Mrs Littleford-Wilson said she had shed a "lot of tears" since digging deeper into the story of her great-grandfather.
"That's the funny thing about being into ancestry, these people all come alive," she said.
She discovered a family bible which showed Robert was a month off his 31st birthday when he died - not 33 as the list of the dead said.
Julie Foster, 58, is the great-granddaughter of James Sidwell, who died aged 31, but his story has not made it down through the generations.
She said: "He's in the book of the family tree and we have a photo of him. He was quite a handsome man. But I don't know anything else about him. I think the memorial is wonderful though - and I felt I had to be there.
"His great, great, great granddaughter will be born in two weeks - our son Mark is becoming a father for the first time."
