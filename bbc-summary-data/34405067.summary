These include hundreds of additional park and ride spaces, extra trains and a better queuing system at Cardiff Central station.
Supporters had complained about problems at the three matches staged at the city's Millennium Stadium so far.
Meanwhile, Cardiff Bus workers will go on strike for 48 hours from midnight Wednesday in a row over pay.
The industrial action by Unite members will take place for the Wales v Fiji match on Thursday and New Zealand v Georgia on Friday.
There are five more games scheduled for the Millennium Stadium in total.
Improvements for fans driving and catching the train have been agreed between tournament organisers and transport providers following feedback from fans.
These include around 1,000 additional park and ride spaces for each game.
On Thursday, there will also be seven supplementary trains on top of the 10 scheduled to Bristol Temple Meads, plus 100 shuttle buses to Bristol Parkway.
"The three matches that we have hosted so far in Cardiff have been a great success in a full and vibrant Millennium Stadium, but there have been a number of transport challenges," said England Rugby 2015 managing director Steve Brown.
"We want to ensure that fans have the best experience so we have listened to feedback and worked constructively and collaboratively with the key transport providers to agree a number of changes to the transport operation."
