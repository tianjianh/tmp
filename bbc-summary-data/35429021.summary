Lord of the Rings star launches Manx EU referendum petition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lord of the Rings star has launched a petition demanding the right to vote in the European Union referendum for those living in British Crown Dependencies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isle of Man resident John Rhys-Davies, 71, said the referendum was "one of the most important [and] constitutionally significant events in recent times".
He said he was "amazed no-one had raised the issue before" with the United Kingdom government.
The Welsh actor was allowed to raise the petition as a British citizen.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU by the end of 2017.
Mr Rhys-Davies, best known for his portrayal of Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, said: "Daily life in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey is affected by EU decision-making and a decision to leave or stay affects all islanders.
"Natural justice requires that islanders have a direct say in such a consequential referendum."
As Isle of Man resident for nearly 30 years he continued: "Even if I did not live on the island I would still champion this cause.
"The British people should all have a say - if any of us have a say."
He added: "I feel very strongly that people of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey should have their say in a referendum that could change all our lives for a generation.
"I'm just a bloke who is British and proud of it and I want a say."
The UK government will respond to the petition if it attracts 10,000 signatures. It will be considered for a Westminster debate if it receives 100,000.
