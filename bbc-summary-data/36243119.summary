Enthusiastic crowds strolled among the shops and cafes of the eight-lane avenue, which is normally choked with cars, trucks and motorbikes.
The car-free day is being repeated on the first Sunday of each month.
It is the brainchild of Mayor Anne Hidalgo and is designed to lower excessively high air pollution.
The first of the monthly pedestrian-only days was declared a convincing success by tourists and residents of the city who were able to enjoy the 2km long (1.2-mile) avenue leading to the Arc de Triomphe.
"It's magnificent," AFP news agency reported city resident Roger, 67, who lives just off the Champs-Elysees, as saying.
"All of Paris should be like this," he said.
Paris city authorities have taken various measures to reduce pollution levels, including rental bicycles, cycling paths and a fleet of electric cars.
