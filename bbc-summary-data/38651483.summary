Kerry has also added 15 new players to his roster.
England will host beaten Olympic finalists the Netherlands in June, before preparing for the Hockey World Cup in London in 2018.
"We have, I feel, a good depth of skilful, committed, smart, and athletic athletes who are eager to learn, develop and build on the legacy and momentum of the Rio Olympic cycle," said Kerry.
