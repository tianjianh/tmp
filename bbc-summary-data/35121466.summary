[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Black Watch soldier has been banned from the road for two years after driving the wrong way across the Tay Road Bridge at 120mph while drunk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Daniel McLean lost control of his car and hit the middle of a roundabout.
The 24-year-old from Dumfries is likely to be demoted from lance corporal to private as a result of the incident in June.
He was fined Â£300 and ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work.
The court was told that he crossed the 1.4mile (2.2km) bridge in 53 seconds, having driven at an average speed of 93mph.
A witness who was in the car said she saw the speed dial reach 120mph.
McLean's lawyer said he had taken the wrong slip road on to the bridge and decided to go as fast as possible to get across.
When he was breathalysed by police after crashing the Honda Civic he was driving, he gave a reading of 54mcg of alcohol. The limit is 22.
He admitted charges of drink-driving and dangerous driving at an earlier hearing.
