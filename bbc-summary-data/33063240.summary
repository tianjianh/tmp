Social worker 'lied about woman's threat to kill family'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A social worker falsely claimed a woman made threats to kill her children, a disciplinary panel has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda McCallum, who was employed by Derby City Council, told her manager the women made threats to kill herself, her family, and burn down her house.
The claims triggered an emergency order which resulted in the removal of the woman's children, officials said.
Ms McCallum was suspended for 12 months after a hearing before a panel of the Health and Care Professions Council.
This means she cannot be included on its register of approved social workers for the duration of the order.
Panel chair Nicola Bastin said: "The aggravating features in this case are the very real harm caused to [the woman] and her family.
"The registrant was an experienced social worker and did not take the opportunity given to her to correct or retract her false statement and nor has she demonstrated insight."
Ms McCallum was employed by the city council between March 2010 and October 2013 in the children and young people department, which is responsible for child protection support.
She was dismissed by the authority after a disciplinary hearing ruled that she had committed "gross misconduct".
Ms McCallum was neither present nor represented at the hearing before the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). It said it had attempted to contact Ms McCallum, who failed to respond. The HCPC said it was "in the public interest to proceed" without her.
