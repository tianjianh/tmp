[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stretch of the M4 around Newport was reopened six hours after it was shut to fix an overhead sign which came loose in high winds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was closed from junction 24 Coldra to 28 at Tredegar Park from 21:00 GMT on Friday to 03:40 on Saturday.
Officials said it led to very slow traffic as motorists were forced to come off the motorway.
A diversion using the A48 through Newport was put in place as emergency repairs were carried out.
