Hampshire director of cricket Giles White hopes fitness concerns will not hamper the county's white-ball prospects this season.

They start their One-Day Cup campaign with away matches against Kent and Essex in the south group.
Bowlers Fidel Edwards and Brad Wheal, as well as batsman Rilee Rossouw, are all nursing injuries for Hampshire.
"We're excited about the competition starting and we feel we've got a good side," White told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's about getting off to a good start and every side will feel the same," White added. "If you get a couple of wins early on, it sets you up for the competition and to qualify for the latter stages."
A second draw in their opening three County Championship games for Hampshire came on Monday when a double century from Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance denied them victory.
Seam bowler Wheal was off the field for the final day nursing a side strain while the Ageas Bowl pitch flattened out to allow the White Rose to steer themselves to safety.
Hampshire's unbeaten start to the season in four-day cricket has encouraged White.
"It would've been nice if we'd got over the line in one or two of those draws," he said. "If we hadn't lost bowlers in both of those games, maybe we'd have pushed for the wins.
"But, overall we have to be happy with where we are."
Hampshire begin their 50-over season at Canterbury on Thursday, 27 April before facing Essex at Chelmsford three days later.
