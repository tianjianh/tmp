'No need' to call off fatal SAS hike, Army medic tells inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was no need to call off an SAS selection exercise when a candidate suffered heat illness, an Army medic has told an inquest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three men died after overheating on the course on the "boiling hot" day in the Brecon Beacons in July 2013.
But the medic said a candidate, 2P, who suffered heat illness earlier in the day "recovered quite quickly".
L/Cpl Craig Roberts died on the course, L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby died in hospital.
All three men had overheated in temperatures of 27C (80.6F) on what was the hottest day of the year, near Pen Y Fan.
Jonathan Hall QC, representing the Ministry of Defence, asked the medic - known as 1H to protect his identity - whether the situation involving 2P was one where he thought the whole exercise should have been called off.
"I don't believe so, his observations were all OK," 1H replied.
"Apart from the confusion he recovered quite quickly, so I don't think the whole operation should have been stopped because of 2P.
"He (2P) said he recalled not knowing what his job was, but then he told me what he did for a living.
"I would say he recovered fully in about 10 minutes.
"He was able to take on water orallyâ€¦ I think we gave him a flapjack which helped with his sugars, all his observations were fine.
"We just cooled him down in the back of the ambulance and he was fine."
Soldier 2P told the inquest previously he was "a bit perturbed" by the way the checkpoints - designed to check on the welfare of candidates - were run.
2P said with hindsight, different clothing and more water stops may have improved conditions for candidates that day.
The inquest continues.
