US parcels delivery firm FedEx has reported a net loss of $895m (£568m) for the three months to the end of May, missing analysts' expectations.

Over the same period last year, the company made a profit of $780m.
The company blamed the strong US dollar and rising pension costs for weighing on its bottom line. These offset a modest rise in domestic package volumes of 2%.
Looking forward, the company said it expects improved results.
"We expect strong earnings growth in fiscal 2016 as we continue to focus on improving performance and successfully executing our profit improvement initiatives," said Alan Graf, FedEx's chief financial officer.
The company said its outlook does not include any costs associated with its purchase of its Dutch package delivery firm, TNT Express.
FedEx announced plans to buy its Dutch rival for €4.4bn ($4.8bn; £3.2bn) in April, as it looks to expand its European operations.
FedEx shares were down more than 3% in early trading in New York.
