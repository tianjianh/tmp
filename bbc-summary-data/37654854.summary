[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bordeaux-Begles scored three late tries to send Ulster crashing to defeat in their opening match of the European Champions Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ulster led for most of the match after Andrew Trimble's 21st-minute try.
But Sebastien Taofifenua battled over to edge the French club ahead eight minutes from the end.
Ulster conceded a penalty try, with Sean Reidy sin-binned for tackling a man without the ball, before winger Blair Connor got the third score.
The pressure will now be on Ulster to beat Exeter in their next Pool 5 fixture on Saturday as another defeat would effectively end their hopes to making the quarter-finals.
They were under considerable pressure in the early stages and trailed to an early Ian Madigan penalty.
But skipper Trimble found a great angle to take Ruan Pienaar's pass and charge through for the opening try midway through the first half.
Jackson converted and added a penalty to give Ulster a 10-3 interval advantage.
Madigan reduced the gap with a second penalty early in the second half and Lionel Beauxis and Jackson traded kicks to leave Ulster 13-9 up.
That is how it stayed until the 73rd minute when a home penalty into the corner set up a five-metre line-out and Taofifenua scored from the driving maul.
Bordeaux were then awarded a penalty try when Reidy's early tackle denied replacement scrum-half Baptiste Serin a score and Beauxis slotted the conversion.
At 21-13 down, Ulster declined a kick at goal when a penalty might have earned them a losing bonus point.
And, to rub salt in their wounds, Brisbane-born winger Connor broke away for the home side's third try seconds before the final whistle.
Ulster's Operations Director Bryn Cunningham: "I am stunned at the moment as at half-time I thought we were in the driving seat. We should have been more out of sight.
"The second half was noting short of atrocious. I am absolutely gobsmacked at how we played to be honest."
