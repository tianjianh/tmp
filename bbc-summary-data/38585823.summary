Afcon 2017: Algeria call up Arsenal teenager Bennacer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal teenager Ismael Bennacer has been drafted into Algeria's Africa Cup of Nations squad as a replacement for the injured Saphir Taider.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bologna's Taider was involved in a training ground collision and has been declared unfit to play in Gabon.
Midfielder Bennacer, 19, was born in France and played for Les Bleus at under-18 and under-19 levels.
He qualified for Algeria through his father, and was also eligible for Morocco, where his mother is from.
Bennacer was only cleared to play for Algeria in August and made his debut against Lesotho in September.
He is currently part of Arsenal's Premier League 2 squad and made his senior debut in a 3-0 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup in October 2015.
Algeria are in Group B alongside Tunisia, Senegal and Zimbabwe.
They open their campaign on Sunday against Zimbabwe in Franceville.
