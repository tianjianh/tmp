If you're still struggling for a quick and easy answer for your weekend, here are some last minute solutions.
Celebrities arguably have it harder than others.
Knowing that their costume is bound to end up doing the rounds on social media means a bed sheet ghost just isn't going to cut it. The results this year have been pretty impressive.
Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson made the most of having black and white face paint to hand.
Having given his followers a reminder of some of his previous efforts, the comedian tweeted a picture of this year's Wednesday Addams outfit.
The caption below the singer's picture of her costume, which seems to have been taken in a lift, describes her outfit as a "pegacorn".
Yes, that's Katy Perry dressed as a Cheeto.
The Arrow actor and model went for one of the night's most drastic transformations to dress up as Shrek's wife Princess Fiona.
Breaking Bad is bound to be a popular one this year but Guy Ritchie made a pretty convincing Walter White, with his son Rocco as Jessie Pinkman.
Never one to disappoint on Halloween, Simon Pegg went for a zombie vicar tweeting "Happy Halloween!!! Bless you my children."
Kim Kardashian spent the week in the run up to the night posting pictures of her own previous Halloween outfits before uploading a series of pictures of her daughter North West dressed as a skunk.
"My little stinker is waiting to show daddy [Kanye West] her costume," she wrote on Instagram.
