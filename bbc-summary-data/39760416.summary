[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town will play Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship play-offs after they lost against Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terriers goalkeeper Danny Ward saw red after just 20 minutes when he handled outside of the box.
Kenneth Zohore had put the Bluebirds ahead when he slotted past Ward, who will now face a suspension.
The visitors made their extra man count as Joe Bennett fired in from close range and then wrapped up the three points by scoring his second late on.
David Wagner's side had already secured a spot in the play-offs with victory against Wolves in April but will now face last year's finalists Wednesday after finishing the season in fifth.
Huddersfield will face Carlos Carvalhal's team at home in the first leg on on Sunday, 14 May at 12:00 BST.
Neil Warnock's Cardiff, who were 23rd when he was appointed in October as replacement for former manager Paul Trollope, end their season in 12th following the victory.
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:
"We were not switched onto the game and, even for me, it's not been easy to finish one competition and get ready for another.
"Now the competition that counts is in front of us. It's been a fantastic achievement but we will not go into the play-offs as favourites.
"We like the underdog role. Huddersfield Town are still in the race but we are humble as always."
Cardiff manager Neil Warnock:
"I have steadied the ship and I have not spent a penny yet. I have agreed a couple of fringe players but we are looking to sign three or four who can really help us.
"Now it's time for a rest because the players have worked their socks off. I want the players to enjoy it with me. We don't train every minute of the day but I want them to die for me when they get out on the pitch."
