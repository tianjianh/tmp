Wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor has been named in the England squad for the Women's World Cup this summer.

Taylor, 28, took an indefinite break from the game last year to deal with anxiety problems, but rejoined the England camp in April.
Captain Heather Knight is named in the squad despite suffering a fracture in her left foot earlier this month.
The tournament starts on 24 June, with hosts England facing India in the first match at Derby.
The inclusion of both Taylor and Knight, 26, is subject to their return to full fitness.
England coach Mark Robinson said:  "The return to the squad of Sarah Taylor shows how far she's come and we are hopeful both her and Heather Knight will be able to play a full part in the tournament.
"We are hugely excited about the potential of this squad."

Knight, who has captained England to victory in six series since taking over in June 2016, heads a young squad, with five players set to experience their first 50-over World Cup.
Alex Hartley, Beth Langston, Nat Sciver, Fran Wilson and Lauren Winfield make their debuts, while 2009 winners Katherine Brunt and Jenny Gunn will take part in their fourth World Cup.
However, there is no place for Amy Jones - Taylor's deputy behind the stumps during her international absence - while seamers Kate Cross and Natasha Farrant miss out, as does teenage spinner Sophie Ecclestone.
"It's such a dream to captain England in a World Cup on home soil; it's not something that many cricketers can say they've done and it's a real honour," said Knight.
"We're a young group but we've made massive strides over the past 12 months and everyone has worked so hard.
"We know it's going to be a tough tournament - and we won't go in as favourites - but backed by home support we'll do our best to challenge for the trophy."
Bristol, Derby, Leicester and Taunton host the group games before the final takes place at Lord's on 23 July.
England squad: Heather Knight (capt, Berkshire), Tammy Beaumont (wk, Kent), Katherine Brunt (Yorkshire), Georgia Elwiss (Sussex), Jenny Gunn (Warwickshire), Alex Hartley (Lancashire), Danielle Hazell (Yorkshire), Beth Langston (Yorkshire), Laura Marsh (Kent), Anya Shrubsole (Somerset), Nat Sciver (Surrey), Sarah Taylor (wk, Sussex), Fran Wilson (Middlesex), Lauren Winfield (Yorkshire), Danni Wyatt (Sussex).
