[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crown Estate control transferred to Scottish government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Powers over the revenue and management of Crown Estate resources in Scotland have been transferred formally to the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move was included in the 2016 Scotland Act, which gave a range of new powers to the Scottish Parliament.
It gives ministers at Holyrood control over thousands of hectares of rural land and about half of Scotland's foreshore.
Leasing the seabed for rights to renewable energy are also included.
The assets were worth a total of nearly Â£272m in 2015-16 and generated a gross annual revenue of Â£14m.
The Scottish government said the transfer would give communities a stronger voice over how those assets were managed.
Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "This is a historic day.
"The management and resources of the Crown Estate now rest with the people of Scotland and we have a genuine, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use them to change the fabric of Scottish society, placing the needs of local and coastal communities at the centre of our long-term planning for these considerable assets.
"From today, decisions about both the day-to-day management and the future of the estate will be taken in Scotland.
"This will have positive implications, not only for the many people who live, work or have some other direct connection with the Crown Estate, but for many communities across Scotland."
A new body, Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management), has taken on the role of managing the asset.
