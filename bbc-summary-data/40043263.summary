Storm were disbanded in 2002 after financial problems, but returned to the top flight in 2015 when they replaced Hull Stingrays after their liquidation.
The club finished ninth in their first season back and then eighth during the 2016-17 campaign.
"The club have made excellent strides inside the first two seasons," said storm general manager Neil Russell,
"I know that the new ownership is very determined to continue the excellent growth that we have shown."
