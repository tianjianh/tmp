Keith Poulton and retired GP Eddie Morris died when their aircraft ran off a runway at Enstone Airfield, near Chipping Norton, on 3 July last year.
An inquest in Oxford heard how the microlight crashed into a trailer full of sheet metal parked nearby.
Coroner Darren Salter said there should be clearer guidance on keeping such areas clear of obstructions.
Dr Morris, 62, from Witney, was piloting the aircraft and accountant Mr Poulton, 59, from Flecknoe, near Rugby, was his passenger.
The father-in-law of Dr Morris, John Osman, said both families had been "devastated" by the loss of the two men.
The inquest heard evidence from Thames Valley Police Sgt Philip Hampton who said he was surprised to find farm machinery parked so close to the operational airstrip.
In a statement he said: "This machinery represents a danger to the users of the runway just because of its location."
Recording a verdict of accident death, Mr Salter said he would write to the Air Accident Investigation Branch and ask for the rules about keeping airfield's clear to be tightened.
