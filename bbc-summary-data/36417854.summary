[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC maintained their two-point lead at the top of Super League with a home win over Widnes Vikings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull's sixth league victory in a row sets up an exciting contest at second-placed Warrington Wolves on 10 June.
They led 6-4 after a competitive first half, Carlos Tuimavave replying to Rhys Hanbury's early try for the Vikings.
Kirk Yeaman, Josh Bowden, Danny Houghton and Jamie Shaul all crossed for the hosts after the interval, with Chris Dean adding a Widnes consolation.
Shaul's score was the pick of Hull's efforts, racing from inside his own half to touch down.
Marc Sneyd kicked all five of his attempts at goal as Hull's excellent second-half display saw them to a comfortable success.
Widnes were the early pacesetters in Super League, hammering Hull 46-6 and topping the table in March.
However, a run of nine defeats in 10 league games has seen them slip to eighth spot and just three points above ninth-placed Hull KR.
Hull FC coach Lee Radford: "They've got an unbelievable amount of confidence in each other, to come back and clinch wins like they have.
"That's what was disappointing after the Widnes defeat last time around. People asked questions about our togetherness and that frustrated me.
"When you put a new side together like we have, you have to learn the hard way and you can see now that we have naturally progressed."
Widnes coach Denis Betts: "We came in at half-time 6-4 down, having had early chances, but we didn't get over the line.
"They were punching through the line, played with a lot of pace and we wasted a lot of energy in that first half. We got into their 20-metre zone once.
"I thought we had regrouped and talked about building pressure, but they're a quality side and showed why they are top of the league."
