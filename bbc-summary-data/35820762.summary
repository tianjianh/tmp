Nicole Sedgebeer, 22, from Milton Keynes, was shown to a 24-hour cafe by a man called Mark after failing to catch the train at Euston station.
She said she was "close to tears" when he took her to safety and back to the station the next day.
Her fundraising page has attracted more than 1,000 donations.
Ms Sedgebeer was left outside the station in central London at about 03:00 GMT on 4 March, with no phone battery and hours until her next train.
She said she was feeling "very vulnerable" when she was approached by Mark, who took her to an all-night cafe and promised to return to walk her back to Euston.
Though she doubted his word, he returned at 05:00 GMT to escort her to the station.
"Not only did he turn up, but he had to get a bus to come get me," she said. "Mark you are one special man."
Ms Sedgebeer set up a crowdfunding page to raise £1,000 to thank him but received more than 1,000 donations.
She is now working with charities on how the money can be used to "get [Mark] on his feet" and described her experience with him as the "most eye-opening event of my life".
