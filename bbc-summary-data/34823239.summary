Police have named a man who fell into the River Forth from the Clackmannanshire Bridge after officers tried to stop his van.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Wood, 21, from Sauchie, has been missing since the incident in the early hours of Friday.
Police said they were continuing to search in and around the river in an effort to trace him.
Ch Insp Irene Ralston said: "We are supporting his family who are extremely anxious to hear news of Dean.
"I would urge anyone who has any information that can assist to contact police immediately."
Dean is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of slim build with short brown hair. He was wearing a red hooded top, blue jeans and brown boots.
Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have had contact with Mr Wood during Thursday evening, and anyone who may have seen a Ford Transit van before the incident.
The incident occurred after officers in an armed response vehicle spotted a blue Transit van that was being driven with three wheels on the Clackmannanshire Bridge.
When they signalled to the driver to stop, he crashed the van into a barrier on the bridge.
He then got out and climbed over the bridge's safety railings before entering the River Forth.
In a statement, Mr Wood's family said: "We are all totally devastated by the events of Friday morning and along with friends and relatives are hoping and praying for news of Dean.
"Dean is a likeable good natured young man with a zest for life and a good sense of humour.
"We are thankful and reassured by the efforts of everyone involved in the search for Dean and the support we have received at this difficult time."
