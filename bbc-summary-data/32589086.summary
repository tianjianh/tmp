Ashley Broomhall's Ben Nevis trek will raise money for Cancer Research UK.
Mr Broomhall, a member of Star Wars costuming club the 501st UK Garrison, set himself the peak challenge after his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
He has already done a walk up the 1,335ft (407m) hill The Wrekin in Shropshire in his stormtrooper kit.
To further prepare for his 4,406ft (1,344m) hike to the summit of Ben Nevis, he also plans to walk to the top of 3,560ft (1,085m) Snowdon.
The UK Garrison was created in 2000. Its members attend events across the UK dressed in "movie accurate" costumes to raise money for charity.
The newest movie in the Star Wars franchise, whose best-known characters include Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and Chewbacca, is due to be released in cinemas in December.
