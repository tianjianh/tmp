Hull midfielder Robert Snodgrass says he would love to be considered as Scotland's next captain after Scott Brown quit international football.

The 28-year-old, who has won 17 caps, returned to the national squad in March after missing the entire Euro 2016 qualifying campaign through injury.
"It is a dream to play for your country first and foremost.  It is even bigger to try to captain the side," he said.
"I will throw my name in the hat, definitely. It is a massive honour."
Scotland manager Gordon Strachan will name his squad on Monday, 22 August, for the opening 2018 World Cup qualifier against Malta on Sunday, 4 September.
In-form Celtic trio Leigh Griffiths, Kieran Tierney and James Forrest are among the players likely to be recalled after Strachan left out players from the Scottish champions and Aberdeen for the end-of-season friendlies against  Italy and France.
West Brom midfielder Darren Fletcher, 32, took the captain's armband for those matches, and will also be in contention to retain the role for the forthcoming campaign.
Snodgrass admits Brown's decision to retire from international football, having won 50 caps over the past decade, came as a surprise.
"I didn't see it coming to be honest," he told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme. "Scott is still young, he is only 31, and he has so much to give in terms of his enthusiasm and character around the squad.
"He has been a terrific captain, he has been superb to work with and I wish him all the best with his club career and taking that forward."
Snodgrass, meanwhile, has played a key role in two successive victories for Hull City, the Premier League relegation favourites.
Tigers caretaker manager Mike Phelan has been relying on just 13 players after suffering a string of injuries - including to Scotland keeper Allan McGregor, who could be out until 2017 - and signing no players since their promotion in May.
"It was 11 and a substitute keeper, and now Shaun Maloney is fit again and Harry Maguire is getting fit, so we could get to 14, but that is it," Snodgrass joked.
"We just have to focus on each game and do the best we can at the moment with what we have.
"There is a good core of lads in the team who have all stuck together, and you don't want to let any of your team-mates down."
