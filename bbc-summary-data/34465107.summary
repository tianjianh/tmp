[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-soldier Mike Buss not guilty of Help for Heroes fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former soldier accused of defrauding an armed forces charity out of more than Â£23,000 has been found not guilty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Buss, 41, from Highworth, was cleared of theft and fraud by false representation relating to Help for Heroes at Swindon Crown Court.
The ex-serviceman said the case "wasted nearly two years of my life" as he had been "innocent from the start".
His fund-raising work included running for 24 hours on a treadmill, and completing 100 marathons in 100 days.
Between 2009 and 2011 the ex-Green Jacket raised about Â£40,000 meant for Help for Heroes by collecting donations and selling official merchandise, the court heard.
However, the charity said it only received monies totalling about Â£17,000 from him.
