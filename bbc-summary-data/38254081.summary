The female pug, thought to be three or four years old, was thrown from a car in Writtle, near Chelmsford, on Sunday.
Vets fear the tan-coloured dog, which they have named Crumble, may not survive.
The RSPCA said there are signs she had given birth to several litters and may have been discarded by a breeder. It is not known if she was paralysed before, or during, the incident.
RSPCA inspector Lucy Brennan said: "It isn't clear whether Crumble sustained these injuries during this horrific incident, or whether she had already suffered these injuries and those responsible were simply trying to get rid of her.
"As our extensive investigations into the unscrupulous, underground puppy trade have revealed, puppy farmers have little use for a breeding bitch when she can no longer produce puppies for them to sell."
Ms Brennan added: "If Crumble had come to the end of her puppy-bearing life then it may be that her cruel and callous owners have decided to discard her.
"Similarly, puppy dealers are looking to make as much money as possible from their stock so do not want to be faced with unexpected veterinary costs.
"If Crumble became injured or sick, then that would be another reason for them to get rid of her."
The RSPCA is appealing for anyone who may know where Crumble has come from or who may have seen her being thrown from the car to get in touch with the charity.
