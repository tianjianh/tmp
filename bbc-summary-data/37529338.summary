The entire shopping area from Regent Street to Piccadilly Circus was closed to all traffic for the NFL fan event.
The event, now in its fourth year, comes ahead of the clash between Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts at Wembley on Sunday.
A game will also be played at Twickenham for the first time.
Organisers have been drumming up interest in the game, since the first NFL International Series game in London during the 2007 season.
Fans met stars from both teams and saw special routines from both teams' cheerleaders, in addition to having a go at throwing and kicking at various interactive games set up for the event.
