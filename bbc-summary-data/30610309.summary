He leaves with Palace in the relegation zone after a 3-1 home defeat by Southampton on Boxing Day.
Assistant manager Keith Millen will be in charge for the trip to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.
It is understood Palace are looking to appoint a permanent successor as soon as possible.
A club statement read: "The club would like to put on record its thanks to Neil for all his hard work and energy over the past four months."
Phil McNulty, chief football writer: "Crystal Palace's decision to appoint Neil Warnock was always laced with risk - a manager arguably out of his time in Premier League terms and favouring an abrasive style best suited to the rigours of the Championship.
"And so it has proved, making his sacking an inevitability if Palace wanted to avoid the sort of relegation threat Tony Pulis saved them from so brilliantly last season.
"How Palace chairman Steve Parish must wish he could have come to some sort of agreement to keep Pulis - and how he must wish he could lure him back now. Sadly for Palace, this seems a non-starter."
Caretaker manager Keith Millen: "It is not a nice position to be in again, that's for sure. It was a surprise this morning when I arrived to get the call from the chairman to let me know the situation.
"I saw Neil this morning and we had a good chat before he went. It's a sad time and a very difficult one for all the staff because when he came in he kept us on as part of his backroom team. We are all disappointed but we have all got to move on quickly with this game coming up so soon."
Mark Bright, former Palace striker: "I had never heard Selhurst Park as quiet as it was yesterday. There seemed to be a lack of confidence. The manner of the defeat was really disappointing.
"[Palace chairman] Steve Parish will want to make a decision pretty quickly this time. He will want someone who can make an immediate impact. "
