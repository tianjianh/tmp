Together with the rising price of fuel and food, it is one reason why inflation could reach its highest level for two-and-a-half years when official figures are released later on Tuesday.
The City expects the UK's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to reach 1.9% in the year to January.
It has risen steadily from -0.1% in October 2015 to 1.6% in December 2016.
According to research by What Car? magazine, prices of cars sold in the UK have risen as a result of a fall in the value of sterling, as well as fewer discounts on offer.
It said the price of some larger people-carriers had gone up by as much as 12.3%, although some other luxury cars were actually cheaper.
In 2016, 86% of the cars sold in the UK were imported from abroad, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
The pound has fallen by about 10% against the euro since the end of June 2016, prompting some manufacturers to raise prices.
"We knew average prices were going up, but rather than a gradual rise, our research has shown that there has been a perfect storm of elements that has conspired to create a big bang in price hikes," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford.
Other factors that could push up CPI inflation include:
The Bank of England expects inflation to continue rising towards 2.8% in 2018, before falling back to 2.4% in three years' time.
