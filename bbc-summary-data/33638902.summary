[SN]TITLE[SN]
MP Richard Graham given six-month driving ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MP Richard Graham has been banned from driving for six months after admitting to a speeding offence in the Cotswolds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gloucester MP was caught driving at 90mph in a 70mph speed limit on the A417 near Cirencester in December 2014.
Mr Graham, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010, was also ordered to pay more than Â£650 in fines and costs.
The Conservative MP said he regretted committing the offence. He already had nine points on his licence at the time so faced automatic disqualification.
