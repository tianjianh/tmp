The Guernseyman is part of the new Ford Chip Ganassi team, with Priaulx hoping to better his third-place result he achieved in his class in 2011.
"We led it for most of the race in 2011 and lost it in the final hours, so I hope we can do one better than that," he told BBC Radio Guernsey.
"But this is a very tough and demanding race on the cars, drivers and teams."
Priaulx will be racing a Ford GT alongside fellow Britons Harry Tincknell and Marino Franchitti.
"It would go amongst the big wins for me," said Priaulx, who won three successive World Touring Car titles between 2005 and 2007.
"I won the Nurburgring 24 hours in 2005 and Sebring 12 hours in 2011, so this - along with Daytona - would be two big races for me.
"I've finished second in Daytona and third here, so there's still some unfinished business.
"To win Le Mans in the Ford GT would be a massive career step for me, so I'm very motivated about it.
"I've been told that I'm starting the race and, for me, that's a massive honour.
"Obviously that's a pretty crucial part of the race, to get under way a 24-hour programme with the huge commitment of Ford, to be given that privilege is a great honour and I'm looking forward to doing that on Saturday."
