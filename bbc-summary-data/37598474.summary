A man accused of having weapons relating to an ongoing loyalist feud in County Antrim has been remanded in custody for his own safety.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Paul Lowry, 33, of Glassillan Grove in Greenisland, County Antrim, was arrested in Carrickfergus in the early hours of Wednesday.
He was detained along with with four other men when police stopped a car on Castlemara Gardens at around 12.30 BST.
It followed a report that a man had been attacked in a Chinese takeaway.
On Saturday, a police officer told Belfast Magistrates Court he believed he could connect Mr Lowry to the offences.
When the car was searched, police uncovered crow bars, pick axe handles, a lock knife and a hammer.
The officer said police believe the weapons are related to a UDA feud in the area, which has been going on for a number of months.
The district judge refused a bail application on the basis that Mr Lowry might be at risk of harm from other people if he were released.
He was remanded in custody to appear again via videolink on 4 November.
