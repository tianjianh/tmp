[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan fast bowler Timm Van der Gugten says he is unlikely to be fit for the County Championship opener at Northamptonshire on 7 April.

The seamer suffered a shoulder injury while playing for the Netherlands against Hong Kong in the Intercontinental Cup in February.
Van der Gugten was expected to recover in time for the Northants match but admitted it was doubtful he would play.
"There is a little bit of doubt," Van der Gugten told BBC Radio Wales.
The paceman, who was born in New South Wales, claimed 82 wickets in all formats in his debut season and was named Glamorgan's 2016 player of the year.
The 25-year-old initially returned to Australia for treatment after his injury and arrived in Wales in March in preparation for the county season.
"I am touch and go for the first game but I should be ready for early in the season from the second game and the next rounds onwards," he added.
"It's not overly painful but it's just a little uncomfortable.
"It's my left shoulder so it should not affect me too much but it's just a little irritating."
Seamer Ruaidhri Smith has been ruled out for six weeks with an abdominal tear, while Will Bragg (back) and Graham Wagg (groin) are set to miss the final warm-up friendly against Nottinghamshire starting on 2 April in Cardiff.
South Africa fast bowler Marchant de Lange could still be signed in time for the opening competitive game at Northants.
