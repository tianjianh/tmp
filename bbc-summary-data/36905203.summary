The 34-year-old former Arsenal and Reading keeper made 129 appearances during four years with the Bees.
Barnet boss Martin Allen wanted Stack to be back-up to Jamie Stephens, while continuing to coach the other keepers at The Hive.
"Having been offered the chance to stay, I feel it is time for a new challenge," Stack posted on Twitter.
