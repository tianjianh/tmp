The Sherlock actor and Harry Potter star are among 11 non-academics who have accepted the appointments at Lady Margaret Hall.
Pet Shop Boys frontman Neil Tennant and film director Beeban Kidron have also accepted the fellowship role.
Visiting fellows are encouraged to attend debates and perform at the college in the three-year role.
College principal Alan Rusbridger said: "At a minimum we'd like them to drop in occasionally at college, eat with us and meet informally with a variety of the LMH community.
"We'd like them to do one thing a bit more structured: it could be a conversation or debate, a performance, a lecture or seminar, a form of outreach - or something we haven't thought of.
"We can imagine fascinating interactions or collaborations between them."
Other appointees include Thames Valley Police chief constable Francis Habgood, former children's laureate Malorie Blackman and high court judge Rabinder Singh.
