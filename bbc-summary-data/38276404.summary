Researchers from universities in Glasgow and Liverpool have reconstructed the face of Scotland's warrior king, Robert the Bruce.
Facial reconstruction software used images from a cast of a skull, found beneath Dunfermline Abbey, during excavation work nearly 200 years ago.
The teams at Glasgow University and Liverpool John Moores University believe this is the first accurate, digital reconstruction of the hero of Bannockburn.
Dr Martin Macgregor, from Glasgow University, says the image shows a "real sense of character in the face".
Galashiels has been recommended as the site for a permanent home for the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the Borders.
The Galashiels proposal would see the town's post office brought back into use, a former Poundstretcher demolished and a new building erected.
The council has been told that could deliver "a successful tourism and regeneration proposition".
Emoji flags for Scotland, England and Wales could be introduced to devices next year, the authority on computer text and characters has said.
A UK flag is already available on smartphones and other devices.
Unicode has recommended the flags are made available from 2017, but it will be up to manufacturers to add the new emojis to their keyboards.
It accepted the proposal to add the flags of the home nations and is seeking feedback ahead of the release.
Ian Cathro is the new head coach at Hearts FC and he's only 30. That makes him the youngest boss in the top flight of both English and Scottish football.
David Baird, who works in the academy as a coach at Hearts, told Newsbeat that he had been inspired by the appointment.
"As someone who is 28 years old, to see someone who is 30 as the first team manager gives you so much belief," says David.
"I've got aspirations to go as far as I can in the game and if someone like Ian Cathro's done it without any playing experience, then why can't I?"
A piglet was caught after being spotted running along the outside lane of the M90 in Fife.
The animal was spotted in a coned area by an HGV driver near Dunfermline, as it headed in the direction of the Forth Road Bridge.
The driver was able to keep the landrace pig safe until the Scottish SPCA arrived to rescue it.
The animal welfare charity said the pig was "clearly frightened" but was uninjured.
It is now recovering from last Thursday's motorway ordeal at the SSPCA's Inverness rescue centre.
Four special £5 notes, engraved with a tiny portrait of author Jane Austen, are being put into circulation and could be worth more than £20,000.
The first of four notes featuring art by specialist micro-engraver Graham Short was spent in Kelso in the Scottish Borders on Monday.
Three more notes will be spent in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this week.
Mr Short's last work, a portrait of the Queen on a pinhead, sold for £100,000.
