Black Mamba death prompts lethal batch warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a homeless man after smoking Black Mamba has sparked fears of a potentially lethal batch of the former "legal high".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man, believed to be in his 30s was pronounced dead at about 06:00 BST in Birmingham City Centre.
Two others, thought to have been with the man in Fletchers Walk, were also taken to hospital.
West Midlands Police warned users of the drug they were "putting their lives at risk".
Black Mamba mimics the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis.
Synthetic forms of the drug are more potent than its naturally-occurring counterpart, increasing the risk of harmful side effects.
These can include psychotic episodes, convulsions and organ failure.
Black Mamba was among a raft of so-called legal highs which were outlawed when the Psychoactive Substances Act came into effect last year.
