Shropshire Council halts filming at a public meeting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Democracy campaigners have criticised a council after being prevented from filming at a public meeting.

They said two cameras were confiscated, despite legislation introduced last year to allow recordings to be made.
A group of about 50 protesters attended the meeting in Shrewsbury on Thursday morning and claim they were told they would need prior permission to film.
Shropshire council said the cameras were confiscated due to "disruptive behaviour".
The Department for Communities and Local Government said rules were very clear, and prior permission was not required in order to record or photograph public meetings.
However, it recommended notifying councils and other bodies beforehand so "necessary arrangements" could be made.
Members of Ludlow Campaign for Fairness travelled to Shrewsbury to protest at a perceived lack of "transparency and accountability" in the Conservative-led authority's recent decision-making and budget cuts.
Campaigner Daniel McDowell questioned the council's legal right to confiscate recording equipment and said the ability to film mattered to the group "as a record of the effort we've put in to come here and try and influence things".
Emotions were running high and the council chamber inside Shirehall was packed.
The authority's Chief Executive Clive Wright told us inside the chamber it was against council rules to film anything unless prior permission had been granted.
One man shouted that it was rubbish and waved paper in the air which he had printed from the government's website. He said it clearly stated new laws allow the press and public to film inside council meetings.
Shropshire Council said anyone continuing to film would be asked to leave, unless recording for personal use. This seemed to resolve the matter and people assumed they could now record again - wrong - the ban stayed in place.
In a statement, the council said it was "happy" for members of the public to photograph and film at meetings, if they behave in "a calm and responsible manner".
"Unfortunately, due to disruptive behaviour by a small number of people at today's meeting it was necessary to confiscate their cameras for the duration of the meeting."
Current policy is that photographs and footage taken at meetings should be for personal use only, the council said, but this is being reviewed to "ensure that it is consistent with the national guidance".
Speaking before the meeting, council leader Keith Barrow said it had met with members of the campaign group several times.
He said he also "took issue" with claims IP&E, a private firm created by the council, was "secretive and undemocratic".
"The [2013] elections saw Conservative candidates returned to form a large majority in the council and therefore it is our job to enact upon the promises made in the manifesto - this is what the public expect of us," Mr Barrow said.
