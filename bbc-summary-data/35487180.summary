[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flood-hit cancer patient who feared he would die in a hotel has moved into a new home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Davison and his wife spent six weeks living at a Premier Inn after their home in Mytholmroyd was flooded on Boxing Day.
The couple were told it would be between six and nine months before they could return home.
But housing association Places for People said he was a priority and have found the couple a bungalow in Halifax.
Mr Davison said he and wife Wendy were happy to be in their new home.
"In the hotel I was eating biscuits and chocolate bars whereas [now] I can make toast or a sandwich," he said.
"You notice little things like that which mean so much, so it's great."
Storm Eva flooded more than 4,400 homes and businesses across Calderdale when the River Calder burst its banks.
Mr Davison was one of about 40 people who had to flee their homes on Elphaborough Close.
"God willing I'll be back [in Mytholmroyd] and can end my days there as we originally planned," he added.
