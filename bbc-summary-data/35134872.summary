[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eleven men from Bradford and Keighley convicted of child sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eleven men have been convicted of sex offences against an underage girl in West Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group, all from Bradford and Keighley, had denied assaulting the teenager between 2011 and 2012.
The jury heard the girl, aged 13 and 14 at the time, had been exploited and used for sex in various locations including an underground car park.
Three others were acquitted following a five-week trial at Bradford Crown Court.
The girl was described in court as leading a "chaotic existence" at the time and had been reported missing from home on more than 70 occasions over a two-year period.
The jury heard her meetings with the men had been arranged by "drug dealer" Arif Choudhury, who was not on trial.
The men had all denied the charges which related to the same girl apart from one charge of rape:
The group was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in February.
Speaking after the verdicts, Det Ch Insp Chris Walker, from West Yorkshire Police, paid tribute to the victim who had "shown great courage" in speaking up.
He added: "This has been a very challenging, complex and sensitive investigation.
"Child sexual exploitation is one of the most important challenges facing the police.
"It is totally unacceptable and it is the responsibility of all agencies, communities and individuals to identify those responsible and help bring them to justice."
Rohail Iqbal, 22, of Skipton Road, Beechcliffe, Keighley, Rohail Hussain, 18, of Hawk Street, Lawkholme, Keighley and a 17-year-old youth, were all cleared of rape by the jury.
