Coach Warren Gatland confirmed Wales' record cap holder has a "tight calf" after being injured in Wales' 19-10 victory over France in Cardiff.
"Gethin Jenkins' calf was quite tight before kick-off," said Gatland, who has Rob Evans as his number one loosehead.
"We'll wait and see if that keeps him out as it normally takes two to three weeks for him to recover from those."
Triple Grand Slam winner Jenkins could join Luke Charteris on the sidelines as the Racing Metro lock missed Friday's win over France because of a knee injury.
The British and Irish Lions front-rower won his 122nd Wales cap against the French but Gatland does have loosehead cover with Paul James and possibly versatile prop Aaron Jarvis.
Wales are seeking back-to-back wins over England at Twickenham for the first time since 1978.
