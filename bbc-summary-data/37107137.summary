Fifa proposes six-year ban for Kirsten Nematandani

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former South African Football Association president Kirsten Nematandani is facing a minimum six-year ban for alleged ethics violations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed ban arises from a Fifa investigation into the organisation of international friendlies in South Africa in 2010.
Former Zimbabwe FA executive Jonathan Musavengana and former Togo coach Banna Tchanile are facing life bans.
The pair are charged with alleged bribery and corruption violations.
Fifa's investigatory chamber of its Ethics Committee will now pass its findings to the panel's adjudicatory chamber.
It has also proposed Nematandani be fined at least $10,400 (Â£7,980).
In December 2012 Nematandani - then serving as Safa president - was suspended by Fifa who found "compelling evidence" that friendly internationals were fixed by Far East betting syndicates.
A Fifa investigation discovered that Safa was infiltrated by convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organisation.
Perumal organised referees for the games against Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala, the outcomes of which were found to have been pre-arranged to benefit an Asian betting syndicate.
In January 2013 Nematandani was reinstated as Safa president but not exonerated and he was replaced the following September after failing to earn a nomination in Safa elections, which were won by Danny Jordaan.
