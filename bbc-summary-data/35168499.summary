A woman who claimed she was raped twice by the same man in the same Edinburgh park, five months apart, has been jailed for two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shereen Mirza, 21, had denied between 15 May 2012 and 2 April 2013, falsely claiming she had been sexually attacked and raped in the King George V park.
The jury of 12 women and three men, however, found her guilty after a nine-day trial earlier this month.
She was sentenced at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Michael O'Grady told Mirza: "In many years in these courts in one capacity or another, I have come across the whole range of hateful, hideous and downright bizarre things that people do to each other and the world at large, but I doubt, however, in all that time that I have encountered a course of conduct so strange, so needless and so hard to fathom as yours.
"It is also a course of conduct that is selfish, devious and persistent to a truly remarkable degree."
During the allegations Mirza was a pupil at Edinburgh Academy.
Det Sgt Michael Leask, of Police Scotland, said the investigations into Mirza's claims of rape placed a huge strain on resources.
When she was called in to be charged and searched before being detained, the officers found a journal she had been keeping.
It contained names of rapists and sexual offenders from around Scotland with details of their crimes and sentences.
There were reports on the effects of marijuana and alcohol on sexual behaviour, and quotes such as "I will kill you".
