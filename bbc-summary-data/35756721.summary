Sussex University plan to build 2,000 student homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Student housing at the University of Sussex could more than treble as part of a Â£500m revamp of its Falmer campus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The university announced plans to increase the number of student beds from about 600 to more than 2,000 as part of a new campus village.
It said it wanted to house more students in university accommodation rather than private residential properties in Brighton and Hove.
Detailed plans are yet to be submitted to the city council.
Outline planning permission was granted last year.
The new student accommodation will replace outdated 1970s buildings with a mix of town houses and flats.
If approved, work will begin on the site in January with the first phase of accommodation ready in autumn 2018.
About 2,400 new permanent jobs could be created as a result of the campus redevelopment, the university added.
