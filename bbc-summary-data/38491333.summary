Albion Rovers won 2-1 in the North Lanarkshire derby, while Peterhead won 1-0 at Glebe Park to leave Stranraer second bottom of the table.
The Diamonds had given a debut to 20-year-old Scottish striker Jack McKay, who signed on loan from Leeds United.
But it was on-loan Hamilton Accies striker Steven Boyd whose brace won it.
Saturday's defeat of Livingston by East Fife had presented Airdrieonians and Brechin with an opportunity to narrow the gap at the top.
The 19-year-old Boyd fired the opener after 15 minutes at Excelsior Stadium, but Adam Brown's drive from outside the penalty box drew the sides level nine minutes later.
Boyd struck again in similar fashion, with Scott McBride again the creator, seconds before the break for his sixth goal of the season and Rovers held on for the win despite intense Diamonds pressure.
Rory McAllister's 13th goal of the season gave Peterhead a deserved win, heading into the top corner after 77 minutes of a game in which Brechin only managed one attempt on target.
Peterhead's first win in six games means Brechin remain a point behind Airdrieonians in third, with the Diamonds seven adrift of Livingston.
Jim McInally's side leapfrog Stranraer, who are now two points behind, with Albion remaining two points ahead of the north east side.
Meanwhile, Stranraer have signed 22-year-old Partick Thistle midfielder David Wilson on loan.
