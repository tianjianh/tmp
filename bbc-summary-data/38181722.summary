[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ice cream and burger vans could be banned from selling within 100m of a school under changes to rules in Denbighshire.

Mobile food sellers on beaches and streets would also have to move on from spots every 20 minutes or risk losing their licence.
Denbighshire council will consider the changes as it reviews its Street Trading Policy on Wednesday.
The Ice Cream Alliance said the proposed rules were "a nonsense".
A spokesman for the alliance, which represents more than 600 businesses in the UK, said: "Members of the public will get quite upset about it when it is a hot day and there is a big queue, they could be waiting and the time will run out and the van will have to move on.
"At the end of the day ice cream sellers are providing a service to the public, it is a service they are paying to provide, and then they are being thwarted in trying to make a living."
A document before the council says the policy - which applies to roads, footways and beaches - aims to prevent the obstruction of streets.
Under the rules all ice cream, hot food and sandwich vans would have to move at least 50 metres every 20 minutes, and would not be able to return to the same spot for four hours.
Food vans would also be barred from outside schools and colleges between 07:30 GMT and 18:00, but will be allowed with expressed permission from the school.
People who break the rules may have their licence suspended or revoked, and may face prosecution.
Denbighshire council has been asked to comment.
