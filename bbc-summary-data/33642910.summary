[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Cave, 15, was found injured on the underpass at Ovingdean Gap on 14 July and died later the same evening at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.
Opening the inquest, coroner's officer Thea Jones said his injuries were due to a fall from a height.
A full inquest will be held on 20 November at a venue to be confirmed.
Assistant deputy coroner Kate Palmer said statements would be read from people including the person who was with Arthur on the day he died.
The hearing was told emergency services were called at 17:55 BST to the underpass between Ovingdean and Rottingdean where Arthur was found by two passers-by.
He was pronounced dead at 18:56.
Investigations are continuing, but Sussex Police have said his death was not being treated as suspicious.
Lawyer Sean Horstead, who attended the hearing with Rachel Willis, Nick Cave's assistant, referred to reported difficulty emergency teams had in reaching Arthur.
He asked Ms Palmer whether a statement would be provided relating to that aspect of the case.
Neither Mr Cave, 57, nor his wife Susie attended the hearing.
The Australian musician and songwriter is best known as lead singer of the band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, an alternative rock group formed in Melbourne in 1983.
Last year Cave and his wife appeared alongside Arthur and his twin brother Earl in 20,000 Days On Earth, a film documenting a fictitious 24 hours in the singer's life.
Following Arthur's death, his parents released a short statement saying: "he was our beautiful, happy, loving boy."
Arthur had two other brothers, Luke and Jethro.
