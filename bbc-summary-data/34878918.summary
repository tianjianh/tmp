A new film features the first female ascent of one of Scotland's toughest climbing routes.

Natalie Berry, who is originally from Bearsden and now lives in Edinburgh, ascended Dalriada on The Cobbler in the Arrochar Alps.
It is graded as E7 6b, meaning its overall difficulty is classed as "extremely severe" and its hardest part requires a high degree of skill.
The film, Transition, will be premiered at the Kendal Mountain Festival.
Scottish production company, Hot Aches, followed Ms Berry over the course of a year as she moved from competitive indoor to traditional climbing.
Lochaber-based professional climber Dave Macleod acted as her mentor.
She attempted Dalriada last month while under the pressures of the film-makers' fast approaching deadline and expected arrival of winter weather.
Ms Berry, one of the UK's leading female climbers, had also sliced two of her fingers while preparing dinner and the injuries threatened her chances of completing the route.
