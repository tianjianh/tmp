The hats donated to Royal Derby Hospital help keep the babies warm in the crucial first days after birth and help staff and parents understand which level of care is right for each individual baby.
Jane Haslam, head of midwifery for Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "[It] is really important to make sure that babies are kept at the right temperature, as if they are too warm or too cold it could be a sign that they are developing an infection.
"This plan helps to make parents and staff aware of the signs indicating changes in temperature, and helps them to take action."
