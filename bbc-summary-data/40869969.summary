Champions League: Manchester City will not face punishment if fans boo anthem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City will not face punishment from Uefa this season if their fans boo the Champions League anthem after a change to regulations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club's fans have previously booed to express anger at European football's governing body over a number of issues.
Uefa opened disciplinary actions against City in October 2015, but decided against any sanctions.
The new 2017 disciplinary regulations contain no reference to causing a disturbance during competition anthems.
