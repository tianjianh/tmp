[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn would be "very welcome in Wales", the first minister has said.

Carwyn Jones made the comment at his monthly news conference when he was asked about the Islington North MP.
However, Mr Jones said it is too early to say if Mr Corbyn will be an asset in the 2016 assembly election campaign.
He stressed it would be a "Welsh election, Welsh policies, Welsh manifesto led by me".
Asked if Mr Corbyn would be an electoral asset, Mr Jones said: "Well, we don't know - with any leader, we have to wait and see what happens.
"What we do know is that he has created a huge amount of enthusiasm within the Labour Party itself. He is somebody who will no doubt outline and set out his stall in the (Labour Party) conference next week.
"I think the one thing that I've found with him is that he is a very honest politician, he is somebody who thinks very deeply about to improve society," Mr Jones added.
"That will be reflected, I hope, in the way the electorate sees him over time."
