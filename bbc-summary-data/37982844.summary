[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 2-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Alex Kiwomya and James Jones secured Crewe a much-needed win over a Morecambe side now without a win in six games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morecambe frontman Rhys Turner struck his first goal since his summer switch from Oldham as the Shrimpers led inside eight minutes at Gresty Road.
Crewe were caught out by a long ball down the middle, allowing Turner to thunder a 20-yard finish past Ben Garratt.
But Ryan Lowe set up a 19th-minute equaliser when Chris Dagnall connected with the Crewe captain's cross from the by-line, and Kiwomya was on hand to finish high into the net after Barry Roche had pushed the initial effort out.
Crewe were ahead three minutes before the break thanks to another excellent delivery from out wide, this time from the rampaging Ollie Turton, Jones diverting the ball into the far corner.
Peter Murphy should have levelled in the 59th minute, but the midfielder took too much time and placed his shot straight at Garratt.
Crewe had the edge in the attacking stakes to earn only their second win in 14 league and cup outings.
The margin of success could have been greater when Lowe picked out substitute Callum Saunders at the far post, only for the youngster to lift his finish over.
