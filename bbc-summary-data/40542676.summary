A long-range penalty from Owen Farrell snatched a late 12-12 draw for the Lions in an epic third Test at Eden Park in Auckland.
Fans watching the game at Rhiwbina Recreation Club had mixed emotions after the game.
But they lauded Lions captain Sam Warburton, who was a former player at the club.
After a hectic encounter in Saturday morning's final test, most supporters thought a draw was a fair result.
Gareth Edwards said: "I'm delighted we got the draw. To be perfectly honest, I thought New Zealand were a slightly better side on the day, showed a lot of heart, spirit and courage and just about deserved to sneak away with a draw.
"Whoever says the Lions is dead, absolute nonsense. This has got to live on forever."
Gareth Hill said: "It's mixed feelings really because you want to go over there and win.
"But for someone like Sam and Warren Gatland, who've been on two tours now and come home undefeated from both, I'm pleased not to have lost and disappointed not to have won.
"At the end of the day, it was a tremendous battle."
Alun Morgan felt the Lions should have taken their chances to seal the win.
"It was absolutely fantastic but [I'm] a bit disappointed really, I thought we could have taken that series," he said.
"There was a little bit too much box kicking for my liking but two fantastic teams. I'm chuffed to bits, I think a draw was a fair result."
Rhiwbina RFC was Warburton's first club and fans described him as a player its younger members can look up to.
Larry Spittle said: "I thought Warburton was just immense. The way he carries himself, he's just a role model for the kids here in Rhiwbina."
Stephanie Harris added: "Sam is amazing, we're so proud as a club to own him and have him as our role model.
"He's fantastic and I'm really pleased we've got somebody like that as an ambassador for Rhiwbina Rugby Club and the recreation club."
