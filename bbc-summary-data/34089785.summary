Appeal to trace Swansea uncle who survived Auschwitz

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Polish man has issued a plea for information on his uncle who settled in Swansea after surviving Auschwitz concentration camp.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wojciech Tomaszewski, 75, from Warsaw, contacted Swansea council's archives team after his own search hit a wall.
After liberation in 1945, his uncle Edmund Tomaszewski moved to Baglan Street in Port Tennant and worked for Skewen's DC William Press Ltd.
But what happened to him after this point remains unknown.
He lost touch with his brother, Wojciech Tomaszewski's father, as communications across the Iron Curtain became increasingly difficult.
"From the very scarce pieces of information I have, I learned that my uncle had a large family in Swansea - one of his daughters was Maria who had two children, Natasha and David," Wojciech Tomaszewski said.
"I have searched on the internet but could find neither a postal nor an email address for any of these relatives of mine.
"The surname is not found in the Swansea phone directory either."
County archivist Kim Collis said: "Records held in the archives tell us Edmund was originally from Warsaw and came to Britain after being liberated by American troops from a long period of wartime imprisonment by the Nazis, including a short spell in the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp, and then a period of service in the free Polish Forces.
"Being unable to return to his native Poland when it fell under communist control, he was officially resettled here and obtained work in a local steelworks.
"It'd be hugely satisfying if someone out there could help us trace any cousins or next generation relatives because it could help reunite two branches of a Polish family that's been split for 70 years."
Descendants of Edmund and people who may remember him can contact the archive service.
