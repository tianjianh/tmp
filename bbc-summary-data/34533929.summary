A further five people who helped during the 1989 Hillsborough disaster are being sought as part of a witness appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Images of the witnesses have been published by the team investigating the stadium crush in Sheffield, which led to the deaths of 96 football fans.
They show four people but no image is available for a fifth witness, believed to have been an off-duty nurse.
She is thought to have helped victims in the back of an ambulance.
The vehicle is pictured in front of the Leppings Lane terraces - where the crush happened during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest - at 15.36 BST on 15 April 1989.
The woman, believed to be from the Nottingham area, is thought to have travelled in the back of the ambulance from Hillsborough to the Northern General Hospital.
Images of more than 100 people have already been released during several appeals.
The photographs of those who have yet to be traced can be seen on the Operation Resolve website.
New inquests into the disaster are being held in Warrington, Cheshire.
