O'Connell, 21, spent the second half of the 2016-17 season on loan at Walsall, making 17 appearances in League One.
The Republic of Ireland Under-21 centre-back made 13 appearances for Celtic in all competitions.
"He has fantastic potential and is a player who has played Champions League football at such a young age in a strong Celtic side," manager Lee Clark told the club website.
"I'm also delighted about the backing from the chairman, as I know that five or six other clubs approached Eoghan."
O'Connell is Bury's seventh summer signing, following the arrivals of Jermaine Beckford, Phil Edwards, Stephen Dawson, Callum Reilly, Joe Skarz and Adam Thompson.
