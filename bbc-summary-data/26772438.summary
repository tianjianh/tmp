Nida, 19, went missing two-and-a-half months ago after putting the bins out at her home.
Gwent Police said they were called to Newport Wetlands at West Nash Road on Thursday morning where a body had been discovered.
The body has yet to be identified and the death is being treated as unexplained.
Police said a post-mortem examination was to take place.
The teenager disappeared from her home in Pill at about 20:00 GMT on 28 December.
She was not wearing shoes and did not have her phone, money or coat with her.

It's almost exactly three months to the day that 19 year old Nida Naseer went missing from her home, three days after Christmas.
Just two days ago her father told BBC Wales he felt something was stopping her from getting in touch.
Despite hundreds of hours of CCTV and several reports of sightings around the country, Gwent Police say her disappearance is still a mystery.
Visitors to this secluded bird sanctuary on the banks of the River Usk have turned back from their walks along the coast this afternoon, visibly shocked at the presence of police officers, at what is a quiet and peaceful area full of dense marshland.
West Nash Road, where a body has been found, is about four miles (6.5km) by road from Linton Street, where Nida was last seen.
Natural Resources Wales, which manages the wetland, said the body appeared to have washed up on to an area of salt marsh.
It said no land had been cordoned off as that area is not accessible to the public.
Police investigating Nida's disappearance have received more than 50 calls reporting possible sightings across the UK but none had amounted to anything.
Officers said they had investigated hundreds of lines of inquiry and taken more than 100 statements.
Four Urdu and Punjabi language specialists from Greater Manchester, Thames Valley and Metropolitan police forces have also helped with the investigation.
Nida's family have made several public appeals for her to return home.
They say she was depressed before she went missing and believe she disappeared because the family's asylum-seeker status prevented her from attending university.
They had sought asylum after coming to the UK from Pakistan five years ago but their application was turned down a year ago. They have appealed.
