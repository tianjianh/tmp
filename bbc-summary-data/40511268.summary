Petra Kvitova's return to action just six months after a knife attack that threatened her career is a "miracle", says her surgeon Dr Radek Kebrle.

Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, played at the French Open in May after being stabbed by an intruder at her home in the Czech Republic in December.
And last month, she claimed a stunning win at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham.
"It was ambitious to see her return here in this space of time, but miracle happens," Kebrle told BBC Sport.
Last week, Kvitova told BBC Sport the attack "took her smile away" and that winning her first title since the attack was "a fairytale".
It was her 12th tour title and one she won in style by claiming 17 of the final 18 points.
The 27-year-old left-hander, who beat Sweden's Johanna Larsson in the first round at Wimbledon, had surgery for severe lacerations to all four fingers on her left hand.
Kebrle said he told Kvitova in December that there was "a high risk that she will not pass and come back" but he would do "everything he can" to help her recover.

He added: "We said six months is a realistic or safe time to make a return. After three months she would have a full range of motion and will have to learn to play tennis again.
"She was a perfect patient because she was following our orders. We made a schedule for two, six, 10 weeks and we followed it. We were reaching the points.
"To gain good range of motion is very difficult. Even if you treat it well, you are not sure she is going to come back because she still has to work it out mentally and has to train - it needs time.
"In two and a half months, she is back and she won Aegon in that time. It is outstanding, unbelievable."
