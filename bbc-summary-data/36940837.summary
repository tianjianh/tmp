[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers are being warned to expect months of "significant delays" on central Scotland's motorways as work begins to install new signage gantries.

Three months of work will begin on 8 August on both carriageways of the M74 from J2A Fullarton to J6 Hamilton.
Four months of work will begin on both carriageways of the M8 in mid-August from J8 Baillieston to J10 Easterhouse.
The M73 will be similarly affected for six weeks from mid-September, between J1 Maryville and J2 Baillieston.
The work is part of an ongoing £500m works programme to improve Scotland's motorway network.
Graeme Reid, Project Manager for the M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements Project, said: "Transport Scotland is working with the contractor to ensure these works are completed as quickly as possible.
"While we're doing everything we can to minimise the disruption, delays will be inevitable, so we're asking motorists to check the Transport Scotland and Traffic Scotland websites for updates on these key routes, to plan their journeys in advance and to look at taking an alternative route if possible."
The £500m project aims to upgrade central Scotland's busy motorways and significantly reduce congestion.
It has been estimated that the road improvements could reduce the average daily car commute between Glasgow and Edinburgh by 20 minutes.
