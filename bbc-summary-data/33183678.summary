The pair will be taking over slots once held by Olly Murs and Caroline Flack, who have been promoted to hosts of the main ITV talent show.
This year's X Factor will see wholesale changes, with Louis Walsh, Mel B and Dermot O'Leary departing.
Simon Cowell and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are the only faces returning.
The judging panel will be completed by newcomers Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora, who was poached from BBC One's The Voice.
Coincidentally, Humes' husband is former JLS singer Marvin Humes, who hosts the BBC's rival talent show.
The couple are regular stand-in presenters together on ITV's This Morning, while Rochelle also fronted ITV's Ninja Warrior UK.
Odoom has worked on Kiss FM's breakfast show, alongside co-host Rickie Haywood-Williams, as well as presenting The Brit Awards for ITV2.
The Xtra Factor is a companion show to the main weekend broadcasts, and follows the backstage action, as well as chatting with judges and contestants.
Humes said: "I have watched The Xtra Factor for years so I am beyond excited about joining such a brilliant team and getting to work with my old friend Melvin makes it even better.
"I also can't wait to meet the contestants and be a part of their X Factor experience."
