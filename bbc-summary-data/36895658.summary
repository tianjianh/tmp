Phil Mustard: Gloucestershire sign Durham stalwart on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucestershire have signed Durham stalwart Phil Mustard on loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The batsman and wicketkeeper, 33, has spent 16 years at Durham and will miss his own benefit game in order to finish the season with Gloucestershire.
A finger injury to 24-year-old wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick led the club to pursue Mustard.
Head coach Richard Dawson told the club website: "Phil brings vast experience and match-winning abilities which I'm sure he will show at Gloucestershire."
Mustard has played in all of Durham's major trophy-winning sides and helped Lancashire to promotion while on loan in 2015.
He is also Durham's leading appearance maker in both first-class and T20 cricket.
Gloucestershire hope Mustard will be eligible for their One-Day Cup match against Surrey at the Oval on 27 July.
He would not be eligible if Gloucestershire and Durham were to meet in the knockout stages of either limited-overs competition.
