Instead, Ofcom said Openreach should become a distinct company within the BT group. Shares in BT rose 3.1%.
By the close, the FTSE 100 index was up 14 points at 6,724.03.
Shares in the supermarket Tesco were the biggest fallers. Kantar Worldpanel figures showed its sales slipped 0.7% in the 12 weeks to 17 July.

Shares in oil giant BP fell 1.3% after it reported a near halving in second-quarter profits.
Underlying replacement cost profit for the quarter fell 44% to $720m (£550m), which was slightly lower than expected, as the company suffered from lower oil prices and weak refining margins.
