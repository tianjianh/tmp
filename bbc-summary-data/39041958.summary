[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World Club Challenge winners Wigan fought back from 14 points down to beat Widnes Vikings in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Leuluai crossed to put Warriors ahead, but Widnes responded with scores from Lloyd White and Danny Craven.
Oliver Gildart's try levelled the scores, before Tom Armstrong and Stefan Marsh went over for Vikings.
Rhys Hanbury added two penalties, but two tries from Joe Burgess and one each from Gildart and Lewis Tierney stole the two points for Warriors.
The win is the second in two Super League games for Wigan, who also won the World Club Challenge against Cronulla Sharks in their last fixture.
Widnes had looked on course to earn their first points of the season in a game which had been rescheduled to their home ground at short notice due to a waterlogged pitch at Wigan's DW Stadium on Thursday.
But the visitors scored 12 points in 10 minutes to take the lead late on, despite making only two of their six conversion attempts on the night.
Conversely, Hanbury was almost perfect with his kicking as he surpassed 500 career points in Super League, but his one missed conversion was ultimately the difference on the scoresheet at full-time.
Widnes head coach Denis Betts:
"It is a bizarre situation. We came in this morning not knowing what was going on.
"The game was put on at 11 o'clock and the club has done fantastically well at such short notice.
"But I couldn't control it. I don't waste energy thinking about it. I had nothing to do with it."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane:
"I am the coach of Wigan and we coached the team to get two points. That is all I am concerned about.
"I got told the game was off and that was it. All the players got a message - make sure you go to bed, look after yourself, something might be sorted.
"I'm very happy with the mentality shown by the players because this is a tough place to come. To get two points here is a great effort."
