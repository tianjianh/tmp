Ryan Dow: St Johnstone wait on contract offer to Dundee United cast-off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone are waiting to hear whether Ryan Dow will accept their contract offer after the forward's departure from Dundee United.

Dow, 24, was one of eight United players not offered new contracts after their relegation from the Premiership.
But Saints boss Tommy Wright is keen for Dow to make a swift decision about a potential move to Perth.
"I can't do any more, it's up to Ryan. We've been in touch with him and the decision will be Ryan's," Wright said.
"I've done everything I can and we're just now waiting for his answer. You'd have to ask him (what the delay has been). He's got his reasons.
"But I can't wait forever because players are being put to us all the time and we have to get things sorted.
"However, I do very much want Ryan here and he knows that so hopefully that will get sorted."
Wright has already secured a deal for former United defender Keith Watson on a pre-contract agreement after his exit from St Mirren.
Dow - along with fellow forwards Florent Sinama Pongolle and Edward Ofere, midfielder John Rankin, defenders Guy Demel, Callum Morris and Euan Spark, plus goalkeeper Joe McGovern - was told on Wednesday his time at Tannadice was up.
That followed the club's relegation to the Championship and the departure of manager Mixu Paatelainen.
