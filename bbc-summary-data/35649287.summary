Grace Taylor, 21, from Swanage, Dorset, flew back to the UK on Tuesday night, police said.
Officers at Krabi Airport said they approached Ms Taylor on Tuesday, who seemed "extremely disturbed" and refused to talk to the authorities.
A Facebook plea to find Ms Taylor posted by her mother, Sam, sparked a global social media campaign for information about her daughter.
Airport police said they approached the backpacker on Tuesday, who was "constantly blowing a whistle and refusing to talk to anyone".
On Tuesday, Dorset Police said it had been contacted by Interpol to confirm she had been found.
Miss Taylor's family filed a missing persons report with police on 21 February after she could had not been in contact with the UK for five days.
On Monday, she called her mother from Ao Nang, who booked her a flight which she did not get on.
This led to her mum writing on Facebook that the family were "desperately worried".
According to the Facebook post, Miss Taylor was "disoriented" and "not in a good mental state".
Miss Taylor's mum confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that the backpacker had been found.
