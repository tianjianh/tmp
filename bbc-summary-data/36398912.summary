[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keith Curle's influence as manager was key to midfielder Russell Penn joining Carlisle United following his end-of-season departure from York City.

Penn, 30, was out of contract and opted to join the Cumbrians rather than accept a new deal with relegated York.
The former Cheltenham, Burton and Kidderminster player has signed a one-year contract.
"His [Curle's] ambitions for the club and for me were key and drew me to the move," Penn told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"I'm really excited by what we've got. The club have made some very good signings and it will show where we're going to stand this season."
Penn arrives at Brunton Park having scored three goals in 37 games for the Minstermen in 2015-16, and joins fellow new signings Nicky Adams and Joe McKee.
"It's good to have competition, it brings out the best in everybody," Penn added. "I've played against Jason Kennedy and Luke Joyce and they remind me of myself. As a team it can only make us better."
Carlisle finished 10th and eight points off the top seven.
Penn has been part of play-off campaigns at Cheltenham and York in recent seasons and hopes his influence can have similar impact.
"I've been captain the last four years," Penn said. "Looking over the squad there are leaders out there, the lads in midfield, if we get the match-winners in there we'll be a force to be reckoned with."
