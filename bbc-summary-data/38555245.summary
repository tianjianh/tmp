Dean Saunders inquest: Father 'allowed himself to be stabbed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father has told an inquest how he allowed himself to be stabbed to try to prevent his own son killing himself.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Saunders, 25, from Basildon, had been sectioned and released from hospital before attacking two of his relatives in December 2015.
He was charged with attempted murder before being found dead from electrocution in his HMP Chelmsford cell on 4 January, the jury heard.
At an inquest into his death, his family said "he deserved better".
Mr Saunders' father Mark told the hearing at the Essex County Coroner's Court, in Chelmsford, his son had been a "typical loving boy" until December 2015 when he became mentally ill.
The family claim a decision not to detain him under the Mental Health Act and to withdraw continuous observation in prison contributed to his death.
In a written statement, they said: "Dean was a kind and loving man.
"We hope that the inquest will properly explore what went wrong with his care and ensure that there are changes so that this doesn't happen to another family.
"We want justice for Dean. He deserved so much better."
Mr Saunders told the inquest how after his son - who he described as "really paranoid, confused, frightened" - was released from hospital, he returned home with the family to Basildon.
He told how Dean went to the kitchen, picked up a knife and tried to attack his older brother Lee.
Mr Saunders said he managed to "rugby tackle" and initially disarm his son, who then returned to the kitchen to get another knife.
He told the court that when he approached him, his son held up the knife and said: "Don't come near me, I know what I have got to do."
Mr Saunders said the only way he could get near his son was to walk towards the knife.
"The knife went in," he said. "But it was the only way I could hold him.  I thought 'if I can keep the knife in me I can stop him taking it out and harming himself'."
Initially his son was on constant watch in prison but that was downgraded and he was not offered any medication other than sleeping pills, added Mr Saunders.
He said the family felt they had been "lied to and misled" all the way through.
The hearing continues.
