Eighty-six arrests have been made so far as part of the ongoing inquiry into events at Hampden stadium in Glasgow on the 21 May.
Thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch and some Rangers players were pushed and appeared to be punched.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and rival fans clashed.
The disturbance followed Hibernian winning the Scottish Cup for the first time in 114 years.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their Cup Final medals.
Police Scotland said anyone with information about the identities of the people in the pictures should contact the incident room at Govan Police Office on 0141 532 5457.
They have also set up an email address: Scottishcupfinalpitchinvasion@scotland.pnn.police.uk.
