**SPOILER ALERT: If you are not up-to-date with Hollyoaks, don't read on.**
After three years, Hollyoaks' Dodger Savage is leaving. He's just had a month of being handcuffed to a radiator in his dead mum's basement. The person responsible? His twin sister. Who he also happens to have a baby with.
"He's a ridiculous man. I'm sure Bryan our producer just laughs," actor Danny Mac told BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw.
In fact so much has happened to Dodger you'd be forgiven for not remembering it all. So allow us to help.
1: Remember when.. Texas, his one true love, was guilt tripped in to marrying his brother Will after he pretended he was disabled.
2: Remember when.. a tearful Dodger then confessed his love to Texas on her wedding day, only for her new husband to chuck her out the church window to her death.
3: Remember when.. after being wrongly charged with Texas' murder, Dodger discovered that it was in fact his brother Will who killed her. But just as he was confronting him, an explosion destroyed his flat, leaving him fighting for his life.
4: Remember when.. after losing his memory in the explosion, he went all detective and discovered (again) that Will killed Texas. He still had no luck confronting him though as they both fell off the roof.
5: Remember when.. Dodger found out his dad Dirk wasn't his real dad after all. It was actually Patrick Blake. Which worryingly for Dodger meant he had a baby with his twin sister Sienna.
6: Remember when.. Dodger kissed Maxine - his dad's girlfriend.
7: Remember when.. ex-girlfriend and convicted murderer Theresa escaped from prison to let Dodger know she's carrying his child. He'd just got together with Maxine - his Dad's ex.
8: Remember when.. Dodger decided to give the "whole family thing a go" with Theresa, but then they were both involved in a high speed train crash later in the same episode.
9: Remember when.. Dodger slept with 16-year-old Holly, who just happened to be the daughter of his other dad's girlfriend.
10: And remember when.. he was stabbed in the leg and then later kidnapped by his psychotic twin sister. It turns out they have a child together - Nico, who's now a teenager. She handcuffed him to a radiator for a month and made him wear this naff Christmas jumper.
