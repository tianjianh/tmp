[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another teenager has appeared in court following disorder after last month's Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brandon Jones, 18, from Edinburgh is accused of running on to the pitch and towards opposition supporters in an "aggressive and threatening manner".
He is also charged with assaulting an unknown male and of assaulting another man, Dale Pryde.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Mr Jones denied the charges and was released on bail pending a later trial.
It is alleged that Mr Jones, who appeared from custody, breached the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act on 21 May by running on to the pitch after Hibs beat Rangers 3-2.
He was released on bail with the conditions not to enter Hampden or attend any football matches.
