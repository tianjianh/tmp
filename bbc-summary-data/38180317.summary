The airport's departures board showed the 08:00 GMT FlyBe flight to London City was cancelled.
Two flights arriving at the airport from Dublin have also been cancelled, and other departures and arrivals are delayed.
All departures on Thursday night were cancelled due to freezing fog and several planes were unable to land.
