Jayce Robinson and Reubyn Ash made fourth-round exits - the midway point in the event - while Luke Dillon fell at round three.
The event in France is the first world championships since the sport was announced for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
A record number of countries have taken part with first-timers such as Senegal and China among the 47 nations.
"I had a good run and then I creased my board in the tail and didn't feel right after that," Robinson told BBC Sport.
"But against some of the best guys in the world it was a good result for England."
Dillon had to contend with one of France's star surfers, Jeremy Flores, in his third-round heat.
"I had a good first wave then the waves moved all over the place," said Dillon.
"It wasn't a normal heat where everyone gets waves on one peak.
"I was just a bit unlucky not to get a good second wave on that one."
