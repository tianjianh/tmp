The Carnegie Library at Loughborough Junction is supposed to reopen as a "healthy living centre" under plans by Lambeth Council to generate savings.
Campaigners assembled there on Thursday earlier to mark its final day.
But when it was due to close at 18:00 BST, a number in the building refused to leave. Lambeth Council has not so far commented.
Laura Swaffield, who chairs the group Friends of Lambeth Libraries, spoke to the BBC from inside the building and said around 80 people had stayed on.
"Some of us have sleeping bags and we intend to stay for as long as possible."
She said the people inside were "doing what we normally do in libraries - reflecting, reading, studying.
"There are three A-Level students here revising. They'll have nowhere to do it after these libraries go."
Two libraries run by Lambeth - the Carnegie and the Minet Library - were due to shut on Thursday.
In a previous statement on its website, Lambeth Council said: "At Carnegie, the council has been working with the community trust, local councillors and residents to ensure that the proposed healthy living centre works for users."
