Met Office issues warning for high winds across Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A yellow "be aware" warning for wind has been issued for Wales, with gusts expected to reach up to 70mph (113kmh).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office said winds are likely to pick up in places from 17:00 GMT on Friday, especially near coasts.
It has also warned snow in north Wales may settle on high ground in the evening.
The warning follows high winds from Storm Barney which hit the country on Tuesday.
Britain's second named storm left more than 7,500 homes and business in Wales without power.
