Balfron High pupils return to school following repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils have returned to a Stirlingshire school following initial repair work to address structural problems.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Balfron High School S1 to S3 pupils had been bussed to other secondaries while the work was carried out.
Pupils in S4 to S6 will return to classes on Monday at the conclusion of exams.
Work is continuing to return the school to "full operational status" by the end of summer.
Twelve temporary classrooms have been installed at the school.
Issues with walls in the stairwell, gym and atrium were discovered in May during precautionary checks, leading to the school's partial closure.
A Stirling Council spokesman said: "The repairs programme will continue throughout the rest of this term in a way that maintains our key focus on meeting educational needs and ensuring the safety of our pupils and staff at all times.
"Further work will take place through the summer break to return the school to full operational status before the start of the new term."
The school was built under a private finance initiative about 15 years ago, but not by the firm involved with recent problems with Edinburgh schools.
