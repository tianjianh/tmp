[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conor Chaplin headed the visitors into the lead after 24 minutes, meeting Christian Burgess' long diagonal ball with an effort that looped beyond Will Norris and into the far corner.
Cambridge saw strong appeals for a penalty turned down moments later as Burgess tangled with Uche Ikpeazu, before Kyle Bennett forced Norris into a sprawling save from the edge of the box.
Just before the hour Cambridge substitute Ben Williamson missed a great chance to equalise, firing wide from close range after Portsmouth had failed to clear their lines, before the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 61st minute.
Amine Linganzi was shown a straight red card for going in dangerously on U's sub Conor Newton in the centre circle.
Cambridge looked to capitalise on their numerical advantage and saw a shot deflected over from James Dunne, who also blazed well over 15 minutes from the end as Portsmouth held on.
