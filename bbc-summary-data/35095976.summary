Police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters at a march called by the main pro-Kurdish party, the HDP.
A number of areas in the south-east have been put under curfew as security forces battle Kurdish PKK militants.
Violence has surged after a ceasefire broke down earlier this year.
The protesters had assembled to voice opposition to the curfew imposed in the city's Sur district for almost two weeks.
It was imposed days after prominent pro-Kurdish lawyer Tahir Elci was shot dead in Diyarbakir during a battle between police and unidentified gunmen in which two policemen also died.
A ceasefire between the army and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July and dozens have since been killed in violence in the south-east.
Turkish jets have also bombed PKK bases in northern Iraq, with the army also launching a ground operation.
Many Kurds were also angered by Turkey's failure to help Kurdish fighters in the battle for Kobane in northern Syria in June.
In the run-up to November's parliamentary poll, the HDP accused Turkey's governing AK Party and intelligence services of orchestrating more than 400 attacks on its offices.
