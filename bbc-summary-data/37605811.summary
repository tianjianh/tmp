Millions of people in America have watched the second of three TV debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the two people who want to become US president.

Businessman Donald Trump was under a lot of pressure going into it, after a video of him saying some terrible things about women was made public.
Mr Trump apologised again: "This was locker room talk, I'm not proud of it, I apologise to my family, I apologise to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it."
However, Mrs Clinton said it showed he wasn't fit to be president: "He has said that the video doesn't represent who he is, but I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is."
Mr Trump went on to attack Mrs Clinton's husband, Bill, who was US president from 1993-2001, for his past behaviour. But Mrs Clinton did not comment.
In the end, after debating several different issues, the two were asked to say one positive thing about one another.
Mrs Clinton said she admired Donald Trump's children, while he said he respected the fact she never gives up.
The US presidential election takes place on 8 November, when one of them will be voted into one of the most powerful jobs in the world.
