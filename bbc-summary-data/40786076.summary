[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge made it two wins from two at the start of the season with a 2-1 victory at Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last season's play-off semi-finalists, who opened the new campaign with a 2-1 triumph over Barrow, needed just three minutes to take the lead at Meadow Park when Fejiri Okenabirhie took advantage of a defensive mistake to beat home goalkeeper Grant Smith.
The Wood were only behind for five minutes, though, as Bruno Andrade drew them level from the penalty spot after the Portuguese himself had been brought down in the area.
In a frenetic start, Dagenham were back in front in the 18th minute when Corey Whitely curled a brilliant 25-yard free-kick into the top corner.
And that proved to be the winning goal as the visitors held on during a late Boreham Wood onslaught, which included the unlucky Andrade seeing a stoppage-time piledriver smash back off the crossbar.
