Midfielder Harry Winks could be out for the rest of the season, says Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino.

The 21-year-old was taken off on a stretcher in the first half of the win at Burnley after injuring his ankle when he fell into the dugout.
Winks was taken to hospital after the match and will have further scans to determine the extent of the injury.
"We hope there is no big issue but it will be difficult for him to play again this season," said Pochettino.
"He twisted his ankle. We need to see the scans and then start his recovery."
Tottenham are second in the Premier League, seven points behind leaders Chelsea.
They currently have Danny Rose, Erik Lamela and Harry Kane on the sidelines ahead of Wednesday's trip to Swansea.
Meanwhile, Pochettino has played down talk of his side being back in the title race - although he added that "nothing is impossible".
"We reduced the gap to Chelsea by three points but it is still a big gap. Seven points is a massive difference. For us it's about being focused and trying to improve on last season in terms of numbers," he said.
"Nothing is impossible - that is our idea and our philosophy. We need to keep going in that direction.
"Our challenge is to be consistent but there is still a big gap to Chelsea and a lot of work to do."
