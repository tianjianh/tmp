[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-2 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom-placed Cambridge struck twice in the second half to clinch their first win of the season in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhys Healey's header gave Newport a 10th-minute lead on his full debut.
Adam McGurk almost equalised when his free-kick hit the crossbar, and Cambridge were eventually back on terms when Uche Ikpeazu fired in from Newport old boy Medi Elito's long ball.
And Cambridge claimed all the points when Luke Berry drove the ball home after a scramble.
The result sees County drop into the bottom two - ahead of Cambridge on goal difference.
Newport manager Warren Feeney said: "It's the story of our season to be honest.
"We can't keep giving the goals we're giving away. We can work at things all week but when you cross that white line that's the disappointing thing.
"But listen, I take full responsibility for everything.
"You can stand here and say this or say that, but the results don't lie. When we get up tomorrow it will say 2-1 to Cambridge."
