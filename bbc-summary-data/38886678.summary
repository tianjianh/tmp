A woman whose bungalow was destroyed by the sea has moved out of her temporary home after losing a planning row.

Bryony Nierop-Reading's home fell into the sea in Happisburgh, Norfolk, during the 2013 tidal surge.
She spent years battling with North Norfolk District Council which said she did not have planning permission to live in a caravan on a nearby field.
The 71-year-old has a home further inland but it is occupied by her daughter and son-in-law.
Bryony Nierop-Reading moved into her 1930s bungalow on Beach Road in 2008.
As the cliff-face eroded, virtually all of her neighbours moved out in 2010 after accepting compensation from the local authority.
But Ms Nierop-Reading refused and by 2013 her bungalow was left teetering on the cliff edge.
After losing her case with the district council, Ms Nierop-Reading's caravan was flattened.
She spent the weekend moving her belongings into a nearby container provided by the council.
"There's a lot of mess. I've already filled one six cubic metre container yesterday and I'm waiting for another to be delivered today. I'm in total shock", she added.
Ms Nierop-Reading said will be living in a motor home on a field she owns for the next week or so while she continues to clear everything up.
The council has been approached for comment.
