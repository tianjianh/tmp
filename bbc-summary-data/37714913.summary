BBC Children in Need: British Gymnastics and Pudsey want you to Jump for Pudsey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Whether it's jumping, leaping, bouncing or hopping you can help Children in Need by 'Jumping for Pudsey'!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This year British Gymnastics and Boots have teamed up to launch a new campaign to get you active as well as helping raise money to fund projects for disadvantaged children and young people around the UK.
You can join in and celebrate with one of our challenges from the handy booklet - find out more here.
All you need to do is get your friends, family or colleagues to sponsor you for each jump and see how many you can do.

You can run your challenge on any day between October and December, and as often as you want. We want to see how many jumps you can do by Appeal Night on Friday, 18 November, so don't forget to add your jumps to our totaliser.
And if you are a gymnast, a gymnastic club or a leisure centre looking to get involved then you can get some helpful resources from British Gymnastics here.

So what are you waiting for? Turn jumps into pounds and help BBC Children in Need fund projects all around the UK!
