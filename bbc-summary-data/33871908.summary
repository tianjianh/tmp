[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paper company has been fined £400,000 after a number of "serious safety failings" led to an employee being crushed by a machine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Operations director John Stoddard, 41, was killed at the Higher Kings plant at Cullompton, Devon, in 2011.
Exeter Crown Court heard DS Smith Paper had failed to act on 73 urgent safety recommendations from a report compiled 11 months earlier.
The company admitted failing to ensure safe working.
Mr Stoddard died instantly when he was pulled into a production line from an upstairs platform as he tried to smooth down paper which was passing through it.
The father-of-two was killed 11 months after a firm of consultants had made a series of safety recommendations which were not implemented.
These included 33 areas of very high risk which should have been addressed within 24 hours and 40 of high risk which should have been rectified within a week.
Judge Francis Gilbert QC said it was a "serious aggravating feature" that the company had failed to act on the report.
The judge said: "If the company had corrected the hazardous feature which was later described by their own expert, this fatality would not have occurred.
"The Health and Safety Executive concluded that the risk to operators from thin moving machinery was obvious.
"They say the failure to address so many area of high or very high risk was a failure at the highest level of the company."
Mr Simon Antrobus, defending, said the company accepted full responsibility and offered a public apology from chief executive Miles Roberts to Mr Stoddard's family.
