[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea City 0-3 Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless Swansea City remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table after they were thoroughly outplayed by Bournemouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With coach Alan Curtis in temporary charge following Bob Bradley's sacking, Swansea's woeful defending allowed Benik Afobe to put the impressive visitors in front.
Ryan Fraser finished an incisive team move to give Eddie Howe's side a commanding 2-0 half-time lead, and Joshua King slotted in a late third to compound the misery for their demoralised opponents.
Bournemouth's win takes them up to 10th in the table, whereas Swansea are still deep in the relegation mire and four points adrift of safety.
It presents Bradley's permanent successor with a daunting task and, with the club hopeful of making an appointment by Monday, Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement remains the Swans' first choice.
Swansea's 4-1 Boxing Day humiliation at the hands of West Ham was played before a baying Liberty Stadium crowd, whose calls for Bradley to be sacked were heeded 24 hours later.
There was no such sense of toxicity on this occasion - owing much to fans' admiration for club stalwart Curtis - but the Swansea players still seemed gripped by the pervading anxiety of a relegation scrap.
Their nerves were evident in their defending, which was hopelessly inadequate for Bournemouth's goals.

The first was shambolic from Swansea's perspective, with Jordi Amat's miscued clearance cannoning off goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and presenting Afobe with the chance to drill a low effort into the net.
Things did not improve for the hosts, who were statuesque as Bournemouth extended their lead and offered precious little in terms of an attacking threat.
Swansea's fans voiced their anger again in the closing stages, singling out chairman Huw Jenkins and his fellow directors for their ire as results continue to be dreadful following the club's American takeover in the summer.
Oblivious to their opponents' strife, Bournemouth played with the energy and quickness of thought which was the hallmark of bygone Swansea teams.
With Jack Wilshere orchestrating proceedings in midfield, the Cherries passed the ball crisply, closed down their opponents eagerly and moved with an intelligence which bamboozled Swansea.
After Afobe had seized on comical home defending to put the visitors in front, Howe's men doubled their lead with a delightfully intricate team goal.
Right-back Simon Francis, winger Junior Stanislas and Wilshere picked the Swans apart with a neat succession of passes, before Stanislas' low cross set up Fraser to fire in from close range.
Bournemouth continued to dominate after the interval and, although Stanislas and Afobe missed decent chances, it proved academic as substitute King collected Charlie Daniels' through ball and finished calmly to seal a comprehensive victory.
Swansea caretaker coach Alan Curtis speaking to BBC Sport:

"It just drained the confidence out of us, as soon as that first goal went in we found it very difficult to recover. At 1-0 we could have regrouped a bit, but Bournemouth were excellent and deserved it. We showed a little character in the second half, bit it was not enough.
"A new manager is needed imminently, we need fresh eyes to look at it. I will speak to the chairman hopefully later today, the window opens tomorrow and it is evident we need one or two new ones in.
"We have to regroup, with a new manager and new players hopefully that will give us a lift. We are in tomorrow to prepare for Tuesday, hopefully a new manager will come in but as far as I know there is no timescale."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Sport:
"It's been a good day, I thought we were excellent from start to finish, we controlled the game and took the chances when we got them.
"We scored at key times, the goal before half-time was a massive one for us. The quality of that one was the pleasing thing, with what the players did around the box. It was a tough game, and the players stood up to that challenge.
"We have no chance to enjoy it, it's straight on to Arsenal and we hope to do well against them."
Former England defender Phil Neville: "Normally when you sack a manager, you get a reaction. Today they did get a reaction - and they were even worse. Swansea were off the pace, they weren't at it. It was a horrific performance."
Bournemouth host Arsenal on Tuesday 3 January, kicking off at 19:45 GMT while Swansea visit Crystal Palace on the same night, starting 15 minutes later.
