[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham interim manager Paul Warne will stay in charge of the Championship strugglers until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Millers have been without a permanent boss since Kenny Jackett quit on 28 November after only five games and 39 days at the helm.
Jackett had taken over from Alan Stubbs, who was fired in October after less than five months as manager.
Warne, 43, will continue to be assisted by coaches Matt Hamshaw, John Breckin and Mike Pollitt.
The former midfielder made 292 appearances for the Millers as a player, before joining the club's coaching staff following his retirement in 2012.
In December, he said he had no interest in taking the managerial job at the New York Stadium on a full-time basis.
Rotherham are bottom of the Championship table, 12 points adrift of safety.
