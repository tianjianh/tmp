Plans for £2bn 7,000-home garden city in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Developers have submitted plans for a £2bn garden city in Cardiff which includes 7,000 homes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Redrow Homes says Plasdŵr will also include shops, schools, leisure centres, pubs and restaurants.
The proposed development would be built on 900 acres of land bordering Radyr, Fairwater, St Fagans and Danescourt.
It would have one main and three smaller centres, each with its own high street and public square, and have a network of roads and cycle paths.
If the development and Cardiff council's local development plan are approved, work could start in 2016 and last up to 20 years.
A consultation on the proposals is now open.
