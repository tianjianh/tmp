Dagmara Przbysz, 16, was pronounced dead at Pool Academy near Redruth at about 14:15 BST on Tuesday.
Principal Zelma Hill said it was "heart-breaking" and described the girl as "passionate about fashion and photography".
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the girl's death was not thought to be suspicious.
'Terrible time'
Ms Hill said: "Dagmara was a beautiful, bright and creative 16-year-old student with a very promising future ahead of her.
"We are supporting students, staff and their families through this terrible time."
Tributes have been paid to Dagmara on the Pool Academy school Facebook page.
Insp John Hannaford, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "We understand this is a very distressing time for the family and the school.
"We are working closely with them and will offer support where required."
