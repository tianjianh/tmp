Daniel Bailey, 17, a pupil at the Alun School in Mold, died from meningococcal septicaemia, public health officials have confirmed.
Headteacher Jane Cooper said Daniel would be "sorely missed".
Public Health Wales say close contacts of Daniel have been identified and there is no wider risk.
Dr Chris Whiteside, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health Wales, said: "A teenager has died after receiving hospital treatment in Wrexham for meningococcal septicaemia.
"All close contacts have been identified and those requiring preventative medication have been treated.
"There is no wider public health risk and no other individuals will require treatment."
Ms Cooper said: "Daniel was a valued and popular member of the school and will be sadly missed by his friends and teachers alike.
"His friends found him to be bright and warm and a person who was interested in many things and always easy to talk to.
"Daniel's teachers are especially proud of his academic achievements throughout his years at the Alun School, and he had made a very promising start to his A-level studies in the sixth form.
"Above all, our thoughts are with Daniel's family at this sad time."
