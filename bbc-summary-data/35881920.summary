Coleman, whose current deal ends after Euro 2016, says he and the Football Association of Wales are "apart" in their talks over a new contract.
Despite speculation linking him with a return to club management, the former Fulham boss wants to stay with Wales.
"My focus is here - it has always been here," Coleman, 45, told BBC Wales Sport.
"I haven't worked this hard to get to where we are to start thinking about something else.
"I'm the manager of Wales. We've got Northern Ireland, Ukraine, then Sweden, then we go into a tournament, which is where we've always wanted to be.
"I'm very much in the middle of that, looking forward to it, and that's where my sole focus is."
Coleman succeeded the late Gary Speed as Wales manager in 2012 and, in qualifying for Euro 2016, guided his country to their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
Wales continue their preparations for this summer's competition in France with a home friendly against Northern Ireland on Thursday, before visiting Ukraine four days later.
Coleman is reportedly a target for clubs such as Premier League strugglers Aston Villa, although the former Wales defender is distancing himself from such speculation.
He added that his contract situation would not impact on the team in France.
"We have worked so hard to get here," he said.
"It's all about the tournament, it's all about doing as well as we can.
"I think my relationship with the players is good enough that we are just focused on what is in front of us.
"There is already rumours outside of the camp about this that and the other because the contract is not agreed, I can't help that, nobody can.
"All I can say is that I am totally focused on Wales, totally committed as I've always been, looking forward to these games coming up and its all about building towards this tournament. That's all that matters."
