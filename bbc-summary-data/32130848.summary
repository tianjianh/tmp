Witnesses reported hearing a "massive crash" outside London Bridge's outpatient hospital in Emblem House, Tooley Street at about 09:25 BST.
The woman, thought to be in her 20s, suffered a non-life-threatening head injury, the Met Police said.
London Bridge Hospital has been contacted for a comment but has yet to respond.
Dan McAlpin said he was walking "about four or five feet behind" the woman when the window fell.
"I heard this massive crash and saw the window had fallen on top of this woman." he said.
"I went over to help her, she was lying face down and she wasn't moving. At first I thought she was dead."
"It was really windy. The window was the size of a normal house door with a wooden frame.
"She was conscious and she was crying. I was just trying to hold her head and stop the bleeding. She had a nasty gash across the width of the head and her teeth were smashed in too."
London Ambulance Service said the woman was taken to the Royal London Hospital for treatment.
The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.
A spokesman for London Bridge Hospital said it was looking into what had happened and was co-operating fully with the authorities' investigations.
Firefighters saw the majority of overnight call-outs involve fallen trees, blown over when winds reached up to 50mph (80kmph), London Fire Brigade said.
The Met Office has issued a yellow, "be aware", weather warning for strong winds across London until 19:00 BST.
