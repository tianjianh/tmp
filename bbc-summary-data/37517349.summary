The man was recovered unconscious from the water at Porthkerris, near St Keverne, and airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he was later pronounced dead.
Two other divers were taken to Plymouth for specialist recompression treatment after a rapid ascent in the sea on Saturday.
The victim is believed to be a 67-year-old from Brentwood, Essex.
More on the diving accident, plus other Devon and Cornwall news
Divers can suffer decompression sickness - commonly known as "the bends" - if they surface too quickly allowing nitrogen bubbles to form in the blood.
The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.
Formal identification has not yet been carried out but Devon and Cornwall Police said the dead man's next of kin has been informed.
A police spokesperson said enquiries were ongoing to establish the circumstances, but the death was not thought to be suspicious.
