Sullay Kaikai blasted in for the home side after visiting goalkeeper Luke Daniels dropped a first-half corner.
Kyle Wootton levelled for Scunthorpe from 12 yards before Paddy Madden intercepted a backpass to net his 19th goal of the season for the visitors.
However, Akpa Akpro's cross from the left drifted in after Daniels was distracted by Andy Mangan.
His first League One goal in almost six months stretched Shrewsbury's unbeaten league run to seven games, nine points clear of the relegation zone while Scunthorpe drop to 13th.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"You have to say the result is frustration and relief for us. The players have rallied. It was a fantastic fightback from the lads. We have shown different qualities yet again.
"We didn't keep the ball in the second half and too many 50-50 decisions went against us from the referee. It was just foul after foul and that made it difficult for us.
"It's a big result for us and we have to work very hard to get results.  We have to respect the point, but this is a massive learning curve and the future is looking good for this football club.
"We have battled on and we have picked up a really useful point against a very good side."
Scunthorpe United manager Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside:

"To concede in the 95th minute is always disappointing but that's how long the game lasts. I certainly wouldn't have argued if we had scored in that time.
"We're frustrated and disappointed but it just goes to show you can't switch off and you can't allow opportunities into your area and not keep clean sheets all the time.
"It's another point to the tally, keeps the unbeaten run going, one defeat in 10, and we've got work to do from now and working towards next week against Chesterfield.
"It was unfortunate but the effort in the second half to get back in the game was exactly what we asked for and exactly what we expected."
