Scott Griffiths marked his Woking debut with a headed own goal on 18 minutes.
The hosts levelled four minutes later through John Goddard's curling effort but Andy Cook put Barrow 2-1 up with a close-range header on 29 minutes.
Giuseppe Sole equalised for the Cards with a neat finish deep into first-half injury time and hit a free-kick just wide late in the second half.
One of the referee's assistants was forced off early on after the ball struck him in the face, with a Woking fan volunteering to take on fourth official duties after a lengthy delay.
Woking striker Scott Rendell, who missed the game through injury, told BBC Surrey:

"It's never easy watching games and it was very scrappy and sitting there on the bench we were disappointed with the way we played in the first half - but to get a point is better than nothing.
"It was always going to be a horrible game but I didn't realise how horrible it was going to be. We said at the start of last week we wanted nine points from the next three games but now we can take seven and remain unbeaten.
"Today was another big test and it wasn't going to be pretty and it was a scrap and a dogfight but we need get through those games."
