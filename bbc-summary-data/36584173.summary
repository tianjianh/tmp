Visits to the Isle of Skye could be boosted by a tourism campaign based on the film adaption of Roald Dahl's story The Big Friendly Giant.

The Storr, a geological feature of the landscape in Trotternish, Skye, was used for creating scenes in the new movie directed by Steven Spielberg.
Tourism body VisitBritain has promoted The Storr in its new campaign called Oh My Giant Britain (OMGB).
It also features the film's locations in England.
Images of actress Ruby Barnhill, who plays lead character Sophie in the film, at The Storr, Big Ben in London and the Angel of the North near Gateshead have been released on social media.
The BFG launches in the US on 1 July and in the UK on 22 July.
Skye is a favourite with film-makers and provided backdrops for Stardust, which starred Michelle Pfieffer, big budget sci-fi Prometheus and also Snow White and the Huntsman, Keanu Reeves' film 47 Ronin and the latest film adaption of Macbeth.
Last month it emerged that the production team behind The BFG were helped by Highland's Council's small tourism and film unit with its inquiries about locations on Skye.
