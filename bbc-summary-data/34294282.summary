The Who have postponed all the dates on the US leg of their 50th anniversary tour, after Roger Daltrey was diagnosed with viral Meningitis.

The veteran British rock band had already postponed four dates due to singer Daltrey's "mystery virus".
A statement on their website said, "After extensive tests the seriousness of his condition became apparent," adding doctors had "prescribed rest".
The band apologised to fans and said Daltrey was "on the mend".
They said they had hoped The Who Hits 50! tour would go ahead, as Daltrey was "getting better" and they did not want to inconvenience ticket holders, but the dates are now being rescheduled for Spring 2016.
"It wasn't a decision taken lightly," said the band. "The Who always give their fans 100% and were never going to compromise the show, but ultimately the band had no alternative but to postpone the tour."
They said Daltrey had been especially disappointed to miss the Teen Cancer America benefit in Los Angeles, a charity he and the band "have worked tirelessly for".
"We are very sorry to disappoint our fans in this way," said Daltrey, who headlined Glastonbury and British Summertime in Hyde Park earlier this year.
"For the last four weeks, I have been in and out of the hospital and have been diagnosed with viral Meningitis," he revealed.
"I am now on the mend and feeling a lot better but I am going to need a considerable time to recover. The doctors tell me I will make a complete recovery, but that I should not do any touring this year."
Pete Townshend also apologised to fans "that have supported us in the last 50 years".
Townshend added: "Once Roger is completely well we will come back stronger than ever and Roger and I will give you all a show to remember."
