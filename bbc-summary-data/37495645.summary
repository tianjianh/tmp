[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Fairweather, 17, was given two life sentences for killing James Attfield, 33, and Nahid Almanea, 31, in Colchester in 2014.
Mr Attfield was stabbed more than 100 times while Saudi Arabian student Ms Almanea was stabbed with a bayonet.
Fairweather appealed to the Court of Appeal claiming the minimum 27-year sentence was "excessive".

Lord Justice Treacy said : "We are not persuaded it was manifestly excessive in an extremely serious case in which an experienced trial judge took much care over the process of sentencing."
Fairweather was 15 years old when he murdered James Attfield and Nahid Almanea in Colchester in 2014.
Despite claiming he was possessed by the devil, he was found guilty of the murders and in April was sentenced at the Old Bailey by Mr Justice Spencer, who said the killings were "brutal and sadistic".
The judge said his "obsessive interest" in serial killers "undeniably fuelled these killings", and it was clear he was "seeking to emulate them".
