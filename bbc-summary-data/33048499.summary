The world's third biggest electronics manufacturing services provider has 147 jobs in Livingston.
The Â£12.5m expansion, with extra 212 jobs, was announced following a visit by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to the company's headquarters in New York.
Ms Sturgeon said this fitted with recent successes in attracting inward investment to Scotland from the USA.
It was supported with a Â£450,000 grant from Scottish Enterprise, the government agency.
The company, which opened its Livingston site 21 years ago, supports large firms in computing, consumer, automotive, aerospace, defence, healthcare and communications.
It helps them identify more efficient processes and implement them.
Joseph McGee, executive vice president of Jabil, said: "We are pleased to be able to announce the expansion of our long-standing Scotland site and leverage the tenured team to grow and expand our global processes and capabilities."
Lena Wilson, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, said: "Jabil's centre of excellence in Livingston will solidify its ability to deliver research and development, manufacturing and new product introduction, thus creating additional capabilities, leadership and decision-making in Scotland.
"Jabil will also be able to tap into evolving technologies emerging from Scotland's innovative company base and collaborate with our world class universities."
