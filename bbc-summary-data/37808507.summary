[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 1-1 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Miller's header three minutes into stoppage time earned Falkirk a point against a dogged Morton side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Kilday had put the visitors in front with only three minutes left when Ross Forbes floated in a free-kick and the substitute bundled the ball in.
It was an unlikely lead for Morton, whose defence had held firm under sustained Falkirk pressure.
But Miller's equaliser ensured the Bairns remain a point behind the Greenock outfit, in fifth place.
The first half was forgettable other than a Thomas O'Ware header that was cleared off the line by Falkirk's Luke Leahy.
Within seconds of the restart though, the home side came within the width of a post of going in front.
Leahy drove forward inside the Morton box but his left-foot drive crashed off the base of the post and was eventually cleared away.
Luca Gasparotto then had a goal-bound header cleared off the line and Tom Taiwo blasted an effort against his own player when it looked easier to score.
The Morton goal was leading a charmed life but at times Falkirk were guilty of over playing and chances were being frittered away.
When the visitors went in front late on it appeared Falkirk were heading for a third straight defeat.
But although Morton keeper Derek Gaston got a hand to Miller's header, he couldn't keep it out to ensure the Bairns earned a deserved point.
Falkirk boss Peter Houston: "I think on our second-half performance it would have been a travesty if we had not taken anything from the game.
"I thought Morton's only threat today was from Ross Forbes free-kicks. They are a good team in good form and we gave them opportunities as he (Forbes) has great delivery.
"But we have had two cleared off the line, we have hit the post twice and their keeper has had two good saves. It's a game where we should have had all three points."
Morton boss Jim Duffy: "Before the game we would have been happy with a point but when you lose a goal so late you are a bit gutted.
"I thought Falkirk deserved a point as they really put us under the cosh in the last 20 minutes. We thought we had seen it out but it wasn't to be.
"I think we need to get to the turn of the year and see how many points we have and then see if we are a top-six side or a bottom six team and then go from there. We are a competitive side who work really hard and we make it difficult for our opponents."
