Eddie Mair and Kirsty Young have been voted the UK's favourite radio voices in a poll conducted by Radio Times.

Both present programmes on BBC Radio 4 - Young fronts Desert Island Discs, while Mair hosts the PM news programme.
Today co-host John Humphrys and Classic FM presenter Charlotte Green - also the voice of BBC 5 live's classified football results - were the runners-up.
Radio Times readers were asked to choose the top voices from a shortlist of 40, compiled by industry experts.
More than 32,000 votes were cast in the poll.
Humphrys's Today co-presenter Mishal Husain and Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey all featured in the female top five.
BBC Radio 2 presenter Ken Bruce, Classic FM's John Suchet and Radio 4 continuity announcer Neil Nunes rounded off the top five male voices.
The last time the Radio Times conducted the poll, the readers' top female and male voices were those of Green and Sir Terry Wogan.
The magazine announced it would be running a new poll earlier this year after Wogan died in January at the age of 77.
Jane Anderson, radio editor at the Radio Times, said: "When Terry Wogan won, he topped a list dominated by those who spoke 'BBC English'.
"That's now changed: Four of today's top 10 voices are Scottish, two are Welsh and, in the case of Neil Nunes, his rich, deep baritone arrives with a Jamaican accent.
She added: "Radio has come a long way since 2002, some 53.5 million people now listen every week. Back in 2002 it was 48.6 million - and happily, radio's burgeoning popularity is reflected in our poll."
