[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swedish activist who was detained in China on charges of damaging national security has been released and deported.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Dahlin, 35, has been held since early January amid a crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists.
Last week he appeared on state media apparently confessing to breaking the law through his organisation's support of local Chinese rights lawyers.
The Swedish embassy confirmed he had left China but gave no further details.
Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom welcomed his release, but expressed concern about another Swede in Chinese detention.
Gui Minhai, a Swedish national who lived in Hong Kong, is one of five people linked to a Hong Kong publishing house to disappear in recent months.  He vanished while on holiday in Thailand in October last year.
He had also appeared on Chinese TV earlier this month, saying he had voluntarily handed himself over to the authorities.
Many in Hong Kong believe the five were kidnapped by China and are being held because of allegations in a book they were working on, critical of the mainland.
Ms Wallstrom said Sweden's "efforts to get a clear picture of his situation and the possibility to visit him continue with undiminished force".
