Passengers aboard a train to Plymouth were delayed after a fatality on the line.
Esmee Phillips, 21, complained to First Great Western, saying "the shocking and callous" loudspeaker announcement left people "completely open-mouthed".
The company has apologised for "any distress caused".
Its services were disrupted on Friday after a man was killed by a train between Slough and Reading.
Miss Phillips was travelling back from Oxford to Plymouth on a delayed service and said a female staff member made two loudspeaker announcements about the fatality.
She said the announcement said: "Our delays are due to someone who couldn't be bothered to live any more.
"Because of this, there are severe delays. Some of you have missed your connecting flights for the Bank Holiday."
Miss Phillips said she and other passengers "cringed" at the message.
"It was shocking as it was said in a very callous and tasteless way, especially as you don't know what personal experiences other passengers have gone through," she said.
Fellow passenger Jay Young said the announcements, made once near Westbury and again just before Exeter, made passengers in his carriage "gasp".
First Great Western said: "We expect high standards from our onboard teams, who are trained to make clear announcements about delays.
"When this involves a fatality this should be done with sensitivity and care. We're sorry for any distress caused to customers yesterday and can confirm that this incident is under investigation."
