The 22-year-old, from Nelson, won gold in the men's 200m T44 final in Rio in a time of 21.06 seconds. Pistorius' record was 21.30 seconds.
Victory gave Malone his second medal of the Games and New Zealand's third gold of the day.
He won silver in the 100m on Friday, losing out to Great Britain's Jonnie Peacock, who retained his title.

Malone's blades were bought with donations from members of the public.
"I wouldn't be here without those blades in the first instance. I'm filled with gratitude to everyone who invested in me from the start," he said after the 100m final, according to New Zealand's Stuff news agency.
Pistorius, one of the world's most famous disability athletes, is serving a six-year jail term for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
