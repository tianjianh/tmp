Coombs, 31, injured his knee in the Dragons' 25-21 win against Cardiff Blues in the European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final in April 2015.
"I can empathise with the problems Andrew has faced over the last year and the difficult decision he has had to make," Dragons CEO Stuart Davies said.
"I wish him the very best in his future endeavours."
Coombs won 10 caps for Wales after making his first appearance in the 2013 Six Nations, during which he played in the 30-3 defeat of England to seal the title.
He began his career with Pontypool RFC, making 30 appearances in 2005 and 2006 before rejoining Newport RFC, where he had progressed through the youth system.
After making 100 appearances for Newport, Coombs captained the side in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons and was named Premiership Player of the Year in 2010.
He made his debut for the Dragons later that year and picked up eight tries in 86 appearances in a six-year spell with the club prior to his retirement.
