The 340-year-old cheese found on shipwreck off Sweden

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Divers have found what they believe to be a very old, very smelly cheese in a jar stuck on the sea bed, near Sweden.

The stinky discovery was made when the team were exploring the wreck of the Kronan, a warship that sank 340 years ago.
They didn't know it was cheese until the journey to the surface caused some of the contents to leak, releasing a very strong smell.
But in matters as important as the potential discovery of 340-year-old cheese, you can't just trust your nose.
So the team have sent their discovery to a laboratory so that they can know for sure what they have found.
