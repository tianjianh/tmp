James Allen denies killing Colin Dunford and Julie Davison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who denies brutally murdering two vulnerable adults in their own homes has described the prosecution case against him as "annoying".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Allen is accused of killing Colin Dunford, 81, of Middlesbrough, and Julie Davison, 50, of Whitby.
Mr Allen, 36, said there was no forensic evidence linking him to the deaths and claimed the judge was not listening to him.
Mr Dunford and Ms Davison were both found with head injuries in April.
The defendant told the jury he was smoking cannabis and cocaine on the night Mr Dunford died.
Rod Hunt, defending, asked Mr Allen about the prosecution's claims at Newcastle Crown Court.
Mr Allen said: "They keep saying I'm responsible for these murders but despite all the forensics they found no blood on me ... there would have been transfer of blood but there was nothing ever found.
"I know 100% I have not killed anybody or been in those properties."
During cross-examination, Robert Smith QC asked Mr Allen about a jacket which a witness said she saw him wearing and which had blood spots on it.
Mr Allen said he would have disposed of it if he was guilty.
He said: "If I had just murdered someone I would have discarded the top and as far as I'm concerned there was no mark on [it]."
Mr Allen, previously of Middlesbrough, refused to answer a question about a pair of black trainers, and told the court he had been in 35 different prisons.
"I don't behave in prison because I don't like conforming to rules," he said.
The prosecution claims robbery was the motivation for both killings.
The trial continues.
