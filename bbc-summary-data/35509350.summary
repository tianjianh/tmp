Yoann Barbet was sent off early on for bringing down Hooper when he was through on goal, before Fernando Forestieri headed the hosts in front.
Hooper struck a powerful half-volley past David Button to double the lead, and Kieran Lee slotted in a third from close range before the break.
Lucas Joao fired in a fourth late on, as the Owls moved fifth in the table.
Brentford are 13th in the Championship, and have now failed to win in three league games.
Carlos Carvalhal's side could have won by a much larger margin, but they almost went behind early on when Keiren Westwood was forced to save from Bees midfielder Alan Judge.
Barbet's sending off, the first of his senior career, allowed Wednesday to dominate the game, with Forestieri and Aiden McGeady going close to adding further goals in the second half.
Wednesday have now earned more points than any other team from their past 10 Championship games, having taken 23 out of a possible 30 over that period.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"I think that the red card was was clear, as Hooper was through on goal, one on one.
"Even though they were down to 10 men, we prepared very well, explored our spaces, moved the ball and changed the speed.
"More important to me was the transition, the way we worked when we lost the ball. We were organised enough not to give Brentford opportunities."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:

"For me, I don't believe the referee can make the decision. I think he guessed. He's directly behind it, 40 yards away. I thought it was a poor decision.
"I don't think Gary Hooper has the ball under control. He's gone down easily.
"They've got really good players going forward, but we always felt we had a game-plan. Unfortunately, this changed after six or seven minutes."
