Mooove out the way!

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Perhaps there was a bit of 'beef' between this cow and policeman in Texas, America.

After following it into a pen, the policeman got out to close the gate hoping the cow would stay inside.
No such luck! The policeman was forced to moooove out the way as the cow stormed out.
Luckily the officer managed to get away in time and no one was hurt.
