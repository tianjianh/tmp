The Northern Dalesman bus service runs for 40 miles (64km) through the Yorkshire Dales on Sundays through the summer.
It featured in the BBC 4 programme All Aboard! The Country Bus, which attracted about one million viewers.
The Yorkshire Dales Society, which funds the service, is trying to raise Â£3,000 to ensure it can continue.

"Over half the money to run the service has already been raised, but another Â£3,000 is needed to keep the wheels turning every Sunday and Bank Holiday throughout the summer," a spokesman for the charity said.
The service route takes in Middlesbrough, Stockton, Darlington, Richmond, Lancaster, Ingleton and Ribblehead. It also crosses Buttertubs Pass between Hawes and Muker in Swaledale.
For the two-hour programme, the bus journey was filmed in real time, with cameras capturing the road ahead, the scenery of the Yorkshire Dales and the conversations of regular passengers.
The service is run by volunteers and funded by the Yorkshire Dales Society's social enterprise company - the Dales & Bowland Community Interest Company.
The group funds a number of rural bus services in the Yorkshire Dales.
