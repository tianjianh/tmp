The 22-year-old kicked an injury-time conversion to seal victory for Bath at Wasps in the European Champions Cup.
And Booth says criticism of Ford's form so far this season is unjust.
"Some of the things that have been written about him are ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous," Booth told BBC Radio Bristol. "I'm delighted for him, he showed what a quality player he is."
Booth paid tribute to his entire team after their late heroics at the Ricoh Arena saw them bounce back from two straight Premiership defeats.
"I'm delighted for the lads because there have been some things written about them that I think have been unjust," he said.
"To show that sort of character, shows a lot about the players the play for Bath.
"Everyone is turning over stones to get the victories we so desperately want. The lads as they have gone through a lot of soul searching and effort off the pitch to make sure they are ready and that result pays them back."
Head coach Mike Ford revealed Friday's training session had been full-on affair with players angered by recent comments about their performances..
"It was a bit edgy, showing that players care about the position we are in," said Ford,
"There weren't fisticuffs or anything, but there were a few handbags thrown, and it just showed to me that the players - not that I needed to be shown - care about the position we are in, and it means a lot to them.
"Results had not gone our way. We took a lot of criticism for not being where people think we should be - but we are keeping the faith.
"Every game is small margins but we have confidence and belief in what we are doing."
