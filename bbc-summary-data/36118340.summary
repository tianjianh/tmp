[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 1-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Mansfield striker Ollie Palmer scored against his old side to secure a 1-0 win for Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Palmer won the game when he met Lloyd James' header just after half-time.
That goal strike atoned for his earlier failure to tap into an open net in the first half after rounding Stags goalkeeper Scott Shearer.
Emmanuel Dieseruvwe also missed with the goal gaping at the other end when Orient's Alex Ciask failed to safely gather a cross.
