She was really ill because of her old age and was put to sleep by vets at the zoo.
Heidi became a global megastar when photos of her appeared in a German newspaper.
A song was written about her, she appeared on TV shows and a stuffed Heidi toy was made.
Heidi was found abandoned outside an animal shelter in America in 2010 and was moved to Leipzig Zoo in Germany.
