The Alwen treatment works, near Cerrigydrudion, serves customers in Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire.
Welsh Water said the improvement works - part of a £120m upgrade plan - would provide safe and reliable water for decades to come.
Ian Christie, Welsh Water's Managing Director of Water Services, said the works had been "very challenging".
Clwyd West AM Darren Millar, who opened the upgraded treatment works, said it was a "significant investment" for the area.
