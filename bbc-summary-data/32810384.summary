Two adventurers from the Isle of Man are attempting to set a new record for circumnavigating Ireland in a kayak.

Keirron Tastagh, 36, and 40-year-old George Shaw are aiming to beat the current record of 28 days for the journey using standard sea kayaks.
They will try to cover up to 50 nautical miles per day whilst wild camping along the route.
The pair, who hold several kayaking records, are raising money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.
They said they plan to remain self-sufficient by carrying all their supplies and safety kit with them.
They began their journey by kayaking to Northern Ireland from the Isle of Man and will take a clockwise route starting from Strangford, County Down.
Keirron said they have three main aims.
"Firstly, we want to raise funds for the RNLI which provides an essential service and has a special significance here in the Isle of Man.
"Secondly, we want to use the trip to promote sea safety, and we also hope it will inspire others to challenge themselves and encourage their sense of adventure."
In 2012 the pair set a sea kayaking record during an expedition to the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea, completing the furthest paddle west from Dutch Harbor on Unalaska to Herbert Island.
