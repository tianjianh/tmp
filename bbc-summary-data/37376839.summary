Swansea City manager Francesco Guidolin insists he has "no problem" with Wales defender Neil Taylor following their touchline spat.

Taylor was visibly annoyed to be replaced four minutes before half-time in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea.
Guidolin apologised after the game for the timing of the move and said there was no bad blood with his player.
"I have forgotten everything. For me the problem is gone and I think for Neil as well," Guidolin said.
"I would like to say it is not good for a manager to change a guy before the end of the first half. I spoke with him in the match after the substitution and in the dressing room in front of all the players.
"I spoke about the substitution in front of the world because I spoke in the press conference. For me there is no more problem, that is enough."
The Italian said no more discussions had taken place with 27-year-old Taylor since the draw at the Liberty Stadium.
Asked whether Taylor would play in Sunday's Premier League game at Southampton, Guidolin said, "We have three important games in this period and there is the possibility for him and for other players to play in one, two or three of these important games."
"He's available like other players."
After facing Southampton, the Swans have two home encounters with Manchester City, on Wednesday in the EFL Cup and a Premier League game the following Saturday.
Guidolin is not yet certain whether record signing Borja Baston will be fit to make his debut at St Mary's.
The Â£15m Spaniard, who signed from Atletico Madrid, has yet to appear in a Swans shirt because of a thigh injury.
"He is training with us. I hope he will be available for Sunday, it may be easier for Wednesday," Guidolin said.
