A lone seal has been visiting a stretch of beach off the Dorset coast, to the delight of staff and customers at a seafront pub.

Brian the seal was first spotted shimmying his way up the pebble beach at Seatown, near Bridport, on Tuesday afternoon and returned on Wednesday.
Ross Diaper, bartender at the Anchor Inn, said it was the first time he had seen a seal on the beach.
He added: "He seems to be OK. He doesn't seem injured, he seems happy."
The hamlet, part of the Jurassic Coast, is popular with tourists and fossil collectors.
Mr Diaper said: "Our head chef decided his name was Brian and it stuck, so we started 'Brian Watch'.
"We got about 6ft (1.83m) away just to check he wasn't hurt, and from then onwards we were just informing people, telling them not to get too close because we didn't want to distress him."
The RSPCA has advised locals to keep an eye on Brian, who is about about 3.5ft (1.06m), but that he is likely to be fine.
However, they warned people to keep dogs away and not to get too near as seals do bite.
