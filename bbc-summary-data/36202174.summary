The white Range Rover Revere - with a starting price of Â£75,000 - was seen parked near Harrods in west London and daubed with angry messages by what appears to be a scorned lover.
"Cheater" was painted on both sides of the vehicle while the words, "Hope she was worth it" were marked on the rear window and bonnet.
Klo who took the photos said she saw a woman spray-painting the car.
"I have no idea who she was - she was just going crazy.
"No one tried to stop her. She just left afterwards."
The words, "It's over", were also on the car, suggesting the end of any relationship.
It is not known who the car owner is but he or she will get a shock when they finally return to their vehicle.
