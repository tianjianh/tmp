[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sheep fell from the cliff at Seven Sisters on Saturday.
Sussex Police said they believe the woman is the dog's owner and she was with two or three men at the time, who all appeared to be in their mid-20s.
The incident is being investigated as an offence under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953. Police have appealed for witnesses.
Bernadette Peters-Shorter, from Sussex Police, said: "We believe the woman is the dog owner and that she was with two or three men at the top of the cliffs.
"We're keen to speak to them as well as a group of other people who were on the clifftops at the time the sheep fell and who may have seen the dog running around loose.
"If you know who the woman or the men are or where they could be, please contact us."
