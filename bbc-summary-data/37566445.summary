Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in the town 11 days ago.
Suffolk Police said the three young people aged between 16 and 18 were seen at Short Brackland at 04:20 BST on 24 September.
They could be "potential witnesses", the force said.

Acting Supt Kim Warner appealed to the trio: "We appreciate that getting in touch with police may be intimidating but we do need to speak to you.
"At this stage in the investigation we just need to talk to anyone who may have seen Corrie during his night out so we can build a picture."
One of the teenagers is described as a white female, of quite slim build, wearing either a dark green or navy blue jumper-style top.
The other two were both males, one wearing a hooded top.
They were seen towards the back of Cornhill Walk shopping centre, police said.
Acting Supt Warner added: "We need to find Corrie and a number of inquiries are being carried out to do this.
"We know from CCTV images that we have already viewed that he engaged with a number of people during his evening out.
"We have had several calls but still need to talk to anyone who may have seen him or spoken to him during the early hours."
Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September.
It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.
