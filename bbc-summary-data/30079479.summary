The set at the rock festival on 12 June in Donington Park will see the Americans topping the bill for the third time.
The band's frontman Corey Taylor said: "Being invited back to Download always feels like coming home.
"It's an honour, a privilege and we're all looking forward to it."
The show on Friday night will be Slipknot's fifth appearance at Download and the first since the release of their latest album .5: The Gray Chapter.
Main support on the Friday night will come from Birmingham band Judas Priest. It'll be their second time at the festival, having previously played in 2008.
Black Stone Cherry have also been announced on the line-up.
After playing a surprise set last year, they'll be headlining the second stage for the second time.
Las Vegas band Five Finger Death Punch will also play on the opening night of the event.
Guitarist Zoltan Bathory said Download has become a key date on his calendar.
He added: "Playing Download Festival is always a highlight for us as it is a bona fide global rock n' roll destination everyone travels to and brings their A game to.
"In fact, it is vividly etched into our memories since it was the place where we may have broken the record for biggest crowd surfing in recorded history.
"I think the migration of Atlantic salmon took second place."
Avenged Sevenfold, Linkin Park and Aerosmith headlined this year's festival.
Tickets for Download 2015 go on sale on 20 November, with details of the remaining two headliners yet to be announced.
