Woman, 82, cleared of historical sex abuse against girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 82-year-old woman from Cardiff who was accused of sexually abusing a young girl has been cleared of all charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Mulcahy, from Llandaff, had faced six counts of indecent assault against a female under the age of 13.
It was claimed the offences took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s but she described the allegations as "total lies".
After a week-long trial at Cardiff Crown Court, a jury found her not guilty on all counts.
