Bus services in Republic of Ireland disrupted due to strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus services in the Republic of Ireland are being disrupted for a second day, in a dispute over plans to put some routes out to private tender.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two-day strike by members of SIPTU and the National Bus and Railworkers' Union will end at midnight on Saturday.
However, RTÉ reports that the unions are planning five more stoppages later this month.
Hundreds of thousands of passengers are facing disruption to their travel plans over the bank holiday weekend.
Dublin Bus estimates the two strike days will cost around €1.2m (£890,000) in lost revenue, which does not include a fine from the National Transport Authority of €300,000 (£222,000).
Bus Éireann has said the strike will cost the company €1.5m (£1.1m) in revenue and affect an estimated 250,000 passenger journeys.
