[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wildlife e-brochure has been launched at the Royal Welsh Show by the economy secretary Ken Skates.

The e-brochure features an interactive map of Wales split into areas.
Visitors can click on one to see what kind of wildlife is there in different seasons, for example puffins on Skomer Island or dormice in north Wales.
Mr Skates said it was "astonishing" what had been achieved using a small amount of money and described it as a "very precious resource".
Speaking at the launch in Llanelwedd, he said: "We have record levels in terms of visitors but what we want to do is build on those successes, making sure people come and return time and time again.
"I'm particularly impressed by what you have done with the online resources, not just including top 10 visitor suggestions for each area but for each of the seasons. We have to ensure there's something all year round to offer tourists."
The e-brochure is available online from Monday.
