[SN]TITLE[SN]
Youth Council abolished by Education Minister John O'Dowd

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The abolition of the Youth Council of Northern Ireland is "deeply disappointing", its chief executive has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Education Minister John O'Dowd said that all youth services funded by the Department of Education will now go through the Education Authority.
Ulster Unionist Party MLA Sandra Overend said the decision was "short-sighted".
The body was established in 1990 and has an annual budget of more than Â£3m.
More than 80% of this funding goes to groups like Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade, Scouts and Girl Guides.
The Youth Council provides grants to 37 services in regional areas and helps them to lever more than Â£7m from non Department of Education sources.
Mr O'Dowd said there was a duplication of services provided, and he will now negotiate with executive colleagues to repeal the legislation that governs the body.
Its chief executive, David Guilfoyle, said: "We are obviously deeply disappointed that the minister has gone ahead with his decision to abolish the youth council."
He added: "What we are really concerned about is the future of the services which we provide."
Mr O'Dowd said staff employed by the Youth Council could transfer to the Education Authority.
"I also intend to launch a voluntary exit scheme as soon as possible for Youth Council staff who would wish to consider it," he said.
Mr O'Dowd said he acknowledged there would be a transitional period, but he hoped the "new working arrangements" would "provide the impetus for further improvement across the youth sector".
Mrs Overend said the move was a "power grab" by Mr O'Dowd, "passing increasing powers to an Education Authority which has no policy development function in youth work".
"The fact is that the Youth Council has expertise, experience and a track record of providing support and training for all the major local voluntary youth organisations," she said.
"The Education Authority, like the old Educational and Library Boards, does not have the necessary level of engagement with the voluntary groups who provide valuable services to our young people."
DUP assembly member Peter Weir said Mr O'Dowd's decision was "a cynical exercise in kite flying that he knows is going nowhere".
"It is disappointing that he has chosen to wait until the assembly is no longer in session to make this announcement, presumably to avoid the criticism and opposition within the chamber," he said.
Mr Weir said Mr O'Dowd had ignored the results of a consultation process.
"It is hard to see how this will yield any savings at all, and will put at risk the successful work that is currently in place," he said.
The funding changes will take place in April 2016.
