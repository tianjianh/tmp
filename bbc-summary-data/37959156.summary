[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 5-1 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon enjoyed a first-half blitz as they thrashed Bury for the second time in four days to extend the Shakers' winless run to 12 games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wimbledon's 5-0 victory in their FA Cup first-round replay on Tuesday cost Bury boss David Flitcroft his job but the caretaker duo of Chris Brass and Ryan Kidd fared no better.
Three goals in three minutes midway through the first half killed the game off, the first coming when Dominic Poleon cut the ball back for Chris Whelpdale to divert home.
Less than 60 seconds later Poleon drove forward and fired an unstoppable long-range shot into the net before the forward turned provider again as he squared for Tom Elliott to make it 3-0.
In the 36th minute Bury's Niall Maher fouled George Francomb in the box and the midfielder converted the resulting penalty, although James Vaughan nodded in Danny Mayor's cross before the break to get the Shakers on the board.
But Francomb made it 5-1 just before the hour by calmly slotting Elliott's cross into the bottom corner.
