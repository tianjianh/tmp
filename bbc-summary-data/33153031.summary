Hartlepool's Admiral Court Care home 'disregards humanity', CQC says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Hartlepool care home unlawfully detained residents and showed a disregard for their humanity, the Care Quality Commission has found.

Following surprise inspections in April and May, Admiral Court was deemed inadequate across all fronts.
Inspectors listed a catalogue of errors including unqualified staff, residents not getting food and water and the heat permanently too high.
The BBC has tried to contact the home owner, Four Winds Care.
However, it was not available for comment.
The CQC has previously issued formal warnings to the home for poor maintenance, administration of medication and failing to employ properly qualified staff.
In March the CQC took enforcement action banning the home from taking in any more residents.
In its latest inspection the CQC said the home had failed to address the concerns.
Inspectors also noted: "We found the provider had a disregard for people's humanity and the Human Rights Act, particularly the right to liberty.
"People were unlawfully detained at the home.
"The provider did not have adequate systems in place to protect service users from abuse caused by acts of omission and neglect."
Some residents went for more than a day without getting fresh drinking water while the temperature of the home was kept between 26C (79F) and 28C (82F), making it "uncomfortably hot", the CQC said.
A "disorganised" system also meant some residents were not getting their medication while staff were also handling tablets without wearing gloves which could pose a risk to their own health.
Staff also did not know enough about the residents' individual issues and residents said they were frightened of staff, the inspectors found.
The report said: "There had been occasions when the police should have been called but were not, for instance when allegations of wilful neglect were made or people had physically assaulted others."
A spokesman for Hartlepool Council said: We are aware of the decision taken by the Four Winds Group to give residents 28 days notice to leave Admiral Court, and also the action taken by the Care Quality Commission which required some residents to move within seven days.
"Our priority throughout the process was to ensure that people were safe and well supported, and receiving high quality care that met their needs.
"All residents required to move within seven days were supported to identify alternative accommodation and moves were completed within the required timescale.
"The remaining residents and their families were notified by the provider of the requirement to move within 28 days and were given the same support to identify alternative accommodation.  The last resident left Admiral Court on Friday 5 June."
