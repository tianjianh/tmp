It is one of five commissioned around the UK by The Landmark Trust, to mark the charity's 50th birthday.
The iron sculpture weighs 1,543lbs (700kg) and is the only one that has been placed in a village, the other four have been positioned by the coast.
Sir Antony said the sculpture in Lowsonford, near Henley-in-Arden, looks most impressive when "you look up at it against the sky".
Caroline Stanford, from the Landmark Trust, said it was fitting that it has been placed in "the heart of the Midlands".
