A final commemorative round £1 coin has been struck using a design created by the Bishop of St Asaph following a Royal Mint competition.

It features the Welsh dragon, the English lion, the Scottish unicorn and a stag for Northern Ireland.
Rt Rev Gregory Cameron has also been able to incorporate his initials.
The final batch of round £1 coins for public circulation were struck at the mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff, in December.
A new 12-sided £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.
Rt Rev Cameron, an amateur artist and coin collector, said: "I am absolutely delighted and proud that I have designed the very last commemorative round pound coin.
"In my design, the four heraldic beasts are equal - each has its quarter of the coin.
"There is also some cross-over - parts of each beast cross over into the next. That makes it more dynamic and also symbolic as it shows four separate nations, all an equal part, yet interlinked as they protect Britain's sovereignty, the Crown.
"As a Welshman, I put my initials GKC under the dragon."
Royal Mint commemorative coins director Anne Jessopp said the commemorative "farewell" pound was all the more special, given it was the last.
