NI's uncut roadside verges are helping wildlife thrive

Could cuts in government spending help save Northern Ireland's bee population?

Experts have warned that one third of Ireland's bee species are threatened with extinction, partly due to the decline in wildflower meadows.
According to conservationists, 98% of this species-rich habitat has disappeared in the last 50 years.
An unusual solution has been provided by spending cuts which left many roadside verges uncut over the summer.
In County Fermanagh and Omagh in County Tyrone, a dozen verges were managed as wildlife corridors by Ulster Wildlife.
A small strip was cut to keep sightlines clear for motorists, but allowed the wildflowers which attracted bees and insects to grow.
Giles Knight who is leading Ulster Wildlife's Save Our Magnificent Meadows project said: "Clearly we use roads to get places, well wildlife is exactly the same.
"It travels up and down these corridors to get from meadow to meadow which luckily we still have in places like Fermanagh."
The verges have now been cut and the wildflower seeds collected to help recreate or restore more areas of meadow.
One seed in particular could even provide a money-saving solution to cutting grass along the roadside.
A wildflower called hay rattle weakens more aggressive grasses and creates space for other wildflowers to grow, keeping down the height of the sward.
Mr Knight added: "If you can gather that seed and spread it out, it will lower the height of the grass and increase your chances of having a broad range of wildflowers and insects in the meadow.
"You are saving money from the cutting regime and you are making space for wildlife at the same time."
An overgrown patch of ground at Mount Lourdes Grammar School in Enniskillen is one area that has been transformed into a hay meadow.
Mr Knight said it represents a gentler style of farming: "You're cutting late in the season, you're allowing the flowers to set seed, you're taking the crop, but you're giving wildlife a bit of a chance to flourish over the summer."
"That's why so many species of wildlife have disappeared because the silage making culture has changed the face of the landscape completely."
