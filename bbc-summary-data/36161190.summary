The man is thought to have been hit by the moving boom on a Giraffe crane on the deck of the north tower.
It is understood the 60-year-old suffered severe blood loss and he was unable to be resuscitated.
Another man was injured in the incident. Work has stopped for investigations to take place.
The bridge, ordered by ministers because of corrosion of the main suspension cable on the Forth Road Bridge from Fife to Edinburgh, is due to be completed by the end of the year.
Work started in 2011 and the death is thought to be the first fatality at the site.
The site reopened on Friday morning to allow the man's colleagues to "come together and and support each other", a project spokesman said.
"Everyone on the site has been deeply affected by this tragedy and specialist support is being made available for anyone who needs it," he added.
It will close at 13:00 and it will remain shut until Tuesday morning.
The project spokesman said: "The return to work will start with a mark of respect for our lost colleague."
Harry Frew, Ucatt Scottish regional secretary, said his thoughts were with the man's family.
He told the BBC Scotland news website: "We were just on our way back from a Worker's Memorial Day ceremony in Glasgow Green to commemorate workers who have been killed at work when we heard the news.
"I am very saddened about this tragedy and our thoughts are with his family."
A Forth Replacement Crossing spokesman said: "We are deeply saddened to have to confirm there was an incident just before noon on 28 April on the Queensferry Crossing's north tower in which a person has lost his life.
"One other person has been taken to hospital. All activity has been stopped at the north tower.
"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of our colleague and co-worker at this time."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "We are currently working alongside our partner agencies to investigate an incident on the Queensferry Crossing Bridge that resulted in a man sustaining fatal injuries.
"The call was received around 12.20 on Thursday and sadly, the man was pronounced dead a short time later.
"Another man on the bridge also sustained minor injuries.
"Inquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding this matter are ongoing."
