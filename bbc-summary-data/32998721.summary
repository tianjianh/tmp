Gunmen have shot dead two police officers on guard close to the Giza pyramids, in a rare attack on a tourist site, state media reported.

The unknown attackers fled the area, and an investigation is under way, the Mena news agency said.
Egypt has seen regular attacks on security forces since the army ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013.
But most incidents have been confined to the restive Sinai peninsula.
There, the authorities are battling jihadists who have pledged loyalty to Islamic State.
The Egyptian capital, Cairo, has also seen a series of attacks by Ajnad Misr, an militant group that has vowed to avenge the crackdown on Islamists that followed Mr Morsi's ousting.
No group has yet said it carried out the drive-by shooting at the pyramids.
But correspondents say it is likely to concern the authorities, keen to boost a tourism industry disrupted by Egypt's political turmoil.
