Resuming on 53-2, Rob Keogh (88 not out) helped the home side to 343 in their second innings, leaving Worcestershire needing 148 to win.
Opener Daryl Mitchell followed his first-innings 161 by scoring 78 not out to guide his team to victory.
The visitors utilised the extra eight overs of play to wrap up an eight-wicket success at Wantage Road.
Mitchell finished the match in style with three fours and a six off Steven Crook to complete a win which keeps Worcestershire in touch with Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire.
Their maximum 24-point haul lifts them to second, within 13 of fellow three-day winners Notts, but Steve Rhodes' side have a game in hand.
The day was marred slightly by an injury to Northants batsman Richard Levi, who retired hurt after being hit on the helmet by a Josh Tongue bouncer.
Levi was taken to hospital for a precautionary scan, which revealed he was suffering from a mild concussion, but he was later allowed to return home.
Northants captain Alex Wakely told BBC Radio Northampton:
"Worcester have outplayed us. Their disciplines were much better than ours. We fought well, but we lost that game in the first innings with both bat and ball.
"Our statistics are pretty poor with the bat. You're not going to win games of cricket with that.
"We're making the same mistakes over and over again. We've got to find a way to not do that."
Worcestershire captain Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"I challenged the guys at the start of the week to get us a position to win the game and we've done that.
"Hats off to Mitch for two fantastic innings in this game and the bowlers have toiled away well too.
"12 months ago we probably played similar cricket but didn't win a game. This time we've managed to kill sides off when we've had the chance."
