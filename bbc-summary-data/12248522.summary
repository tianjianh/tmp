[SN]TITLE[SN]
Court to rule on extradition of Ian Bailey over death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish High Court will decide if a Briton can be extradited to France for questioning over the murder of a film-maker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former journalist, Ian Bailey, 53, is wanted by authorities in Paris over the killing of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, 39, who was beaten to death in west Cork in 1996.
Mr Bailey was arrested twice by gardai in connection with the murder investigation but he was never charged.
He denies any involvement in her death.
Ms Toscan du Plantier was found dead outside her holiday home at Toormore, near Schull, two days before Christmas 1996.
Under French law, authorities can investigate the suspicious death of a citizen abroad but cannot compel witnesses to go to Paris for questioning.
Investigating magistrate Patrick Gachon was appointed by officials in Paris to conduct an inquiry into Ms Toscan du Plantier's violent death after the Director of Public Prosecutions in Ireland announced nobody would be charged.
A European arrest warrant was issued for Bailey.
During a two-day hearing in December 2010 barrister Martin Giblin, senior counsel for Mr Bailey, argued there has been no new evidence against him to support an extradition.
He also maintained the application was an insult to the Irish state and the DPP, who has repeatedly directed that no prosecution be taken.
Mr Justice Michael Peart will deliver his judgment on Friday morning.
Manchester-born Mr Bailey, a recent law graduate, lives in Schull with his partner Jules Thomas.
He worked as a journalist in Gloucester and Cheltenham before moving to Ireland in 1991.
