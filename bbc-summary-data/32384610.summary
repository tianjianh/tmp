Aberdeen-based BWE Partnership has already gained planning permission for a 9.5MW solar photovoltaic (PV) park on farmland at Carmyllie, near Arbroath.
BWE said the project could produce enough energy to power 6,670 homes.
It has already secured a 9.5MW connection agreement with Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution.
The firm expects the New Mains of Guynd park to start generating electricity early next year.
BWE owner Ron Shanks said: "This is an exciting time for BWE Partnership as we enter the construction stage of delivering what we believe is Scotland's first large commercial solar park.
"This site was selected because of its excellent levels of irradiance which is vital to the effectiveness of a solar park as this powers the entire project.
"Scotland continues to build a strong reputation in the renewable energy sector and the build of this solar park will represent a significant step forward."
