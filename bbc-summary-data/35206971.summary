The offenders entered the property on Hemming Way on the Britwell estate in Slough between 07:00 and 07:30 GMT and ordered them into a van parked outside.
The boys, aged six and 10, got into the vehicle which travelled to Upper Lees Road, where they were able to escape and run back to Hemming Way uninjured.
Other people who were inside the property were not disturbed during the abduction, police said.
Det Insp Nicola Hurdley said police were in the "early stages" of working to establish a motive.
She said: "The incident itself only lasted for several minutes and violence was not used against either victim, however it is understandably upsetting for them and their relatives, given their young age, and officers are currently providing support to them."
Police said the suspects had their faces covered and were wearing dark clothing.
The van is described as white and may have been a Ford Transit.
Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
