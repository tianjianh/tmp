[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Neville was at Moor Lane to see Salford score twice in the final 12 minutes to beat Workington 3-2 in their Northern Premier League play-off final.
It means Salford will play in National League North next season.
'Class of 92' members Neville, brother Phil, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt took a 50% stake in 2014.
The club were promoted last season and this term reached the FA Cup second round, featuring in live TV games against Notts County and Hartlepool United.
Their progress was followed in a two-part BBC documentary 'Out of Their League', which has been commissioned for a second series.
