Stafford rail station aids 'hopeless romantic' in her plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "hopeless romantic" has put an advert in the window of a railway ticket office in an attempt to track down a man she "exchanged smiles and eye contact with".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The poster, headed "searching for you" is on display at Stafford station.
If the tall man who was wearing a grey suit recognises himself, he is urged to contact staff at the counter.
A Virgin Trains spokesman said the love-struck woman had contacted them to help find the man she saw on 6 August.
A hopeless romantic is looking for the man she exchanged lots of smiles and eye contact with here on Thursday 6th August between 5:50-7pm.
Was it you? Tall, silver/grey hair, wearing a grey suit, black shoes and with a black wheeled case.
If so you will recognise the lady in question... slim, blonde hair, luggage, black leather jacket, black boots, 44yrs old.
Her train arrived at platform 1 at 6:56pm and you went over to watch her board. She was too shy to speak but would really like to get in touch.
If this was you & you would like to make contact, please see a member of ticket office staff.
The Virgin Trains spokesman said: "Being the soppy, romantic souls we are we're hoping this brief encounter will lead to a fairytale ending.
"So if the mystery man is out there please do get in touch."
The notice, a picture of which has been posted on Facebook by BBC Radio Stoke, has attracted comments including "hope all goes well", "I hope she finds him", "he could be married but good luck" and "he was just perving. You won't be the only one".
