[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 2-4 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham maintained their unbeaten Championship away record with their first win at Barnsley since 1970.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The London club twice fell behind as home strikers Marley Watkins and Sam Winnall beat the offside trap.
Lucas Piazon's left-foot shot and Sone Aluko's neat finish ensured Fulham were level at the interval and Scott Malone put them in front after the restart.
Chris Martin headed the fourth before Barnsley's Josh Scowen was shown a straight red card for a rash tackle.
The match was the first meeting between the sides since 2001, but Barnsley went into it having managed only one point from their previous four games and without influential skipper Conor Hourihane.
His replacement, Sam Morsy, provided the passes for Watkins and Winnall to score with composed finishes, although it was Fulham who had the majority of possession in the first half of a high-tempo contest.
Home keeper Adam Davies was deceived by Malone's cross-cum-shot as Slavisa Jokanovic's team went in front for the first time, and the full-back then provided the assist for Martin's header.
Scowen's dismissal for a challenge on former England midfielder Scott Parker capped a dismal afternoon for the home side as Fulham moved up to ninth in the Championship table after their first league win since August, with Barnsley two places below them.
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom: "I am disappointed, watching the goals back they were terrible on our part. If you give four goals away like that you haven't got a chance.
"When we went in front we didn't keep the ball, and weren't composed on the ball to give ourselves a rest to control the game.
(On Scowen's dismissal) "I thought he won the ball but they are saying he was out of control because he left the floor. However, he was fouled twice in the build up, why the referee wants to play advantage I don't know.
"Scowy won the ball in the box and was fouled and the referee played on. I thought that could have been managed a hell of a lot better."
Fulham boss Slavia Jokanovic:  "After a very bad September we started after the international break with victory, that's very important for us.
"We are a team unbeaten away, but our problem is at home. We come under pressure and we are not as comfortable without the ball as we are away from Craven Cottage.
"We showed great ambition and good character after the poor start, we showed enough desire.
"We need to improve ourselves at home. We offer good afternoons for our away fans, now we need to do it at Craven Cottage."
