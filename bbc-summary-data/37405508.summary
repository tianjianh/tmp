Alli, 20, signed a five-and-a-half-year contract when he joined from MK Dons for an initial Â£5m in February 2015.
He made his first appearance for Spurs on the opening day of last season, scored 10 goals in 46 matches and signed an improved contract in January.
Alli made his England debut in October 2015, and scored on his full debut against France the following month.
"I can't think of anywhere better with the fans, the manager and the young team we've got here - it's a great place to be," he said.
Eric Dier, a team-mate for club and country, signed a new five-year deal last week.
