Bridgend council, together with the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), spent a total of £2,800 on six training sessions.
It comes as the council began live streaming meetings online in January.
Plaid Cymru said it was "concerned" by the use of taxpayers' money but the council said it was necessary so the service was "delivered properly".
A Freedom of Information request, obtained by Plaid Cymru, revealed £1,400 was spent on two days' training for 24 councillors last July.
Four more sessions costing £1,400 for 150 members and officers took place in January.
Topics included "What is webcasting?" and "Being on camera" as well as "How to get your message across" and "Dos and don'ts - avoiding the pitfalls".
To date, the council has webcast five committee meetings which have attracted 1,716 views between them.
A council spokesman said the total cost to the authority was £700, with the WLGA providing the rest of the funding.
"The training has been provided so the council can ensure that webcasting is delivered properly and in such a manner that the public receives a full understanding of the service," the spokesman said.
