There will be guarded optimism surrounding the prospect of facing Bayern Munich, Sevilla and Monaco
The Foxes, in their debut campaign, have a tough test against Europa League champions Sevilla.
Manchester City's opponents Monaco beat Tottenham twice in Group E.
One of the other standout ties of the round pits Spanish champions Barcelona against French champions Paris St-Germain. Barca beat PSG in the quarter-finals en route to winning the title during the 2014-15 season.
Champions and La Liga leaders Real Madrid face Italian side Napoli, who are fourth in Serie A.
Reaction to the Champions League & Europa League draws
Man Utd v Saint Etienne, Tottenham v Gent - Europa League draw
(First legs to be played on 14 & 15 and 21 & 22 February 2017; second legs on 7 & 8 and 14 & 15 March)
Arsenal have been knocked out by Bayern the past three times they have met in the knockout stage.
Gunners club secretary David Miles told BT Sport: "We are through to the knockout stage for the 14th consecutive season, which is testament to manager Arsene Wenger and the teams throughout that time.
"But the fans will think we have got the rough end of the draw again - at some stage the tide has got to turn and we will beat them."
Bayern skipper Philipp Lahm tweeted: "Tough draw as Arsenal is in really good shape. Looking forward to seeing my former colleagues from the national team again!"
Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain said Monaco should not be underestimated.
He added: "Monaco are playing probably the best football in France now.
"In the group of Tottenham and Bayer Leverkusen, they were top. They have young players and a lot of talent. They play good football. It is a good draw."
Manager Claudio Ranieri said his Leicester side were set for a tough challenge against a "big, big, big team".
"I know that Sevilla have lifted the Europa League three times in three years - it is unbelievable," said the Italian, who led the Foxes to their first Premier League title last season.
"Now they are third in the league and have lost only three so far. They are fighting to win the title with Real Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, so that tells you how good they are."

The Premier League's three representatives have all been handed tough draws - but also ties that will offer them the realistic opportunity of progress.
Arsenal, Premier League champions Leicester City, and Manchester City could have been given easier opponents but there will also be guarded optimism surrounding the prospect of facing Bayern Munich, Sevilla and Monaco.
The Gunners are aiming to end a run of six successive exits at this stage and some may curse the draw that pairs them with Bayern.
It is not a comfortable reward for topping their group and they have suffered before against Bayern in this competition.
Leicester City will give anyone a tough time if they play with the intensity and power they showed in thrashing Manchester City at the weekend.
Monaco's displays in beating Tottenham home and away will have warned Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola about their quality, and he also has serious defensive issues to address.
