[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors led from their first attack, former Hatters defender Luke Wilkinson heading home from a corner after just three minutes.
Luton almost equalised after 10 minutes, but Pelly Ruddock's header was cleared off the line by Jack King.
Ben Kennedy almost took advantage of a poor free-kick from goalkeeper Matt Macey, chipping over the top.
Chris Day denied Isaac Vassell and the Stevenage stopper then tipped over Dan Potts' deflected effort, while Charlie Lee put a good chance over.
Steven Schumacher cleared Danny Hylton's header off the line, and Vassell's attempt in the 66th minute went just wide.
Day made a superb stop from Ollie Palmer's close-range header late on, and Stevenage clinched victory when Kennedy smashed an effort into the top corner.
