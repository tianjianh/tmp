Companies to bid for Bristol Arena lease

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three companies wanting to run a £91m entertainment arena in Bristol are being asked to bid for a 25-year lease.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bristol Arena, a 12,000-seat music venue, will be located at the Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone.
The arena is part of the city's plan to regenerate about 70 hectares (170 acres) surrounding Bristol Temple Meads station and is due to open in 2017.
The bidders have until 1 September to submit their applications to Bristol City Council.
They must outline how they would run the facility and the amount they would pay as an annual lease to the council.
The authority will select a preferred and reserved bidder in October, with the contract running for at least 25 years.
The winning bidder will be involved in the design of the arena and in charge of operating, maintaining and managing it for the duration of the lease.
West of England Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) will contribute £53m towards the cost of building the arena, with the remaining £38m funded by Bristol City Council.
The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is also investing £11m in regenerating and improving access to the site.
