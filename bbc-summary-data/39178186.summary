The 45-year-old former Beverly Hills, 90210 star was diagnosed in 2015 and recently posted on Instagram that she was "done with chemo and radiation".
In the same message, she said she was "waiting to see if I'm clear or not".
At Saturday's Animal Hope and Wellness Foundation's Gratitude Gala, she told People.com: "I feel great, I feel like lucky. Lucky that I'm here."
She attended the event with the charity's founder Marc Ching.
Speaking to People, she added that she was "lucky that I'm standing next to Marc, lucky that I get to be a part of this foundation, lucky that we get to be a voice tonight for the voiceless, and just lucky".
She has not given a fuller update on her health after completing her chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
But she did post this video of herself taking part in an energetic exercise routine on Friday with the hashtag "#cancerslayer".
Her husband Kurt Iswarienko posted an excerpt from a speech she gave at Saturday's gala.
"The animals Mark [sic] rescues touch my heart," she said. "I see the ones he saves... I see their spirit, I see their drive to live, and most importantly their ability to forgive and to once again love.
"I see all of this, and I gotta tell you, I am so humbled. They've encouraged me to face adversity with the same strength and grace they display in the face of destruction."
Doherty is known for playing Brenda in hit 1990s teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 as well as Heather Duke in the 1989 film Heathers and Prue in TV series Charmed.
