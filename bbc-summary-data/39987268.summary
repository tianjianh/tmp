Super troupers Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth are set to reprise their roles.
The songs of Abba will also be back to provide a fresh soundtrack, featuring some songs which did not make it in to the original.
Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is scheduled for release in July 2018.
The original film was based on a musical first staged in London's West End, but its successor is set to be written and directed by British filmmaker Ol Parker.
Abba members Benny Andersson and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus will be executive producers, Deadline reported in an article later tweeted by Mr Parker.
He is best known as writer of the The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy.
The 2008 Mamma Mia was based on a bride-to-be's scheme to discover her father's identity - by inviting all three possible candidates to her wedding.
Despite mixed reviews, it made money, money, money - an estimated $600m (Â£460m) worldwide, almost 12 times its budget.
The musical is so successful there has even been a musical restaurant based on the Greek wedding of the plot.
