Rakish Bingham cancelled out Michael Gardyne's splendid opener for County.
The home side regained the lead through a Remi Matthews own goal but substitute David Templeton looked to have earned a draw for the visitors.
However, Franks' strike proved decisive and means Accies can not finish higher than 11th in the table.
Martin Canning's men could still go down automatically if bottom side Inverness Caledonian Thistle can overcome the four-point difference between the sides in their final two matches.
Hamilton's defeat ensures that Dundee are guaranteed Premiership football next season, with Motherwell's win over Kilmarnock also ensuring their safety.
Accies will argue they deserved something from this match, perhaps even all three points. This defeat will hurt badly.
They dug in after a disastrous start and should have been ahead by half-time.
A slice of luck arrived with Bingham's leveller when Ali Crawford's delivery ricocheted in the box and fell perfectly for the striker to slam home. Their fortune ended there in dramatic fashion.
Bingham smashed a shot off the inside of the post soon after. It was unlucky but much more was to follow.
It seemed Crawford had put them ahead with an outstanding free kick from a central area. It sailed over the wall, away from Fox but clipped the inside of the post and out again.
After the break a ball along the six-yard line came through to Greg Docherty, he side-footed from close range for what looked a certain goal but Fox produced an outstanding stop.
Docherty and Massimo Donati came close before substitute Templeton quickly restored parity after Jim O'Brien saw his effort smash off a post and in off Matthews.
It'd be hard to find a more convincing hard luck story.
Hamilton's work rate and commitment was impressive. Their fight under pressure equally so. They also showed they've got ability.
What they don't have is three points. They needed them.
Jim McIntyre's side initially looked very impressive. They were on the front foot and went ahead swiftly.
Gardyne gathered a short corner, ambled to the edge of the box and curled a terrific curling shot into the top corner. It was top quality.
It was poor defensively and at that stage Hamilton looked up against it.
Franks was unfortunate with a technically excellent volley that flew wide.
Christopher Routis twice had excellent opportunities but hesitated at one, then couldn't beat Matthews with the other.
Their second goal came from an excellent strike from O'Brien. It cracked off the post and, in utter contrast to Hamilton's earlier efforts, cannoned of Matthews and into the net. When your luck is out, it's out.
There was no doubt about the quality of their winner though. Franks sent a tremendous effort straight into the corner to settle a brilliant contest.
McIntyre's side remain on target for a seventh place finish which would be a satisfying outcome after missing the top six.
The unbeaten run that took them clear of relegation trouble now stretches to seven matches.
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "It was a very open game. We started the game brilliantly, scored a fantastic goal through Michael Gardyne, but Hamilton came right back into it. It was one of those nights with plenty of mistakes and lots of goalmouth action.
"We've had our pockets picked here before in Dingwall with late goals. I feel we picked theirs tonight. I feel for Hamilton tonight but it's all about our team doing what we can do, trying to get into that fight for seventh.
"We know that we have the quality that can hurt sides but the doggedness wasn't quite there tonight and that is the side that we need to improve for Saturday. I thought Hamilton's players gave their manager everything. I wish them well for their fight to stay up."
Hamilton boss Martin Canning: "I can't believe we have lost that game. We have hit the post twice, one rolled along the line and we've had numerous other opportunities.

"Their second goal has come off the post, hit our keeper and gone in. That is when you know your luck is out.
"The amount of bad luck we have got tonight is scary. I couldn't ask more of the players. I asked them to be brave and it was one of our best performances of the season. How we have managed to lose that game, I don't know."
