Shares in the credit card firm rose 9% after it raised its 2016 profit forecast and reported better-than-expected third quarter revenue.
Overall, the Dow Jones was 40 points lower at 18,162, while the wider S&P 500 was flat down 2 points at 2,144.
The tech-focused Nasdaq slipped by 4 points to 5,241.
On the downside, Ebay tumbled more than 10% after forecasts for the current quarter, the crucial holiday season, disappointed investors.
Verizon fell nearly 2.5% percent after the company posted weak revenue for the third quarter, having added fewer than expected new subscribers.
It also indicated it is considering renegotiating its $4.8bn (Â£3.9bn) deal to buy Yahoo Inc.
The company's chief financial officer said they were working on the basis that the security breach at Yahoo earlier this year which involved 500 million email accounts could affect the transaction.
Yahoo's shares fell 0.8% percent.
