Przemyslaw Kaluzny was previously a member of a Polish criminal gang who stole cars to order before moving to Scotland a year before his attack.
The 41-year-old pleaded guilty to the charges at a hearing in December.
He will now be sent back to Poland to serve his sentence after immigration papers were served on him.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard Kaluzny has previously served a series of jail terms in Poland for violent offences, including a four-and-a-half year sentence for robbery and 10 months for hostage taking.
His rampage through the Dundee Toys R Us store in April 2015 was captured on CCTV.
A sheriff branded the crime "horrifying and terrifying" before jailing him for three years.
The court heard how Kaluzny had taken at least five ecstasy tablets that he found in a Kinder Egg on the street before running amok in the store.
He stripped off as he walked through the shop and then picked up a six-year-old boy who was on a day out with his father and grandmother.
The boy started screaming as Kaluzny grabbed him and tried to leave the store.
He was then tackled by a store worker who rammed him with a trolley before the boy's grandmother - who cannot be named to protect the boy's identity - hit him with her handbag.
Staff and shoppers then dived on top of Kaluzny as he struggled to get free.
In December, Kaluzny pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing an offensive weapon, behaving in a threatening and abusive manner, public indecency, abduction, assault, assault to injury and vandalism.
Defence solicitor Nicola Brown said: "He was part of a ring of heavy duty criminals at home who in effect stole vehicles to order and that's why his previous sentences have been fairly lengthy.
"He is remorseful about this incident. He just wants to be sentenced and extradited back to Poland, where his mother is currently very unwell."
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC jailed Kaluzny for three years - reduced from four for his early guilty plea.
She said: "It must have been a horrifying and terrifying experience for everyone in Toys R Us that day, but particularly for that six-year-old boy and his grandmother."
