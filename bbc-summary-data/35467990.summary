Wycombe won it when Cowan-Hall headed over keeper Mark Cousins from close in.
Dagenham remain in the relegation places, while Wycombe move up to sixth spot, above Leyton Orient on goal difference.

"I know that we're capable that we're winning four or five games together. The side's getting stronger.
"The power in the team is beginning to come through. We showed good quality."
"As long as we keep to the pattern that we're working to, I think the rest will slip into place. There's so much good stuff, so much energy in our team today. We went down to ten men and you wouldn't have noticed."
