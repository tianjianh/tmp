A Met Office yellow "be aware" warning covered the Western Isles, Wester Ross, Sutherland, Argyll, Lochaber and parts of Tayside and central Scotland.
Play at the Open golf championship at St Andrews has been suspended due to rain.
Police Scotland urged rush hour drivers to "slow down and take care."
At The Open play was suspended before the first group had even managed to finish the first hole on the second day of the championship.
The downpour saw a torrent of water gushing down Golf Place, the road leading to the R&A clubhouse, with the greens quickly flooding.
Warnings about problems caused by the heavy rain were issued for road users on the M9, M90 and A90.
The A82 Inverness to Drumnadrochit road was partially blocked at Lochend by a mud-slip.
Standing water on A90 at Crammond Brig was causing delays for those heading into Edinburgh and in the south side of Glasgow, Haggs Road was closed between Pollokshaws Road and St Andrews Drive because of flooding.
Forecasters said winds could gust to speeds of 50mph, while heavy rain has also been forecast for Saturday.
The weather warning covers from 01:00 on Friday until 21:00 on Saturday, with Argyll and Lochaber due to see the heaviest rain.
The Met Office said: "A rather vigorous area of low pressure for the time of year, will bring a combination of strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Scotland.
"The worst of this arrives in two separate episodes - a six to nine-hour period of heavy, thundery rain overnight into Friday, and then slightly less intense but more persistent rain setting in later Friday and lasting well through Saturday.
"Total rainfall will typically be 25 to 50mm but with some areas, particularly over high ground, receiving more than 80mm over the two days."
