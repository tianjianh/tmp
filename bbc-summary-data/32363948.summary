His win came after Kristian Thomas won Britain's first gold in Montpellier.
Becky Downie took silver in the uneven bars, with younger sister Ellie finishing in fourth place.
The 15-year-old, who won bronze in the all-around on Friday, finished just 0.1 points adrift of third in an event won by Russia's Anastasia Spiridonova.
Thomas, 26, had earlier won his first international individual apparatus gold by scoring 15.166 with a clean routine on the floor.
And Smith, who came out of retirement last year and wants to compete at next year's Olympic Games in Rio, matched his team-mate's achievement in his favoured event.
"It's unbelievable. This for me was a trial, a massive competition for me to prove that I'm willing to go all the way," Smith told BBC Sport.
"It doesn't rest with this. Rio is in my mind; I want to be there."
Smith was first up in the eight-man final and admitted to feeling tense.
"I was so nervous before my routine because it meant a lot more to me," said Smith.
"It's been a journey just to get back to this point and to get gold just after Kristian is just brilliant.
"I had a break after London 2012 and I made the decision to get back into it. It would be silly to waste what I've got.
"It's going to be a very busy summer trying to get into the team for the World Championships."
