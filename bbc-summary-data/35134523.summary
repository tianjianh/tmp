Tyler Thompson was discovered with a stab wound in Freeman Road North, Leicester, on 24 November, and later died in hospital.
Bizzi Dixon, who organised a memorial gig, said it was important people came together at this "terrible time".
An 18-year-old man, from Litelmede, Leicester, has been charged with Tyler's murder.
Mr Dixon, who lives in Leicester, said: "Tyler's family's lives have been turned upside down.
"He was a wonderful, bubbly, friendly young man.
"He was very popular with young people and the community has been touched with the loss of young Tyler."
The Gone Too Soon event at the Music Cafe on Thursday managed to raise Â£951 towards Tyler's funeral and Mr Dixon is still taking donations.
Megan Thompson, Tyler's sister, said she would always remember her brother's "smile and laugh".
She said he always wanted to be around his family.
Natalie Holt, Tyler's aunt, said: "I remember holding Tyler when he was 10 minutes old and his smile, it didn't matter whether he was being naughty or good, he constantly smiled.
"He was elated I bought him chinos for his birthday [once] he was over the moon with that."
Pravdit Sian, 18, is due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday charged with Tyler Thompson's murder.
