Parliament must undo Iraq war mistake - ex-MP Adam Price

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Houses of Parliament must "undo" the mistake of the Iraq war, former Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price has said.

Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Price argued for MPs and lords to act against former Prime Minister Tony Blair in the wake of the Chilcot report.
He said the House of Commons' support for the war "left a stain on our democracy".
Mr Price, who is now an AM, was part of a campaign to impeach Mr Blair over Iraq a decade ago.
The original impeachment procedure, considered to be obsolete, allows parliament to prosecute and try peers and commoners.
It has not been used since 1806.
The Chilcot report concluded Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, sent ill-prepared troops into battle and had "wholly inadequate" plans for the aftermath.
Mr Price said: "Parliament that made this mistake must now undo it by using the tools at its disposal."
He said a modern version of impeachment - contempt of parliament - if passed on a parliamentary motion "would require the former prime minister to stand at the bar of the house as the indictment was read out".
He suggested other sanctions, such as the stripping of a privy counsellorship or a symbolic night detained by the parliament's sergeant at arms "would be available to parliament as it saw fit".
"But, for many, closure will come at the return of the ex-prime minister to the scene... this time not to repeat a self-serving apology withdrawn sliver by sliver over the course of a two-hour press conference, but to simply stand silent and alone as history's verdict is delivered," Mr Price wrote.
The AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said the House of Commons' support for the war "left a stain on our democracy through a complete collapse of public trust in government".
"Iraq's bitterest legacy may yet be this post-truth era of anti-politics, where every politician and every expert is deemed to be disingenuous," he added.
Mr Blair has apologised for any mistakes made, but not the decision to go to war.
