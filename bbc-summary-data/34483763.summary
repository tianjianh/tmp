The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) Lancaster landed safely at RAF Coningsby in May after it misfired during a training flight.
The aircraft has since undergone extensive repairs.
The Lancaster, one of only two in the world permitted to fly, has missed most of the 2015 display season.
Sqd Ldr Martin Morris, of the BBMF, said: "The engineers have been busy beavering away and we are confident she is mechanically ready to go.
"We will conduct an air test on Monday - dependant on the weather - and then we are looking at planning additional sorties flying over key locations in Lincolnshire."
He added: "I'm checking what we are able to do, and then we will be in the lap of the gods in terms of the weather.
"It's possible we might also take her further afield."
The BBMF said it was only right people were able to see the aircraft flying ahead of its winter maintenance programme. It said it would announce further details when confirmed.
