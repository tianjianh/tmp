Leinster Lightning and the Northern Knights earned victories in Friday's Inter-Provincial T20 games.

Holders Lightning earned a 56-run win over the North West Warriors at Bready helped by George Dockrell's three wickets and Andrew Balbirnie's 44.
Leinster hit 153 and after reducing the Warriors to 42-6, eased to victory.
The Northern Knights clinched a nine-run DL win over debutants the Munster Reds in a rain-affected game at The Mardyke in Cork.
At Bready, Johnny Robinson hit three sixes in an unbeaten 37-ball 38 but it was too little, too late as the Warriors were dismissed for 97.
Ireland spinner Dockrell produced figures of 3-20 with Eddie Richardson (3-11) and Kevin O'Brien (2-14) the other main wicket-takers.
Earlier, Balbirnie top-scored with 44 from 31 balls to get Lightning off to a strong start before three Andy McBrine wickets had the game evenly poised at 92-6.
However, Lightning added 60 in the last seven overs with Dockrell (29 not out) and Max Sorensen (23) making vital contributions.
In Cork, Adam Dennison (33) and Graeme McCarter (25) led the Knights out of the traps as they raced to 82 for 2 in just eight overs.
They were pegged back by a superb spell from Stephan Grobler (3-12) which saw them faltering at 124-8 after 15 overs when the rain came.
On the resumption, Munster needed a DL adjusted 122 to win, but despite a quite brilliant 59 from 40 balls by Jack Tector, he received little in the way of meaningful support before play was halted by bad light with Munster 92-8 after 13 overs.
That meant the Knights were declared nine-run winners.
The next action in the competition is on Monday, when the Warriors host Knights in a 50-over game at Strabane, followed by the maiden first-class match between the same opponents at Eglinton on Tuesday.
