The third seed, who saved a match point against Grigor Dimitrov on Thursday, won 4-6 6-1 6-4 on Friday.
Murray said: "I fought and gave everything I had, but thankfully it's just been enough in the last two days."
Federer beat Feliciano Lopez 6-3 6-4, while Novak Djokovic and Alexandr Dolgopolov reached the other semi.
The Scot has now won more matches in 2015 then any other male player, 56, and with the US Open beginning on 31 August, he will be looking for a third Grand Slam title.
Against the dangerous Gasquet, he failed to convert a break point in the eighth game of the opening set and then paid the penalty when his opponent broke his serve in the next game to serve out for the set.
Murray recovered to earn a double break in the second and although he had break points against him in two of his own serve games, he took the set 6-1 in 31 minutes.
He broke Gasquet again to lead 2-1 at the start of the third, but just when he appeared to have broken his opponent's resistance, he was distracted by the lengthening shadows and the spider camera situated above centre court and momentarily lost his composure and then his serve.
The world number two continued to look threatening on the Frenchman's serve and earned three break points in the ninth game. Although Gasquet saved one of them, he double-faulted to give Murray the opportunity he needed to serve for the match.
Murray added: "I was sluggish at the start, but as the match went on I was striking the ball better and was dictating a lot of points without having to do as much running.
"Physically I'm tired and my body hurts, but with the US Open coming up these matches are good for me physically and mentally to get through."
Federer, 34, needed just 61 minutes to see off Lopez, with the Swiss chasing a seventh Cincinnati title.
The world number one looked imperious in his 6-4 6-1 victory over his French Open final conqueror Stan Wawrinka, and will now face qualifier Dolgopolov, who upset world number six Tomas Berdych6-4 6-2.
Djokovic has won every Masters 1000 title except Cincinnati and will become the first player to complete the set of nine if he wins.
"My performance came at the right time against one of my biggest rivals and the guy I lost to last time we played in the finals of the French Open," said the Serb.
"Obviously I approached this match very seriously in trying to prepare myself and get myself in a good position to win."
In the women's quarter-finals, world number one Serena Williams overcame stern opposition from Serb Ana Ivanovic to win 3-6 6-4 6-2.
"I was lethargic in the first set and she played incredibly well; I just had to do better," said the American, playing her final tournament before she tries try to win the calendar Grand Slam at the US Open next month. .
"This was my best performance since (winning) Wimbledon. I hope to take the momentum into the next match."
Williams will next play 14th seed Elina Svitolina, after the Ukrainian beat Czech Lucie Safarova 6-4 2-6 6-0.
Third seed Simona Halep of Romania saw off Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-6 (7-3) 6-2, and Serbia's Jelena Jankovic beat Slovakian qualifier Anna Karolina Schmiedlova 6-4 6-2.
