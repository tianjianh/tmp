Casey Kasem family row impedes DJ's burial plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DJ Casey Kasem has still not been laid to rest a month after his death due to a legal wrangle amongst his family.

A Washington state judge granted a temporary court order to Kasem's daughter, preventing his second wife from removing his remains from a funeral home in Tacoma.
Kerri Kasem is seeking authorisation for a post-mortem on her father.
Kasem was a voiceover artist and host of the American Top 40, and the voice of Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo cartoons.
He died on 15 June after suffering from a form of dementia, with his care at the centre of a serious rift between his family.
Before Kasem's death, a judge granted an order allowing his daughter to withhold food, liquids and medication from him against the wishes of his wife of 34 years.
His daughter has expressed concerns that his body could be cremated or taken to Canada by his widow Jean, negating the possibility of a post-mortem.
The radio host's wife has rights over his remains, while his daughter held the medical conservatorship in the final part of his life.
A small, private memorial service for Kasem was held in California last month, but his second wife and their daughter Liberty did not attend.
The children from the 82-year-old's first marriage are hoping to bury him in California in accordance with his final wishes.
The judge moved to ensure Kasem's body was not taken from the funeral home while a decision is being considered about allowing a post-mortem examination to take place.
The broadcaster began his career in the 1950s and found fame with the chart programme.
He famously ended his broadcasts with his signature sign-off: "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars."
After spells hosting countdown shows under other titles, he returned to American Top 40 in the 1990s and retired from the airwaves in 2009.
Around the world, his radio rundown was broadcast in 50 countries and he was known for the spin-off TV show America's Top 10.
In Scooby-Doo, Kasem voiced the character of Shaggy from the first series in 1969 until 1995, and again from 2002 until 2009.
