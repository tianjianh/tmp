A bin lorry seized by detectives searching for a missing airman has been released, after it was found not to contain his lost phone.

Police searched the lorry after finding its route matched the movements of Corrie Mckeague's mobile phone.
Mr Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds 10 days ago.
Police have appealed for anyone who has seen the Nokia Lumia 435 phone in a tattered black case to contact them.
Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 BST on 24 September.
It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to his base alone.
Police said they were still exploring the "possibilities around where the phone may be and searches for it are continuing".
"The work shows the phone was in Bury St Edmunds early on Saturday 24 September but then moved to the Barton Mills area."
The phone, described as being in a PVC case, had not been used since 08:00 BST on the day Mr Mckeague went missing, police have said.
Officers again renewed their appeal for any sightings of Mr Mckeague, reiterating the message his mother Nicola Urquhart gave at a press conference in Bury on Monday when she urged any possible witnesses to contact the police.
Mrs Urquhart, of Dunfermline, Fife, said someone would have seen her "good-looking lad at three o'clock in the morning walking in a pink shirt and white trousers".
Police said they had received a "small number of calls" following the family's witness appeal.
Officers said they have also trawled through hours of CCTV in a bid to find Mr Mckeague, as a "key area of the investigation".
They have now asked people with private CCTV to view any footage from 24 September and to contact them if they thought it showed useful information.
The force also appealed for market traders setting up stalls in the early hours of the day McMckeague disappeared to come forward if they had not yet spoken to police.
Acting Supt Kim Warner, who is leading the inquiry, said: "If you were out in the Bury, Honington or Barton Mills area between Friday night and Saturday and saw Corrie we need to speak to you.
"He was wearing distinctive light clothing - a pink Polo shirt and white jeans or trousers - and was friendly and engaging with a number of people during the course of the evening.
"While we're particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have seen him after 03.20 BST on Saturday 24, we also need to talk to you if you saw him during the evening."
Searches for Mr Mckeague, who serves as a gunner in No 2 Squadron RAF Regiment, are continuing with help from Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue volunteers, the RAF and the National Police Air Service helicopter, which has been flying over the Bury area on Tuesday morning.
