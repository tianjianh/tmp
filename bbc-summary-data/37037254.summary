A cat has been stabbed to death and another seriously injured in a "deliberate" knife attack.

Russian Blue Twilight was found with slices to her abdomen so deep her organs were exposed, the RSPCA said.
She was found collapsed near her home in Hungate Street, Aylsham. Her sister Midnight returned home with a severe limp and bleeding leg.
RSPCA inspector Ben Kirby said: "This is a shocking and horrific attack on two loved pets from the same family."
Both cats were taken to the vets where it was discovered Twilight's injuries were so severe she had to be put down.
Midnight is recovering from the leg injury.
Vets believe the wounds were inflicted with a knife or a blade. The RSCPA has just released details of the attack on 30 July.
Insp Kirby added: "The vets have said that Twilight's wounds were the worst she had ever seen, the possibility that someone has done this deliberately is unthinkable.
"We are extremely keen to hear from anybody who might be able to lead us to who committed this awful attack."
A Norfolk police spokesman confirmed they have been made aware of the attack and are investigating it.
