'Horror show' child porn collector Graham Capocci jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who downloaded more than 250,000 indecent images of children, with some victims aged only two, has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Capocci spent seven years amassing the library, which was dubbed a "horror show" by Judge Peter Davies.
Carlisle Crown Court heard police raided the 44-year-old's Wellington Row home in Whitehaven last year and seized computer equipment.
Capocci pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and was jailed for a year.
The hearing heard how hundreds of the images were said to be classed as category A - the most serious.
Hundreds more were listed as category B and 235,000 were ranked in category C, the court heard.
