Social Investment Fund: Assembly rejects Alliance call for independent review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Assembly has rejected a call for an independent review of the Social Investment Fund (Sif).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The programme which aims to tackle deprivation has been in the media spotlight.
It follows remarks made by a Ulster Defence Association leader, Dee Stitt, chief executive of Charter NI, which has been awarded Â£1.7m from the fund.
The Alliance Party called for an independent review of the fund.
MLA Stewart Dickson said it needed "root and branch reform".
Nicola Mallon, SDLP , said people had lost trust in the scheme.
She criticised the first and deputy first minsters saying they lacked courage and should stand up to Dee Stitt.
Danny Kennedy, Ulster Unionist Party, acknowledged that the fund did good work. However he said there were legitimate concerns about the way it was being run.
Junior Minster Alastair Ross said the recent media attention was distracting. He said the fund had created jobs, was changing communities and was making a difference to people's lives.
The motion calling for an independent review was defeated by 53 votes to 38.
