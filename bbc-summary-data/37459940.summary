Southport 1-2 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley recorded a much needed win over Southport to secure their first National League victory in three matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Cunningham's first goal of the season got Bromley off to the perfect start when he converted Joe Anderson's left-wing cross.
The visitors doubled their advantage when Jordan Higgs got on the end of a corner at the far post and headed home to earn a deserved 2-0 lead at the break.
Jordan Lussey pulled a goal back for Southport with a wonderful strike into the top corner but the Ravens held off a late fightback from the hosts to grab all three points and move up to 18th in the table.
