[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coastguard rescue teams were called out at about 18:30 on Thursday to assist a woman with a severe leg injury.
The walkers - all from the Essex area - were on "inaccessible and rough" terrain near Dunskey Castle with winds gusting up to 70mph.
The injured woman was airlifted to hospital while her three companions also needed treatment for hypothermia.
Coastguard teams from Portpatrick, Stranraer, Drummore and Ballantrae were sent to the incident along with the Scottish Ambulance Service and the coastguard rescue helicopter based at Prestwick.
They moved the injured woman to a safe position to be airlifted to hospital.
The coastguard urged anyone planning a coastal walk to check weather conditions and make sure they were well equipped.
They also advised people to tell someone their planned route and what time they expected to get back.
Anyone getting into trouble should call 999 immediately and ask for the coastguard.
