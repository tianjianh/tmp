Police closed access to Lagan College at around lunchtime on Tuesday.
The school contacted parents via text message to tell them that an investigation is taking place at "the front of the school site".
Police have now left the scene and said the investigation is ongoing.
During the alert, the school said students and staff were safe but that "no member of the public can access the site at present to go out or come in".
Amanda McNamee, the school's principal, said lessons continued as normal.
The PSNI supervised students as they left Lagan College on buses and by foot at the end of the school day.
Parents were contacted and asked to arrive at 15:45 to pick-up children.
Ch Insp Lorraine Dobson said: "The powder has been tested and has been described as not-hazardous.
"I would like to thank the teachers and pupils at the school for their co-operation. I would also like to thank our colleagues in the fire and ambulance services for their assistance."
