The body of 23-year-old Daniel Smith was found by firefighters under a railway bridge at the junction of Trinity Way and Irwell Street at about 01:20 GMT on Wednesday.
A post-mortem examination found he died from multiple injuries.
Greater Manchester Police said Mr Smith was believed to have been sleeping rough for a number of years.
Ch Supt Mary Doyle appealed to "other members of the homeless community" to come forward.
"Someone must have seen or heard something so we are appealing for anyone with even the smallest bit of information to tell us what they know."
She said the tent fire was the result of "deliberate ignition" and police were consulting with Greater Manchester Fire Service to establish the cause.
"This is a tragic situation and we are working with other agencies to assist the local community," she said.
She added Mr Smith's family was being supported by specialist officers.
