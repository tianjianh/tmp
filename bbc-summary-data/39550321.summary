Both sides struggled to create any chances in a disappointing first half, although Wood defender Danny Woodards blocked a couple of shots from Kevin Lokko and Magnus Okuonghae.
Maidstone started the second half brightly and Odubade nearly put the home side in front with an effort which flashed just wide.
Angelo Balanta almost gave the visitors the lead 10 minutes from time when he shot into the side-netting, while at the other end Odubade was denied by an offside flag moments later.
Just as the game was heading for a stalemate, Odubade struck in the third minute of stoppage time to secure a priceless three points for Stones.
