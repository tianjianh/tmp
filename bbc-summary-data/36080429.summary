Post-mortem tests found he had died as a result of compression to the neck.
His mother, Ruth Neave, was cleared of his murder at a trial in 1996. She later admitted child neglect and cruelty and was jailed for seven years.
Despite extensive investigations at the time, no-one was ever convicted of Rikki's murder.
A BBC Crimewatch television appeal in November resulted in 17 calls to investigators.
Information from the public led officers to release an e-fit of two teenage boys they wanted to talk to in connection with the case.
They had been seem walking out of the woods where Rikki's body was found on the morning of 29 November.
Cambridgeshire Police said it was unable to comment on whether the arrested man was one of the two teenagers pictured.
