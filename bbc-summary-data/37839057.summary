[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tim Jones, a former player himself for Swansea, passed away following a long illness.
The WRU confirmed the Ospreys player will not now be considered for selection for the Wallabies game on Saturday, 5 November.
Jones, 31, was a possibility to captain Wales with Sam Warburton released back to play for Cardiff Blues.
Swansea RFC have paid tribute to Jones senior, who played as a back-row for Swansea Athletic from 1969 and who turned out for Swansea's first team during the 1973-74 season
Tim Jones started playing rugby for Welsh Universities, having taken his degree in law at Aberystwyth and had worked in the legal profession for 40 years.
Swansea former players chairman, Terry Morgan, who played alongside Jones, paid tribute to his former teammate
"Tim is remembered for his dry wit and sense of fun as well as the enormous support he unassumingly gave behind the scenes to Swansea Rugby Club from his experience in the legal world," said Morgan.
"He had been ill for some time but never complained. His footprint on the club is, like his father Ken, a great supporter, and his son Alun Wyn Jones, indelible. We will miss him."
Swansea RFC said in a statement: "All our thoughts are with his wife Anne, son Alun Wyn and daughter Lowrie at this especially difficult time."
A minute's silence will be observed before kick-off when Ebbw Vale visit St Helen's in the Principality Premiership on Thursday.
