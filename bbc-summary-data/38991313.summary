[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council tax in Glasgow to rise by 3%

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's largest council has backed plans to increase council tax for the first time since 2005.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glasgow City Council's ruling Labour administration agreed to a £3% rise.
The Scottish government ended the national council tax freeze this year.
Council leader Frank McAveety previously said that while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.  Higher-band properties will see their charges rise by more than 3%.
This is due to national changes agreed last year.
The council indicated last month it would increase council tax by 3% . The band D rate will rise by £36.39 from £1,213 to £1,249.
