Nicky Cadden equalised for Livingston just after the break and Dale Carrick then put David Hopkin's side ahead 60 seconds after coming on.
Lewis Morgan equalised for the visitors after 74 minutes before Clarkson scored the St Mirren winner nine minutes from time.
Elsewhere in the group, Ayr United defeated Hamilton Accies 2-1.
After a short early spell of Livingston pressure the visitors took the lead.
A long ball was played up to John Sutton who used his strength to hold off the attentions of Livi defender Sean Crighton. The former Motherwell and Hearts striker nodded the ball down to Clarkson who fired a sweet crisp volley beyond goalkeeper Liam Kelly from 12 yards out.
Saints began to play the ball around with great purpose but Livingston always looked dangerous when breaking forward.
Cadden, who made the move to Livingston from Airdrie in the summer, looked in the mood and a magnificent piece of skill by the teenager almost brought about an equaliser.
The winger clipped the ball over the head of the stranded Irvine before driving forward and firing a shot inches over the crossbar.
Cadden was again in action with a free kick from 20 yards out that Scott Gallacher in the Saints goal had to dive low to his right hand side to push away for a corner.
Morgan almost doubled the advantage after his mazy solo run took him deep inside the Livingston 18 yard box, but his shot was blocked by Kelly in the home goal.
Livingston began the second half in fine style and within six minutes the West Lothian side duly equalised.
Cadden decided to try his luck from the edge of the 18 yard box and the ball squeezed in beyond Gallacher at his near post.
And the visitors keeper was caught napping again as the home side took the lead.
Gallacher waited for a Cadden cross into the box but substitute Carrick nipped in to volley the ball home ahead of the keeper.
It was the former Hearts and Kilmarnock strikers first goal for the club with his first touch of the ball.
The lead though was short lived as St Mirren equalised through Morgan.
The 19-year-old sent in a deep cross that looped over the outstretched arms of Kelly and into the corner of the net.
St Mirren regained the lead with the goal of the game that also proved to be the winner.
Clarkson decided to have a crack at goal from 25 yards and the ball thundered beyond Kelly into the roof of the net giving St Mirren all three points in their opening match.
Hamilton Academical fielded new goalkeeper Remi Matthews, but he was soon beaten from the penalty spot as Alan Forrest scored after two minutes for Championship side Ayr United.
Robbie Crawford cut inside and unleased a shot from 22 yards out to make it 2-0.
Louis Longridge managed a late consolation for Martin Canning's side.
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "A certain element of Hamilton's support need to take a look at themselves.
"To give their manager stick, who kept them in the Premiership last season, after 15 minutes is utterly outrageous.
"Other than that, I'm very pleased. It's a good exercise for us, I'm pleased and we'll get a good bit of fitness for us, but it has come way too early."
Hamilton Academical player/manager Martin Canning: "I don't need that to tell me what we need to do - I know we need to bring players in.
"We were disappointed with the goals we conceded, it was too easy.
"There was a little bit of desire missing that needs to come back in, that bit of determination not to get beat, not to concede, not to let them get the better of you.
"I don't want to overreact because it is early in pre-season, our big aim is to make sure we're ready for the league, but I would expect us to come down here and do better."
