Jonathan Davies won gold in the men's under-23 race, a victory which helped the men's U23 squad to team silver.
"I'm over the moon. I came thinking I had a chance of winning but you never quite believe it," Davies, 21, said.
Kate Avery won silver for a second successive year in the senior women's race won by Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan.
Avery, who produced a strong final lap in Hyeres, said: "I've finished behind an amazing athlete in Sifan Hassan, so there isn't much more I could have asked for there."
