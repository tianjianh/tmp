The man, Mario Bravo, was taken from his mother as an infant while she was in jail and given to military government supporters to bring up.
Unusually, his mother was not executed but was released and is still alive.
On Tuesday Mario and his mother are expected to meet in Buenos Aires.
Mario is the 119th child to be found by the Grandmothers.
They have worked for decades to reunite families with missing children, stolen by the junta.
In an interview on the radio, Mr Bravo said "I have talked these last few days to someone who has been reliving very difficult moments and she told me she was released after two years in captivity on condition that she had to keep silent about what had happened."
Mr Bravo said he had been talking to the Grandmothers since February.
"They interviewed me and then started testing me on dates. They asked me to come in to their offices a week ago to have a chat. Then they asked my permission to announce my discovery."
Mr Bravo had a DNA test done in 2007 when he first approached the Grandmothers, after he had begun to have doubts about his identity.
His DNA was compared with a bank of genetic samples collected by the Grandmothers from families searching for their children.
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo was formed to reunite families with their missing children, who had been stolen by the junta.
Some 30,000 people were murdered by the military junta in Argentina.
The leader of the campaign group, Estela de Carlotto, and a co-founder, Delia Giovanola, both found their missing grandsons last year.
