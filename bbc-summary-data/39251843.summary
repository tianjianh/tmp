The two-year-old pup from Blackpool, won Saturday's Gundog group and was handled by owner Jason Lynn.
Mr Lynn praised the breed - with its distinctive long-flowing and tricolour coat and high-set tail - for its merry temperament.
The winning owner said: "He's pretty special and honestly I'm speechless. I'm absolutely shocked and thrilled."
"This is kind of a special place to be and being here a few years ago prepared me for all the noise and excitement.
"Temperament is probably the hallmark of the breed - his happy, wagging tail and his charisma," said Mr Lynn.
Reserve Best in Show went to a Miniature Poodle, Frankie.
No points are awarded for the reserve, but if the Best in Show winner is disqualified, the title and ribbon go to the reserve dog.
Owner Melanie Harwood congratulated the winner and said of her award: "It's a fantastic result - it was a wonderful line-up of dogs and I'm thrilled for Jason. To get reserve, I'm speechless."
More than 22,000 dogs have taken part in the four-day 2017 competition at the Birmingham NEC arena, with the most popular entry among Labrador Retrievers.
Around 160,000 dog owners and lovers are estimated to have attended the show - the world's largest dog competition - with entries from 56 countries, culminating in Sunday's Best In Show final.
Now in its 126th year, the competition is host to hundreds of breeds and crossbreeds who are ranked by their agility, obedience and heelwork to music ability, among other competitions.
However, the show has had its fair share of controversy, with some people claiming it does not place enough emphasis on the welfare of dogs.
Campaign group Peta said the show was "all about celebrating dogs who have been bred by humans to have unnatural, exaggerated features".
