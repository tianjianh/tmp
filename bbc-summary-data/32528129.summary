The inflation rate in the 19 nations that use the euro stood at 0% in April, up from a rate of -0.1% in March.
Eurostat said that low energy costs were continuing to cut living costs.
Energy prices in the eurozone fell by 5.8% in April - a slightly slower pace than the 6% decline recorded in March.
Inflation in the services sector stood at 0.9% in April, compared with 1% in March, with a 0.3 percentage point rise in food, alcohol and tobacco to 0.9%, according to the flash estimates.
The European Central Bank said that its policy measures appeared to have banished the spectre of deflation in the eurozone.
In January, the ECB announced a â‚¬1.1 trillion bond purchase programme to jump-start the flagging economy and send inflation higher.
"After having reached low levels in mid-January, longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area have recovered. The decline observed over the previous two years has thus come to a halt," the Bank wrote in its latest economic bulletin.
Meanwhile, Eurostat said that the unemployment rate for the euro area remained stable at a seasonally adjusted 11.3% in March compared with February. That was lower than the 11.7% recorded for March 2014.
Across the 28 nations in the EU, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8% in March. That was the same as February but down from 10.4% in March last year.
Germany had the lowest jobless rate at 4.7%, with the UK next on 5.5%. Greece (25.7% for January - the most recent figures available) and Spain (23%) top the jobless chart.
Compared with a year ago, the unemployment rate in March fell in 22 EU countries, rose in five and was stable in Austria.
Ireland posted the biggest decrease, from 12% to 9.8%, while the rate in Spain fell from 25.1% to 23% and in Poland from 9.6% to 7.7%.
Unemployment has risen in both France and Italy in the past 12 months, from 10.1% to 10.6% in France and from 12.4% to 13% in Italy.
The rate of unemployment for those aged 15 to 24 stood at 20.9% in the EU, down from 22.8% in March 2014, and at 22.7% in the euro area - down from 24.2% last year.
