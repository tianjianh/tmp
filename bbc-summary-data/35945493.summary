Comedian Jasper Carrott is urging a brewery to reconsider its decision to remove the landlord of his local pub.

More than 1,700 people have signed a petition opposing Enterprise Inns' decision not to renew its lease with Ayman Zahran.
He has run the Red Lion in Claverdon, Warwickshire for seven years. Carrott said customers would boycott the premises if he is forced to leave.
The brewery said it had reviewed "all options" but will meet him next week.
But the Birmingham-born comic said Mr Zahran's departure would have an impact on the local community.

"It really is a real blow because we don't want to lose a very, very successful restaurant that is part and parcel of the village and the local community and we would ask Enterprise to reconsider, seriously, what they are doing and whether or not it's fair because we don't think it is," he said.
"Treat him fairly otherwise people will boycott the Red Lion in Claverdon for a long time and Enterprise Inns will lose money. There's no two ways about it."
Mr Zahran's MP, Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, said he had written to the brewery to ask it to reconsider its decision about "evicting" Mr Zahran.
He said the brewery had agreed to a meeting with Mr Zahran and its senior regional team.
In a statement, Enterprise Inns said: "Having carefully reviewed all the available options, we decided not to offer Mr Zahran a new lease agreement at the Red Lion.
"We have acted fully within the terms of the lease by serving six months' notice to Mr Zahran.
"We are meeting with him next week to discuss the situation further.
"We would like to reassure the residents of Claverdon and surrounding area that the Red Lion will remain as a licensed premises and hope that they continue to visit and enjoy their local pub."
