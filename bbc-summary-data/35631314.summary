Politicians in the Irish Republic are in the final stages of campaigning ahead of Friday's general election.

An Ipsos MRBI opinion poll for The Irish Times suggests the odds of a hung Dáil (parliament) are increasing.
The survey indicates a drop in support for Labour and Sinn Féin, with Fianna Fáil and Independents improving their position.
The figures would mean an indecisive result if it was replicated on polling day.
The poll shows no change in Fine Gael support since the election campaign began and a drop in Labour Party support to just 6%.
Fianna Fáil has moved up two percentage points to 23%, Sinn Féin is down four points to 15%, according to the poll.
There appear to be significant gains for independents and smaller parties, who are up three points to 28%.
With four days campaigning to go, RTE reports that there is no sign of momentum for the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Enda Kenny.
It adds that Labour will be "deeply worried at a fall-off in party support at this stage".
For Fianna Fáil, the figures will confirm what the party described on Sunday as an increasingly positive response on the doorsteps.
The Irish broadcaster suggests that Sinn Féin will be disappointed by a major slide in the numbers backing the party.
