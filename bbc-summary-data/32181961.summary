Garth Wright, 95, from Plymouth, also unveiled a new memorial plaque on Plymouth Hoe.
In 1940, hundreds of boats set sail to rescue hundreds of thousands of Allied troops who had retreated from Hitler's forces on to the shores of Dunkirk.
"We went across to France, we defended Dunkirk and the evacuation," said Mr Wright.
Almost 99,000 men were lifted from the beaches and about 240,000 from the harbour and mole - a wooden breakwater protecting the harbour - but thousands died.
Mr Wright said: "I hope and I'm sure that in future years, when youngsters hear about Dunkirk, they'll come and see this plaque."
He added it had been a "great day" and he had "achieved a mission" to have the new plaque installed.
