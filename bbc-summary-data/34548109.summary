Man fined for leaving bin outside Stoke-on-Trent home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been fined for leaving his wheelie bin out to be collected for several weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerald Thompson, 51, who was prosecuted by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, was fined £150 but with costs it totals more than £550.
Thompson, of Glendale Street, Burslem, will be paying it back at £10 a week.
His defence was that he could not get his bin out of the back door and would have had to take it through his house, so he left it on the road.
Thompson, who has lived in the house since May last year, was charged with failing to comply with a requirement imposed by a waste collection authority.
When he first moved in, residents kept their bins permanently outside their homes but in January, the council issued warnings asking them to keep them inside the boundaries of their properties and fined those that refused.
New policy meant the bins could only be on the street between 07:00 and 19:00 on the day of collection.
But he said his back door and gate were both jammed after bad weather last year so he could not access an alleyway along the back of his terraced house and did not like to wheel it though his house.
He was fined £80 which he refused to pay. The council issued a further penalty notice and then took him to court.
Outside the North Staffordshire Justice Centre, he described the verdict as "crazy".
"What is this world coming to?," he said.
"How can somebody be convicted for leaving as bin outside the house because they don't want to live with that bin?
"Living with a bin inside our house makes it smell, especially a green wheelie bin."
The city council said it did not take decisions to prosecute lightly, and only did it as a last resort.
"In the time it's taken us to get from where we first initially contacted him to actually taking this action there were options he could have discussed with us and we could have helped him to actually tackle his landlord maybe, address the problem with the rear gate, no need to take this before the courts," a spokesman said.
Tompion Platt, from pedestrian campaign group Living Streets, warned wheelie bins could be awkward obstacles for people using the pavement.
He said: "Our streets should be easy and accessible to walk in and leaving items, such as wheelie bins out on pavements, can act as an obstruction, especially for those who are blind or partially sighted, parents with buggies and people in wheelchairs.
"At best this is a nuisance and at worst, can put people's safety at risk by forcing them into the road."
