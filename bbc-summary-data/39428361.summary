Sarah Khatri was targeted by two men after parking outside St Columba Church in Chantry Road, Moseley, Birmingham at about 09:45 GMT on 27 March.
The men tried to pull her out of the car before she was threatened with the blade and her Kia was stolen, police said.
West Midlands Police said an investigation has been launched.

It is the lastest attack following a spate of car-jackings in the city.
Mrs Khatri said: "I had got the engine running because it was quite chilly outside and then I noticed a shadow blocking out the light next to my side of the car.
"Next thing I know, I felt a jolt on the car and then I felt somebody opening the door."
While one of the attackers attempted to get in via the driver's door, a second man sat in the passenger seat.
Mrs Khatri, 37, initially fought back and managed to scream for help, until one of the men brandished a knife.
She said: "All I remember is him bringing it to my neck in slow mention, he looked me in my eye and just went 'get out the car'.
"I just thought enough, it's not worth it."
A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "Officers were at the scene within minutes and we continue to make enquiries into the theft."
