For the second successive night, the 13-time TT winner recorded the fastest lap of the session on his Classic Suzuki XR69 Superbike at 122.650mph.
Dunlop, from Northern Ireland, seemed unaffected by the challenging conditions around the mountain course.
Four riders, including Dean Harrison, posted laps in excess of 120mph.
Harrison (121.101), Michael Rutter (120.763), James Hillier (120.336) and Ivan Lintin (120.160) all recorded 120mph on their opening Superbike laps.
Meanwhile, Ian Lougher again topped Lightweight class whilst Harrison and Rutter topped the Senior and Junior sessions on the night.
Clerk of the course Gary Thompson is reporting damp patches around the course - particularly under the trees - although the low mist reported on the Mountain earlier in the day had lifted.
The first races get under way on Saturday including the Classic Senior TT.
Isle of Man rider Andrew Dudgeon set fastest time of the evening in the Manx Grand Prix qualifying session.
The Ramsey man posting a time of 116.906 mph on the GSX-R Suzuki he will ride in both the Junior and Senior MGP races.
Fellow Manx rider Michael Evans topped the MGP Newcomers A leaderboard with 110.059mph.
