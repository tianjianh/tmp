Nick Evans: Harlequins 'legendary' fly-half to retire at end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former All-Blacks fly-half Nick Evans is to retire at the end of the season, once his commitments with Premiership side Harlequins come to an end.

Evans, 36, won 16 caps for New Zealand and has been one of the most successful overseas imports to the Premiership since moving to the Stoop in 2008.
He won a Premiership title in 2011-12 and holds Quins' scoring record, having amassed 2,217 points in 206 games.
"I couldn't think of a better place to finish my career," Evans said.
"This game has taught me everything, showed me things I could never imagine and introduced me to people that are not team-mates but family.
"I need to thank the clubs I have represented, the coaches - who have helped shape the player I am today - and the fans, both in New Zealand where it all started, and here in the UK, for their support and cheers."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston said: "The word 'legendary' is really over-used within the modern sporting world, but in the case of Nick Evans and his rugby playing career at Harlequins, it is the perfect description."
His final league game, fitness permitting, would be away to Northampton on 6 May, with Quins' hopes of a Premiership play-off place all but over.
