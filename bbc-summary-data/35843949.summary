Police said the woman, believed to have been the sole resident, was found dead inside the property in Broyle Lane, Ringmer.
The cause of the fire is being treated as unexplained and investigations are under way by Sussex Police and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.
Police said the woman's family have been told about her death and the coroner has also been informed.
The alarm was raised shortly before 05:00 GMT on Friday, police said.
Efforts by emergency teams were hampered by structural damage, which made it unsafe to enter the detached house until temporary repairs had been carried out.
Broyle Lane has been closed for most of the day and diversions are in place.
The fire service said six fire engines were sent to the blaze.
