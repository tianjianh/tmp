Community support officer Daniel Dawson also offered to sell his stab vest, CS canisters and helmet in August 2014, Teesside Crown Court heard.
The 26-year-old, from Middlesbrough, admitted attempted fraud and theft.
Dawson, who was dismissed from the force in 2015, was given a six-month jail term, suspended for two years.
A search of his house found 40 pieces of kit stashed in his wardrobe, the court was told.
He posted the items on the website, including the handcuffs with a holder and keys for £40, a cap for £30 and badges for £10.
Further posts offered a heavy duty utility belt, an extendable baton and a gas canister holder.
Michele Stuart-Lofthouse, prosecuting, said that despite the items being listed on the website, they had not actually been sold to anyone.
In mitigation, the court was told Dawson had suffered from mental health issues, including anxiety.
Rukhshanda Hussain, defending, said Dawson had no previous convictions, accepted his actions were "foolish and stupid" and that he was remorseful.
Dawson was also ordered to do 180 hours community service and pay £500 costs.
Judge Colin Burn said Dawson actions were "a serious breach of trust".
He added: "There was one item which was offered for sale, the baton, which if sold could have been putting a significant weapon in the hands of a stranger."
Judge Burn said Cleveland Police had to act to ensure equipment was properly accounted for when officers left the force.
