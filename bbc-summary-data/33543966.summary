Azerbaijan equalised through Dmitri Nazarov's low, first-time strike, but Italy regained the lead as Stephan El Shaarawy tapped in from close range.
Manchester United full-back Matteo Darmian hit a third, and Azeri defender Badavi Huseynov was sent off late on.
Having failed to make it through to Sweden in 1992, Italy - runners-up in 2000 and 2012 - have now qualified for six consecutive Euro tournaments.
Norway and Croatia will battle it out for second spot, after beating Malta and Bulgaria respectively.
The Norwegians are away to Italy in their final group game on Tuesday, while Croatia face a trip to Malta.
