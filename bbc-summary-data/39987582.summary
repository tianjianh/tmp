Clyde: Club appoint Annan Athletic boss Jim Chapman new manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clyde have appointed Annan Athletic boss Jim Chapman manager on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter MacDonald and JP McGovern had been in interim charge at Broadwood since March, following the resignation of Barry Ferguson.
The pair kept the struggling Bully Wee in Scottish League Two.
But while both applied to manage Clyde on a permanent basis, ex-Albion Rovers striker Chapman, 51, was chosen to lead the club forward.
The new boss won numerous domestic honours with Kilmarnock Ladies in his first managerial role, and later guided Dumbarton to the League Two title.
Chapman leaves fellow League Two side Annan after a third-placed finish this season, and a play-off semi-final defeat by Forfar Athletic.
He also led the club to a famous Scottish Cup victory over Premiership side Hamilton Academical in January 2016.
"The board has just completed a rigorous appointment process and Jim was one of a most impressive list of candidates interested in the post," Clyde chairman Norrie Innes said in a statement.
"Over the years, Jim has contributed a lot to the game and sport in general and this has largely been within the environment of the very demanding lower leagues. He now has the appetite for a fresh challenge.
"Jim has left Annan Athletic - and the many good people at a fine club - to help Clyde progress to a higher level. He demonstrated a very strong desire to join Clyde and this was very important to us.
"I would also like to thank all those who applied for the position, especially Peter MacDonald and Jon Paul McGovern who both have very real qualities that will serve them well in the future."
