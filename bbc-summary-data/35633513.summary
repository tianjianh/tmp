Timetables set for Glasgow Queen Street tunnel closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
ScotRail has published timetables and diversion routes ahead of the closure of the rail tunnel at Glasgow's Queen Street station.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The main tunnel serving the station is to close for 20 weeks - from 20 March until 8 August - as part of a Â£60m upgrade project.
Services will divert to low-level platforms or Glasgow Central.
Timetables are now available online along with an interactive map to check journey routes.
Passengers on ScotRail's main Edinburgh to Glasgow service can expect journey times of between 70 and 90 minutes.
ScotRail said printed timetables would be available in stations from the second week in March.
Additional carriages are also planned for services to provide as much extra capacity as possible.
