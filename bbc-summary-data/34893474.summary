They are Andrew Virco, 50, and his partner Katharine Walker, 51, from Cambridge, and Nigel Charlton, 66, and his wife Cynthia, 70, from Hampshire.
The aircraft crashed in a crevasse on the Fox Glacier, on New Zealand's South Island, on Saturday morning.
The crash site is on the island's remote west coast, which is a popular tourist area.
Also among the dead are Sovannmony Leang, 27, and Josephine Gibson, 29, both from New South Wales, and pilot Mitchell Gameren, 28, from Queenstown, New Zealand.
The bodies of three of the victims have now been recovered from the crash site and taken to a temporary mortuary facility nearby for formal identification, which New Zealand Police said may take a number of days.
The recovery operation has been halted for the day after weather conditions at Fox Glacier deteriorated.
Rescue teams in helicopters found no sign of survivors when they reached the crash site, rescue co-ordinators said. The cause of the crash is being investigated.
A Tasman police spokesman described the operation as "extremely challenging and the safety of those working at the scene is of paramount importance".
He added: "Our thoughts are with the victims' families at this difficult time."
Inspector John Canning, the police west coast area commander, told New Zealand's One News: "It's at the top of the glacier and it is heavily crevassed, so very rough country and it is going to take a lot of care to get the people out of there."
The helicopter involved is believed to be a Eurocopter "Squirrel" operated by local firm Alpine Adventures, which also trades as Fox Glacier Heliservices.
In a statement the firm said: "Fox Heliservices' thoughts are with the families of the passengers and pilot.
"The pilot was a very valued member of our team. The New Zealand Police and Civil Aviation Authority have taken over the investigation."
A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are providing consular assistance to their families at this difficult time."
