Carlisle had goalkeeper Mark Gillespie sent off five minutes after the break when he brought down Tom Elliot on the edge of the penalty area.
Robinson pounced from the resulting free-kick after substitute Dan Hanford had parried Lyle Taylor's effort.
Carlisle captain Michael Raynes almost equalised seven minutes from time but crashed a half-volley onto the post.

AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:
"I think it's easy when the opposition go down to 10 men for you to think that we should dominate the game and pass it.
"The pitch wouldn't allow anyone to control the game out there and neither would Carlisle."
"It was tough and I thought they were excellent."
"For us to manage to win that game says a lot about our players and they deserve a lot of credit."
