A play penned in the wake of boardroom turmoil at a football club is to be staged at the club's own ground.

The Twelfth Player tells the story of Northampton Town FC through three generations of a family.
The play's audience will be given a headset and handheld media player as they are guided around the club's Sixfields Stadium.
Playwrights Susanne Thomas and Sophie Jump said their work was inspired by "dark days" of 2015.

Towards the end of 2015, financial problems at the club meant staff and players were not being paid.
The club owed Northampton Borough Council more than Â£10m and a winding-up petition was sought by HM Revenue and Customs against the then League Two side.
Despite problems off the pitch, 2015-16 was the season the Cobblers clinched the league title and promotion to League One.
"We are going to take the audience on a journey around the stadium and into the back stage areas where the public rarely gets a chance to go including the changing rooms," said Ms Thomas.
"They will see the world of football through the eyes of three generations of a single family."
The show will include live performances by actors as well as audio and visual media through the devices provided to the audience.
The show runs from 22 June until 12 July.
