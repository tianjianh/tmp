[SN]TITLE[SN]
Why was Jeremy Corbyn posing next to a toilet?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It seems - at first glance - a rather strange photograph.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn, wearing goggles and a cap, leaning on the door of a train toilet.
But there is a logical explanation: the Labour leader was visiting a rail factory in Doncaster on Thursday.
Mr Corbyn used the visit to Wabtec Rail to pledge Labour action on the economy and jobs after Brexit.
But the photo - taken by a Press Association photographer - has prompted a stream of comments, with many suggesting it was ill-advised.
Let me take you along to what we call a political photo op.
Traditionally, at least for the last 20-odd years anyway, these have tended to be highly choreographed affairs.
Someone employed by the politician, who has a keen eye for how a picture will look and what headline writers might be tempted to attach to it, will survey the landscape in front of them.
Owl-like, the spin doctor will be looking for hostages to fortune.
Like a leader in trouble being snapped near an exit sign, for instance.
Enter Jeremy Corbyn.
A leader who has defined himself as very different from the generation of political leaders before him by eschewing the conventions of modern politics.
So, while many a politico would avoid being snapped examining a toilet cubicle - the potential headlines are as crude as they are obvious - Mr Corbyn would argue he was visiting a train factory, and so what? Don't be so superficial.
Mr Corbyn - whose team has declined to comment - was also photographed away from the toilet.
And he's not the first politician to be photographed in unfortunate circumstances.
