Four people had to be treated in hospital after taking what is thought to be ecstasy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were first called to St James Boulevard in Newcastle just after midnight due to concerns for a man, 21, and an 18-year-old woman.
Her condition is described as potentially life-threatening.
An hour later, another couple, both 18, also had to be taken to hospital after becoming ill in the city centre.
Northumbria Police said a quantity of drugs, believed to be ecstasy, had been seized and inquiries were ongoing.
Det Inst Sally MacDonald said: "Taking illegal drugs is incredibly dangerous and the fact four people have been taken ill in just one evening is particularly worrying."
