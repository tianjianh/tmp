US officials charged Joshua Goldberg with distributing information on explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction.
Mr Goldberg chatted online with an undercover FBI agent, offering information on bomb building.
He told the agent to put the bomb at a 9/11 memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.
Pressure-cooker bombs were used in the Boston marathon bombings that left three dead and dozens hurt.
In other instances this year the FBI has charged American residents with plotting terrorist attacks after finding them online.
The FBI agent had found Mr Goldberg's online messages, in which he was posing as an Australian jihadist, offering to assist in plotting terror attacks in Australia and Texas.
"What weapons do you have brother? I can send you guides on how to make bombs if you need help making them," wrote Mr Goldberg in one message to the agent.
Mr Goldberg sent bomb-making guides to the agent on 19 August, asking the agent how he wanted to attack on 11 September.
He suggested a pressure-cooker bomb and picked out a 9/11 memorial event in Missouri, the Kansas City Stair Climb.
Australian police interviewed a witness who said Mr Goldberg's online acts were "part of a hoax" and he was a "proponent of radical free speech".
He will also be charged with providing information online to spur terrorist attacks in Australia.
