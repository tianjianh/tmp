NI Events Company: Legal bid to ban former quango board members

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eleven former board members of the NI Events Company are facing a legal bid to have them banned from acting as company directors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Disqualification proceedings issued by the Department for the Economy over the directors' roles began on Thursday.
The application follows critical reports into the oversight and running of the body which folded in 2007.
The court heard some of the respondents plan to contest the proceedings.
Others were said to be considering whether to give undertakings.
The eleven named in the papers are: Samuel Mervyn Elder, Jasper Perry, Gerry Lennon, Jim Rodgers, James Clarke, Thomas Alan Clarke, Paul Henry McWilliams, William David White, Aideen Corr, Victor Campbell Haslett, and Catherine Williamson.
Gerry Lennon is Visit Belfast chief executive and Jim Rodgers is High Sheriff of Belfast.
Thomas Alan Clarke is a former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and James Clarke is the current chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.
The NI Events Company (NIEC) was formed in 1997 to support major sports and music events.
Lawyers for some of those who sat on the NIEC's board have claimed they were being made scapegoats to deflect attention from civil servants who failed to provide proper scrutiny.
Following a brief hearing, the case was adjourned until November.
