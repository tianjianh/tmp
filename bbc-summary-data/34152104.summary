Forty-five soldiers from the United Arab Emirates have been killed in Yemen while fighting Houthi rebels as part of a Saudi-led coalition, the UAE says.

Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said they had died when a rebel missile struck an ammunition depot.
On his official Twitter feed, he said the "cowardly attack will not deter us".
Separately, Bahrain said five of its soldiers were killed while protecting Saudi Arabia's frontier with Yemen.
It did not say how the troops had died, but some reports say they were killed in the same explosion.
The UN says some 4,500 people - including at least 2,110 civilians - have been killed in fighting on the ground and by coalition air strikes since late March.
The UAE is thought to have sent several thousand troops to Yemen in an effort to restore the country's exiled President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.
They helped southern militiamen opposed to the Houthis retake the southern port city of Aden in July and have since advanced northwards.
