[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-NoW reporter's conviction quashed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-News of the World reporter convicted of using a soldier in Prince Harry's regiment as a paid source has had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Sabey, 35, was accused over payments to Paul Brunt, 33, while working at the now-closed Sunday paper.
Mr Sabey was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office.
But the Lord Chief Justice quashed the conviction on the grounds that the jury was misdirected by the trial judge.
And Lord Thomas also confirmed there would be no retrial.
Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders had already said she would not pursue the case.
