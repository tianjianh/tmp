Home Secretary Amber Rudd said PC Keith Palmer will be commemorated by the UK Police Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.
Khalid Masood killed the unarmed officer who was guarding Parliament, minutes after Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge.
"He gave his life, in the line of duty, to keep others safe," said Ms Rudd.
Ms Rudd said the Charlton Athletic season ticket-holder's sacrifice has "touched the lives of millions of people in this country and around the world" as she thanked the police for their "phenomenal" bravery and professionalism after the attack, on Wednesday.
Writing for Police Oracle, she said: "So much has been said and written in tribute to Pc Palmer - a husband and father who went to work on Wednesday morning and will never go home.
"His sacrifice, the tragedy of his death, has touched the lives of millions of people in this country and around the world."
The UK Police Memorial "provides a lasting tribute to the sacrifices that all too many police officers have made".
The MP also praised the two officers who remain in hospital after being injured in the attack.
At the arboretum there is an avenue of trees called The Beat in memory of fallen officers, and a police memorial garden.
Plans are in place for a new police memorial at the arboretum, with organisers hoping it will be in place by 2019.
