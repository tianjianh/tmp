The Briton caused controversy in 2010 when he made barbs at some of Hollywood's leading stars and had vowed in 2012 to never host the awards again.
But in a blog post entitled "Ricky's back!" the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organises the Golden Globes, confirmed the news.
The 73rd ceremony will take place on 10 January in Los Angeles.
Employing British vernacular, Gervais tweeted: "It's a good job I'm drunk. Otherwise the thought of hosting The Golden Globes again would seem like a real pain in the arse."
In a jibe at the US Republican 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump, Gervais tweeted: "Now I want Donald Trump to stop saying things until the day before The Golden Globes."
In 2011, many critics felt Gervais would not be allowed to return to the Golden Globes, saying he had "crossed lines of taste and civility".
American broadcaster NBCUniversal confirmed Gervais had been named as host of the ceremony.
NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt said: "Disarming and surprising, Ricky is ready to honour - and send up - the best work of the year in film and television.
"Fasten your seatbelts."
