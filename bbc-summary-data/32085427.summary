However, the French firm, which supplies engines to Red Bull and Toro Rosso, is also contemplating buying a team and becoming a constructor again.
"We are looking at a lot of options, including getting out of Formula 1 if it's bad for Renault's reputation," said the team's chief, Cyril Abiteboul.
Renault engines powered Red Bull to four successive world championships, before Mercedes won in 2014.
However, the manufacturer has come in for criticism since Mercedes dominated the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on 15 March, with Red Bull finishing a lap down on winner and world champion Lewis Hamilton.

Abiteboul added: "We think we are a credible player in the sport but you need to think about what else we need to do on top of what we already are. But right now, the focus remains on the engine."
Renault only supplies engines to Red Bull and its sister team Toro Rosso after Caterham folded and Lotus switched to Mercedes.
When asked about speculation that Renault could buy his team, Toro Rosso's team principal Franz Tost said it would be a "fantastic opportunity" for the Italy-based team.
"To be owned by a manufacturer would be exactly the step forward which the team needs," added Tost, who was sitting next to Abiteboul.
Abiteboul's comments at the Malaysian Grand Prix indicate growing tensions between Red Bull and Renault.
Red Bull chief Christian Horner insisted the relationship was "super" but, in the build up to the trip to Malaysia, Abiteboul accused the Milton Keynes-based team's designer Adrian Newey of lying after he blamed the car's problems on the engine.
