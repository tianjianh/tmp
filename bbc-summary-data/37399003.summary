The opening goal came after 90 seconds of the second period as Michael Forney notched up his fourth in four games.
Forney struck again with under three minutes remaining in the middle period during which Travis Fullerton in the Capitals goal was the busier netminder.
Jared Staal pulled a goal back, but a Steve Saviano empty-netter made it 3-1.
The Giants play the 1000th match in their 17-year history on Sunday when they travel to Dundee Stars for another Challenge Cup match.
