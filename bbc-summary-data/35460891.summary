Doncaster Rovers have signed Port Vale goalkeeper Chris Neal on a 28-day loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old's move to the Keepmoat Stadium is added competition for Thorsten Stuckmann and Marko Marosi in the Doncaster goal.
Neal, who has made 133 appearances, has featured just once for Vale this season since losing his place to Jak Alnwick.
Neal was part of the Vale side which won promotion from League Two in 2013 and the Shrewsbury Town side which went up to League One the previous season.
Meanwhile Rovers' veteran defender Rob Jones has left the club by mutual consent.
The 36-year-old, who was also a coach with Doncaster's development side, moved to Rovers from Sheffield Wednesday in 2012.
