The 29-year-old's 18th-minute dismissal was his second red card of the season.
The former Kidderminster man was also banned for the first eight games of this term, after an alleged bite on an opponent during the previous campaign.
Cheltenham are 18th in League Two, seven points above the relegation zone.
