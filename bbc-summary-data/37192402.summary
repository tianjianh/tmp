The world number five missed a couple of short putts in his round as he played his first competitive outing following a change of putter.
After starting on 10, bogeys on the 15th and 16th dropped him to two over before he battled back to one under.
However, a missed short putt at the eighth brought him back to level par.
Graeme McDowell is sharing 51st place, one behind McIlroy, after carding three birdies and four bogeys in his round.
The 2010 US Open champion finished his round on a high as he birdied the short 18th.
Scotland's Martin Laird and American Patrick Reed lead the field after rounds of 66.
The two leaders are a stroke ahead of Americans Rickie Fowler, Kevin Chappell and JB Holmes plus Argentina's Emiliano Grillo.
World number one Jason Day is among a group two off the pace.
The Barclays tournament is the first event in the PGA Tour's play-offs series.
