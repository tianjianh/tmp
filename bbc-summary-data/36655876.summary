The Spaniard replaces Laurent Blanc, who left his position in charge after three years at the French league champions on Monday.
Emery, 44, won the Europa League with Sevilla in each of his three full seasons in charge of the La Liga club.
"It's with great pride that I accept the challenge of coaching PSG," said Emery, who has also coached Valencia.
"This club has become one of the biggest in Europe over recent seasons, and I am happy and honoured to help lead it towards achieving its goals."
Emery spent the majority of his playing career in the Spanish second tier, before moving into management.
