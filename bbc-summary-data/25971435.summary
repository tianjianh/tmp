Medway NHS Foundation Trust said chairman Denise Harker and chief executive Mark Devlin had decided the time was right for them to move on.
The trust was criticised as failing and put in special measures following the Keogh Review in June.
It said a new chairman and chief executive were expected to be announced next month.
The Keogh Review found the trust, which runs Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, had major failings.
It was criticised for poor communication with patients, poor management of deteriorating patients, inappropriate referrals, delayed discharges and long waits in A&E.
The hospital was later told by the Care Quality Commission it must take urgent action to improve safety on a maternity unit.
In November health regulator Monitor said the hospital's problems were broader than first thought and said it must take urgent action or face leadership changes.
The trust said in a statement Ms Harker and Mr Devlin had decided to hand over leadership of the trust to a new team.
"I would like to thank Mark and Denise for their dedication and integrity," said Colin Wilby, its senior independent director.
"Their commitment to public service is indisputable and we wish them both every success in the future."
Earlier this week it was announced Medway Maritime's A&E department would undergo a Â£5m redevelopment.
Mark Reckless, Conservative MP for Rochester and Strood, said the hospital had appointed a new medical director and a new chief nurse.
"I think they are doing good work and I have seen some improvements but frankly, given the problems, I am not sure its been fast enough," he said.
