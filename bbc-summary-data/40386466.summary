Sellafield firefighters to strike in pay dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Firefighters at the Sellafield nuclear site have agreed to take industrial action in a dispute over pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokesman for the GMB union, which represents 63 firefighters at the site, said the action would be 24-hour strikes starting in July.
He said members felt they were not getting the right pay and were doing work above their role.
Sellafield Ltd said further talks are planned for 30 June but "arrangements are in place" to cope with action.
The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing and decommissioning site employs about 10,000 people.
GMB senior organiser for Sellafield, Chris Jukes, said almost all of the site's firefighters, who voted two to one in favour of industrial action, are part of the union.
He said: "The firefighters do a vitally important job and they feel completely taken advantage of by management, relying on doing work over and above what they are paid for.
"It is sinful that this highly skilled group of workers have been put in this position."
A spokesman for Sellafield Ltd said the firm was "committed to resolving" the issues.
He added: "The safety and security of the Sellafield site are our overriding priorities.
"We have arrangements in place to ensure the site remains safe during any industrial action."
