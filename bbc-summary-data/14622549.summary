Outbreaks of heavy rain are expected to continue into the afternoon across London, the Met Office has said.

On Monday it issued a severe weather warning, predicting torrential rain on Tuesday morning and warning of a risk of localised flooding.
Although there were some heavy and at times thundery showers, the predicted torrential downpour did not occur.
Some parts of London had between 5mm to 10mm of rain in a few hours, while other areas saw moderate to light rain.
Passengers travelling on Eurostar have been facing delays of up to 30 minutes due to signalling problems in France and Belgium caused by the bad weather there.
The Met Office website said there was still a risk of "surface water flooding", but showers will ease later.
"A yellow alert has been issued to highlight the risk of localised surface-water flooding," a spokeswoman said earlier on Tuesday morning.
On Monday evening, the Met Office had predicted that heavy rain "will start from about midnight and there will also be a lot of lightning".
The Environment Agency also said there was a risk of flooding in southern and eastern England and the London Fire Brigade said it was on stand-by to help anyone hit by flooding following the Met Office warnings.
