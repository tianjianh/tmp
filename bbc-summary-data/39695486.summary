Corrie Mckeague: Airman landfill hunt in 'the right place'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police searching for airman Corrie Mckeague have started to find rubbish at a landfill site "from the right time period" from when he went missing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers have been searching waste in Milton, Cambridgeshire for eight weeks.
They have now started to unearth rubbish from 10 September and said the items uncovered indicated they were "searching in the right place".
The airman disappeared on 24 September on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart said the landfill search was taking "absolute precedence".
She said: "For now, all we can do is wait."
"All I know is, if I thought for one second there was anything I could be doing to help find Corrie, I would be doing it. I will never give up," she added.
Mr Mckeague, 23, from Dunfermline in Fife, vanished after going out with friends from RAF Honington, where the gunner is based.
He was last seen going into a bin loading bay known as the "horseshoe" at about 03:25 BST.
A waste disposal lorry collected a bin from that area less than an hour after Mr Mckeague was last seen.
Its route appeared to coincide with the movements of his mobile phone.
