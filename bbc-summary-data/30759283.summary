India survived a last-session collapse against Australia to draw the final Test in Sydney as the hosts secured a 2-0 series win.

Declaring their second innings overnight on 251-6, Australia set India a victory target of 349.
Steve Smith's side were left three wickets short as they chased a final day win with India finishing on 252-7.
Opening batsman Murali Vijay top scored with 80 as Ajinkya Rahane (38) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (20) secured a draw.
Victories in the opening two Test matches in Adelaide and Brisbane were enough to secure the 2-0 series win for Australia, as the final two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney were drawn.
Despite some disciplined bowling from Australia on a turning final-day pitch, only one India batsman had fallen in each of the first two sessions and the match looked destined for a draw at tea.
Australia were given a glimpse of victory as India collapsed from 178-2 to 217-7 in the final session, but Rahane and Kumar held out in the closing overs with an unbroken eighth wicket partnership of 35.
Earlier, captain Smith took a sensational one-handed diving catch at slip to dismiss Rohit Sharma (39) just before lunch, while spinner Nathan Lyon and fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazelwood all claimed two wickets apiece.
The start of the series had been rearranged and moved from Brisbane to Adelaide following the death of Australia Test batsman Phillip Hughes in November.
