Mother in legal battle to have dead daughter's baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother has launched a legal battle for access to her dead daughter's frozen eggs, so she can carry her own grandchild.

The unnamed woman and her husband are challenging an independent regulator's refusal to let them export the eggs from London to a US fertility clinic.
The couple's daughter died from bowel cancer in her late 20s.
They claim she wanted her eggs to be fertilised by a sperm donor and implanted into her mother's womb.
The daughter, who was the couple's only child, decided to freeze her eggs in a clinic at IVF Hammersmith in west London in 2008, following her cancer diagnosis.
She hoped she would one day carry her own child, but she lost her battle with the disease.
A clinic in New York has indicated that it is willing to provide her 59-year-old mother with the fertility treatment she desires, at a cost of up to Â£60,000 ($92,000).
But the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has refused to issue a "special direction" to allow the eggs to be taken out of storage and sent to the US.
Its statutory approvals committee (SAC) made the ruling in 2014, saying there was insufficient evidence to show that the daughter wanted her mother to carry her child.
Although the woman completed a form giving consent for the eggs to be stored after her death, she did not fill out a separate document indicating how she wanted them to be used.
Minutes from a committee meeting revealed the "strongest and only evidence" of her wishes was a reported conversation with her mother while she was in hospital in 2010.
Fertility expert Dr Mohammed Taranissi, who runs the ARGC clinic in London, said: "I have never heard of a surrogacy case involving a mother and her dead daughter's eggs.
"It's fair to say that this may be a world first."
The application for judicial review is listed anonymously as "M v the HFEA" and it is understood the family does not want to be identified.
