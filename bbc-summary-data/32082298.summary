[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lorry and four cars were involved in the crash near junctions 8 and 9 of the eastbound M27 near Segensworth.
The driver of a silver Ford Focus, believed to be a man in his 40s, died at the scene, police said.
People with video or mobile phone footage of the crash are being urged to contact police on 101.
Repair work was carried out through the night on the road, which was damaged when the lorry involved caught fire.
The crash happened shortly after 09:00 GMT on Thursday.
The closure meant some drivers were stuck in their cars in tailbacks for up to six hours.
