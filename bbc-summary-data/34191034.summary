Kansas jurors have recommended that a white supremacist who shot and killed three people receive the death penalty.

Frazier Glenn Miller Jr, 74, targeted Jewish sites on last year's Passover holiday, but his victims were not Jewish.
"Frankly my dears, I don't give a damn," Miller told the jury on Tuesday while raising his arm in a Nazi salute.
A judge will now determine whether to follow the jury's sentencing for Miller, who was convicted last week.
Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, represented himself during the trial. He admitted to killing William Corporon, 69 and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, 14, outside of the Jewish Community Centre in Overland Park, Kansas and Terri LaManno, 53, outside of a Jewish retirement centre.
Miller told the jurors he "knew" they were going to put him on death row, and he did not care what sentence he would receive.
Although he admitted to the April 2014 killings, Miller pleaded not guilty at trial.
Miller, who suffers from chronic emphysema, said he was motivated to kill Jews before he died because he believes they have too much power.
Before the shooting, Miller founded several white supremacist groups and later ran twice for elected office on a white power platform.
His son said during the trial he does not know where his father learned to hate Jews and other races.
