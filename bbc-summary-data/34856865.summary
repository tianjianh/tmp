[SN]TITLE[SN]
Giving up Christmas for those in crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's noon on Christmas Day. Mike Tuohy pulls a Christmas cracker with his son Andrew. He kisses his wife goodbye, leaves the turkey-laden dinner table and rushes off to volunteer with homeless charity Crisis.

This might not be the typical way to spend 25 December, but for Mike, it has been the norm for 35 years.
The 54-year-old believes everyone deserves a winter break and calls the Crisis centres an "all-inclusive holiday" for the homeless.
"At Christmas time, homeless people are our guests and we invite them into our home," he says.
"I look forward to it every year. Just seeing the difference it makes, like taking someone to a doctor when they haven't seen a doctor in two years and they need to see one.
"It's a very rewarding job."
But what is it like spending Christmas away from the family?
"My son Andrew asks if Christmas Day with him isn't more important than with the homeless community and I tell him 'you've got me for the rest of the year, they've only got me for a week'," Mike says.
That said, the long hours take their toll - over Christmas, Mike doesn't normally get back to his home in Brookman's Park, Hertfordshire, until the early hours.
"We all get ill after Christmas because we're so adrenaline-fuelled and get so excited and have so many demands on us," he explains.
"We can't afford to get ill actually over Christmas because people need you. But new year's is nearly always a write-off."
As the charity's longest-serving volunteer, Mike has seen a number of changes.
Primarily, he says, mental health problems are the reason many people he sees are on the streets.
"There used to be lots of heavy drinkers," he says.
"Nowadays most people are here because of their mental health and they use hard drugs, the two go hand in hand.
"Our medical services are always very busy with mental health guidance and all the volunteers get some training for mental health."
When he started volunteering, there was no talk of the internet.
"It was soup and blankets and emergency first aid to stop people dying overnight because it was so cold outside. It got so busy sometimes people slept on chairs.
"Now we help get them off the streets and also help them get on with their lives. We've got full medical services, legal advice and internet cafes. They're really popular."
Being a volunteer has changed Mike's life in many ways. He met his wife Michelle when they volunteered together 25 years ago.
"When you see someone cleaning up someone else's sick, you know they're a good person," he says.
"You have lots in common with the volunteers. Quite a few of my friends met their partners here, too.
"When my son was six weeks old, he came to the centre and spent the afternoon there.
"We had a baby and we wanted to show him off. Some people want to show off their baby to their friends and my friends are volunteers and homeless people.
"I still wear a teddy bear in my top pocket that a homeless lady bought for my son, so if anyone asks where my wife is, I can show them and say she's at home with my son."
One homeless man, who Mike describes as "very aggressive and angry", later returned to Crisis as a volunteer.
"That was amazing," he tells me. "Someone we didn't even want in the building because he was so aggressive, and then he sorted out his alcohol problems and his issues and he was back four years later to help out."
Crisis reports the number of homeless has increased by 55% in England over the past five years and the average life expectancy for homeless people is just 47 years.

Many of the Christmas guests Mike meets are "not who you might expect to be homeless". One such guest used to be the deputy head at a school.
"He had a degree and a stable life, what everyone aspires to," says Mike who, away from volunteering, works as a facilities manager for Deloitte.
But in a tragic turn of events, he separated from his wife, became a heavy drinker and lost his job.
"One day, he saw his wife and kids walking by while he was lying on a street corner. That's the domino effect: you fall over and no one helps you back up, so you fall further and no one helps you.
"Lots of homeless people had good jobs in the past. When you look around, you think, it could have been any of us, me or the volunteers," he says.
"Crisis helps people get back up, get their self-respect back, get treated like a human. Sometimes that's all they need."
