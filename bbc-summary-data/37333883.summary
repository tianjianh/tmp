Movistar rider Quintana, 26, finished in the bunch in Sunday's final stage to maintain his lead of one minute 23 seconds over Team Sky's Froome.
"It is a dream come true. I have a huge amount of respect for Chris Froome and he for me," Quintana told Eurosport.
Orica-BikeExchange's Magnus Cort Nielsen won the 104.8km stage in a sprint finish in Madrid.
The win is Movistar rider Quintana's second in a Grand Tour after his 2014 Giro d'Italia triumph.
Esteban Chavez, riding for Orica-BikeExchange, finished third, 4:08 behind compatriot Quintana.
Sunday's 21st stage from Las Rozas was a largely processional stage for Quintana, who repelled Froome's attacks and finished two seconds ahead in Saturday's summit finish.
Three-time Tour de France champion Froome, 31, admitted stage 15 cost him his chance to become the first man to win the Tour and Vuelta in the same season since Bernard Hinault in 1978.
Froome lost 2:40 to Quintana after missing a surprise early breakaway as his main rival extended his lead to 3:37.
Although Froome regained 2:16 in winning the stage 19 time trial, Quintana held on to win the third and final Grand Tour of the season.
"What happened on stage 15 possibly cost me victory but we will learn from that," said Froome.
"One of the things that makes cycling so special is that it can change in the blink of the eye. That's racing."
He added: "This is a gruelling race and I have enjoyed it. "I'm thrilled with how the season has gone - it's been my most successful to date.
"It has shown me that it is possible to win two Grand Tours in a year and maybe that is something I will look to do next year."
