He was Alistair Sloss of Ruskey Road in the village.
Mr Sloss's death is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland.
In a statement, the HSE said its "deepest sympathies are with the man's family at this most difficult time".
DUP MLA Keith Buchanan said the man's death was "another tragic loss within the farming community".
"The local community's in shock. Any small rural area, everybody knows everybody else," he said.
"The amount of farmers across Northern Ireland and across the country working at slurry at this time of year, unfortunately these things can and will happen.
"Hopefully the message will come through to take more time and be cautious."
Ulster Unionist MLA Sandra Overend said: "To hear of another local farming accident brings a clench to my stomach.
"I was so saddened to hear of the tragic death of Alistair Sloss yesterday evening and I immediately thought of his family who are suffering their greatest sadness; my heart goes out to them."
Wesley Aston of the Ulster Farmers' Union said the "tragic news" of Mr Sloss's death showed there could be no complacency around the issue of farm safety.
"Just a couple of days ago, we got encouraging news from the Health and Safety Executive about how much we had made progress in reducing farm deaths," he added.
"Unfortunately to receive this tragic news last night just shows that we can't be complacent and it is important that we do take every action that we can to avoid such events happening in the future."
