[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£5.54bn investment in four London Underground (LU) lines should improve efficiency, Transport for London (TfL) has claimed.

Work to the District, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines will include a new signalling system, new track, longer platforms and rebuilt train depots.
It is hoped the changes will lead to more frequent trains on all four lines.
The move will also include 191 new air-conditioned walk through trains.
Once the work is complete, Circle line trains will arrive every four minutes, instead of every 10, and there will also be trains arriving every two minutes on the other three lines, TfL said.
TfL estimates capacity on the lines will be increased by 30% and said it is making the changes to cope with the predicted 1.4 million increase to London's population by 2030.
Delays on all lines should be reduced by up to a third by the end of the year, it added.
Tfl said the plans for a new signalling system include the oldest part of the network built, which was built in 1863 and "belong in a museum".
Negotiations are in the final stages with Thales, the French defence firm behind changes to the Jubilee, Northern lines and Victoria line, to make the changes, said TfL.
Passengers on the Circle line could see improvements from 2021, the organisation added.
