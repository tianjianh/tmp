[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of people are trying to get a Carmarthenshire outdoor swimming pool reopened five years after it closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brynamman outdoor pool closed in 2010 after getting a Â£20,000 repair bill.
A committee has been formed with the goal of getting it reopened as an eco-friendly pool and a "memories" day is being held on Saturday.
Committee chairwoman Jess Lerner said: "We will use the day as a positive step towards remembering why we want the pool reopened."
The pool was built during the depression of the early 1930s by out-of-work voluntary labourers and used to attract about 2,000 visitors each summer.
