The Cherries dominated the opening half-hour and took the lead through Benik Afobe's diving header.
But Sunderland hit back through Van Aanholt, who collected Fabio Borini's through ball and rifled past Artur Boruc.
Lewis Grabban had a great chance to win it for Bournemouth but fired wide.

The striker was played in by Matt Ritchie but misfired from five yards, while for the hosts, Billy Jones had earlier put a free header at Boruc when perfectly placed.
Bournemouth stay 15th, while Sunderland remain 19th, three points from safety.
In many ways this was a performance that typified Bournemouth's maiden Premier League campaign; starting brightly, full of quality and composure on the ball, but ultimately losing control of the match.
The Cherries have scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes of games than any other side in the Premier League and once again they took an early lead.
Junior Stanislas sent in a teasing early cross from the right wing and Benik Afobe - a Â£10m January signing from Wolves - connected with a diving header to score for the second game running.
Following that breakthrough, the visitors pressed Sunderland relentlessly, to a soundtrack of audible boos from the home fans, but could not find a second goal.
Stanislas fired over from Marc Pugh's cross with the goal gaping, while Afobe forced a good save from Mannone after Stanislas chested the ball down to him.
But Eddie Howe's side once again proved unable to close a game out as their increased their tally of points dropped from winning positions to 14 - another league high.
Having dominated the first half, Bournemouth suffered a sucker punch in stoppage time as Borini's clever pass split centre-back and full-back and found the rampaging Van Aanholt, who finished confidently.
The left-back has been in superb form, having scored against Tottenham last week and also found the net in the two previous matches - though both those strikes were subsequently credited as own goals.
Despite those reversals, Van Aanholt has now been directly involved in five goals this season - more than any other defender - with three goals and two assists.
Here, his strike completely reversed the momentum of the match, as Sunderland took control of the second half and created several opportunities.
It was Van Aanholt's fellow full-back Jones who had the clearest chance to give the hosts a priceless victory, but he could not beat Boruc from five yards when picked out perfectly by Adam Johnson's cross.
Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce: "After their goal went in, there were 20 minutes where we hung on, but we stopped them scoring, which we haven't done recently. We've gained a result from going a goal behind, and that shows a bit of character from the players. They overcame their fears and came back strongly.
"It's a precious point. We've showed a lot of nerve to come through our bad spell and if we continue like that we're going to be fine."

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "We dominated the early stages, we were in total control. Today was a real number nine's goal from Benik Afobe and he was a real handful.
"We just lost our grip. We craved the second goal, we were so on top, and the second goal eluded us.
"The pleasing thing is the resilience we showed in the second half. There are positives to take - we've only lost two games in 11 now. But today we were the dominant team and that's the disappointment."
Sunderland host Manchester City on Tuesday, while Bournemouth visit Crystal Palace.
