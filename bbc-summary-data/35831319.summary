Francesco Guidolin: Swansea City head coach to return to dugout

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be pitchside for Saturday's visit of Aston Villa, having taken training this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 60-year-old Italian had been absent from the Swans' previous three matches after suffering from a chest infection.
The Welsh side earned wins over Arsenal and Norwich City before losing 3-2 at Bournemouth last Saturday, with coach Alan Curtis leading matchday duties.
Swansea lie 16th in the Premier League, eight points above the relegation zone.
They have won four, drawn two and lost three of their nine games since Guidolin's appointment.
That followed a run of just one win in their previous 12 games in all competitions.
