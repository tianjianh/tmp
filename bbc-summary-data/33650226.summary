A campaign has been set up to save buffet cars on First Great Western (FGW) trains as dispute talks over the introduction of new trains continue.

Services between London, the West of England and Wales were affected earlier this month by a 48-hour strike.
One of the proposed changes is to replace buffet cars with an "upgraded trolley service".
The #savethebuffet Facebook group was set up by Steve Blair who said he would miss the social element of the buffet.
FGW spokesman Dan Panes said current trains offered either a buffet car or smaller, more limited service with a microwave.
He said new Hitachi trains would have one or two kitchens for hot and cold food on journeys over an hour.
The changes are set to affect services between Paddington and Wales, and Paddington and the North Cotswolds, when 110 new trains are brought in.
Mr Blair, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, has been a commuter for eight years and has gained more than 2,000 followers for the campaign online.
He said buffet cars were "a way of networking with people, a real way to make new friends and acquaintances".
Mr Panes said buffet cars took up the space of 50 seats.
Subject to union agreement, he said passengers may be able to order from their seats.
"We also want to upgrade the trolley significantly with areas to keep hot food hot and cold food cold, and with fresh coffee machines," he said.
He added there would be no job losses and at least 100 new roles created as a result of the changes.
The first Hitachi trains will run on the Great Western main line from 2017 and the East Coast main line from 2018.
The new trains are being introduced under the Intercity Express Programme (IEP) on routes between London Paddington and Oxford, Bristol and South Wales.
