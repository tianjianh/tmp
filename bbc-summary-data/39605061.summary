The result saw the Cumbrians slip to 10th in the table, but they remain just one point outside the play-off places with two games remaining.
Carlisle, 2-0 down after 25 minutes, were level before the interval and led through Reggie Lamb before Smith had the final say.
Carlisle midfielder Jamie Davitt fired against the post and Jamie Proctor put a good chance wide before Crawley took the lead in the 11th minute.
Leading marksman James Collins opened the scoring in superb style by smashing a tremendous shot into the top corner from 20 yards.
Collins was on target again after 25 minutes from the penalty spot, sending Mark Gillespie the wrong way after the goalkeeper had brought down the striker.
Striker Jabo Ibehre, put clean through by Danny Grainger, reduced the deficit four minutes later with his fourth goal in four games.
Crawley keeper Glenn Morris was then hurt as Ibehre put the ball in the net and had to be replaced by Yusuf Mersin.
Carlisle were level three minutes before the break when Proctor, on loan from Bolton, struck with a bullet header following a Gary Liddle cross.
United seized the lead on the hour through Lambe, who clipped the ball past replacement keeper Mersin after latching onto Proctor's cross.
Josh Payne fired just wide late on for Crawley and Collins also headed over before the hosts levelled in the second minute of stoppage time when Smith fired in following a pass from Joe McNerney.
