The Briton was crowned champion last November when Randy Caballero was stripped of the title after failing to make the weight for their fight.
The Bristol southpaw has won 32 of his 35 fights and is unbeaten since losing to Belgium's Stephane Jamoye in 2012.
"I class myself as a world champion 100%," said the 32-year-old.
"I feel like I won the world title when I beat Ryosuke Iwasa. He was very tough and had only been beaten once before, and that was by the guy who is now the WBC champion [Shinsuke Yamanaka].
"Caballero was out of the equation, nobody thought he was coming back.
"If he just handed the belt in, because he knew he wasn't going to make the weight, then that would have been a legitimate world title fight between me and Iwasa.
"So if you asked me if I feel like the world champion then 100% I do, yes, and people will get to see that I am world class on Saturday night."
Haskins' opponent at the Cardiff Ice Arena is the 24-year-old brother of Erik Morales, the first Mexican to win world titles at four different weights, and Diego Morales, a former WBO super-flyweight champion.
"Just because his brothers can box doesn't mean he can," said Haskins.
"His record shows that he's a good fighter, so I'm guessing he can whack a bit. But I haven't watched him, I've left that to my trainers.
"He could be as talented as his brothers, but I want to put on a great show and stop the guy."
