The Croatia striker, 24, joined the Premier League champions from HNK Rijeka in a Â£9.7m deal in January 2015.
But he made just five appearances for the Foxes this season before going to Hoffenheim on loan in January.
Kramaric scored five goals in 15 appearances - including two during a five-match unbeaten run - as Hoffenheim avoided relegation from the Bundesliga.
