Denbigh father-of-three died from chainsaw wounds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father-of-three from Denbighshire died from chainsaw wounds to the neck, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aled Lloyd Jones, 48, was building a fence for a friend at a smallholding in Llandyrnog on 14 January 2015 when he was found dead in a field.
He was lying alongside his running tractor, with the chainsaw nearby.
The jury returned a conclusion of accidental death and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was still considering taking action.
Consultant pathologist Dr Mark Atkinson said the cause of death was a chainsaw injury to the neck, where major arteries had been cut.
Mr Jones was from Tanrallt, near Denbigh.
His wife Nerys Mosford-Jones told the jury he "was very safety conscious" and "took pride in his work".
On the afternoon of his death she became worried when he did not return her call.
"I just knew something awful had happened," she said.
Damian Corbett, a HSE investigator, said he could only speculate as to what had happened.
The possibilities included Mr Jones had slipped while standing on a small platform on the front of the tractor where rolls of wire fencing were carried or that a branch may have knocked him off.
John Gittins, the coroner for North Wales East and Central, said there was still a possibility that fencing contractor Robert Francis would face HSE prosecution.
Asked if he had been surprised to hear of Mr Jones' death, Mr Francis said: "Yes, totally."
He declined to answer several other questions on the advice of his barrister.
Expressing his condolences, Mr Gittins said Mr Jones "was clearly a well-known and popular figure".
