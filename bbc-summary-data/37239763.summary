[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Blackburn Rovers have signed Swansea City striker Marvin Emnes on loan until 15 January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old made just four appearances for the Premier League side last season and has failed to score a league goal since his permanent move from Middlesbrough in July 2014.
But the former Netherlands Under-21 international did score 31 goals in 162 games in six years at Boro.
Emnes joins Rovers with the club bottom of the table and without a league win.
