Al-Amin Hossain: Bangladesh bowler's action cleared by ICC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bangladesh seamer Al-Amin Hossain has had his bowling action cleared by the International Cricket Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old was reported in September, but tests have since shown that he extends his arm within the ICC's 15-degree tolerance.
Hossain is available for selection immediately, with Bangladesh currently hosting a tour by Zimbabwe.
He has taken six wickets in six Tests and 16 in nine one-day internationals since making his debut in 2013.
