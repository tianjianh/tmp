Flights were diverted for a short time at Manchester Airport after a drone was spotted close to the flight path.

The police helicopter was scrambled at about 11:20 BST after flight crews on two separate planes reported seeing the drone in the airspace.
An investigation was carried out and Runway One closed for 20 minutes but nothing was found, police said.
An airport spokesman said some flights experienced short delays but all operations have now resumed as normal.
John Mayhew, general manager for air traffic services at Manchester Airport, said: "Flying drones in the close vicinity to any airport without permission is completely unacceptable, with the reported sighting causing delays to inbound and outbound traffic and the diversion of a small number aircraft to other airports.
"The matter has now been referred to the police."
