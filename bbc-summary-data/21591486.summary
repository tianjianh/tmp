The US bank revealed plans to reduce headcount by 3,000-4,000 at its consumer and community banking unit, in a presentation.
And it reiterated previously announced plans to shed 13,000-15,000 jobs at its mortgage banking unit.
It expects about 4,000 losses to come this year, mainly through attrition, a spokeswoman said.
JP Morgan Chase is the biggest US bank.
At the end of last year it employed almost 260,000 people.
The bank, which has reported record profits for the past three years, is trying to reduce its overall expenses by $1bn (Â£660m).
The company spent $19.7bn in consumer and community banking in 2012, and $9.1bn in mortgage banking.
Unlike many other banks who have recently announced job cuts, largely in investment banking, JP Morgan Chase is reducing the number of people working in its branches.
The bank had 5,614 branches at the end of 2012.
Speaking at an investor conference Ryan McInerney, chief executive of consumer banking, said the company plans to add 100 branches a year, though staff per branch will fall by 20% by 2015 through "attrition".
