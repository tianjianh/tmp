Watford & West Brom fined £45,000 each for failing to control players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League sides Watford and West Brom have each been given a £45,000 fine by the Football Association for failing to control their players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charge related to an incident which led to Watford's Roberto Pereyra being sent off during a 3-1 Premier League defeat at The Hawthorns on 3 December.
Pereyra reacted angrily to a challenge by Albion midfielder James McClean, and both players clashed on the touchline.
The FA said players failed to conduct themselves "in an orderly fashion".
