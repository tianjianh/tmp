The band have issued a statement saying that the US presidential candidate does not have permission to use the band's music.
"The Rolling Stones have never given permission to the Trump campaign to use their songs and have requested that they cease all use immediately."
The candidate has been playing their songs at his rallies for months.
Their 1969 hit You Can't Always Get What You Want has been a particular favourite.
The band are not the first to protest at the reality TV star and businessman - now the Republican front-runner - using their music during his campaign.
In February, Adele issued a statement distancing herself from Trump, after he had been playing Adele's hit Rolling In The Deep as his "warm-up" music at his rallies.
The singer issued a statement making it clear she had "not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning," .
Aerosmith have also protested over their music being used in Trump's campaign
Singer Steven Tyler's lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter, saying the use of the band's song Dream On "gives a false impression" he endorses Mr Trump's presidential bid.
Tyler, who is a registered Republican, said it was not a "personal" issue but one of permission and copyright.
Prior to that Neil Young demanded that Trump stop using his song Rockin' in the Free World, which the billionaire had used when he announced his candidacy in June last year.
Young demanded that Trump stop using the song and declared his support for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.
Michael Stipe from REM issued a strongly worded statement when Trump then used the band's song It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).
"Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign," the statement read.
Trump who presented the US Apprentice is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, after his last Republican rival John Kasich quit the race on Wednesday.
