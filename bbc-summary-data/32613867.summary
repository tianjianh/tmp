London gang leader rehomed in Newport admits robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A London gang leader who was given a fresh start in Wales admitted a robbery in his new home city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff Crown Court heard Joland Giwa, 26, robbed the William Hill betting shop in Newport in November 2014.
Giwa covered his face with a red bandana and jumped over the counter before pushing over the cashier and stealing Â£600 from the till.
He was moved to a bail hostel in Newport in January last year to start life away from fellow gang members.
But the court heard that by November he had returned to his life of crime.
He admitted one count of robbery and will be sentenced at a later date.
The South Wales Argus reported last year that Giwa had been released from immigration detention on the order of a judge. Prior to that he had served 27 months in prison for robbery and theft.
The Home Office said at the time that it had opposed the judge's decision to release him from detention, saying: "We vigorously opposed this individual's application for bail and we are very disappointed by the court's decision.
"He will be subject to rigorous monitoring, including an electronic tag, and we are continuing to fight for his removal from the UK."
Attempts to deport him have failed because neither Sierra Leone, Nigeria or any other country would take him.
