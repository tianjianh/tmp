Alastair Cook will not quit as England ODI skipper

Alastair Cook says he will not stand down as England one-day captain despite their series defeat by India.

Tuesday's nine-wicket loss was the latest of three heavy defeats only five months before the World Cup, while ex-players such as Graeme Swann feel Cook should give up the one-day game.
"At this precise moment, I'm still hungry to do it," 29-year-old Cook told BBC Test Match Special.
"If the management say they don't want me, that's a decision they make."
Former captain Michael Vaughan believes England need to hand the responsibility to someone who sees one-day cricket "through one-day eyes".
"We go purely on Tests and purely on stats. It is not being driven by a one-day expert and it has not been for such a long time," he said.
"It needs a one-day expert and Eoin Morgan is a one-day cricketer. He sees the game and he knows what is required."
Cook's position as Test captain came under scrutiny when India took a 1-0 lead in the Test series earlier in the summer, only for England to complete a 3-1 victory.
"The frustrating thing is that, every side I seem to play in for England, there's a question about my place," added opening batsman Cook. "That's a hard place to work from.
"I went from 1-0 down to 3-1. It changes very quickly in sport. My credibility is not for me to comment on."
Cook took charge of the one-day international side in 2011, leading England to the top of the ODI world rankings in 2012.
However, England have won only one series against another Test-playing nation since 2012 and have lost their last four at home, though they did reach the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in 2013.
"If the England management, captain and selectors cannot see there is a burning issue that needs to be changed, then I am worried, angry and sad," Swann said.
"If they start spouting rubbish about 'not executing our plans' then we really should be worried because sanity is not prevailing."
Overall, Cook averages 40.29 as ODI skipper, though that figure was as high as 47.35 in 2012, and has since dropped to 29.83 for 2014.
"I know I have to score more runs," said Cook. "I've done that in the past and I will in the future.
"I've had three-and-a-half years of one-day captaincy experience. We've done some really good stuff in that time, but we're having a heavy blip at the moment."
The latest heavy defeat by India came after the hosts were bowled out for only 206 at Edgbaston, with the tourists chasing down their target with 117 balls to spare.
The final game at Headingley on Friday is England's last home ODI before the World Cup in Australia in New Zealand, which begins in February.
"We haven't played very well, nowhere near our potential," said Cook. "That's the most frustrating thing. The players have to look at themselves and turn it around.
"The guys are hungry to succeed, we're just not delivering at the moment. If anyone thinks their place is safe, then they are wrong."
