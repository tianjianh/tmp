They announced their engagement in the births, marriages and deaths section of the Times newspaper, which is owned by Mr Murdoch's News Corporation company.
It will be the fourth marriage for Mr Murdoch, 84, and the first for Miss Hall, 59, although she lived with singer Sir Mick Jagger for many years.
The new relationship reportedly began in the summer. A spokesman said: "They have loved these past months together."
They were "thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future", he added.
Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who now has US nationality, split up with his third wife Wendi Deng in 2013.
J-Rup and other power couples
American Miss Hall's 23-year relationship with Rolling Stones frontman Jagger, with whom she had four children, ended in 1999.
Mr Murdoch and Miss Hall were first spotted together in public in October at the Rugby World Cup final in London between Australia and New Zealand.
Actress Joan Collins tweeted a picture of herself and Miss Hall, saying: "The future "Mrs. M" glowing about being #engaged to her new beau! #fiance #Congratulations".
The couple were introduced to each other in Australia by one of Mr Murdoch's sisters and his niece, The Times reports.
It says the couple got engaged while in Los Angeles at the weekend, where they attended the Golden Globe awards ceremony.
Media commentator Steve Hewlett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "the recent history of Rupert Murdoch's liaisons" had been "genuinely vexed", following his third marriage to Wendy Deng and the birth of their two daughters.
"There is a family trust which controls 40% of the voting shares in the Murdoch empire... the question was what would happen with the daughters of Wendy Deng," he said.
"The children [from his second marriage] were very upset at the way that their mother had been treated. In order to let Grace and Chloe into the family trust, the others were paid a vast amount of money - it was reportedly in the region of $200 million-plus."
