New car sales up in 'challenging' market

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New cars sales grew in Scotland last month despite a "challenging and uncertain market", according to motor traders.

A total of 15,278 units were registered in November - just under 2% up on a year ago.
However, sales growth was confined to the central belt.
All regions apart from Lothian and Strathclyde saw new registrations fall, according to the Scottish Motor Trade Association (SMTA).
Business and fleet sales grew at the expense of retail, which still accounted for more than 50% of all registrations in Scotland.

The SMTA said the latest figures confirmed that "Scotland's hunger for new vehicles shows no signs of the dramatic slowdown expected by many".
Chief executive Sandy Burgess said: "To experience the growth we have over the last quarter in our challenging and uncertain market pays testimony to the resilience and determination that exists within our industry to deliver the correct mix of exciting fresh, fuel efficient and safer vehicles to meet the demands of Scotland's motoring consumers."
