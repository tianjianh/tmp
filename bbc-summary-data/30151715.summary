'I voted UKIP but don't want them in government'

UKIP is celebrating the election of its second MP after winning the Rochester and Strood by-election.

Now the big question is how many of the party's new voters will choose them again at the general election.
Newsbeat met a young UKIP voter in Rochester who says it's unlikely he'll still support them in May 2015.
Nineteen-year-old Piers says his vote was a protest against the other main parties.
"I voted for UKIP in this by-election, but I don't want them to win the general election and I don't want Nigel Farage to be prime minister," Piers told Newsbeat.
"I've had a read of UKIP's ideas in the pamphlets they've been giving out here.
"To me, they don't seem to have a lot of policies on the important things like the economy.
"That's the main reason I wouldn't want to see them in power."
UKIP's candidate Mark Reckless won the Rochester and Strood by-election with 16,867 votes.
That's 2,920 more than the Conservatives and more than Labour, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats combined.
"I want all the other parties to realise that they're not doing enough," Piers told Newsbeat.
"I'm not pretending to know a huge amount about politics, but what I do know is I won't be able to afford to move out of my mum's house until I'm about 30.
"I could have gone to university, but paying Â£9,000 a year, for three years meant a lot of debt.  I didn't want to have to pay that off in the long run."
UKIP leader Nigel Farage denied the result was just a protest vote against the government.
The party has, as its name suggests, one key policy, to leave the European Union.
"I  think the country wastes a lot of money staying in the EU," said Piers, who works in an antiques and jewellery shop.
"We've just had a recession and I don't see why we keep wasting so much money.
"Between now and the next general election the other parties need to come across as a bit more human to convince me to vote for them.
"They say 'We know you've got these problems' but it doesn't feel like they understand.
"Immigration is a good example.  The country is over-populated and that's why there are so many people without jobs."
Prime Minister David Cameron promised to win the seat back, while Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was determined to meet the "challenge in relation to UKIP."
