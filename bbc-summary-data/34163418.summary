Police were called to reports of an assault at about 23:15 BST on Friday in the St John's Estate on Pitfield Street, Hoxton.
The boy, believed to be 17, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
A witness, who did not want to be named, said she saw the teenager being chased through the estate.
The 40-year-old woman said she saw the victim from the window of her flat.
She said: "There was a big chase.
"They ran through the estate, some on bikes, some on foot. By the end of it when he died there were about 15 people around him."
Officers believe they know the identity of the victim and are in the process of informing his next of kin.
Det Ch Insp Andy Partridge said: "A young man has lost his life in a brutal manner and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area last night and witnessed this attack to come forward and speak to police."
A post-mortem examination will be held in due course, the Met said.
Candles and flowers have been lit in tribute to the victim near to the estate.
The boy is the second teenager to be stabbed to death in London in two days.
On Thursday Shaquan Mario Fearon died from a stab wound to his leg after a fight at a block of flats in Brockley, south-east London.
