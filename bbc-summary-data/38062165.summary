The biggest gainers were Anglo-American, up 7.6%; Glencore, up 5.3%; and BHP Billiton, up 4.9%.
They were boosted by the continuing post-US election rally in international mining shares.
The biggest fallers were the contract catering firm Compass, down 4.7%, and the engineering group Babcock, down 4.6%.
"The crude oil price rally shows no signs of letting up... while continued optimism that President-elect Trump will implement an infrastructure-based fiscal stimulus behemoth is helping metals, and subsequently miners, to also rally," said Henry Croft, research analyst at trading firm Accendo Markets.
Compass had reported slightly slower-than-expected revenue growth.
The firm said its underlying revenue, at constant currencies, grew 5% to Â£19.9bn in the year to the end of September, compared with expectations of 5.2% revenue growth.
In the FTSE 250, shares in Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One were the biggest faller, dropping nearly 13%.
The TV and film production company had reported the departure of its finance head Giles Willits and said that its pre-tax profit for the first half had plunged 80% due to higher cost of sales and administrative expenses.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.6% against the dollar to $1.242, and fell 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.17.
