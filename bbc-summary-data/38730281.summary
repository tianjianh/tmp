Midfielder Jimmy Ryan, defender Conor McLaughlin and forwards David Ball and Bobby Grant could leave this summer.
The Cod Army are fourth in the third tier under former Brentford, Wigan and Leeds boss Rosler.
"Jimmy Ryan, David Ball and Conor McLaughlin have been offered contracts and not accepted," the German said.
The 48-year-old told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Bobby Grant is doing terrifically and I've spoken to him and his agent. Bobby is in a very good place and just needs to carry on and everything will take care of itself.
"I'm planning a future with Bobby but in the end it is up to every individual to accept or not accept.
"The way I see it, all four players will still be here next year."
