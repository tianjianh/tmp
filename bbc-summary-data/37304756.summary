Work to transform the former Strand bar complex includes the demolition of existing buildings at Great James Street and Strand Road.
The new development will also include retail outlets and a restaurant.
It is hoped that the multi-million pound project will provide a boost for the local economy.
The new development was seen as a significant one for council chief executive, John Kelpie.
"We are delighted to see the successful delivery of new tourism developments which will enhance the profile of the City and District in keeping with the objectives of the Community Plan," he said.
"The development will contribute positively to the economic development and regeneration of the city and the wider north west."
Planning Committee Chairman John Boyle said he was delighted to see new plans for the city centre progressing.
"I'm confident that the new hotel will contribute to the revitalisation of this area of the city centre, with the potential to attract new investors and further enhance the profile of the area," he said.
As well as the premises on Strand Road, the new development site will also incorporate adjoining lands on Great James Street and Edward Street, which is currently a vacant site.
