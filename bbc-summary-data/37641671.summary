The 50-year-old Dubliner won two league titles with the Crues in 1995 and 1997 and began his managerial career at Seaview before taking charge of several League of Ireland clubs.
His most recent position was as Roddy Collins' assistant at Waterford United.
He replaces Kieran Harding, who quit last month after Carrick lost seven of their opening nine games.
Callaghan was capped for the Republic of Ireland at Under-21 level.
The defender played for Shelbourne, St Patrick's Athletic and English clubs Stoke City, Oldham, Crewe and Preston as well as having a successful spell in the Irish League with Crusaders.
After replacing Roy Walker as manager for the 1998/99 season, he gained further managerial experience in the League of Ireland with Athlone Town, Longford Town, Bohemians and UCD.
"I would like to transfer the identity of the club onto a professional platform and I look forward to working with all key stakeholders to achieve this objective," he said.
"It's a league I have achieved great success as a player and a manager.
"I am confident of improving the current squad's tactical, technical, psychological and physical abilities."
Club secretary David Hilditch said he hopes the appointment "will bring stability to matters on the field" and develop the club.
Callaghan's first game in charge will be an Irish Premiership match at home to Glenavon on Saturday.
The club are in 11th place with four points from 11 games, with only Portadown further adrift because of their points deduction.
