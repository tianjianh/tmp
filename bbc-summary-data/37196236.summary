The 25-year-old, who signed from Stromsgodset in 2014, has agreed a three-year deal at Craven Cottage, with an option for a further 12 months.
Norway international Johansen has only made one substitute appearance since Brendan Rodgers became Celtic manager in May.
Johansen scored 20 goals in 114 games during his spell in Glasgow.
Rodgers had confirmed that Johansen was on his way out of the club after failing to agree a contract extension.
"It's been difficult because he's been unable to reach an agreement with the club," he said on Friday.
"But I think he has always wanted to play in England, so the opportunity has come for him."
Johansen, who has 29 caps for his country, was a regular starter under Rodgers' predecessor, Ronny Deila, the pair having worked together at Stromsgodset.
