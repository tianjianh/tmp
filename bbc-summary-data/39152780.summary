Uefa has praised the behaviour of the Welsh supporters as the team reached the semi-final of Euro 2016 in France.
However, the rankings take into account matches played in both international and domestic club competitions.
Norway, Iceland and Estonia came ahead of Wales in the Fair Play Rankings, which include 45 countries.
The Football Association of Wales commended the nation's fans, saying their good behaviour at last year's championship was "well-documented".
