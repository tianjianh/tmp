Walsall Council axes 200 jobs in £29m budget cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 200 jobs will be lost at Walsall Council after spending cuts of £29m were approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some children's centres will close and council tax will go up by 1.99%.
But a decision to close five libraries was reversed by councillors at their 2015-16 budget meeting as the authority looks to slash £86m over the next fours years.
Sean Coughlan, leader of the Labour-led council, said some people will be pleased and others left disappointed.
Cuts of £10.1m were originally put out to consultation, Mr Coughlan said, and the remaining savings of £18m will come from the authority "being more efficient, working differently and cuts in management".
Twelve children's centres will close saving £4.4m, the council confirmed after its budget meeting on Thursday.
Proposed savings of £288,000 by closing libraries in Streetly, Pheasey, Beechdale and Walsall Wood and south Walsall, £140,000 from changes to garden waste collections and £226,000 from the street cleaning budget were removed from the proposals.
They will instead be funded by a payment from council reserves.
