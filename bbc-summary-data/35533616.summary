An appeal has been launched to trace the families featured in a series of pictures taken in some of England's poorest and most deprived areas.

The images were taken by photographer Nick Hedges in the 1960s and 1970s for housing charity Shelter in some of the country's biggest cities.
He said the conditions some families lived in "shocked me to the core".
An exhibition will be held later this year in Sheffield, Birmingham and Manchester to mark Shelter's 50th year.
The images were taken in Birmingham, Manchester, Salford, Newcastle, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, London and Liverpool.
Mr Hedges said: "It would be wonderful to meet the children I photographed all those years ago and for them to be able to tell their stories.
"I often wonder what happened to them, if they went on to lead happy and healthy lives."
"When I was commissioned by Shelter to take these photographs, I never imagined that decades later they would still have such impact," said Mr Hedges.
"The poverty and terrible conditions I witnessed shocked me to the core.
"I hope that all these years later, by reconnecting with some of those I photographed, I am able to hear good news of what happened to the families."
Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive, said: "We would love to hear the stories of the people behind these iconic pictures to help us mark 50 years of fighting bad housing and homelessness.
"I'd encourage anyone who recognises themselves, or family members and friends, to get in touch and let us know what happened after they were taken."
"These photographs are a sobering piece of history not only for Shelter, but the nation as a whole, and it's important to preserve the stories behind them.
"They show us how far we have come, but also that we must do more for the tens of thousands of families and individuals still desperate for a safe, secure and affordable home."
The charity is asking anyone who recognises themselves or anyone else in the images to email: stories@shelter.org.uk or call: 020 7505 2032.
