Football success in Euro 2016 sees manager Chris Coleman receive an OBE, and former FAW president Trefor Lloyd Hughes handed an MBE.
Gold-winning Olympians and Paralympians have been honoured for their exploits in Rio.
Cyclists Owain Doull and Elinor Barker and sailor Hannah Mills have been given MBEs.
Wales' Paralympians have been recognised too with javelin-thrower Hollie Arnold, swimmer Aaron Moores and table-tennis player Rob Davies awarded MBEs after winning gold in Rio in the summer, along with Swansea-based boccia player David Smith.
Smith, from Hampshire, has two Olympic golds in boccia, a sport similar to bowls.
Another long-serving administrator to be appointed MBE is Bill Owen, who served as chairman and president of Welsh Cycling for more than 20 years.
Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns offered his congratulations to Coleman, who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
"A well-deserved OBE to Chris Coleman" he said.
"The achievement of the Welsh football team in the Euros 2016 was huge for Welsh football and the nation.  Chris led by example and  proved we were 'Together Stronger'.  Congratulations."
Cardiff-born Hannah Mills, who took a sailing gold in the Rio Olympics in the summer, took to twitter to express her delight.
She said: "MBE!! Quite simply, FAB. Thanks everyone for the support this year. Let's see what 2017 can deliver. It's got a lot to do to keep up with 2016."
Paralympic javelin-thrower Hollie Arnold also took to social media too, tweeting: "What a way to end an incredible 2016!! I'm very honoured to become an MBE for services to Field Athletics!"
Table-tennis player Rob Davies, who also struck Paralympic gold in the summer, said he was delighted with his MBE.
"I feel absolutely ecstatic that I've been named in this year's honours list to receive an MBE," said the 32 year old from Brecon.
"My face just lit up when I read the letter, I was just so overwhelmed and happy.
I just couldn't believe it! I feel so privileged and proud and would just like to thank everybody who's been part of this amazing journey I've been on.  I can't wait to make 2017 special!"
