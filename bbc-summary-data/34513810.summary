The blaze, on the top floor of the University of Bristol flats in Colston Street, is thought to have started in a kitchen at about 13:00 BST on Monday.
No-one was hurt when debris rained down on the street below, and inspectors have begun to assess the damage.
Avon Fire Service said the building is unsafe and the street will remain closed for the rest of the week.
A University of Bristol spokesperson said all 121 students living in the flats have been found temporary housing.
Bedding, toiletries, food and clothing are being supplied to them.
The fire is completely out but fire crews were called back to check on the building overnight after reports of smoke at 04:00 BST.
"It was a concern to us how fast that fire went through the roof and we'll be talking to the university about their buildings," said area manager Mark Anderson.
Some 40 firefighters worked to bring the flames under control at the height of the fire.
