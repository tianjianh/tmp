The actor, who was known to millions as Coronation Street binman Eddie Yeats in the 1970s and 1980s, died "peacefully in his sleep" on Friday night.
It followed a "long courageous battle" with prostate cancer, his family said.
Hughes, who lived on the Isle of Wight, was also known for his roles as Twiggy in TV comedy The Royle Family and Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances.
He had thought he had beaten prostate cancer in 2009, but was told it had returned after collapsing at home in 2010.
Hughes first appeared in 1960s shows such as Z-Cars and The Likely Lads. He was the voice of Paul McCartney in the Beatles film Yellow Submarine.
Other roles included Vernon in Heartbeat and Uncle Keith in teen drama Skins, guest-starring in episodes of Doctor Who, Casualty, Boon and The Upper Hand.
A Coronation Street spokeswoman said: "We are very sad to hear of the death of Geoffrey Hughes.
"He created a legendary and iconic character in Eddie Yeats who will always be part of Coronation Street.
Everyone connected with the programme sends our sincerest condolences to his family."
Coronation Street star William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, said: "I am so sorry to hear about Geoffrey. He was a warm, lovable actor, with great comedy timing.
"He will be greatly missed, one of the Street's memorable characters."
Helen Worth, who plays Gail McIntyre in Coronation Street, said: "Geoff was a very dear friend for many years, and I'm very sad to hear the news of his passing.
"He was a master of gentle comedy and brought pleasure to so many people. He will be sadly missed."
Sally Lindsay, who played barmaid Shelley Unwin in Corrie, wrote on Twitter that her first TV job was playing Twiggy's girlfriend in The Royle Family, "and he was so kind RIP lovely man x".
Hughes was appointed Deputy Lord Lieutenant for the Isle of Wight in 2009, providing the official link between the island and royalty at formal events.
