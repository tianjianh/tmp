The 26-year-old has won the Currie Cup with Western Province twice and made more than 50 appearances for Stormers.
"Leaving Cape Town and the Stormers is going to be tough and a big change," Groom told the club website.
"But I'm looking forward to embracing new experiences both on and off the field."
Northampton are currently fifth in the Premiership, unable to finish in the top four going into Saturday's final match of the season against Gloucester.
