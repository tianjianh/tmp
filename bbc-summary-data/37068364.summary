[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Joe McNerney hit a second-half equaliser as Crawley maintained their unbeaten record in League Two with a battling home draw against Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Undefeated Barnet took an early lead through former Crawley striker John Akinde, who also went close on four other occasions in the first half.
Akinde, who bagged 24 goals in 48 appearances last season, took only three minutes to make his mark.
Sam Togwell set up Akinde with a headed pass and he outpaced defender Alex Davey before smashing the ball home.
Akinde then had a goalbound shot parried by goalkeeper Yusuf Mersin, before heading inches wide from a corner by Ryan Watson.
Crawley awoke from their slumbers when midfielder Josh Payne had a 25-yard shot pushed around the post by keeper Josh Vickers.
Akinde, who scored twice against his former club in Barnet's 3-0 win at Crawley in the final game of last season, went close again when he rolled the ball inches wide from a tight angle.
Keeper Mersin parried another goal attempt from Akinde just before the break after a strong run from Alex Nicholls.
Barnet keeper Vickers saved well from Davey and captain Jimmy Smith before defender McNerney levelled midway through the second half from point-blank range, after a shot from James Collins came back off the crossbar.
McNerney was later well placed at the other end to block a goalbound shot from substitute Mauro Vilhete.
