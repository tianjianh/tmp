[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paint was thrown at the wall, in Glasnevin Cemetery, in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. It was discovered on Sunday morning.
The wall bears the names of all those who died as a result of the 1916 conflict.
The Glasnevin Trust, which operates the historic graveyard, described it as "an act of callous vandalism".
"Glasnevin Trust is currently engaging with the Gardaí on the matter and will not be commenting further at this time,"  the statement said.
Gardaí (Irish police) in Mountjoy are investigating the incident.
The paint is not confined to any category of deceased.
