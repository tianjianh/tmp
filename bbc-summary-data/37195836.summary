Judge's 'LOL' as he jails online boaster who ducked sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who avoided prison after being convicted of a street attack has been jailed for refusing to perform unpaid work, then boasting about it online.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Newlands, 24, was given 150 hours community service for punching a vulnerable man in Glasgow last year.
He refused to perform the unpaid work and was twice given another chance.
Judge Norman Ritchie jailed Newlands for nine months after hearing he posted on Facebook: "I'm out bro, easy." The judge added: "As they say, LOL."
Newlands, who is currently serving an eight-month sentence for assault and breach of the peace, will serve the latest sentence when his current sentence ends.
Newlands was among eight people who ended up in court after Ivor Miller, a 27-year-old man who has learning difficulties, was called "a beast" and chased until he threw himself out of a flat window.
During that hearing at the High Court in Glasgow in January, judge Ritchie described the group as "a pack of animals".
Newlands, from Glasgow, was given a community sentence but refused to carry out unpaid work.
The court heard that he later posted on Facebook: "A got a high court conviction n they never sent me eh jail instead gave me a community order ..told them to stick it...so got sent back to court n what do they dae?
"The judge says mr Newlands I would refer to you as an idiot..n then what does he dae? He geez me it again...probation am no dayn it simple!!!"
After being returned to court, Newlands admitted breaching the order.
Judge Ritchie told him: "It's always interesting to see a different view on sentencing as in 'I'm out bro easy.' As they say lol."
The judge added: "I gave you two chances. You didn't take the chances. I hope you don't think I'm doing this out of anger. In truth it enlivened what was otherwise a dull day."
