Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Wolves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday survived a Wolves onslaught to share the spoils in a tense goalless draw at Hillsborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme denied Vincent Sasso early on and also made a double save to foil Steven Fletcher and Fernando Forestieri before the break.
But Jon Dadi Bodvarsson hit the bar and Joe Mason fired his follow-up over as Wolves ended the first-half strongly.
Mason then hit the post with a shot before Matt Doherty had a strike cleared off the line by Adam Reach.
The draw left Wednesday sixth in the Championship table and in the play-off places, with Wolves - just the second team to keep the Owls scoreless at home this season - remaining 18th after 25 games.
In a bright start, and Wednesday's strongest spell of the game, Ikeme did well to keep a Sasso header out from a Barry Bannan free-kick.
And while Fletcher and Forestieri again had the visiting keeper scrambling before the break, he was rarely troubled after that.
At the other end, a penalty shout was turned away as Owls keeper Keiren Westwood appeared to bring down Doherty late in the half which ended with Bodvarsson's effort against the woodwork and Mason's miss.
The visitors continued to pressure after the break, carving out chances but failing to take them, while Wednesday fashioned a number of chances of their own with Forestieri having the best of them saved by Ikeme.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"I think it was a typical game after such a short break of 48 hours.  You try your best, you put the best team out to win the game but you also have to put out the team who has recovered the best.
"I think the scoreline was correct. We had chances, they had chances. We wanted to do better in this game, but we did what we could have done under the circumstances and the draw was the fair result.
"I don't know if we win one point or lose two points but I think the time off now will be very good to us."
Wolves manager Paul Lambert:
"I think anybody at the stadium saw that we deserved to win. If we walked out of the stadium winning 3-0 I don't think anybody would have questioned it.
"I thought the pressing was fantastic. The game-plan was perfect, other than the goals we deserved to get. Everything about us, the passing, the tempo. I'm just disappointed we've managed not to win.
"It shows you how far we've come. It wasn't that long ago that Sheffield Wednesday came down to our place and beat us quite easily, so the progress we've made is huge."
