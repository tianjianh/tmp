[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gulam Chowdhury, 24, was convicted of murdering his love rival Mohammed Yasser Afzal at the Old Bailey.
Mr Afzal was killed outside a cab office in Broadway, Stratford, in March 2014.
The court heard Chowdhury, of Barking, plotted to kill Mr Afzal because of a row over a woman who had been in a relationship with both men.
The woman had told Chowdhury that Mr Afzal had compromising pictures of her on a mobile phone.
She had said he was threatening to expose their relationship to her parents, who did not approve.
Mr Afzal, from Forest Gate, was working at E20 Cars when he was stabbed 20 times in the attack on 24 March. He never regained consciousness.
Officers managed to place Chowdhury at the scene of the murder through mobile phone records.
Det Insp Euan McKeeve said: "Gulam Chowdhury carried out a ferocious assault on Mohammed Afzal.
"The level of violence used was shocking and ensured that Mohammed would not survive the attack."
