Tom Bedford's family thought he was upset because of the match but when he collapsed his dad John attempted CPR.
The family said he died of either an undiagnosed heart condition or a blood clot and are urging parents to get their children to get tested.
Tom's heart is undergoing tests but it could be several months before a cause of death is known.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
The family said a post-mortem examination revealed it was not clear how Tom died and further tests are being carried out at a specialist centre in London.
Tom, a passionate Leicester City fan, was watching the FA Cup replay on 20 January between the Foxes and Tottenham Hotspur in his bedroom at home in Leicestershire.
His dad, also a fan, was watching the game downstairs because "they had a tendency to wind each other up" while watching football.
After Spurs scored their second goal he appeared agitated and upset which was put down to the stress of the game.
When he complained to his mum that he was struggling to breath an ambulance was called but by then he had collapsed and his dad had to attempt CPR.
"It was the worst thing a parent could ever have to do and to see your child get slowly worse in front of you. It was awful. I couldn't believe what was happening," he said.
"It was intense, it was unfair and it was wrong."
Tom was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary but he later died.
The family said doctors believe Tom's death was likely caused by an irregular heartbeat or a blood clot but it could be six months before they find out more.
Leicester Coroner's Office said it is waiting for the cause of death to be established before deciding if an inquest is needed.
