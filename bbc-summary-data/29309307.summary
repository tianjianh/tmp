It said Tian Tian's hormone levels have returned to normal and a reabsorption of the foetus may have occurred.
The zoo said data gathered since conception took place indicated she was expecting and likely to carry to full term but this did not happen.
Tian Tian is said to be in good health and the outdoor viewing area of her enclosure has reopened to the public.
Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Tian Tian's hormone levels have now returned to normal, so we can confirm that she is no longer pregnant.
"Panda reproduction and biology is complex, all data gathered since conception took place pointed to a pregnant panda likely to carry to full term, sadly this did not happen.
"There is no evidence she has had a miscarriage, so late reabsorption of the foetus could have occurred.
"Although Tian Tian has not successfully given birth, it is important for her individual biology as a female giant panda and for the future of giant panda conservation across the globe that we tried.
"We will also be reviewing all our data and procedures from this year and last."
