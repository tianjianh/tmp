The 28-year-old left Ewood Park in May after three years at Rovers.
Spurr started his career at Sheffield Wednesday and has also had a two-year stint at Doncaster Rovers.
"I'm delighted to finally sort things out and I can't wait to get started. They made me feel wanted as soon as the season was finished," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I like to think I'm a hard working footballer and I'll leave everything out there."
He is the third new signing so far this summer after striker Simon Makienok and goalkeeper Chris Maxwell arrived at the Championship club.
