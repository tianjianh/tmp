Guangdong was hardest hit, reporting 36 deaths after days of heavy rain, said the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Six people had died in Jiangxi, added the ministry.
And further bad weather is forecast for Guangdong later on Saturday, with warnings of heavy wind and rain causing more flooding in the next few days.
Teams of relief workers have been sent to oversee the recovery efforts in the hardest hit areas, officials said.
Heavy rainstorms in Guangdong reportedly caused widespread flooding in the province's mountainous areas and affected nine cities including the provincial capital, Guangzhou.
Nearly 900,000 people had been affected across the state, with floods destroying 2,675 houses, China's Xinhua News Agency reported.
