[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rikki Neave death: Suspect James Watson returned to UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man suspected of murdering a six-year-old boy is back in the UK after leaving the country while on bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rikki Neave's naked body was found in woodland near his Peterborough home in November 1994. He had been strangled. The investigation reopened last year.
James Watson, 35, from Peterborough was arrested and bailed in April and re-arrested in Portugal on 2 August.
Officers from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire travelled to Lisbon to fetch him.
He was initially bailed until June and re-bailed until September, but last month police confirmed he had left the country.
He was traced to Portugal where local police detained him in the capital. He did not resist extradition.
Rikki Neave was last seen leaving his Welland estate home for school on the morning of 28 November 1994.
His body was found the next day in a wooded area about five minutes walk away.
He had died as a result of compression to the neck, post-mortem tests found.
Rikki's mother, Ruth Neave, was cleared of his murder at a trial in 1996. She later admitted child neglect and cruelty and was jailed for seven years.
A Crimewatch appeal broadcast on the 20th anniversary of Rikki's death led officers to release an e-fit of two teenage boys they wanted to talk to in connection with the case.
The pair had been seen walking out of the woods where Rikki's body was found on the morning of 29 November.
