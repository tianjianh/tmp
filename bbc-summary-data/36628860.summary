Melanie Hall murder: Extra time granted to question suspect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have been granted extra time to question a 45-year-old man on suspicion of the murder of Bath graduate Melanie Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, from Wiltshire, was arrested on Thursday morning and remains in police custody.
Miss Hall, 25, was last seen alive at Cadillacs nightclub in Bath city centre on 9 June 1996.
Her partial remains were found 13 years later in a plastic bag near a slip road of the M5 at Thornbury in 2009.
Dental records were subsequently used to identify the hospital worker.
On the 20th anniversary of her disappearance police revealed they had obtained DNA evidence from an item found at the scene where Miss Hall's remains were discovered.
Her parents, Steve and Pat Hall, also made an appeal for information and offered Â£50,000 of their own money as a reward for information leading to a conviction.
Mr Hall said then: "The loss of Melanie has been life changing for us and we'll never be the same people as we were before Melanie disappeared.
"Melanie's murder has had a terrible impact on our family and I know my wife Pat is tortured by what happened to our daughter, and will never get over it.
"I believe this inquiry will be solved by one of two things - either through the advancement of DNA helping to identify who was responsible, or someone who knows a crucial piece of information having the moral fibre to contact the police."
A renewed appeal for information was also made on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow programme.
This programme led to more than 20 calls from the public offering information.
The force does not have a prime suspect or any conclusive evidence that Miss Hall's death is linked to other murders or sexual offences.
Police have previously arrested nine people in connection with the case but no-one has been charged.
