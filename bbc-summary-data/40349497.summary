The 32-year-old made 42 appearances last season, but could not save the Latics from relegation to League One.
He was only 12 months into a three-year contract but wanted to be closer to his family in Nottinghamshire.
"He's a great professional who gave 100% to the cause while with us and we respect the fact he has been honest," boss Paul Cook told the club website.
