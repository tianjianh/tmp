[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand World Cup-winning scrum-half Piri Weepu says he does not regret his move to London Welsh, despite eight successive losses in all competitions.

Welsh have conceded 352 points in those eight games, an average of 44 per game.
Asked if he regretted his move, Weepu, who suffered a stroke at the start of the year, said: "Not at all.
"After the stroke, I was grateful for the opportunity and hopefully I can contribute a bit more before the end of the season."
Following the 31-year-old's stroke, 71-time capped Weepu joined the Premiership new boys in the summer from Super 15 side Auckland Blues, having found his opportunities limited in Southern Hemisphere rugby.
Weepu said even with the thrashings the Premiership's bottom club have received each week, the spirit is still high in the training camp in Richmond.
"It's not that difficult (losing each week), we just need to tweak a few things, be better in a few areas we've been having issues with," he said.
"Other than that the boys are a good group of lads, the coaches are great staff and I can't complain much. The losses are the only thing letting us down. Other than that the spirit is still within the team. Everyone is still getting on."
Weepu, who will miss this weekend's LV= Cup game against Bath with an ankle injury, admitted he has found it tougher than he expected but that he has settled well into life in Richmond - where he lives above a cafe with Australian flanker Lachlan McCaffrey.
"I've been in a situation before where a team is constantly losing and you just have keep working," he added. "Hopefully we'll start getting the results we want.
"It won't happen overnight, this is a new squad and we are still getting used to each other's style of play."
