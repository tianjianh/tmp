Both Saturday and Monday's scheduled sessions were called off due to a combination of thick mist and heavy rain.
Clerk of the course Gary Thompson cancelled Monday's session with no chance of the track drying in time.
Tuesday's session is scheduled to get under way at 18:20 BST
Manx Radio TT presenter Tim Glover said riders had already completed 778 practice laps by this time in 2016.
All roads around the 37.75-mile (60km) TT course will close to traffic at 18:00 BST, with the mountain section closing an hour earlier.
Practice will be held each evening ahead of the opening racing on Saturday.
The TT sees riders reach speeds in excess of 200mph on closed roads.
Last year, more than 40,000 fans travelled to the island for the festival, which has been running for 110 years.
