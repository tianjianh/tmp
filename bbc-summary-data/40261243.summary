Each volume will include three novellas written by a variety of authors. Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker will edit them.
The novellas will all be original stories, with the first volume due to come out in February 2018.
Brooker announced the "all-new" works would appear in a "high-tech 'paper' format".
The satirical TV drama series began life on Channel 4 before moving to Netflix last year for its third series.
He said: "All-new Black Mirror stories from exciting authors - that's a joyous prospect. And they're appearing in a high-tech new format known as a book.
"Apparently, you just have to glance at some sort of ink code printed on paper and images and sounds magically appear in your head, enacting the story. Sounds far-fetched to me, but we'll see."
The authors of the book series have not yet been announced but will be "leading names in the literary world", according to The Bookseller. The books will be published in hardback and ebook form.
The next TV series of Black Mirror is due to drop on Netflix in October, with one of the episodes directed by Jodie Foster.
