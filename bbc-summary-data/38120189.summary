[SN]TITLE[SN]
Monaco 4-0 Marseille

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monaco completed a good week by following up their win over Tottenham with a thrashing of Marseille to move back to the top of Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Tuesday, they beat Spurs 2-1 to progress to the Champions League knockout stages, knocking out the English side in the process.
And they now go above local rivals Nice in the French league - for 24 hours at least.
Gabriel Boschilia opened the scoring, Valere Germain scored twice and Guido Carrillo added a fourth in stoppage time to make it Monaco's biggest win against Marseille.
Nice, behind Monaco on goal difference, will go back to the top if they do not lose to Bastia on Sunday (16:00 GMT).
