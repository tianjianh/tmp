Plan to replace Strontian Primary School in Ardnamurchan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council has set out plans to replace one of Scotland's most remote schools.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strontian Primary in Strontian in the north west Highlands was built in the mid-1970s and takes pupils from the Ardnamurchan and Morvern peninsulas.
Councillors will be asked a meeting next week to agree that the school be accommodated in new units at the village's Ardnamurchan High School.
The proposal would cost about Â£1.16m, council officers have said.
The 1970s building forms part of a wider complex, that includes the village hall.
Council officers said the local authority would work with the community to explore the future use and ownership of the hall.
