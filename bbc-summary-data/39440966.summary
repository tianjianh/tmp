Welsh squash player Tesni Evans hopes to end her season on a high at the women's World Championships from 5-14 April in El Gouna, Egypt.

Evans, 24, is ranked 18th in the world after reaching the quarter-finals of the Â£40,000 Cleveland Classic in March.
"I'm seeded 16th. I've sneaked in as a few people have pulled out," Evans told BBC Wales Sport.
She says there will be a high standard of competition at the World Championships.
"They'll be girls who are 16 or 17 who you've probably never hear of and they are very good," added Evans.
"You never have an easy game in Egypt. You go there and you get locals and qualifiers who are never easy.
"It would be good to end on a real high. Egypt is always a place I've played well in."
Six of the top 20 female squash players in the world rankings are Egyptian and Evans says it'll be a challenge playing in the North African nation.
"They love it. It's a big thing for them. It's their biggest sport and they are taking squash to a new level right now," she said.
"It's in their genes. From a young age they take it so seriously. When they go to school they play squash. It's amazing.
"We could learn a lot from them."
Evans competed in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, but was knocked out at the final 16.
She hopes her experience in 2016-17 will help to secure a medal for Wales in the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia.
"Glasgow is one of the best things I've ever done so I'm very excited there's a chance of me going to the Gold Coast," she said.
"I will be in a better position than I was four years ago and I'm hoping to do really well there. I would love to win a medal. It is definitely a goal for me.
"I think the doubles is a definite opportunity for a medal just because doubles is a different game.
"If we can get enough practice in there's no reason why any of us in the Welsh team cannot grab a medal."
