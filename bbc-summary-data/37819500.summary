Fleetwood's Jimmy Ryan came closest to breaking the deadlock but home keeper Magnus Norman tipped his second-half free-kick on to the crossbar.
Southport failed to seriously trouble the visitors' defence, with most of their efforts coming from long range.
Norman had to react quickly to deny Devante Cole a winner in stoppage time.
Fleetwood's Bobby Grant shot wide on the half-hour mark but Uwe Rosler's side could not find a way past on-loan Fulham stopper Norman in the second period.
At the other end, Town keeper Chris Neal was forced to palm away James Caton's shot from just outside the area.
After play was briefly halted when a smoke bomb and a flare were thrown onto the pitch by Southport fans, Fleetwood's best chances came during six minutes of second-half injury time.
First Norman smothered Cole's low shot then Cian Bolger sent a powerful header narrowly wide after losing his marker at a corner.
The winners of next week's replay at Highbury will travel to League One strugglers Shrewsbury in the second round.
