Greek election: What was the point?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alexis Tsipras's electoral gamble has paid off. For the third time in a year, he has secured the support of Greek voters.

But was it worth another period of political instability in Greece?
Here are six things we have learned from the vote.
You could be forgiven for wondering why Greeks rejected the terms of a 5 July bailout only to vote Alexis Tsipras back into power - even though he agreed to another tough austerity package only last month.
That July referendum, when 61% of voters backed the Syriza leader's rejection of the eurozone terms, was probably more pointless than the September election, as all it told us was that most Greeks approved of his handling of debt talks.
The latest vote has revealed that, despite the exhaustive list of reforms that Mr Tsipras has signed up to, Greeks still want his leftist party in power. They trust him to secure the debt relief he has promised to push for, when the bailout comes up for review by Greece's creditors in the next few weeks.
Tsipras gambles Greek future on euro
One of the reasons Mr Tsipras called elections was that he had lost his majority in parliament, and his credibility with the far left of his own party was damaged.
Dozens of his own MPs had refused to back Greece's third eurozone bailout and 25 of those far-left dissidents abandoned the party to form the third biggest group in parliament, Popular Unity.
These included ministers such as Panagiotis Lafazanis and influential parliament speaker Zoe Kostantopoulou.
Now the Syriza leader is back with almost as many MPs as before and Popular Unity has failed to have any of its 25 MPs elected.
Although many in his party resent the terms of the bailout, Alexis Tsipras has freed himself of the most hardened opponents and moved his left-wing party closer to the centre.
With 7% of the vote and 18 MPs in the new parliament, Golden Dawn are the third biggest force in Greek politics, after Syriza and New Democracy.
They have increased their share of the vote from January, even though most Golden Dawn leaders are on trial, in connection with the murder of  anti-racist rapper Pavlos Fyssas by a Golden Dawn supporter.
Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos said Golden Dawn's result was particularly significant as "we had an entire system against us".
Support for the far right was most visible among those hardest hit by Greece's economic crisis. More than 16% of Greece's unemployed backed Golden Dawn.
There was also a small spike of support in some of the eastern islands hit by the migrant crisis. With the overall turnout down, it is worth noting that the number of Golden Dawn votes fell just below 380,000, lower than in January and in 2012, when the party also won 18 seats.
Nervous Greeks fear Golden Dawn trial
Turnout was below 57%, well down on the 63% who voted in the July referendum and the January election.
One polling station in Athens reported only 25 voters during a three-hour period.
Although the declining turnout fits into a trend in Greece - in 2007 three-quarters of the electorate voted - the latest figures suggest Greeks have become weary of being sent back to the ballot box.
January's poll was a momentous toppling of Greece's accepted political order and July's referendum came at a decisive time for Greeks as they struggled with capital controls that had shut their banks.
But Sunday's vote had none of that excitement.
Turnout was even lower on the eastern islands near the Turkish coast which have been hardest hit by the influx of migrants.
Only 43% of voters turned out on Lesbos, which saw 50,000 migrants arrive last month alone.
For many Greeks, who have watched their shores become a transit point for 300,000 people trying to get to northern Europe, the election was secondary to the crisis on their doorstep.
But on the mainland migration was not a major issue in the campaign.
Migrant crisis eclipses vote
In the run-up to election day, Greeks were being told that Syriza and New Democracy were running neck and neck, at around 31%.
Syriza's eventual margin of victory was 7% - narrower than in the January election but not by much.
Greeks were also told ahead of the 5 July referendum on the eurozone bailout that the vote was too close to call, with the Yes and No campaigns both running at around 45%. In the event, the No's had it, by a comfortable margin of 61.3% to 38.7%.
