[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The majority of British Muslims oppose violence against people who publish images depicting the Prophet Muhammad, a poll for the BBC suggests.

The survey also indicates most have no sympathy with those who want to fight against Western interests.
But 27% of the 1,000 Muslims polled by ComRes said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the Paris attacks.
Almost 80% said they had found it deeply offensive when images depicting the Prophet were published.

95%
feel a loyalty to Britain
93%
say they should obey British laws
46% feel prejudice against Islam makes it difficult being Muslim in Britain
78% are offended when images of the Prophet Muhammad are published
11% feel sympathy for people who want to fight against western interests
Asked if acts of violence against those who publish images of the Prophet Muhammad can "never be justified", 68% agreed that such violence was never justifiable.
But 24% disagreed with the statement, while the rest replied "don't know" or refused to answer.
The poll, carried out between 26 January and 20 February, suggests 32% of British Muslims were not surprised by January's attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine, which published depictions of the Prophet, and a kosher supermarket in Paris.
The poll also suggests that almost half of British Muslims believe they face discrimination because of their faith and that Britain is becoming less tolerant, while the same percentage feel prejudice against Islam makes it difficult being a Muslim in the UK.
Some 35% said they felt most British people did not trust Muslims, and a fifth said they thought Western liberal society could never be compatible with Islam.
Of those polled, 95% felt a loyalty to Britain, while 93% believed that Muslims in Britain should always obey British laws.
Nearly 20% of Muslim women questioned said they felt unsafe in Britain, compared with 10% of men.
Islam is a religion of peace and love - not violence: sentiments that have been expressed numerous times here in Bradford.
Out of the dozens of people I've spoken to, an overwhelming majority have said they're angry that their interpretation of Islam has been eclipsed by an extreme ideology that is too often projected in the media.
They say it's this that is fuelling prejudice, and it's leading to some in the community feeling ostracised from British society.
As one young man said: "We're all being branded as extremists in this country. I am British but sometimes it feels as if Britain is rejecting me because of my faith and that hurts."
One thousand Muslims were polled as part of our survey - a number statistically representative of the population of close to three million Muslims in Britain.
A student at Bradford College, Samaia Aslal, told the BBC that politicians and the media perpetuated a dehumanised image of Muslims, which opens them up to all forms of attack.
She said: "It is up to the rest of British society to stop looking at us as some kind of threat, to accept us.
"To not always ask us how British we feel, that's as stupid as asking 'how do you feel about your red hair today?'.
"To ask this whilst alienating us, spying on us, making us feel like we don't fit in."
But another student Mohammed Al Hakaroon said integration was the responsibility of both Muslims and non-Muslims.
"There is no Islamic regulation or law that prevents integration. Everyone should be treated as equal: Muslim, white, black, Asian, as the Prophet himself has said."
Musmil Afik, who also studies at Bradford College, said he was angry and frustrated, so he could understand why this drove one in four people to support the attacks in Paris.
He said: " But this is not what Islam is about. Islam is about peace, love and harmony."
Former Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi said the poll highlighted her view that the government's terrorism policy was not based on enough evidence.
Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme she said: "What is the evidence that shows us how people are being radicalised?
"What is the evidence that shows us the route to someone becoming a terrorist. We just don't have this.
"We don't have definitive data that we work to and that is why I think we get much of our policy wrong."
Twelve people died when an attack was launched on the office of Charlie Hebdo on 7 January.
The following day a policewoman was murdered by Amedy Coulibaly, who also held up a Jewish supermarket the next day, killing four people.
Coulibaly and the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen, Said and Cherif Kouachi, were shot dead by police in two separate sieges.
