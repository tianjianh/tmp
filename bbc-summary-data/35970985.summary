Man City's Martin Demichelis accepts FA betting charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City's Martin Demichelis has accepted a Football Association charge that he broke betting rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old Argentina defender was accused of 12 breaches relating to matches between 22 and 28 January 2016.
Demichelis, who is in France for City's Champions League quarter-final at Paris St-Germain on Wednesday, had until 17:00 BST on Wednesday to respond.
The FA will decide Demichelis' punishment, with potential sanctions ranging from a fine to a ban.
Rules introduced in the 2014-15 season prevent players and coaches from betting on any football activity worldwide.
There is no suggestion the charge related to any City games in which Demichelis has featured this season, nor any match he could have had any influence over.
