The bodies of Bonheur Musungay, 14, and Stella Kambi, 17, were recovered from water at Thorpe Marshes nature reserve near Norwich on Wednesday evening.
Post-mortem examinations have confirmed the cause of the teenagers' deaths was drowning. An inquest has been opened.
Stella's parents Engele and Daniel Aketo said she had rescued a boy from the same spot a year ago.
"We will miss her so much and hope our faith will get us through," said Mr Aketo. "But we are very proud of her."
Family friend Esperance Kuanzabi said Stella had saved her son in the previous incident.
"It looks very safe there, but people underestimate the dangers," she said. "She was a very brave girl."
Mr and Mrs Aketo said Stella and sister Claudine, 16, were not swimming, but were sunbathing on the beach next to the broad.
When Bonheur got into trouble both the girls, who were strong swimmers, dived in to save him. Claudine survived but Stella was dragged under.
Mr Aketo said: "She was the oldest of our six children and looked after everyone - she was very caring.
"She was studying nursing at college and wanted to be a paediatrician.
"She was a good Christian who had worked hard to do well at school. She was kind, funny and just made people happy."
The family arrived in the UK as refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008.
Miss Kambi attended City College Norwich after leaving Thorpe St Andrew High School.
A spokesman for Bonheur's family said: "I cannot believe he has gone. He was like a brother to me.
"When you were having a bad day, he would make you laugh and cheer you up. We are all very devastated."
Emergency services launched a major search and rescue operation to find the pair but were unable to save them.
Police and firefighters are now investigating what happened.
