Striker Josh Magennis feels a move to Charlton Athletic from Kilmarnock was simply too attractive to ignore.

The Northern Ireland international, 25, made his debut for the English League One club on Saturday after signing a two-year deal on Thursday.
"It was a chance I couldn't really turn down, with the status of the club," he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"It was a no-brainer really. There was a lot of going back and forward but finally they managed to get it done."
Kilmarnock rejected three earlier bids from Charlton for Magennis but finally accepted an offer reported to be around Â£250,000.
Magennis revealed there was "various interest" in him after he played in three of his country's four matches at Euro 2016, an experience he feels made him a better player.
"It raises your profile and if you can do something that grabs somebody's attention it always bodes well for you," he said.
"I learnt a lot when I was away. Six weeks with 22 players is a long time and the majority of those players are in the Premier League and Championship so the standard of their training is very high.
"I was able to learn from different types of strikers like [Kyle] Lafferty and Will Grigg and what midfielders expect of you, like [Steven] Davis and Oliver Norwood."
Magennis, who insists he was "happy at Kilmarnock and progressing under Lee Clark", is determined to start scoring for Russell Slade's side.
"The English game is pretty intense and a lot more physical but that benefits my game," he added.
"I'm a physical player, but hopefully I will get up to speed and adapt.
"It's just about getting my head down and working hard and hopefully the goals will come."
