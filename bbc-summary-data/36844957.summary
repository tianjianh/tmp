The 16-year-old from Plymouth, who can not be named for legal reasons, admitted three offences relating to cyber attacks on SeaWorld in Florida and Devon and Cornwall Police.
He had denied two charges of sending bomb hoaxes in 2015 but was found guilty in July.
He was given a two year rehabilitation order at Plymouth Youth Court.

District Judge Diana Baker said the teenager knew what he was doing in the persistent cyber attacks and she had been minded to jail him for 12 months.
However she concluded a detention sentence would "destroy him" and imposed the rehabilitation order with conditions, including 120 hours of reparation projects with the youth offending team.
"I think you got carried away, you thought you were cool and clever", she said.
Judge Baker told the court the boy had put his family through hell, adding she thought it was unhealthy for someone his age to spend so much time on his own with his laptop in his bedroom.
She said he could not have his computer back or any associated items.
