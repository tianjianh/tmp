Councillors consider Orange walk through Locharbriggs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Dumfries have been asked to approve plans for an Orange walk through a suburb of the town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Locharbriggs Loyal Orange Lodge wants to stage the procession on 27 June.
About 50 people are expected to take part in the march, from Lochthorn library car park to Locharbriggs community centre.
Police Scotland has not objected to the annual procession, as it has caused "no problems" in previous years.
Dumfries and Galloway Council's licensing panel have been recommended to approve the application.
