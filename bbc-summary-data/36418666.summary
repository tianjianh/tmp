The show, which stars Jeffrey Tambor in the lead role, was named Bafta's best international programme and has won several Golden Globes and Emmys.
Series creator Jill Soloway said "an order for season four is so, so sweet".
Soloway recently announced Caitlyn Jenner would appear in the show's upcoming third series.
Filming for that season began in April. It will be released on the company's streaming service in the autumn, with the fourth series due to follow at some point in 2017.
Transparent revolves around a Los Angeles family and their lives after their transgender father Mort Pfefferman reveals herself as Maura.
Soloway praised Amazon's "explosive freedom and revolutionary thinking" that had allowed the show to come into being.
"It's so much more than TV to us," she said. "It's our version of the most ambitious streaming art we can conjure."
The company's head of half hour TV Joe Lewis confirmed the show's stars Tambor, Judith Light, Gaby Hoffmann, Amy Landecker and Jay Duplass would all take part in the fourth instalment.
"We're grateful that customers have responded so enthusiastically to the Pfefferman family and we're excited to bring them another chapter of their story," he said.
He added that as "the quality of television rises to new heights, Transparent continues to stand out for its depth of character, compassionate storytelling and its infinite creative risk-taking".
