[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal launched by BBC Radio Derby presenter Colin Bloomfield shortly before he died has raised more than £150,000.

The 33-year-old, from Shropshire, died on 25 April from skin cancer.
The Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal, which closed on 31 December, raised a total of £152,495.
Money from the appeal, involving Radio Derby, the Derby Telegraph and cancer charity Skcin, is being used to provide UV sun meters in public places.
It will also be used to fund work with schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire.
The presenter wanted to prevent other people from being affected by the disease.
His mother Alison said the money raised in his name would now help to do that.
"There's no cure as yet for melanoma so the best way to deal with it is has got to be prevention.
"It's dreadful to lose your only son at 33 to something which is preventable."
