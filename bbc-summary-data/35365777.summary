Glasgow's Ryan Wilson cleared of 'grabbing Lee Dickson's testicles'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow flanker Ryan Wilson has been cleared of grabbing the testicles of Northampton's scrum-half Lee Dickson in a European Champions Cup match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wilson, 26, pleaded not guilty after the incident at a scrum in the 25th minute of last Sunday's game.
The judicial officer, Welshman Simon Thomas, was "not satisfied to the required standard that the act of foul play as alleged had been committed".
The citing complaint was dismissed and Wilson is therefore free to play.
He could have faced a minimum 12-week suspension if found guilty of the offence.
Thomas heard evidence from Wilson and Dickson, as well as submissions from Glasgow rugby operations manager John Manson, the Warriors' legal representative Bruce Caldow, and EPCR disciplinary officer Liam McTiernan.
Glasgow lock Tim Swinson was earlier banned for a week and will miss their final European Champions Cup pool match with Racing 92 on Saturday.
Swinson was sin-binned for a punch five minutes from time in last Sunday's defeat by Northampton, which a judicial officer decided warranted a red card.
The one-week ban means Swinson can join Scotland's preparations for the Six Nations after being named in the squad on Tuesday.
Wilson, who featured in four games at the World Cup, was omitted from Vern Cotter's squad, with the head coach saying other back-row contenders were in better form.
