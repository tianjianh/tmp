St Asaph £3m flood defence cash 'not enough', warns ex-mayor

A former mayor of a north Wales city devastated by floods has criticised funding for flood defences.

Ministers have announced £3m will be spent on continuing flood protection work in 2016-17 in St Asaph.
A further £3m will also go on improving coastal defences in north Wales.
But the final cost for defences in the Denbighshire city will be £7m and former mayor John Roberts said residents want to know where that money will come from - and when.
"In all probability it will be six years before the work is complete,"  Mr Roberts told BBC Radio Wales.
"Now six years from 2012 is far too long for this work to be completed because people do live on their nerves.
"People are on tenterhooks because we were on flood alert a few weeks ago and people were moving their possessions in preparation. People can't go on living like that."
Ongoing work in St Asaph will be carried out along the River Elwy in the city and is expected to help protect more than 400 homes that suffered flooding in 2012.
This includes improvements to St Asaph old bridge and the restoration of a small stream.
Natural Resources minister Carl Sargeant said: "Minimising the effects of flooding and keeping our communities safe are key priorities for this government."
Natural Resources Wales, which is carrying out the work in Denbighshire, said the project would be funded over two financial years.
Keith Ivens, the operations manager for flood risk, added: "We are delighted that funding for 2016-17 has been allocated and the Welsh government are aware of the need for the remaining funding to complete the scheme."
