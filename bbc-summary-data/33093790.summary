The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the figure was in line with 2014 - the busiest since the event celebrated its centenary in 2007.
The company also said it had so far carried more than 14,000 motorcycles - a 17% increase on last year.
In 2014, more 42,000 fans visited the island during the TT fortnight.
The official figure for this year's event has not yet been released by the Manx government.
A spokeswoman for the tourism department said a full economic survey had been commissioned and that the results would be released in due course.
Steam Packet Company chief executive Mark Woodward said more than 7,000 bookings have already been made for the 2016 event, including nearly 17,000 passengers and more than 8,500 motorcycles.
David Cretney MHK said the figures reflect a "global interest in the TT."
The event, which sees racers from all over the world reach speeds of 200mph on closed public roads, will conclude with the Senior race on Friday.
