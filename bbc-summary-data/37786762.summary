Janet McQueen, 58, has not been seen since 18 October when she left her home in the city's Govanhill area.
Her sister, Fiona Kilcoyne, told a news conference that she had left behind her dog, purse and mobile phone.
Police said Ms McQueen was a woman of "routine" and her disappearance was totally out of character.
Reading a statement to assembled media, Ms Kilcoyne said: "The family are now really worried about my sister Janet.
"We regularly speak to her on the phone and for her to disappear for this length of time is really concerning."
She said her sister was "sociable and reasonably well-known around Govanhill", where she had lived for the past year.
Ms Kilcoyne said her sister had "established a pattern" most days of walking to Sir John Stirling Maxwell's pub in Kilmarnock Road, Shawlands, for a cake and a coffee.
"She loves her dog and it's really concerning that she's left the dog at home, along with her mobile phone and her purse," she said.
"We are worried sick not knowing where she is at this time. If anyone has any information that can help, please contact the police immediately. All we want to know is that Janet is safe and well.
"If Janet is watching this, please get in contact with us and let us know you are safe. We love and miss you so very much."
Ms McQueen was last seen in Langside Road in Govanhill at about 22:00 on 18 October.
She is described as white, 5ft tall, of slim build with short black hair. She was wearing glasses, a navy blue anorak and dark-coloured trousers.
Ann Jennens, manager of the Sir John Stirling Maxwell Pub in Shawlands, said Ms McQueen always came into between 09:00 and 10:00 and always ordered the same thing.
"She was very quiet, she had a good group of friends she would sit with," she said.
