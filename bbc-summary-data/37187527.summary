[SN]TITLE[SN]
Any Currency: Cheltenham Festival winner disqualified over banned substance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Any Currency has been stripped of his win in the Glenfarclas Chase at March's Cheltenham Festival, but his trainer Martin Keighley has not been fined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Traces of the prohibited substance Triamcinolone Acetonide (TCA) were in the horse's urine following the race.
The cortisone substance can be used legally to treat horses, but must have cleared their system by racedays.
The original runner-up - and 15-8 pre-race favourite - Josies Orders has been retrospectively awarded victory.
