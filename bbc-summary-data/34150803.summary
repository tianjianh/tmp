[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neville Shute's York Airspeed building to be demolished

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A building which was briefly home to an aircraft company founded by author Neville Shute is to be demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors were told the building, Reynard's Garage on Piccadilly, was in a dangerous state of repair and at risk of collapse.
Built as a trolley bus depot in the 1920s, it was leased by Shute, whose investors included aviator Amy Johnson, in 1931 for his Airspeed Ltd factory.
The decision was opposed by the city's Civic Trust and the Green Party.
Airspeed Ltd moved its base to Portsmouth in 1933 and since then the building has been used as a garage and was home to a laser game but has been derelict since the mid-1990s.
Attempts to have the building listed have failed.
Historic England said its Art Deco detailing had been damaged by decay and the use of render.
It also judged there was no significant physical evidence of its links with Airspeed and the development of the aviation industry in the 1930s.
