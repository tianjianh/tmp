[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Headlam, from Harlesden, north-west London, was found with stab wounds in Drayton Road, in the early hours of 29 June 2014.
T-Shai Ennis, 18, of Langley, Slough and Idris Daud, 20, of Anton Place, Wembley, were both sentenced to a minimum of 20 years, at the Old Bailey.
Ayman Koshin, 18, of Summers Close, Wembley, must serve at least 18 years.
All three had also been convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following an attack of a 19-year-old man who was with David at the time.
Mr Headlam and his friend were attacked as they walked along the High Street in Harlesden.
Both victims ran away but two of the attackers pursued Mr Headlam into Drayton Road and assaulted him again.
Police said he was taken to hospital but died later.
The Met Police's Det Insp Sarah McConnell said the motive for the stabbing remained unclear.
"This was an unprovoked attack against two friends who were making their way home after meeting friends," she added.
"The defendants launched a violent assault, chasing David for some distance before delivering the fatal injuries."
