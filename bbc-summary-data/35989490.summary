[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police removed the sign from a bridge on the M602 ahead of the Europa League tie on 17 March after complaints it referred to the Hillsborough disaster.
A 24-year-old from Oldham and a 20-year-old from Manchester have been charged with a public order offence.
They are due before Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court on 25 April.
The banner bore the date of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster when 96 Liverpool fans died.
Greater Manchester Police were alerted to it and removed the sign immediately.
In a separate development, police have issued an appeal to trace nine men they wish to speak to in connection with a violent disturbance at the match in the East Stand at Old Trafford.
A child sustained minor injuries after being hit by a plastic seat that was thrown in the confrontation.
Det Sgt Stephen Warriner described them as "mindless thugs" who "paid absolutely no regard to the safety of those around them".
