Manchester's Anthony Crolla says he wants to create "a legacy" by defending his WBA lightweight title against Venezuelan Jorge Linares next month.

The 29-year-old will fight Linares, 31, at Manchester Arena on 24 September.
Crolla, who successfully retained his belt for the first time against Ismael Barroso in May, says he will need to produce a career-best performance.
"I'm fighting a great fighter and I'm fighting for one of the greatest prizes in the sport," said Crolla.
The British fighter first claimed the WBA lightweight title at the Manchester Arena last November, before retaining it against Barroso at the same venue.
"I see this as a bit of a legacy fight, " said Crolla. "When every young kid walks into a gym and they start boxing, they dream of becoming a world champion.
"I've done that now. I came into boxing to try and win a world title and pay my house off. That's done now, so I don't want people to think 'he's settled for that'.
"I'm honoured to be fighting for this and getting these big fights, but I'm hungrier than ever. I like it too much, I like the big Manchester nights way too much to let it go now."
As well as Crolla's WBA crown, Linares' WBC Diamond belt and the vacant Ring Magazine title will also be on the line.
"I'm so excited for this now, I'm counting down the weeks," said Crolla, who believes he and Linares are the "best lightweights" in the division.
"I'm in a good place, training is going fantastic. We're working on bringing something new, which we know we will have to for a fighter like Jorge."
Former WBA super-bantamweight title holder Scott Quigg:
"We're under no illusions, we know this is going to be a very tough fight for Anthony style-wise. But believe me, he'll pull it off. He's firing in the gym, things are starting to come together.
"You know it's a big fight when it's for the unified Ring Magazine belt, you don't get any easy fights for that. I have a prediction in my head. Anthony doesn't win on points, but Anthony will stop him."
