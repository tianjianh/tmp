The Smiler at Alton Towers was shut on Saturday after the guide wheels hit riders in the face and shoulder as it went up an incline.
A spokeswoman for the park said they had been working with designers to review and replace elements connected to part of the ride affected.
She said the Â£18m ride opened at 10:30 GMT on Thursday after safety checks.
"In line with our operational procedures, the ride was closed following the incident at the weekend and we have been working with the designers to review and replace all of the elements connected to this part of the ride," she said.
"We remain committed to ensuring that all of our rides meet the highest standards in all areas and we are sorry for any disappointment caused by The Smiler's recent unavailability."
The ride opened in May and includes a drop of 30m (98ft) and 14 loops.
Its closure follows another incident on 21 July when 48 people had to be rescued.
It closed again in August for five days due to a "technical issue".
