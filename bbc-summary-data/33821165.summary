Gangsters lose bid to overturn gun murder convictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four gangsters given life sentences for the murder of an innocent man caught up in a turf war have lost an appeal against their convictions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot with a submachine-gun at a Turkish social club in Hackney, east London in 2009.
Blaise Lunkula, Ndombasi Makusu, Yusuf Arslan and Christian Barabutu argued the judge at their trial was biased.
But three Appeal Court judges rejected the men's claims, upholding both their convictions and minimum tariffs.
Lunkula, who pulled the trigger, Arslan and Makusu were ordered to spend at least 35, 33 and 28 years in prison respectively, while Barabutu, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was detained for a minimum of 18 years.
Court of Appeal judge Lord Justice Fulford said the jury had been right to conclude the murder was a "planned revenge attack".
He said: "There was an undoubted intention to kill."
Sentencing the four in April 2014, Judge Anthony Morris QC said Mr Duzgan, who lived in Islington and worked as a sales assistant, was not the intended victim. He had unwittingly become caught up in a "bloodthirsty" series of tit-for-tat killings involving the Tottenham Turks and Hackney Turks drugs gangs.
He was hit seven times by a submachine-gun at close range after going to the entrance of the Clapton FC Club in Upper Clapton Road to investigate a disturbance.
Appealing against their convictions, the men argued Judge Morris had been biased, "using a dismissive - 'jackanory' - tone and derisory language, combined with facial expressions that denigrated the defence arguments".
But Lord Justice Fulford said there were "no indications in this case that counsel was hampered in the way that they wished to present the cases of their various lay clients because of any intervention by the judge".
