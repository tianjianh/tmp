[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Garvie, 30, who stood for Wellingborough and Rushden, bought train tickets using a bank account he knew contained insufficient funds.
He said he "did not set out to defraud East Midlands Trains".
At Corby Magistrates' Court on Friday he was also ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge and court costs of £400.
Garvie, from Corby in Northamptonshire, denied the offence but was convicted at Wellingborough Magistrates' Court on Thursday 30 April.
At the time he told magistrates he ran up a debt in his own name in 2012 because he had been "desperate to see the people he cared about" in Berkshire.
"I didn't know I'd get into trouble. I intentionally went overdrawn on my account, that account was then sent to a debt collection agency and the debt was paid off," he said.
Garvie said he would appeal against the conviction.
According to a Labour Party spokesman he resigned on the day of the elections when he lost to Conservative Peter Bone who had been MP for Wellingborough since 2005.
