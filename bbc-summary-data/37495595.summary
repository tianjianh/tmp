[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Atherton Lodge on Pooltown Road was placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) following unannounced inspections in August.
The CQC said the home had "a lack of sustained leadership" leading to "weak and ineffective" governance.
The home said "significant changes" have been made since the visit.
The CQC report found:
Satwinder Pawar, director of Atherton Lodge, said: "We are committed to the health, safety and wellbeing of the residents who trust us to care for them in their later years.
"Since being alerted of potential shortfalls in our services, we have invested heavily in the implementation of new policies and procedures throughout the home as well as the training of our staff to further improve on the quality of the care we provide.
"With the help of a specialist care consultant, we have made significant changes in the way in which we will operate to benefit the people under our care."
The home provides accommodation for up to 40 people who require personal and nursing care, including those with dementia.
It has been given six months to improve.
