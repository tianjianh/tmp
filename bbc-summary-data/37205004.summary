Nuisance calls: Which? says company bosses should be liable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Company bosses should be held personally responsible for nuisance calls, the consumer group Which? says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A law change last year made it easier to prosecute firms that ignore rules on cold-calling people - but only four of the 22 fines issued have been paid.
The group suggested some bosses were closing businesses only to open new ones as a way of escaping penalties.
The government said it was looking at how to further strengthen the information commissioner's powers.
The commissioner's office (ICO) said it had issued Â£1.5m of fines so far in 2016 up from Â£300,000 in 2014 after the change to the law made it easier to penalise firms.
The ICO now only has to demonstrate calls and messages are a "nuisance" rather than the cause of "serious damage and distress". Firms must also display their number when calling or face being fined up to Â£500,000.
But Which? said making further changes to the law so individual directors could be held to account would help bring "rogues" to justice.
"Millions of people are still being pestered by nuisance calls and it's time for tougher action that holds responsible company directors personally accountable for the unlawful actions of their companies," Alex Neill, director of campaigns and policy for Which? said.
The ICO confirmed that just four of the 22 fines levied against firms since the law changed in April 2015 had been paid in full, with two part-paid.
In the remaining cases the fines had not been paid at all or the firms had gone into liquidation, it said.
Last year one claims management company in South Wales made 40 million nuisance calls about PPI claims, and had its licence suspended.
Andy Curry, head of the ICO team investigating nuisance calls and texts, said the problem tended to be "small marketing companies that pay little heed to the rules".
"Setting up an operation that can make millions of calls is unfortunately surprisingly easy, with little outlay required on equipment, premises or staff. It can literally be a cottage industry, and as these companies are typically limited companies, directors can be quick to look to liquidation as a way out of paying fines.
"The UK does have a strong insolvency regime and the ICO is committed to pursuing money owed on behalf of taxpayers and those millions of people who have been bothered by unwanted calls.
"Unpaid fines mark a frustrating end to our investigations, but it's worth noting that when nuisance call companies go out of business, they stop making calls - and that's a successful outcome."
A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: "The government is exploring measures to strengthen the powers of the Information Commissioner, this includes, amongst other things, holding to account board-level executives who fail to comply with rules and guidance."
