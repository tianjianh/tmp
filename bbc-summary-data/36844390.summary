Davidson said he plans to "set the record straight" with 40 Years On - which will tour the UK from October.
The show will cover the entertainer's life from his breakthrough on talent show New Faces in 1976 to winning Celebrity Big Brother in 2014.
"This is an honest and raw reflection of my life, both in the spotlight and personally," Davidson said.
The comedian, who has written the show himself, has promised never-before-heard stories about the "highs, lows and controversies of a unique life spent in the public eye".
Davidson, who has been married five times, is well known for presenting TV shows including The Generation Game and Big Break.
He was awarded an OBE in 2001 for his services to charity and founded the British Forces Foundation and Care After Combat - both of which help British service veterans and their families.
But in recent years he has been criticised for controversial jokes about women, rape, homosexuality and disability.
A year before his appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, Davidson was arrested at Heathrow airport by officers working for Operation Yewtree on accusations of historic sex abuse, but he did not face charges.
