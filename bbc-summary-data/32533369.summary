Plans for a £70m tidal project off the Anglesey coast could be revived less than a year after they were shelved.

The Skerries Tidal Stream Array, which could power 10,000 homes, was suspended by developers Siemens in September.
But the scheme could now be taken forward by Atlantis Resources which has acquired Marine Current Turbines Ltd from Siemens in an all-share deal.
The Skerries project, one of six acquired by Atlantis, would be Wales' first commercial tidal energy farm.
Tim Cornelius, CEO of Atlantis, said: "It is one of the primary projects we would like to drive forward now we have it."
