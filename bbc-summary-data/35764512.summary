National League strugglers Altrincham have parted company with manager Lee Sinnott after five years in charge.

Sinnott was the second longest serving manager in the non-league top-flight, behind Woking boss Garry Hill.
The 50-year-old helped the Robins earn promotion from the Conference North in 2014, and led them to the FA Cup second round earlier this season.
But the club has failed to win in seven league games and are 21st in the table, one point adrift of safety.
Assistant manager Neil Tolson has been named caretaker manager ahead of Saturday's game at Barrow.
"It has been a privilege to work with Lee, a man of integrity and honesty," chairman Grahame Rowley said in a statement on the club website.
"I am extremely sorry to see him go, his shoes will be hard to fill. Altrincham Football Club are proud to have had him as their manager."
Former defender Sinnott made more than 600 first team appearances for Walsall, Watford, Bradford City, Crystal Palace, Huddersfield Town, Oldham Athletic and Scarborough during his playing career.
