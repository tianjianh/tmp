The London Paramount resort on the Swanscombe Peninsula, near Dartford, would be twice the size of the Olympic Park, and include 5,000 hotel rooms and a water park.
The developers said they needed to conduct more research into traffic and environmental issues before applying for a development consent order.
If given approval, it is expected to open in 2021 instead of Easter 2020.
The planned park will have more than 50 rides and attractions based on films and TV programmes on a 900-acre brownfield site.
David Testa, chief executive of London Paramount, said: "In light of our ongoing studies and detailed discussions with the Planning Inspectorate‎ and local authorities, we have decided to give ourselves a bit more time to....revise our submission date for the development consent order."
