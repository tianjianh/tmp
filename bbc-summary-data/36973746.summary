The London writer was the only new entry on the Forbes magazine list.
She earned $10m (£7.5m) in the year from June 2015 thanks to global sales of 11 million and a film deal for The Girl on the Train, according to Forbes.
That put her in ninth place. The top spot went to James Patterson for the third year running, with $95m (£71m).
Diary of a Wimpy Kid author Jeff Kinney was second, earning $19.5m (£14.7m), closely followed by Harry Potter creator JK Rowling on $19m (£14.3m).
