The 30-year-old Croatia international has made one Premier League start this season under compatriot Slaven Bilic.
He follows Chelsea's Ramires, who joined Jiangsu Suning for £25m last month, while striker Jackson Martinez joined Guangzhou Evergrande for £31m.
The Colombian left Atletico Madrid for the Chinese Super League side, breaking the Asian transfer record.
Jelavic signed for West Ham for £3m from Hull in August 2015, but has scored only once in the league despite making 12 appearances from the bench.
He previously played for Everton and Rangers.
Meanwhile, former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill is leaving Chinese football after his contract was terminated by Shanghai Shenhua.
