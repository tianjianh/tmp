Scotland's largest health board is to oppose the staging of a 10k race where runners have the chance to sample wine.

More than 200 people have already signed up for the Wineathlon event in Glasgow on 24 September.
Organiser, Team OA, hopes to announce the route in March and billed the event as putting "the fun back into running".
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it would oppose any application to stage the run as it contradicted existing "public health messages".
In a statement, the health board said: "We would contest any application for this event.
"Not only is alcohol detrimental to sports performance, but this proposed event stands against our public health messages."
Team OA said the course would be an "easy trail" with "feed stations every few miles, stocked with optional wine samples".
Runners would be invited to "run, walk or crawl" around the event, where each drink on offer would be based on a different wine region of the world.
Wane Law, managing director of organiser Team OA, said: "The idea is just to put the fun back into running. It's getting people out, crossing the finishing line.
"People have taken it on themselves, and it's turned into an event rather than a race."
A number of Wineathlon events have been planned for this year around the UK.
The first is scheduled to take place in Conwy, North Wales, at the end of August, moving to Cambridge, Worcester and Yorkshire in September.
The Glasgow event is planned for 24 September before the season finishes in Durham on 1 October.
It follows previous events held in Huddersfield and Worcester from 2014 onwards.
That race will have three stops, dotted roughly two miles apart, where the wine available to sample will cost a minimum of Â£7.50 per bottle and will be available to purchase at the end of the race.
Organisers stress the wine is available for sampling purposes only, with a single sample of wine made available for each competitor.
Due to the availability of alcohol, no-one under the age of 18 is allowed to take part in the events, which also raise money for local charities.
