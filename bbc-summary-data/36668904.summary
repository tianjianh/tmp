Former champion Murray will play Chinese Tapei's Yen-Hsun Lu, a man who beat three-time finalist Andy Roddick in 2010 to reach the quarter-finals at SW19. He also knocked out Murray at the 2008 Olympics.
The 29-year-old expects a tough match against the world number 78 - who is on an 11-match winning streak - but the Scot has won three of their four encounters.
"It's a very tough match. He's played the three grass-court Challengers in the build-up. He's won two of them and lost in the final of one," said Murray, who is scheduled second on Centre Court, with the match expected to start at about 15:00 BST.
Andrew Castle, former British number one and BBC Sport commentator, said: "Lu is a regular and genuine top-100 player. This will be a demanding match - but Andy is hitting the ball as well as I have ever seen him hit it.
"I don't see him getting into too much trouble. I still suspect we will be seeing him in the final."

British number one Konta experienced her first victory at Wimbledon on Wednesday after four previous first-round losses and is back in action on day four.
The 25-year-old is one of many players who will have to make a quick turnaround this week to clear the backlog caused by the rain delays on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The 19th seed is facing Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, a player who has failed to find form since reaching the Wimbledon final in 2014 and is now ranked 48th in the world.
The pair, who have never faced each other before, are due on Centre Court after Murray's match, possibly at about 17:00 BST.
British number two Heather Watson will hope she can finally complete her first-round match on the third day of trying.
The world number 55 let the second set slip against Annika Beck on court 12 so will contest a decider on Thursday, with Beck having broken early in the third for a 1-0 lead before rain stopped play.
The pair will resume on the same court at 11:00 BST.
Dan Evans was competitive against Ukrainian 30th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in their second-round match, taking the first set to 6-6 before rain prevented a tie-break.
The British number four and Dolgopolov are first on court two with play set to start at 11:00 BST.
It is also the start of the doubles and there will be a conflict of interest for British fans as Jamie Murray and his Brazilian partner Bruno Soares take on Briton Colin Fleming and Jonathan Erlich of Israel in the final match on court 18.
