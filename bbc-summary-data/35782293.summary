The victim, named in reports as 27-year-old Oliver Tetlow, was pronounced dead at the scene of the Harlesden gun attack.
Det Ch Insp Mark Lawson said Wednesday night's killing was being investigated as gang-related.
He said the victim was shot multiple times and that an automatic weapon appeared to have been used.

DCI Lawson said: "At this very early stage in the investigation, we are exploring that the shooting was gang related, however I am satisfied the victim was not the intended target and this was a tragic case of mistaken identity."
He added officers were aware details of the murder were "circulating" on social media and called on anyone with information to come forward.
The killer is believed to have got out of a dark hatchback car before returning to the vehicle after the shooting.
The victim's family has been informed, but formal identification will not take place until after a post-mortem examination.
