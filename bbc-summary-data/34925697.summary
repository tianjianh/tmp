Relevant income is defined by the RFL operational rules under 19 different categories, including BBC TV fees, gate receipts and other profits.
The decision was brought forward to the October meeting to help clubs plan for the forthcoming season.
"The RFL Board agreed that the Championship salary cap for 2016 will be increased," chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said.
"We have listened to and worked hard with all Championship clubs to ensure that the changes we have made are proportionate, sustainable and also give them a better chance to compete."
Full details will be released in time for the RFL's December meeting.
