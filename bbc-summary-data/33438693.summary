The men accused of the murder of two British tourists on the island of Koh Tao have gone on trial in Thailand.

Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, both 22, deny killing David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.
The bodies were found at a beach on the popular tourist island last September.
The first police officer to reach the scene has given evidence, describing how the bodies, mostly unclothed, were found a few metres apart.
Lieutenant Jakrapan Kaewkao, a prosecution witness, told the court in Koh Samui he received a phone call at about 06:30 on 15 September informing him two bodies had been found.
"I found a man's body lying on the beach with seawater lapping his body. Then I found the woman's body behind the rocks," he said.
Lieutenant Kaewkao said Miss Witheridge's body bore signs of physical assault.

The two defendants, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, shuffled into court number six at Koh Samui Provincial Court.
Legs chained together, they sat attentively. Both had their hair cut short and were clad in beige prison uniforms.
The judge quickly confirmed that they still wished to plead not guilty and proceedings got under way.
At the front of the room, a shopping trolley stuffed full of evidence sits waiting. Most of the contents are wrapped but the shape of a guitar can be clearly made out.
First to give evidence was police officer Lieutenant Jakrapan Kaewkao. He was one of the first on the scene and was quickly walked through events of the morning of 15 September, and the gruesome scene on Sairee Beach.
At that point we were forced to leave the courtroom. The families of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller had arrived, space needed to be found in the small courtroom and almost all of the journalists were evicted.
Later, more space was found and we were allowed in on the strict condition that we take no photos, turn our phones off and write nothing down.
A doctor who examined the bodies of the two Britons is expected to be called to give evidence later.
The defendants, who also deny rape and robbery, were arrested several weeks after the bodies were found.
They are said to have confessed to the crime shortly after the killings but have since retracted their statements.
The investigation was widely criticised amid allegations of police incompetence.
Police have said DNA tests link both men to Miss Witheridge's body.
The defence have called for this evidence to be independently re-tested, alleging the men have been framed. Both defendants have repeatedly stated their innocence.
The BBC's Jonah Fisher said the judge would decide on Thursday whether the defence could independently test the DNA evidence.
As he walked into the courtroom, defence lawyer Nakhon Chompuchat said he hoped the trial would be fair.
"We hope the truth will be revealed. We hope the mechanism of justice in Thailand... will have the same standards of international countries," he said.
The victims' families are in Koh Samui for the trial.
Speaking before the hearing, Mr Miller's family said they hoped justice would be done "fairly and openly", while Miss Witheridge's relatives said both families were "united in grief".
"We of course want to see those responsible for the brutal murder of our precious girl brought to justice," they said.
Verdicts in the case are not expected until October.
