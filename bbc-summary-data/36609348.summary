The 21-year-old former West Ham trainee is the fifth new player to arrive at the Wham Stadium so far this summer.
Shaw dropped into non-league football with Billericay and Dulwich Hamlet after he left the Hammers, but made 30 outings during his one year at the O's.
"It's another opportunity for me to push on in my career," he told the Accrington website.
"I just want to really push on now, do well for the club and hopefully we can get promoted."
