As an author, Prof Jardine tackled subjects including Shakespeare, Erasmus and 17th Century Holland.
She was also a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and established the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters at Queen Mary, University of London.
Historian Lord Hennessy, a colleague at Queen Mary's, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Lisa was a polymath. She was a natural swimmer in both the scientific stream and the arts and humanities stream.
"She bedazzled her generation. She had an inspirational effect."
The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, added: "She was a brilliant communicator.
"Life, I think, is very much what we make of it, and she really made the most of her life.
"Her work at the HFEA was enormously important because she brought together the science with the public engagement and the debate about the ethics. She was an inspiring leader."
Historian Simon Schama tweeted: "Lisa Jardine was one of the great historians. She understood that to write of humanity you needed to be fully part of it."
Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote: "So, so sad to hear of death of wonderful @ProfLisaJardine. A great intellect & completely down to earth. A beacon for women. RIP."
Lisa Jardine was a regular contributor to the BBC's A Point of View, and featured on this website for many years. Here is a selection of some of her most popular pieces.
