Dalbeattie community wins speed limit campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community campaign to lower the speed limit on a town's bypass has been successful despite a police objection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council has backed Dalbeattie community council's call for a 30mph limit on a stretch of the A710.
Police favoured a 40mph limit. and opposed the lower speed on the grounds that it went against national policy.
However, a meeting of the council's economy, environment and infrastructure committee went with the 30 mph limit.
Councillors voted 15 to three in favour of the 30mph proposal.
Insp Neil Hewitson said the police objection had been to try to avoid causing an "enforcement problem" on that section of the route.
"We don't have a casualty rate for crashes in that area," he said.
"So, ostensibly, there are no problems which would cause me to have patrols patrol there in the first instance.
"I feel that by introducing a 30mph (limit) there will be a desire by the community for that to be enforced."
He stressed that they would now work with the community to make the new limit work.
