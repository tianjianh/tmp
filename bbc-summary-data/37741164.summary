The disturbance followed Hibernian winning the trophy for the first time in 114 years.
Fans spilled on to the pitch after Hibs won 3-2 against Rangers at Hampden on 21 May.
Police Scotland said a total of 86 arrests have been made to date as part of an ongoing investigation.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their Cup Final medals.
A dedicated email address has been set up for anyone with information.
They can also contact Greater Glasgow CID on 0141 532 5457 or provide information anonymously via Crimestoppers.
