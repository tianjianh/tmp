Barnsley 0-0 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnsley and Cardiff City played out a goalless draw in a scrappy Championship game at Oakwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chances were at a premium for both sides although Barnsley had the better opportunities.
Paul Heckingbottom's Barnsley have now gone eight games without a win but stay 13th - a point above Cardiff.
The Bluebirds remain 14th having won only one of their last seven matches and without an away win since 14 February.
Barnsley made a strong start and put Cardiff under pressure in the opening minute when Adam Hammill's shot deflected narrowly over.
Alex Mowatt's resultant corner caused a scramble before the ball was eventually cleared.
Cardiff's on-loan goalkeeper Allan McGregor required treatment for a leg injury after colliding with Marley Watkins but managed to carry on despite his obvious discomfort.
Opposite number Adam Davies had very little to do with Cardiff limited to a Kenneth Zohore chance from 25 yards which the striker blazed over the bar.
McGregor's injury meant he did not emerge for the second half and the Scotland international was replaced by Brian Murphy.
The home side had an impressive opening to second half and Murphy made a double save to deny Saidy Janko and Matty James and also saved from Josh Scowen.
Sol Bamba, already on a yellow card, escaped further punishment for a foul on Barnsley's Tom Bradshaw, although the Cardiff defender was injured in the incident and could not continue.
Cardiff's few chances saw Davies race off his line to thwart the onrushing Zohore while Anthony Pilkington's strike went over the bar.
Cardiff manager Neil Warnock: "It would have been harsh if we had got beaten. We knew they were going to be sprightly and play one-touch football.
"It was really pleasing to keep a clean sheet. I know (Brian) Murphy made a couple of saves, but overall there were some massive pluses for me.
"That was Joe Bennett's best game for me at the club by an absolute mile. There's a player under that shirt somewhere and tonight he was unbelievable."
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: "We didn't score so we were not going to get three points. I didn't believe anyone was really going to be aggressive and stick their head on it.
"We controlled their threats and the game for long periods. There were lots of pleasing things we did out there, but it's the end product that is letting us down and we missed our chances again.
"We are changing the shape and personnel, we are doing everything we can and we are really pleased with the application, but we are not getting the rewards."
