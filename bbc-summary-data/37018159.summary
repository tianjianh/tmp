[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side started with confidence but went behind after 24 minutes when Mark Cullen struck a fine shot past Josh Vickers from the edge of the box.
The Bees responded terrifically, Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro finding Sam Slocombe and then a post between him and the goal.
Alex Nicholls went closest to a first-half equaliser hammering a 20-yard shot against the crossbar with the keeper well beaten.
Barnet boss Martin Allen threw on Luke Gambin after the break and they continued to dominate, effectively playing four across the front.
Brad Potts should have doubled the lead on the hour mark though when clean through but could only hit a post.
Nicholls drew a stunning one-handed save in the last minute of normal time from Slocombe but John Akinde delighted the home support with a volley from close range in the fourth minute of injury time to break Blackpool's epic resistance.
