[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court heard one of Eoin Duncan's teenage passengers was flung out of the window of his Honda Civic Type R in the March 2014 crash.
Duncan lost control on a bend north of Carnoustie and hit a tree, injuring two of the occupants.
The 22-year-old denied dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury at Forfar Sheriff Court.
The trial heard that the car did not have enough seatbelts for all of the passengers in the vehicle.
A jury at Forfar Sheriff Court was told that two of the occupants of the car suffered injuries including a broken arm, fractured sinus, face, head and lung contusions and a scalp wound.
The trial heard evidence from one passenger that the car reached its top speed of 145mph on a dual carriageway.
In her closing speech, depute fiscal Joanne Smith, told jurors: "When he lost control of the car he didn't just make a mistake, he wasn't just caught out - it was entirely due to the manner of his driving.
"What we get is a clear impression of not a careful, measured driver but a car being driven at dangerously excessive speed."
Sheriff Gregor Murray jailed Duncan for 30 months and banned him from the road for five years.
He told Duncan he had bought a car "with a reputation for high performance" and said he had gone out that day with the sole intention of "showing off".
The sheriff said: "The jury have found you guilty of what I regard as a very serious charge on what I regard as overwhelming evidence against you."
