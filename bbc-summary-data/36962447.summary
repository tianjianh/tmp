It is believed there are only 70 Amur leopards left in the wild and it is hoped the cubs at Twycross Zoo could help repopulate the natural habitat.
The birth five weeks ago was captured on camera and the pair have now ventured out of their den.
The youngsters - whose sex is not known - will stay at Twycross for the next 18 months before moving to another zoo.
Director of life sciences Dr Charlotte Macdonald, said: "Amur leopards are so precious - there are so few left in the world.
"Every birth in captivity is really important, so to have two born this year is fantastic news both for us and the global population."
The cubs are the second pair of babies born to parents Kristen and Davidoff at the zoo in recent years.
All four leopards' offspring could be part of a newly approved reintroduction programme in eastern Russia, the zoo said.
The critically endangered species natural habitat is temperate forests in the far east of Russia and north-east China.
