Broadcaster Stuart Hall has been charged with three counts of indecent assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 82-year-old from Wilmslow in Cheshire has been charged following complaints to police about alleged incidents involving three girls aged between nine and 16.
Lancashire Police said the offences were alleged to have been committed between 1974 and 1984.
Mr Hall has been bailed to appear before Preston magistrates in January.
In a broadcasting career spanning five decades, he is perhaps best known for his distinctive style of football reporting on BBC Radio 5 live.
Mr Hall was appointed OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.
A BBC spokesman said: "In light of the very serious nature of these charges Stuart Hall will not be working at the BBC while the police continue with their inquiries."
