[SN]TITLE[SN]
Valencia 2-2 Getafe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Neville is still waiting for a first La Liga victory as Valencia manager after their draw with Getafe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pablo Sarabia opened the scoring for the visitors with a free-kick but Paco Alcacer levelled with a fine strike.
Lafita took advantage of an Aymen Abdennour error to put struggling Getafe ahead for a second time.
But substitute Santi Mina scored their second equaliser with his first touch - with all the goals scored in the opening 35 minutes.
Neville lost his opening match as Valencia boss 2-0 to Lyon in the Champions League and drew his La Liga debut 1-1 with Eibar last weekend. But they beat third-tier Barakaldo 2-0 in the Copa del Rey in midweek.
