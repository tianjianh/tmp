At 18 years old, Lachlan Smart is the youngest person ever to fly around the world in a single engine aircraft, by himself.
The journey was 24,000 air-miles long, and he stopped in 15 different countries along the way.
54 days after setting off, Lachlan got a big welcome as he touched down back home in eastern Australia.
Leah's been taking a look at how he did it.
