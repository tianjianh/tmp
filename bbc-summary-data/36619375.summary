Jay Potter's home in a residential area of Forfar was raided by police after a tip-off that there was a "strong smell" of the drug coming from the property.
Drugs squad officers found 47 plants growing in the flat as well as a bag containing £1,500 worth of heroin.
Sheriff Pino di Emidio described the incident as a "significant offence".
Depute fiscal Alan Kempton told Forfar Sheriff Court: "Police received intelligence that drugs were being supplied from the locus, the address of accused Potter.
"There was a strong smell of cannabis within, and officers found 47 cannabis plants in total.
"The opinion of drugs unit officers was that the crop was about six to eight weeks old."
Appearing from custody, Potter, 22, a prisoner at HMP Perth, pleaded guilty to producing and supplying cannabis between 11 January and 11 March this year, and supplying heroin on the latter date.
Not guilty pleas entered on behalf of a co-accused, Potter's partner Koreen Farquharson, were accepted by the Crown.
