The Elephants have a friendly this weekend's against the Netherlands and a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at home to Guinea a week later.
Gervinho, who plays for Chinese side Hebei Fortune, missed January's Nations Cup with a knee injury.
Coach Marc Wilmots has also had to replace Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha with Fulham's Gohi Bi Cyriac.
The two-time African champions are rebuilding after an embarrassing group stage exit in Gabon early this year.
The friendly against the Netherlands is Wilmots' first game in charge of the Elephants.‬
‪In August, they resume their World Cup qualifying campaign away in Gabon. The Ivory Coast head Group C with four points from their first two matches.‬
