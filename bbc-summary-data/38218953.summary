Daniel Williams, 35, filmed the thresher shark at Fishguard Harbour on Monday.
Sea Trust Wales said thresher sharks can grow up to four metres (13ft) long and have a distinct scythe-shaped tail.
Mr Williams said: "I have been working on the quay for 11 years and have seen seals and larger fish, but nothing like this. I was so shocked."
A Sea Trust Wales spokesman said: "The shark may have been attracted to the harbour mouth by shoaling fish.
"Threshers are quite rare but we seem to have had a few sightings in Pembrokeshire waters in recent years."
