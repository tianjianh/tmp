[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morrissey has criticised politicians and the monarchy for their response to the Manchester attack.

In a post on Facebook, the singer made reference to the attack which left 22 dead and 64 injured.
He described the anger in Manchester as "monumental", adding that politicians do not condemn such atrocities strongly enough because they are "protected from the line of fire".
But his post received a mixed reaction on social media.
Commenting on his page, one fan named Stephanie said: "Utterly brilliant and correct. Someone with the courage to say it how it really is."
But Alex replied: "I idolise you and have done for years but please do not use this event to try and spread fear amongst people."
Others said his comments about politicians never being at personal risk was inaccurate, and drew attention to the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox last year.
Morrissey, who was born in Greater Manchester and fronted The Smiths in the 1980s, said he had been celebrating his birthday in Manchester as news of the bomb broke.
He asked: "For what reason will this ever stop?" and criticised the response of politicians such as Prime Minister Theresa May, London mayor Sadiq Khan and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.
All three had spoken out against the attack but Morrissey criticised Khan's failure to specifically condemn Islamic State and Burnham's description of the attacker as an "extremist" without specifying what kind.
He also said Theresa May was speaking from a position of safety - or a "bullet proof bubble", as he put it - when she said such attacks "would not break us.
"In modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private," Morrissey said.
"Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections."
Morrissey also said the Queen had received "absurd" praise for her response to the attack, despite not cancelling a garden party at Buckingham Palace "for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press".
Former Smiths bandmate Johnny Marr was among many Mancunian artists to pay tribute to the victims of Monday's attack, tweeting: "Manchester stands together."
