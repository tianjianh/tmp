People gathered near Westfield Primary School, where Katie was a pupil, a week after her death to release 200 balloons.
Andrew Waller, Liberal Democrat councillor for the area, said he was not surprised by the large turnout.
"People do pull together and people wanted to express support and sympathy for the family but in a respectful way," he said.
Organisers said Katie's parents had thanked everyone for "their kind words and ongoing support through this very difficult and sad time".
People were asked to donate Â£1 for a balloon with any money raised going to a fund established to help Katie's family.
The fund has raised nearly Â£24,000 in less than a week.
