[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham bounced back from Saturday's 4-1 defeat by MK Dons to beat Cambridge United in the League Cup first round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lethargic first half was brought to life when Jordan Bowery headed in from Joe Newell's left-wing cross.
U's keeper Chris Dunn was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Matt Derbyshire as Rotherham asserted their dominance in the second half.
Cambridge came close to a late leveller, but Kelle Roos was on hand to foil Conor Newton's effort.
The hosts dominated possession and had by far the most chances, but were made to work hard for their victory by an organised Cambridge side.
The Millers have now won six of their last seven League Cup ties at home.
