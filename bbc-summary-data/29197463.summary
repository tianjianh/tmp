Alongside his solo number ones, he has also enjoyed two chart toppers with Dizzee Rascal - Dance Wiv Me - and Rihanna's We Found Love.
Other new entries on the chart included club track Walking with Elephants by house producer Ten Walls at number six.
Harris was recently named the most successful songwriter in the UK singles chart for the second year in a row.
The Scottish singer, songwriter and producer wrote such songs as Call My Name by Cheryl Cole and Rihanna's We Found Love, which were big sellers in 2012, as well as a string of his own hits.
The list was compiled by trade magazine Music Week.
Meanwhile, Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour held on to top spot in the UK Top 40 albums chart.
