[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is getting under way to build a temporary bypass around a flood-hit Lake District road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following last month's storms, a section of the A591 was closed between Dunmail Raise, north of Grasmere, and Thirlmere.
Some bus services will be able to use the bypass as well as cyclists and pedestrians but it will not be open to cars, Cumbria County Council said.
It is expected to take three weeks to complete.
The scheme involves a temporary road being constructed up the east side of Dunmail Raise.
It will be used initially to transport schoolchildren who are currently being escorted along a temporary footpath near the closed section of road.
Keith Little, the Labour county councillor responsible for highways and transport, said an hourly bus service for members of the general public could also be trialled.
The A591 is the only major route through the central Lake District. It is hoped it will be fully reopened by the end of May following a restoration project overseen by Highways England.
