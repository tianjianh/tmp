We Were There was written in 1982 by Leicester singer Bob Wragg in support of England's World Cup finals campaign in Spain.
Mr Wragg, 82, said the song was about to be released when the Falklands conflict broke out and it was thought to be "inappropriate at a time of war".
The recording features players including Gordon Banks, Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Alan Ball singing along with former England manager Sir Alf Ramsey.
