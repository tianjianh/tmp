Comic Relief complaints won't be investigated by Ofcom

Ofcom has announced it will not investigate complaints from viewers about this year's Comic Relief.

The broadcasting regulator received 338 complaints in total about the telethon.
Of those, 117 were for "sexual material" in a sketch which saw Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer interview Susanna Reid.
But Ofcom said the comedy sketches "were inexplicit and consistent with the live, unpredictable format of this established charity programme".
The regulator told the BBC it had "carefully considered" the complaints, adding: "We recognise that some of the comedy sketches were not to everyone's taste."
The Reeves and Mortimer sketch saw the comedy duo interview Reid, with Reeves apparently brandishing a prosthetic penis from under a kilt.
Reid, who co-presents ITV's Good Morning Britain, later tweeted: "Well. That was an experience" - complete with a red-faced emoji.
She added that she "wasn't looking" when Reeves sat with his legs open while asking innuendo-laden questions about whether or not she had seen new film Kong.
There were also 49 complaints about a video showing a child dying of malaria.
Ofcom said: "We found that images of a child suffering from malaria, while potentially distressing, were suitably limited and likely to have been within most viewers' expectations of a fundraising programme."
The segment 'innuendo bingo' drew 22 complaints, while there were also 10 complaints about swearing in a sketch featuring sitcom star Mrs Brown.
