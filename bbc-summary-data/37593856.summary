Vale's Sam Foley shot wide from distance and Anthony Grant was blocked in the area.
United went ahead in the 23rd minute when John Fleck's corner was met by on-loan defender Ebanks-Landell who found the net with a firm, far-post header.
The second goal came in the final minute of the half when Ebanks-Landell hammered the ball into the net after the Vale defence failed to clear.
Duffy made it 3-0 with 62 minutes played, pouncing on the rebound to score after Billy Sharp had a shot blocked on the line.
Vale's Alex Jones was denied by a good save from Simon Moore late on before Blades substitute Stefan Scougall rounded off the scoring with a close-range header six minutes from time.
