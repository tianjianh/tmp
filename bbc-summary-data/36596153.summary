Swadlincote town crier search continues after audition no-shows

A town has struggled to find its first town crier after only two people applied for the job and then failed to turn up to auditions.

The search to find someone for the bellowing role in Swadlincote, Derbyshire first began in April.
But one applicant withdrew ahead of the second round of auditions last Friday and the second was unable to attend.
The council said it has not given up just yet and are "optimistic" of finding someone eventually.
Kate Allies, from the recruiting team at South Derbyshire District Council, said she was "surprised" so few people applied but said: "We are not giving up trying to find a town crier.
"It has to be the right candidate because this is very important for Swadlincote."
The role was introduced after residents asked for a town crier as part of a survey on what they wanted in their area.
It would be paid for with some of the Â£40,000 Heritage Lottery Funding that was given to the Swadlincote Townscape Heritage Scheme to revive the town.
Ms Allies said they were trying to rearrange a new trial with the one applicant left before re-advertising the vacancy for a third time.
"It will definitely happen," she said.
"People have asked for it and there has been a lot of interest for it, we just need the right candidate."
