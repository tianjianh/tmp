Notts County caretaker boss Alan Smith says he can see positives despite their 4-1 defeat at Morecambe.

The Magpies were beaten for the 10th League Two game in a row and remain only a point above the relegation zone.
Smith told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I learnt a lot from them in the second half. They coped from setback after setback after setback really well.
"I think the second-half performance is what they've got to put in game in, game out right from the start."
The 36-year-old took over the reigns at Meadow Lane on 3 January following the sacking of John Sheridan, but he expects the game against Morecambe to be his only one in charge.
Nottingham businessman Alan Hardy is set to take over the club this week and he said last week on Twitter he was down to two candidates for the manager's job.
"I thanked the lads for their effort and I thanked Norm (assistant manager Mark Crossley) for helping this week in difficult circumstances," continued Smith.
"We wanted to give everyone a lift. The result has not done that but when the new owner does come in and I hand the reigns over to someone else, I hope the week we have had has been positive for the lads and given them some beliefs."
