"I'm delighted with the way they came back from going a goal down.
"We've had a few sore ones recently and I thought their determination, grit and the desire to get themselves back into the game was excellent.
"If you lose a goal you always want to score as soon as possible, but we had confidence if we kept doing the right things we would've created other chances.
"I thought we got the ball down and played some good stuff at certain spells during the game and limited them to very few opportunities."
