Dog dies in St Abbs coastal cliff fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog has died after falling 120ft (36m) down the side of a cliff on the Scottish Borders coastline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eyemouth inshore and all-weather lifeboats were called out at 13:20 on Wednesday amid concerns for the animal and its owners.
They had been walking along cliffs north of St Abbs when the dog fell down the steep drop.
A search of the coastline found the dog owners safe and well but their pet had not survived its fall.
The Eyemouth lifeboat was called out for a second time two hours later.
It helped to escort a yacht which was suffering engine difficulties back to Eyemouth harbour.
