Marc Wilson says he ignored shouts of "don't shoot" moments before netting just his fifth career goal to see Bournemouth through in the EFL Cup.

Wilson, 29, struck the winner in Wednesday's 2-1 second-round win over Morecambe in his first game since joining the Cherries from Stoke City.
"I couldn't care who scores the goals to be honest as long as we get the results," Wilson told BBC Radio Solent.
Wilson has also been recalled to the Republic of Ireland squad after injury.
The goal was Wilson's first in club football since a 2-0 Premier League win for Stoke against Blackburn in December 2010, while his last professional goal was for his country in a World Cup qualifier against Faroe Islands in October 2012.
Wilson is part of Martin O'Neill's squad for a friendly against Oman, followed by their opening 2018 World Cup qualifier against Serbia.
"It's been a great day," he added. "I can't complain and I'm happy we got the result and that we're through to the next round, that's the main thing.
"Some of the boys were saying 'don't shoot' as I took a touch inside and thought, 'why not have a go?' But, I hit it and found the back of the net."
