He hit 23 maximums in his 281 from 167 balls for Auckland against Central Districts in the Plunket Shield - New Zealand's first-class competition.
The previous record of 16 was held by four players - Andrew Symonds, Graham Napier, Jesse Ryder and Mukhtar Ali.
Munro, 28, not in New Zealand's World Cup squad, will play for Worcestershire again in this year's T20 Blast.
The left-hander made 13 appearances for the county in last year's competition, scoring 332 runs at an average of 27, with a top score of 65.
He played one Test and seven one-day internationals for New Zealand in 2013, with a highest score of 85 in an ODI against Bangladesh.
Munro has also made 14 T20 international appearances, averaging 21.55 with a highest score of 73 not out, but has not featured since the ICC World Twenty20 last year.
