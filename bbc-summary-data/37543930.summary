Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has regained three Michelin stars at his restaurant The Fat Duck in Berkshire.

The venue was stripped of the accolade, the pinnacle in the food industry, last year when it was temporarily relocated to Melbourne, Australia.
The move meant the Â£255-per-person restaurant did not qualify for inclusion in the Michelin Guide.
In 2009, 240 people claimed to suffer norovirus-like symptoms after eating at The Fat Duck.
Blumenthal said he "didn't expect" the 38-seat restaurant, which he claims gets up to 30,000 phone calls a day, to regain its prestigious title.
"It's taken me by surprise, just fantastic," he said.
In 2011, an academic journal claimed The Fat Duck had the largest documented norovirus outbreak at a restaurant; the restaurant denied any wrongdoing.
The editor of the Michelin Guide, Rebecca Burr, said: "Our inspectors had many meals here during the course of the year and found the restaurant invigorated, rejuvenated and unquestionably worthy of being re-awarded our highest accolade."
The guide, now in its 116th year, announced 20 new restaurants across Britain had entered the book.
Michelin also published its London guide on Monday, which included a return for The Ritz Hotel in Mayfair.
Ms Burr added: "London's great variety of establishments, its history, but also its dynamism and vitality are illuminated by the capital's new Michelin stars.
"The Ritz restaurant and Veeraswamy, London's oldest Indian restaurant, both receive one Michelin star. These establishments have long and illustrious histories, but the cooking at both has never been better than it is today."
