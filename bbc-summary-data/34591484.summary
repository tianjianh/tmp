The deputy consul and the finance officer for the Chinese consulate in the city were killed and the consul general wounded, police said.
The consul general, Song Ronghua, who was celebrating his birthday at the restaurant, is in a stable condition after being shot through the neck.
Police have arrested a woman who works at the consulate and her husband.
Reports vary as to who fired the shot.
"We're still trying to determine the motive for the shooting," said Chief Superintendent Prudencio Banas.
The consul general's male deputy, Sun Shen, was shot in the neck and finance officer Li Hui, a woman, was shot in the head, police said.
A handgun has been recovered from the scene, police spokesman Wilben Mayor told AFP news agency.
The attack occurred at 13:30 (05:30 GMT) at Lighthouse, a popular restaurant.
Restaurant manager Stephen John Patero said the shooting occurred in a private room, which is a favourite among local politicians.
He said waiters who served the diners heard the guests shouting at each other before the shots were fired.
"They are all friends who apparently figured in an argument," he said.
Both the Chinese embassy in Manila and the Philippine foreign ministry have declined to comment on the incident.
