The France midfielder, 30, joins the Italian champions on a three-year deal for an initial 20m euros (£18.2m).
Juve say they could pay PSG a further 10.5m euros (£9.6m), depending on the number of games 30-year-old Matuidi plays.
Matuidi won four consecutive league titles with PSG after joining in 2011 from Ligue 1 rivals Saint-Etienne.
He becomes Juve's ninth signing of the summer, with Italian media suggesting he will earn 3.5m euros (£3.1m) per season.
Matuidi could make his debut on Saturday after being named in the squad for the Serie A opener against Cagliari in Turin.
Massimiliano Allegri's side are aiming this season for a seventh consecutive Scudetto. Their six straight Italian league titles is already a record.
