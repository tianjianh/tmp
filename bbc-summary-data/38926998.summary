The products were stored inside a truck trailer parked near Rilland, a village close to the Belgian border.
They included 100,000 bottles of hydrogen gas, 15,000kg of caustic soda and 3,000 litres of other chemicals.
Police did not give an estimate of the street value of the drug or say if anyone was arrested.
They said they are investigating who was behind the drugs haul.
The Netherlands is known as one of the world's major manufacturing centres for ecstasy.
