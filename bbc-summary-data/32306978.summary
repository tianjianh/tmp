Sgt Louise Lucas death: Coroner's investigation adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner's investigation into the death of an off-duty police officer who died after being hit by a bus has been opened and adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, died after she was struck on The Kingsway in Swansea on 31 March.
She is the second person to have died on the same stretch of road.
Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips said the cause of death is still unknown and the inquest was adjourned for four months.
Mr Phillips previously said the road has a "serious design issue" which must be addressed.
On Tuesday, Swansea council announced changes to bus routes on the road.
Sgt Lucas's husband Gavin was at the brief hearing and was told he can make arrangements for her funeral.
