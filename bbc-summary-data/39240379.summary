Chester 0-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Wilson's last-gasp strike earned Eastleigh a win at Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spitfires, who were level on points with their hosts at kick-off, went close through Matt Tubbs after four minutes but Chester's Alex Lynch got down well at his near post to save.
The visitors continued to ask more questions, but Chester forced a great save out of Graham Stack with Lucas Dawson's deceptively dipping free-kick just after the break.
Tom Shaw went close for the hosts with an audacious volley two minutes from time, but Wilson made it back-to-back wins for Eastleigh by firing home Ben Close's corner in stoppage time.
