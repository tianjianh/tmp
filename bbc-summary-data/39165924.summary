The 40-year-old is being held after Lea Adri-Soejoko was found in a lock-up store on Sheaveshill Avenue, Colindale.
Ms Adri-Soejoko, the secretary of the Colindale Allotment Association, was reported missing at 01:40 GMT on Tuesday and found 20 minutes later.
The suspect, arrested on Friday, remains in custody.
Police have not released the cause of death but said Ms Adri-Soejoko lost her life "in the most tragic way possible".
Ms Adri-Soejoko was described as "vibrant and happy, fit and healthy" despite her age, by her family.
In a statement her family said "she was a person who stood for the words community, unity, tolerance and love for your neighbour".
"A matriarch, a woman who championed the underdog and did not tolerate prejudice of any kind."
Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh said: "At this stage we are keeping an open mind about any possible motive and would ask any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.
"An elderly woman lost her life in the most tragic way possible and was left inside a storage unit similar to a garage."
