The actress, who cemented her film career last year with the lead role in The Maze Runner franchise, will feature alongside Johnny Depp.
It's not yet known what part she will play. Javier Bardem was recently confirmed as the leading villain.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales will be released in July 2017.
Filming is expected to begin shortly in Australia.
Norwegian duo Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, who were behind the Oscar-nominated film Kon Tiki, will direct the movie.
Scodelario thanked her fans for their wishes on Twitter: "You guys are the balls (that's a good thing) seriously, thank you for all your kind words. Ever. You make me smile even when I have the flu."
The actress has enjoyed a varied career since her breakthrough role in Skins, including her performance as Cathy in Andrea Arnold's award-winning adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights in 2011.
She also appeared in the award-winning TV mini-series Southcliffe in 2013 opposite Sean Harris and Rory Kinnear.
Scodelario got engaged to actor Benjamin Walker in December. He was previously married to Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer.
