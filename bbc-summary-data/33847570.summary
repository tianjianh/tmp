John Mark Macro, of Church Road, Colby, spent two weeks chatting online to his victim before meeting at her home, Norfolk Police said.
The police investigation found he had also sexually assaulted another woman he had met online, at her home in January.
Macro, 52, was found guilty of rape and sexual assault at Norwich Crown Court.
Police found two mobile phones when he was arrested in January - one of which officers were able to link back to the two women.
Det Insp Richard Ellis said Macro, who had fabricated his online profile, "was clearly using the dating website to seek out women with whom he could fulfil his own sexual gratifications".
"Both victims have been left extremely traumatised by the attacks which happened in their own homes, which are meant to be a place of safety," he said.
He commended both for the "bravery" shown in giving evidence in court.
