[SN]TITLE[SN]
Penalty points whistle-blower at Public Accounts Committee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Irish policeman who claims some colleagues routinely cancelled motorists' penalty points is to give evidence to politicians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Public Accounts Committee hearing is to go ahead in private, despite calls to cancel it by the head of the police and the minister for justice.
They argued the government spending watchdog was not the appropriate forum.
Sergeant Maurice McCabe claims there is corruption, with penalty points often being quashed for friends and family.
Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan had sought legal advice about the prospect of Sgt McCabe and another police whistle-blower appearing before the committee.
However, he withdrew the challenge after the committee agreed to hear evidence in private.
Sgt McCabe will not be allowed to name specific officers in his evidence, and there are restrictions on what he can say or be asked by committee members.
On Monday, the allegations were referred by Minister for Justice Alan Shatter to the Garda Ombudsman. He said he did not believe the committee could adequately address the controversy.
