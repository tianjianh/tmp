Haydn Burton death: Inquest into suicide inmate begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of a man who hanged himself in prison said she believes he did not intend to kill himself.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Haydn Burton, 42, was detained in Winchester Prison in May 2015 over allegations of assault, but on 15 July was found unconscious in his cell.
Mr Burton, who was on suicide watch, was found in-between visits from family and friends and died in hospital.
A jury-led inquest began on Monday to see whether his death could have been prevented.
Mr Burton's mother Maureen Carter told Winchester Coroner's Court her son had told family that he felt threatened in the wing of the prison that he was being held in, and that someone had threatened to beat him up over a debt.
Ms Carter said: "He would have been aware of how the prison was run including when he was due to be checked on.
"But he wasn't found in time.
"It did not go as he had planned."
The jury heard Mr Burton was known to have mental health issues and had been on suicide watch before.
He was well known in Winchester as a New Fathers 4 Justice campaigner and could often be seen wearing a Superman costume with a placard and a hailer.
The jury heard the campaigner had been sectioned several times.
Mr Burton was supposed to be checked by members of staff at Winchester Prison every hour, the court heard.
The inquest continues.
