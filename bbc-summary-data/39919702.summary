When the driver crashed on Saturday evening in Aghalee, his Ford Fiesta alerted police to the accident.
"Some cars these days are pretty clever," said a PSNI Craigavon Facebook post.
"Did you know that some can even phone police automatically to let us know you've crashed?! That's a really good safely feature."
The post added that it was a "really bad feature to have if you're a drunk driver".
"That's right, you're picking this up correctly - a CAR phoned us to let us know about a crash last night when it turned out the driver was drunk," said the police message.
"You think you're having a rough weekend? At least your car hasn't touted on you!"
The driver was one of a number who were arrested in the area for drink-driving during the weekend, police said.
Anyone who suspects someone is drink-driving should contact police, they added.
