BBC Two sitcom Boy Meets Girl and EastEnders have both been shortlisted for their portrayal of transgender issues.
Transgender actress Rebecca Root and the first ever transgender actor in a TV soap opera, Riley Carter Millington, have also been nominated.
Nick Grimshaw, Boy George and Sue Perkins are among the other nominees.
Sarah Garrett, founder of the awards, explained: "The British LGBT Awards are vital in highlighting those who have done good by the LGBT community and are also important in promoting LGBT acceptance."
"The commissioning of Boy Meets Girl was a particularly landmark moment in British television history as was the introduction of a transgender character to Eastenders.
"The BBC should be proud of its commitment to diversity and groundbreaking coverage of LGBT issues," she said.
Speaking in August last year, actress Rebecca Root, who plays Judy in Boy Meets Girl said: "I really believe that it will demystify my community, it will increase the visibility of the trans population.
"In a way it's a shame, it's 2015 for goodness sake, and we're only having this conversation now. But better late than never."
The British LGBT Awards take place at London's Grand Connaught Rooms on 13 May.
