Actor Tina Hobley is "in shock" that The Jump is returning, less than a year after she was injured while taking part in the Channel 4 show.

The former Holby City star has only just stopped using crutches following the accident in which she injured her knee, shoulder and arm.
The show features celebrities competing at winter sports, including ski-jumping, bobsleigh and speed skating.
"The Jump is behind me and I will never do that show again," Hobley said.
"I'm still in shock that it's going again, but of course they will have learnt from all their mishaps and hopefully there won't be any more accidents."
The broadcaster said earlier this year that there had been a "thorough review of safety procedures".
The channel apologised to Hobley after the incident in February, blaming "human error" for the accident.
It happened when she was practising a jump but was distracted by crew members who hadn't left the landing area.
"Tina's fall was caused by simple human error when members of the ground crew failed to clear the outrun," they said.
"All those involved have been spoken to and extra procedures have now been put in place by the producers to ensure that this will not happen again."
Hobley was not the only participant to injure herself last year on the show.
Former Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle needed surgery on her spine after a crash, while Made in Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli fractured his ankle.
Swimmer Rebecca Adlington dislocated her shoulder, athlete Linford Christie pulled a hamstring, ex-EastEnders actor Joe Swash chipped a bone in his shoulder, Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding injured a ligament and model Heather Mills hurt her knee and thumb.
The next series of The Jump, hosted by Davina McCall, is set to start early next year.
Celebrities lined up include Olympic gymnast and Strictly Come Dancing winner Louis Smith, rugby player Jason Robinson and comedian and TV host Mark Dolan.
