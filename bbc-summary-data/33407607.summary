Around 300 people walked from the primary school to the harbour on Saturday afternoon.
An online petition against the proposed closure of the site has gathered more than 4,000 supporters to date.
The RNLI, which wants to provide lifeboat cover from nearby Eyemouth, has said it is about having the "right assets in the right place".
