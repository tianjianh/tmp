[SN]TITLE[SN]
Serious assault trial adjourned over witness issues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four men due to stand trial over a serious assault on three men outside a pub in Bishopbriggs have had their trial delayed until July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Monaghan, 35, Edward Lyons, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 38, and Liam Boyle, 36, appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
They were due to go on trial but a motion to adjourn was granted due to witnesses being unavailable.
It is alleged the men attacked Robert Lyle, Alexander Lyle and William Logue in Woodhill Road on 5 April 2016.
Each charge claims the men did "strike him on the head with a sharp implement" to their severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Prosecutors claim Robert Lyle was knocked unconscious during the alleged assault.
Mr Monaghan from Penilee, Mr Lyons from Cumbernauld, Mr Gallacher from Battlefield and Mr Boyle from Bellshill all deny the charges.
Procurator fiscal depute Mark Allan said witnesses were "out of the country and unavailable for the trial sitting".
