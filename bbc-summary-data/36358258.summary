Wolves were top of the table going into Magic Weekend in Newcastle, but lost 34-14 to Castleford to lose top spot.
In their previous outing, Smith's side were beaten 36-28 by a late try at Wakefield.
"We gave away a couple of cheap penalties and didn't react particularly well to those penalties," said Smith.
He told BBC Radio Merseyside: "I didn't think we showed the steeliness in our defence that we have in other games after a couple of things went wrong.
"We've got to go away and work hard on some of those aspects of the game, and we will. It's hard to take at the moment but we'll learn some tough lessons."
