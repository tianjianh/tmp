Somerset A358 dual carriageway plans 'lack detail'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to turn a busy Somerset road into a dual carriageway have been criticised by a local council for lacking detail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A358 upgrade between Taunton and Southfields was part of the Conservative's Â£15bn roads project.
Taunton Deane Borough Council said it was unable to give a full response to the plans as they lacked detail and only one option had been submitted.
Highways England said the consultation offered "the chance to see our initial proposal at an early stage".
A Highways England spokesman added: "Publication of more detailed plans and consultation is due to follow in 2018, where everyone will have another chance to comment and provide feedback."
Parish councillors in the A358 area have also told the BBC they are unhappy with the initial proposals.
They have cited concerns about noise, pollution, how the new junction would work with the M5 and the location of the new section of road linking the A358 to the M5.
Stoke St Mary Parish Council has also lodged a formal complaint with Highways England.
Councillors at Taunton Deane are due to meet to discuss the proposals and what steps can be taken later.
