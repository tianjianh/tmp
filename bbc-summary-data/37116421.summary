An Australian family facing deportation from the UK say they hope to know next week if a job offer will allow them to continue living in Scotland.

Gregg and Kathryn Brain and their son, who live in Dingwall, had until earlier this month to stay in the UK.
Immigration minister Robert Goodwill has urged them to leave the country.
Mrs Brain, who moved with her family to Scotland on her student's visa in 2011, has been offered a job that could meet the requirements of a new visa.
She told BBC Radio Scotland the post met all the relevant criteria and said she was "hopeful and confident" it would allow her and her family to stay in Scotland.
Mrs Brain said paperwork for the job was in the process of being finalised, but added that she would not know until next week at the earliest if she had secured the employment.
After moving to Scotland on Mrs Brain's student visa, the family expected to be able to later move on to a Tier 1 post-study work visa, but the scheme was scrapped in 2012.
