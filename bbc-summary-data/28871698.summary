Actor Jaycee Chan, 31, was detained on Thursday by Beijing police, who said more than 100 grams of marijuana were found at his home.
It came amid a crackdown on drugs which has already netted several celebrities.
Jackie Chan was named an official "Narcotics Control Ambassador" by Chinese police in 2009.
"With regards to the incident involving my son Jaycee, I am very angry and shocked," Jackie Chan said on his official account on Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo.
"As a public figure, I am ashamed. As a father, I am very sad and his mother is heartbroken.
"I told Jaycee: if you have done something wrong, you must bear the consequences. As your father, I am willing to face the road ahead with you."
The Hong Kong film star added that he "hoped young people would learn from Jaycee's lesson and avoid drugs", and apologised on Jaycee Chan's behalf.
Jaycee Chan and Taiwanese movie star Kai Ko, 23, were both detained on Thursday, with police saying they tested positive for marijuana.
Mr Chan was put under "criminal detention" for the suspected crime of "providing a shelter for others to abuse drugs", Beijing police said.
If convicted, he faces a maximum prison term of three years.
Mr Chan's management firm M'Stones International apologised on his behalf for the "social impact" caused and said they would "supervise his rehabilitation and help him return to the right path".
Last week, 42 artist management agencies in Beijing signed an agreement with police pledging not to recruit celebrities with reported drug use problems.
In June, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for "forceful measures" to tackle illegal drug use.
