The location for a new Portishead railway station has been chosen after a public consultation.

North Somerset Council is expected to confirm the location as the corner of Quays Avenue and Harbour Road.
Proposals to re-open the line are part of a Â£100m investment in the area's rail infrastructure.
It was originally closed in 1964 and the revamp is part of the MetroWest Phase 1 project, being overseen by the West of England Partnership.
Leader of North Somerset Council, Nigel Ashton, said the decision on the location of Portishead station would be "a major step forward" for the project.
He said of all the potential locations under consideration, the corner of Quays Avenue and Harbour Road was "the most popular option" from the public consultation carried out last year.
The proposals for the planned station do not include the addition of a level crossing, which was considered to be a risk to pedestrians, and would potentially cause traffic disruption.
The MetroWest Phase 1 project aims to reopen the Portishead line to passenger train services by spring 2019.
The line will restore the rail link between the town and Bristol city centre.
