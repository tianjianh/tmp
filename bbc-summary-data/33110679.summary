Father-of-two Sheku Bayoh, 31, was held following an incident in Hayfield Road, Kirkcaldy, on 3 May.
He died of suspected asphyxia after being detained by officers responding to reports he had brandished a knife and attacked cars in the area.
Relatives of Mr Bayoh claim police told them five versions of what happened.

The PIRC has also released CCTV video clips which can be viewed from its website.
