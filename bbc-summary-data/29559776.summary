Police said Kieran McGrath, 26, drove to Ashton-under-Lyne police station in Manchester Road after being shot in a "targeted attack" on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man, arrested on suspicion of murder, is in custody.
The stolen motorbike was found burned out in Boggart Hole Clough, Blackley.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: "From our inquiries, we know the motorbike was stolen from the Stockport area in June 2013 and believe it was used in the shooting.
"After studying CCTV, we have found images of two people riding the bike near to Charlestown Road, Manchester.
"I would ask anyone who may have information on the 600cc Suzuki Bandit from it being stolen last year, being seen on Saturday night at the Sheldon Arms and its discovery, to contact us."
Police believe Mr McGrath was shot after leaving the Sheldon Arms pub at about 22:25 BST.
A post-mortem examination showed he died from a single gunshot wound to the chest.
A 23-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail.
