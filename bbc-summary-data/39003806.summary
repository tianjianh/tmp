A couple who murdered a man in a "brutal, savage and sustained" 15-minute ordeal have been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Webster, 49, and Alison Moss, 46, inflicted 117 separate injuries on Craig Wild at Moss's home in Sheffield.
The 47-year-old was attacked with a Stanley knife, razor and screwdriver.
Webster, who admitted murder, and Moss, who was found guilty by a jury, were told they must serve a minimum of 24 and 29 years behind bars respectively.

Sheffield Crown Court heard Mr Wild was murdered last August when he went to speak with Moss and Webster after they threatened to kill a neighbour who they wrongly believed had complained about noise coming from their home.
The jury was told there was evidence to suggest Mr Wild and Moss were once in a sexual relationship, but Moss was violent towards him.
After Mr Wild had gone to confront Moss and Webster, prosecutor Andrew Robertson QC said, the neighbour heard banging and shouting coming from Moss's flat.
"He heard Mr Wild begging to be allowed to go as Moss shouted 'Go on, go on' seemingly egging Webster on," said the barrister.
Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Holgate, said the attack lasted over 15 minutes with blood "sprayed on to walls and furnishings".
"Mr Wild suffered a brutal, savage and sustained attack which resulted in his death from multiple injuries," he said.
When police arrived and gained access to the flat they found Mr Wild's body beneath a blood-stained duvet on the living room floor.
He said that as Webster, of Leppings Lane, Hillsborough, was led away by officers he said: "Of course he's dead. I made sure of that."
Mr Robertson said that in the "ferocity" of the attack Mr Wild was slashed and stabbed repeatedly and had a 'H' shaped wound cut into his body and score marks on his back.
He said traces of salt were also discovered on Mr Wild's body and in at least one of his wounds, though a pathologist who examined the body could not be sure if the salt had been applied before or after he died.
He told the court the "gratuitous" injuries were "not necessary to inflict serious harm or to kill" but inflicted "from a desire to inflict greater pain".
In a victim impact statement Mr Wild's sister-in-law Catherine said the family had been "totally devastated".
She said: "There is now a gap that can never be filled.
"The raw, painful grief we still feel every day is unimaginable."
Moss, of Fox Walk, Walkley, also pleaded guilty to a separate offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for slashing a 17-year-old boy with a cut-throat razor in January 2016.
For this, sentencing judge Mr Justice Holgate ordered her to serve a 10-year concurrent sentence.
