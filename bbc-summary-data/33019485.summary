Retailer Marks & Spencer was the biggest faller, down 3.2%.
On Thursday, the firm announced that it had paid bonuses to its senior managers for meeting profit targets, but that its international business performance had been "disappointing".
The biggest riser was Royal Bank of Scotland, up 1.48%, after speculation that the government might sell part of its 80% stake in the bank as early as September, to avoid a clash with the full privatisation of Lloyds Banking Group next March, banking and political sources said.
Bailing out the debt-laden RBS cost British taxpayers £45bn ($69bn).
On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.64% against the dollar to $1.5266, but rose 0.53% against the euro to €1.3742.
