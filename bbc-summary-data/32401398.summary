Ironbridge exhibition revisits 'Victorian HS2'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition has opened showing how the 19th Century equivalent of HS2 rail project split public opinion.

The drawings by John Cooke Bourne have gone on display at the Ironbridge Gorge Museums, in Shropshire.
They were originally used to counter critics of the building of the first London to Birmingham line in the 1830s.
Dr Matt Thompson from the museum said the opposition had "direct parallels" with the campaign against the planned HS2 high speed rail line.
"There's a great deal of anxiety about the lasting impact that this might have on the landscape and also whether the benefits are worth the cost,"  he said.
Dr Thompson said the museum also had satirical cartoons from the period, which were not part of the exhibition, attacking the idea of steam travel.
Unlike HS2, however, the first London to Birmingham line was funded through a share issue.
Its modern equivalent has similarly split opinion. The Public Accounts Committee questioned its value for money in January, while many residents along its route have protested against the plans.
The Department for Transport has previously said the project would have a "transformational effect" on the country and help "rebalance the economy".
