Organisers said the Oscar-winner would be honoured for her 40-year career as an actress, director and film producer.
"Her ambition, exuberance and grace have helped pave the way for budding artists in this business," said the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
She will be presented with the award at a ceremony on 13 January.
"Jodie is a multifaceted woman that has achieved immeasurable amounts of success and will continue to do so in her career," HFPA president Aida Takla-O'Reilly said in a statement.
"She's truly one of a kind."
Foster, 49, began her career in television commercials at the age of three and by the age of 10, had appeared in a string of TV shows.
She found international fame in 1976 for her Oscar-nominated performance as teenage prostitute Iris in Taxi Driver, and roles as Tallulah in Bugsy Malone and the lead in Freaky Friday.
She has since appeared in more than 40 movies, winning best actress Oscars for her role as a rape victim in 1988 film The Accused and as the FBI agent Clarice Starling in 1991's The Silence of The Lambs.
The actress also branched out into directing, with projects including Little Man Tate in 1991 and last year's The Beaver, starring Mel Gibson.
She also produces for both film and television through her production company, Egg Pictures.
Previous winners of the Cecil B DeMille Award - named for the famed director of The Ten Commandments and The Greatest Show on Earth - include Robert DeNiro, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman, who was awarded the honour earlier this year.
