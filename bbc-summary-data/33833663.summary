The woman was walking her dog in Stoke Orchard near Cheltenham when a man appeared shouting "get off my land" and hit her in the mouth.
She "immediately grabbed the man by his testicles" and he fell to the ground, Gloucestershire Police said.
A spokesman added: "This was an unusual method of self-defence and the attacker got more than he bargained for."
The attack, at about 11:30 BST on Monday, left the woman with bruising and a small cut, police said.
The man is described as white, about 5ft 8in tall, between 25 and 35, with tanned skin and a "young voice".
The police spokesman added: "It would have been a terrible experience for a person of any age and we would urge anyone who can help to come forward."
