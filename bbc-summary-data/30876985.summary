Motorists in Leicester have been told to expect 12 weeks of delays as work starts on a new cycle lane in the city centre.

It will be installed around the St Nicholas Circle roundabout.
City mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said the disruption to roads was not ideal but the work was about reconnecting the city.
Eric Ludlow, from Leicester Cycling Campaign Group, said navigating the roundabout was a "high risk endeavour".
"Not many people [cycle round] it," he said.
"Most people, although it's illegal, take the much safer way out and go along the pavement.
"I go around it but I'm a confident cyclist and it isn't a pleasant experience by any means."
The work is part of the council's Connecting Leicester scheme.
One lane on the roundabout will be closed from Monday during off-peak hours as the layout is changed on the south side of the Circle.
Work will also include widening footpaths and removing a rundown footbridge.
Mr Soulsby said: "It isn't just about a cycle lane, it is about reconnecting Leicester and the landmarks of the city.
"You have to look at the bigger picture, and that is this city needs to move into the 21st century."
