Queen of the South fans' boardroom goal still in sight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council has agreed in principle to back a bid by Queen of the South fans for a place on the Scottish Championship club's board.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It came too late for the Palmerston Park side's annual general meeting this year which was held earlier this week.
However, the council has given its backing in principle to adding the issue to the agenda at a future AGM.
It said its support was subject to a meeting being held with members of the board and the Queens Trust.
The trust has just over 900 shares in the Dumfries club with 7,500 needed to allow it to add an item to the AGM agenda.
It needs the support of the council - which holds more than 6,600 shares - to help secure its goal of discussing a director's role.
Failing that, the fans group has said it would hope to get a "non-voting representative" onto the board.
The club said that should the trust get sufficient support to add the item to the AGM agenda then fan representation was something which could be discussed.
It added that its door was "always open" for an "open and honest dialogue" with supporters.
