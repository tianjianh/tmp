Powys council has put traffic lights on a 50m (164ft) section of the A4077 between Crickhowell and Gilwern, restricting the use of the eastbound lane.
It comes after inspectors found slope instability within the bank below the road.
Investigations into the cause of the instability are expected to last into the early autumn.
Cabinet member for highways John Brunt said the lights were needed for road safety.
"Remedial drainage work will be carried out to reduce the stress on this section of the road while we wait for the results of our joint investigation," he said.
