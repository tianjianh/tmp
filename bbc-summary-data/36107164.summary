The 39-year-old was appointed in January when the Wings were 22nd in the table but they were relegated on Saturday after the 4-0 loss to Chester.
His assistants Barry Ashby and Jamie Turner have also left the club.
Former Bromley boss Goldberg was dismissed from his third spell at the Ravens in February.
A statement on the Welling website said Goldberg coming into the club was with a view to taking on ownership of the club in the near future.
