Brexit: UK and Irish governments work on keeping open border

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK is talking to the Irish government to determine the technical mechanism to maintain an open border and underpin the Good Friday Agreement, the Brexit secretary has said.

David Davis said the government would maintain the Common Travel Area and all the benefits it had in Northern Ireland before the UK entered the EU.
He was answering a question from Sammy Wilson, DUP, in the House of Commons.
He said the government would resolve any problems posed by the border.
Meanwhile, a think tank has said introducing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as a result of Brexit would have a devastating effect on border communities.
The Centre for Cross Border Studies is hosting a discussion in Brussels to discuss the Brexit vote.
Anthony Soares, the centre's deputy director, said border controls would set communities back decades.
The UK electorate voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in June's referendum.
In Northern Ireland, the majority (56%) of those who went to the polls voted to stay in the EU.
Mr Soares added: "The introduction of a hard border would really, really undermine the economic development of the border region.
"Some parts of our border region are already struggling in terms of perhaps being overlooked by central governments, whether it's in Belfast, London or Dublin, that have other priorities.
"The border region would suffer even more if the hard border was to be reintroduced."
Protests against Brexit took place in a number of areas along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic on Saturday.
The demonstrations were organised by campaign group Border Communities against Brexit.
