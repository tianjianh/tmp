Prestatyn 'uninhabitable' home mum receives suspended sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Denbighshire mother-of-three whose children lived among discarded drug syringes has been given a suspended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the "virtually uninhabitable" Prestatyn home stank of rotten food, faeces and cigarettes.
The mother, 39, who cannot be named, admitted three counts of neglect at Llandudno Magistrates' Court in July.
On Tuesday, she was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.
Magistrates issued a warrant for the children's father, who faces identical charges, after hearing he was seriously ill in hospital.
Prosecutor James Neary said police were first alerted by one of the father's relatives, who arranged for the woman to be taken to hospital by ambulance after finding her ill in bed.
Magistrates were shown footage taken from police body cameras as officers moved from room to room in almost total darkness, as there were no lights.
There was broken glass and drug-related items on the floor, dried blood on the ceiling and the bedclothes on a cot were soiled.
Police had to tread on bags of rubbish as they moved through the home.
"The children would have had to navigate their way through all of that in the dark," said Mr Neary.
The court heard the mother spent weeks in hospital recovering from septicaemia and, when interviewed, she said she had been ill for a fortnight and was unable to get out of bed when her condition deteriorated.
When shown photographs of the living conditions, she became upset and accepted she should have gone to hospital sooner and ensured the children were cared for.
Chris Dawson, defending, said: "She was not well enough to look after herself, let alone the children."
He said she had been prosecuted on the basis of what might have happened, as the children had not been adversely affected.
Since her discharge from hospital she had been free of drugs, he said.
Chairman of the magistrates' bench, Paul Kinsey, said the children had been put at a "high risk".
The mother was also ordered to undergo drug testing and to pay costs of Â£120 along with an Â£80 surcharge.
