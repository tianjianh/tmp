[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute James Henry's injury time winner earned Bolton a dramatic victory over former leaders Scunthorpe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry, a replacement for Zach Clough 10 minutes earlier, struck from 18 yards in the third of six minutes of added time with a shot that looked to deflect off Iron defender Murray Wallace.
Bolton's win took them into the automatic promotion places while Scunthorpe, top at the start of the day, slipped to third after Sheffield United's 1-0 win over Northampton earlier in the afternoon.
Until Henry's intervention Neal Bishop's fourth goal of the season appeared to have earned Graham Alexander's side a deserved draw.
Bolton, watched by the Macron Stadium's second biggest attendance of the season - 17,062 - led 1-0 at half-time.
Josh Vela's half volley from the edge of the area after 17 minutes was his eighth goal of the campaign.
Scunthorpe had a goal disallowed for offside but Clough wasted a good opportunity to double Wanderers' advantage and felt he should have had a penalty after Jordan Clarke's challenge.
Scunthorpe were much the better side after the break and they deservedly drew level when Bolton failed to clear a 62nd-minute corner and Bishop swivelled on the loose ball to rifle home from 10 yards. But their endeavours drew a blank courtesy of Henry's hammer blow.
