Tributes have been pouring in for the DJ. Here is a selection.
Gareth Williams sent in this photo via WhatsApp: "So sad to hear about Ed Stewart's death. Here I am on stage during a Radio 1 roadshow in Caswell Bay, the Gower in August 1976. I was taking part in a yes/no game which I was lucky enough to win! Ed gave me my radio debut that day. Thanks Ed!"
Ed was involved in several charities, including PHAB. Simon Haskew was at an awards ceremony at the House of Lords in May 2012 and took this photo of his friend Maxim Lowe.
Alfie Bedborough in Jersey has fond memories: "Always a main stay on Christmas Day with Junior Choice. Such a loss. 'Ello darling!"
Clint Ritchie Stark in Edinburgh says he was fantastic with children on his Saturday morning show: "I remember him at the children's ward at the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital. The kids just loved him. He was so kind to them."
"I will never forget his kindness," says Sharon Ward in Sheffield. "In 1982 he was going out to the Falklands to record his Christmas radio show.  My husband was based out there. I was based at RAF Brize Norton.  We had only been married 10 months. Ed very kindly took an anniversary card, Christmas card and a cake to him."
Ed's sister, Sue Mainwaring, who lives in Swanage, told us the news hadn't quite sunk in: "He was such a good brother. I have loved him for nearly 70 years. He has been there for me all my life. I went to some of his shows but I didn't get a Crackerjack pen! We had a lot of fun. I will miss him."
Dominic Dalton says he met Ed several times back in the 1980s when he worked for Radio Mercury but his son Tyler met him for the first time in August 2014 at Cranleigh Car Show. "He was still the loveable 'Stewpot' that I remembered from those meetings in the 80s and still happy to be stopped to have a picture taken. RIP Ed you have left me with some fond memories."
Barry Lester in Spain: "I had the pleasure of meeting him about 15 years ago in southern Spain while he was working with Spectrum FM. He was a gentle man with a big heart. He will be sadly missed by the people who loved his style and manners."
