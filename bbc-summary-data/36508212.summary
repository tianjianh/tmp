Jack Walker crossed from a driving maul as England built a 13-0 interval lead in the final game of the day at the Manchester City Academy Stadium.
Will Evans, Johnny Williams, Jack Singleton and Max Mullins added tries to secure a second bonus-point success.
Earlier in the day, Ireland beat New Zealand 33-24.
England play their final match of the group stages at the AJ Bell Stadium against Australia on Wednesday, while Scotland face Italy on the same day.
Ireland's win was their first over New Zealand at any level in the men's game, as they kept up their 100% record so far.
On the day when the senior team won in South Africa for the first time, the men in green produced a fine display in driving Manchester rain with tries from Greg Jones and Adam McBurney putting them 20-14 ahead at half-time.
Number eight Max Deegan scored their only try after the break and fly-half Johnny McPhillips kicked two penalties to inflict a first loss for the Kiwis in this competition since June 2014.
In the same pool, Six Nations Grand Slam winners Wales struggled to break down a stubborn Georgia side but won 10-9. The only try of the game was scored by Wales prop Leon Brown after four minutes.
The win leaves the Welsh third in the table, on the same points as the Kiwis.
Wales face New Zealand on Wednesday in their final group match, with Ireland taking on the Georgians.
