[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Survival rates for patients treated in critical care units in Wales are increasing, according to the latest annual report on the service.

In 2014-15, 83% of critical care patients were discharged to another ward, up from 79% in 2011-12, while the numbers treated rose by 8% to 9,700.
But health boards have been told to cut delays in transfers and discharges, equivalent to the loss of 16 beds.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said continuous improvement was needed.
He said the report "highlights some of the excellent work taking place in critical care units and hospitals across Wales".
The minister added: "The report also identifies areas where more rapid improvement is needed and health boards must make sure they have robust plans in place to drive out inefficiencies in the system, such as delayed transfers of care."
