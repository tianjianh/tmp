It is believed the 58-year-old may have fallen around two hours before police were called to Church Street, Tetbury, on Saturday evening.
Firefighters helped to recover her body from the property, Gloucestershire Police said.
The woman's death was not being treated as suspicious and the woman's next of kin and the coroner had been informed, the force added.
Emma Jones, 40, was staying in a cottage overlooking the large 17th-century semi-detached house where the woman died.
She said: "There were seven ambulances, two or three police cars, about two fire engines and a helicopter - I feel so sorry for her family."
A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said they had been looking out of the window at around 20:30 BST when they "saw the body come out in a private ambulance".
"We were told that she was doing her gardening and she just fell. One moment she was gardening, the next minute gone," they said.
"Just imagine how her family feel. Something like that, you wouldn't dream of happening."
