Ofsted rates Wirral Council children's services 'inadequate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children's services in Wirral have been rated "inadequate" after "widespread and serious failures" were found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ofsted found investigations into abuse "are not always compliant" with guidelines, poor record management and inadequate services for care leavers.
Inspectors said senior leaders were aware of issues but a "corporate failure" over recruitment meant they were not addressed.
Wirral Council said Â£2m was being invested to improve the service.
In the report, Ofsted rated leadership and management, the experiences and progress of care leavers and the services provided to children who need help and protection as inadequate.
The council performs well with children most at risk, but does not react as quickly to those at a "lower risk".
It found staff turnover was high, there has been a failure to recruit a permanent head of services and social workers' caseloads, though not excessive, are often complex.
The watchdog said the authority does not know where many of those who leave care are or what they are doing.
Julia Hassall, director of children's services said: "Social workers are constantly being asked to do more, with much less... but we need to create the right environment for our staff, and give them the right tools to do their jobs well."
The improvement plan, with the additional Â£2m investment from council reserves, includes more effective training and development for staff and recruiting and retaining social workers.
Eric Robinson, chief executive of the council, said: "These failings are unacceptable... It is absolutely vital we put them right as quickly as possible."
The Department for Education said it takes "tough action where councils are failing children" and expects Wirral Council to improve as a matter of urgency.
It added it would review the authority's progress in six months.
Ofsted rated the council's fostering and adoption services as good in 2011.
