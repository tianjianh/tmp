The woman had her handbag taken as she waited at a bus stop on Cromwell Road shortly before 06:00 BST on Saturday.
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: "As a result of the attack the woman has lost her baby."
It is understood the woman was about six weeks pregnant. A youth, 17, has appeared before Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court accused of robbery.
The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was remanded into youth detention accommodation until his trial which has been set for 16 April at Manchester Crown Court.
A second youth, also 17, has been arrested on suspicion of robbery.
Claire Parrot, defending, applied for bail for the defendant but was refused by District Judge Paul Carr.
Officers have released CCTV images of another youth they want to trace "imperatively" in relation to the attack.
He is described by police as white, aged between 16 and 20 and was wearing a black hooded top with white stripes down the arms, a black body warmer and dark tracksuit bottoms.
Det Sgt Roger Smethurst described the incident as a "sickening attack".
He said: "This is a shocking and tragic case and one that will undoubtedly have a lasting psychological impact upon the poor victim.
