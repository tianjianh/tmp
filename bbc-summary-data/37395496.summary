Search for soldier's relatives after Droitwich grave find

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of a soldier whose name was found at an overgrown cemetery are being urged to come forward on the 100th anniversary of his death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Edgar Talbot died at the Battle of Flers Courcelette on the Somme on 18 September 1916.
His name, inscribed in the edging stones of his mother's grave, was found during a clear-up of St Mary's Cemetery in Droitwich, Worcestershire.
Historians need to contact relatives before they can restore the memorial.
Pte Talbot - one of eight children - was born in Birmingham and later lived in Droitwich and Burton-on-Trent.
It is believed he worked as a bank clerk before his death in battle aged 35.
Historian Peter Kennedy said: "Edgar was not a tank driver he was a fusilier and he was in what was known as the bankers' battalion - the banks and all the clerks would go together as one."
He added: "We need permission before anything can be attempted to renovate and protect this memorial."
