Darko Velkoski's own goal and strikes from Vitolo, Nacho Monreal and Aritz Aduriz secured Spain's win.
All of Italy's goals came before the break, with Andrea Belotti scoring twice and Ciro Immobile and Antonio Candreva also netting.
Elsewhere in Group G, Israel beat Albania 3-0 to move to third.
The venue for the match in Albania had to be moved from Shkoder to Elbasan for security reasons. It followed media reports that an alleged terror group of 15 people, arrested in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia, planned an attack during the match.
An Eran Zahavi penalty gave the visitors an early lead, while Dan Einbinder and Eliran Atar added to the scoreline after the break.
The win means Israel stay a point behind Spain and Italy.
In Group I, Ukraine maintained their unbeaten record as Artem Kravets scored from close range to secure a 1-0 win over Finland.
Ukraine climb into second place above Iceland, whose unbeaten record ended with a 2-0 defeat by leaders Croatia.
Earlier, Turkey had beaten bottom-of-the-table Kosovo 2-0.
Republic of Ireland lead Group D after beating Austria 1-0, taking a two-point lead over Serbia, who drew 1-1 in Wales. Moldova remain bottom after drawing 1-1 in Tbilisi against Georgia.
