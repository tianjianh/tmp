World indoor champion Richard Kilty will not defend his 60m title in Portland, Oregon next month after choosing to focus on the Rio Olympics.

Despite disqualification for a false start at the British Championships, UK Athletics wanted to select Kilty, 26, alongside winner James Dasaolu.
But Kilty has opted instead to focus on realising his potential outdoors.
"Whilst this has been a really tough decision, looking at the big picture it's the smart call," he tweeted.
"This year is all about the Olympics, so going into Portland short of races and taking a gamble that I could run myself into form makes no sense when I could start to focus on my outdoor season early."
Kilty has a best over 60m of 6.49 seconds, but has yet to break 10 seconds for the 100m. His best time of 10.05 seconds was set at last year's Birmingham Grand Prix meeting.
"Individually I'm aiming for sub-10 and making the Olympic final in 2016," the Gateshead Harrier continued.
"As part of the GB 4x100m relay squad, we have a real shot at getting on the podium and are 100% focused on achieving success as a team."
Bath-based Andy Robertson took second place in Saturday's 60m final in a personal best of 6.54secs.
The IAAF World Indoor Championships take place in the United States from 17-20 March.
