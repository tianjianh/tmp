Export performance 'lags behind 2002'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The value of international exports from Scotland is lower than it was in 2002, a new paper has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Economist Margaret Cuthbert said overseas trade from the country "fell by 2.5% in real terms", between 2002 and 2013.
She said: "Despite the good performance in 2013, Scotland still lags in exports behind where it was in 2002."
Her paper was published by the Jimmy Reid Foundation.
According to Ms Cuthbert international exports increased between 2012 and 2013.
But when adjusted for inflation, the 2002 export figure of Â£20.14bn was higher than the Â£19.64bn for goods in 2013, the last year for which complete figures are available.
Ms Cuthbert's paper called for more reliable and up-to-date figures to be published detailing the level of Scottish exports to the rest of the UK and overseas.
She also questioned the degree of collaboration between the UK and Scottish government bodies charged with boosting international exports.
The economist said data was "not available to make any meaningful judgement of how well the agencies are doing in the ultimate goal of improving Scotland's export performance".
Ms Cuthbert added: "Without good data, economic strategies can end up as 'wish lists' and can actually harm the economy.
"The effect of past strategies in Scotland cannot be adequately scrutinised to determine whether or why they were successful and cost-efficient, or why they failed.
"We fool ourselves about our economic strategy without knowledge based upon analysis of the facts."
A Scottish government spokesman said: "All the export statistics published by the Scottish government are classified as national statistics.
"This means that the statistics are produced according to sound methods, are readily accessible and are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest."
SDI (Scottish Development International) managing director Paul Lewis said: "We have some of the most robust economic data and evidence in Europe which underpins our approach to improving Scotland's international trade and investment performance.
"There's a growing body of evidence that reinforces our approach is working, including that from independent industry bodies and organisations such as EY and the Financial Times, all of which echo our trade and export analysis, and recognise Scotland as a top European location for foreign direct investment."
