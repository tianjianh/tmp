The discovery was made on an inbound Ryanair flight from Alicante, southern Spain, just before midnight.
Dozen of flights were diverted elsewhere as the airport was shut for six hours, sparking passenger misery.
It was reopened when police gave the all-clear but flights on Sunday will be delayed, an airport spokeswoman said.
The package turned up during a routine inspection of Ryanair flight FR8297 after it arrived, a Bristol Airport spokeswoman said.
"Some delays to today's flight schedule can be expected as a result of this incident, but Bristol Airport is working with airlines to minimise disruption to passengers wherever possible," she added.
"As a result of this incident a total of 12 inbound flights diverted to other airports, and arrangements are being made to bring aircraft and passengers back to Bristol."
Many passengers returning from holiday had hours added on to their journey home, after being diverted to Cardiff, Birmingham or Stansted, and took to Twitter to express their frustration at bus delays, or not being able to get off the plane they were on.
Kathryn Rudd wrote: "Can't get enough taxis/buses to get us back to #bristolairport so we've got to arrange individually #cantseethisworkingoutwell."
Claire Weymouth tweeted: "Stuck on a plane at Birmingham airport for the last 2 hours as Bristol is still closed. #BristolAirport #JustWantMybed."
And Richard Cundy said: "Been stuck on #easyjet plane at #Cardiff airport for 2.5hrs after diverted from #bristolairport. Surely a bus back would be quicker!"
