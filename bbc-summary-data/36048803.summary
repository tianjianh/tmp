Lisa Bahmani, from Hawick, was killed and two pensioners injured in the accident on the A68 St Boswells to Jedburgh Road on Wednesday.
Ms Bahmani was driving a Hyundai Getz which collided with a Suzuki Ignis.
The 71-year-old female driver of the Ignis is in a serious but stable condition at Borders General Hospital.
The 78-year-old man is being treated for a chest injury, however, it is not thought to be life-threatening.
Ms Bahmani's family issued a statement saying she was "a much-loved daughter, sister and friend".
It added: "She was a special loving girl who loved animals.
"Lisa will be sorely missed by all who knew her. We are grateful for all the messages of support."
The road near Lilliardsedge Caravan Park was closed for about 10 hours following the accident which happened at about 22:00.
Police Scotland have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
Sgt Neil Inglis said: "Tragically this collision has resulted in the death of a young woman and the driver of the other vehicle remains in a very serious condition in hospital.
"We are continuing with our investigation to establish the full circumstances surrounding this collision and would urge any motorists who were on the A68 at around 8pm on Wednesday 13 April to contact us immediately if they witnessed the incident.
"In addition, anyone with any further information relevant to this inquiry should also get in touch."
