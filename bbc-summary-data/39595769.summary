Richie Foran says he is discounting rumours about his own job and is fully focused on leading Inverness Caledonian Thistle to safety from relegation.

His club issued a statement on Tuesday denying a report that a board meeting was being held to discuss his future.
"For me, it's not affected me," said Foran ahead of Saturday's visit to Motherwell. "I'm quite strong-minded.
"When you take a job on, you've got to expect criticism, rumours, speculation and lies."
Caley Thistle lie four points adrift of Saturday's hosts after their 3-0 home defeat by St Johnstone, but Foran remains positive about his position - and his side's chances of staying in the Premiership.
"It's not true - there was no board meeting about my future," he said.
"The club have put a statement out, so everything will be done face to face with the chairman. It doesn't get me up or down."
Foran was heckled after the weekend reverse, but the former club captain had no criticism of the fans.
"It's been a long season and fans have been patient," he said. "They were right to boo me off and have a go at me.
"They've been great for me and the team all season, but I deserved criticism on Saturday. I understand it.
"If they can be that bit more patient for the last six games, we'd appreciate it.
"They've surprised me how positive they've been. Don't panic or get frustrated, the wins are coming.
"Us, the players and supporters will enjoy their summer off as we'll still be in the Scottish Premiership."
Foran admits that relegation has been spoken about in the Caley Thistle dressing-room.
"Some have been part of teams before that went down - I was part of it here," he said. "I walked out in the corridor to see staff in tears at losing their jobs.
"It's huge to the city of Inverness to stay in the Scottish Premiership and we will.
"We're going to be fearless in these last six games, get points on the board and end up in a good position."
On Tuesday, Caley Thistle insisted that the club was holding "a routine board meeting".
"The directors, management team, players, staff and supporters remain focused on taking as many points as possible from our remaining six games," said their statement.
"A win at Motherwell this weekend would dramatically improve our prospects and the manager, coaching staff and lads are working hard to achieve this.
"The atmosphere at the club remains positive, with great determination to remain in the top-flight."
