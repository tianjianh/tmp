The Swiss, 19, was forced to withdraw from the second round at this year's Wimbledon with a wrist injury.
"Although I have recovered from the wrist injury I am behind in my training schedule," she wrote on social media.
On Tuesday, Bencic's compatriot Roger Federer, the men's world number three, pulled out of Rio with a knee injury that has ended his 2016 season.
The US Open begins in New York on 29 August.
Also out of the Olympics - which start on August 5 - are Maria Sharapova, who is serving a doping suspension, fellow former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who is pregnant, world number five Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova, who is ranked 17th.
In the men's tournament, Wimbledon runner-up and world number seven Milos Raonic and Tomas Berdych, ranked eighth, will also not compete.
