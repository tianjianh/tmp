Maidstone United 1-4 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green secured a fourth successive National League win with a thumping victory at Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhys Murphy's second-half double confirmed victory after Christian Doidge's strike in first-half injury-time had fired the visitors ahead.
Darren Carter sent Rovers ahead after five minutes when he ran onto a through ball and picked his spot, but the lead was short-lived as Jack Evans curled in a 20-yard free-kick.
Rovers went into the break ahead when Doidge turned in Ben Jefford's cross before Murphy took over, first with a stunning solo effort, before he was left unmarked moments later to confirm Maidstone's first defeat on their plastic pitch this season.
