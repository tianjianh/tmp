[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Reverend Canon Dr Audrey Elkington has been installed as the Archdeacon of Bodmin at a special ceremony at Truro Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Elkington, who used to be the Bishop of Newcastle's chaplain, succeeds Clive Cohen who retired after 11 years in the post.
Audrey Elkington was born and brought up in the outskirts of Newcastle. She read Biochemistry at St Catherine's College, Oxford, and became fascinated with how life works at the level of molecules. This led to four years in Norwich conducting research into the molecular genetics of a soil bacterium.
During this time, she sensed a calling to ordained ministry and met her husband.
Audrey served 14 years in parish ministry - in Monkseaton, Ponteland and Prudhoe - and in 2002 became Bishop's Chaplain and Director of Ordinands.
Dr Elkington said: "God has surprised us both in calling us from the north-eastern-most part of the Church of England to its south-western extremity, but already we have been able to see some connections.
"Both our dioceses can trace our Christian faith back to the Celtic saints, and as we leave behind St Aidan and St Cuthbert, we look forward to getting to know St Piran and St Breaca."
The Bishop of Truro, the Right Reverend Tim Thornton, said he was "delighted with the appointment" of Dr Elkington.
Bishop Tim said: "I am especially looking forward to working closely with Audrey as we shape further our work in formation and discipleship. She has a keen interest in the calling of all people. She will of course want to get to know the diocese and we shall give her and her husband a very warm welcome. Please do keep them in your prayers."
Northumbrian piper, Bea Geddes, the St Minver Silver Band and the Wadebridge Male Voice Choir all played their parts in a special welcome service for the Revd Canon Dr Audrey Elkington as she was installed as Archdeacon of Bodmin in Truro Cathedral on Friday 29 July.
In her inaugural sermon, the Venerable Dr Audrey Elkington drew strong analogies between the North East - its people and its Celtic saints - and those in Cornwall.
She spoke of the characteristics of the early Christian saints and the pattern of their lives; which consisted of journeying, wrestling with the Scriptures, prayer and worship, and being in community.
"I may have been seeking to walk with Christ 'a canny few' years, but this doesn't mean to say I am any more of an expert than you are. There are still times when I'd rather walk my way and on my own terms.
"That's why you and I need to journey together, why we need to explore alongside each other what it means to be a disciple of Christ in Cornwall today."
