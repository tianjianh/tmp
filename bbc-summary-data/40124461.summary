A quiet room for Manx patients flying to Liverpool will be provided by the city's airport following a U-turn.

Liverpool John Lennon Airport rejected the plan last month as there were "already a number of quiet spaces within the departure lounge".
Manx Breast Cancer Support Group, which claimed the airport had gone back on a pledge, said it was thankful there had been "a change of heart".
The airport said a "quiet area can be developed within the departure lounge".
A spokesman said: "The airport has been working with representatives of Manx cancer patients over a number of weeks to understand their needs.
"This area would be available for all passengers looking for a quiet space, and we would work with and support all parties in communicating to those passengers as required."
Manx Breast Cancer Support Group said the room, which could be available at the end of July, would be made open to anyone travelling for hospital treatment - not solely cancer patients.
Julie Stokes, from the charity, said: "Thankfully Liverpool Airport has recently had a change of heart.
"We want this facility for all patients to use - some are young children and some are very elderly."
