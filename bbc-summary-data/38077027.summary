The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The Yes to Kingsford Stadium group believes the 20,000-seat venue would be a vital step forward, however there has been opposition.
An exhibition will be held at Pittodrie on Thursday from 15:00 to 21:00, at the AAM Suite in the Richard Donald Stand.
George Yule, executive vice chairman of AFC, said: "The glories of our past and solid footing of our present cannot sustain the club in the future and that is why we embarked on a new journey some four years ago - a journey that will take us to long-term success and sustainability, on and off the pitch.
"We will be providing a stadium that supports our ambition and meets the expectations of our fans alongside outstanding community sports facilities."
