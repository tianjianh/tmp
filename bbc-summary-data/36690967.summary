In front of a partisan home crowd, the world champions came from behind in both sets to defeat Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo 21-19 21-17.
It was Brazil's fifth gold of the Games and the country's first win in the event for 12 years.
The Netherlands beat Russia in the bronze medal match.
Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen saw off Konstantin Semenov and Viacheslav Krasilnikov 23-21 22-20 to earn the Dutch a first medal in the event.
The Copacabana beach stadium was only half-full for their match, but the crowds arrived at midnight to watch Cerutti, a losing finalist in 2012, and his new partner Schmidt take the gold.
Italy led 11-7 in the second set but 6ft 8in Cerutti pulled the Brazilians back to level at 14-14, and the home fans erupted as the pair converted match points.
Brazil, who also won women's silver on Thursday, have come away with multiple medals at every Olympics since beach volleyball was added to the Games programme in Atlanta in 1996.
