[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old man was found in the undercarriage of a British Airways plane from Johannesburg on Thursday.
The Met Police said officers were investigating whether a second man, found dead on a roof in Richmond, stowed away on the same plane.
His death "remains unexplained", they said.
Police believe they know the identity of the dead man and said a post-mortem examination would take place this week.
He was found dead on the roof of notonthehighstreet.com's headquarters on Kew Road at 09:35 BST on Thursday.
Officers are set to speak to the man in hospital to ascertain whether the two incidents are connected..
British Airways said it was working with the authorities to "establish the facts surrounding this very rare case" while notonthehighstreet.com said it was also "co-operating with the ongoing police enquiry".
The 5,600-mile journey (9,012km) from Johannesburg to the UK usually takes about 11 hours.
There have been other cases where stowaways have fallen to their deaths in London after smuggling themselves onto planes and hiding in landing gear.
In September 2012, Jose Matada, 26, was found dead after falling from the undercarriage of a flight from Angola to Heathrow on to a street in Mortlake, west London.
An inquest heard he may have survived freezing temperatures of up to minus 60C (-76F) for most of the 12-hour flight, but it was believed he was "dead or nearly dead" by the time he hit the ground.
