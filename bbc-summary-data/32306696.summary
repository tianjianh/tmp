Dumfries and Galloway police examine 'collusion' claim report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have confirmed that they are examining a report into allegations of collusion between Dumfries and Galloway Council and a collapsed building firm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The report was commissioned by the local authority six years ago but has never been made public.
The document was compiled by the former chief executive of Highland Council, Arthur McCourt.
He was brought into to examine a complaint made against the authority's planning department.
It was in connection with proposed data farm developments.
It was alleged that sensitive information from one developer was passed to a competing commercial interest - understood to be the collapsed building firm R&D Holdings.
The report also looked into claims that elected members were given misleading information.
A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed that they had now received the McCourt report from the local authority and were examining the contents to determine whether there was any evidence of criminality.
