Christopher Griffiths, 35, of Southsea, Wrexham, was convicted of causing unnecessary suffering and carrying out a prohibited procedure.
Victor, a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog, was mutilated using "a pliers-type implement," Wrexham Magistrates' Court heard.
RSPCA inspector Kia Thomas said: "It was so heartbreaking. It is awful to imagine what poor Victor went through."
On Wednesday, Griffiths was also disqualified from keeping dogs for 10 years and was given a 12-month probation order.
The RSPCA was contacted on 22 September 2015 by police after Victor was found with his ears chopped off.
He was taken to a vet who performed surgery on his ears and stitched up the wounds. During treatment, cocaine was found in Victor's system.
Insp Thomas added: "When I first saw Victor I was just so shocked as his ears were gaping open wounds. I had never seen anything quite like it before.
"Since Victor has been in our care he has been doing so well. He is an adorable dog with a lot of love to give.
"He loves nothing more than to be in your company and loves a cwtch on the sofa. He is now up for rehoming and we hope he will find his forever home soon."
