Parker, who has faced recent media scrutiny over a historic rape trial, will be in London for the screening.
The line-up also includes Oliver Stone's Snowden, about Edward Snowden, and La La Land, which has had rave reviews at the Venice Film Festival.
A 780-seat pop-up cinema will be erected in Victoria Embankment Gardens.
The festival will screen 245 feature films over 12 days from 5-16 October, including 18 world premieres.
One film to be given its European premiere will be Manchester by the Sea, which is seen as one of the frontrunners for next year's Oscars.
The family drama stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. It has nothing to with the UK city, but is set in the small town of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts.
Other highlights will include:
As previously announced, Ben Wheatley's Free Fire will be the closing night gala, while Amma Asante's A United Kingdom will open the festival.
The festival will feature the UK premiere of Snowden, the Platoon and JFK director's dramatisation of the story of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
La La Land, meanwhile, in which Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling pay homage to the golden age of Hollywood, will be in London on the back of its rapturous reception in Venice.
It was described as "a sun-drenched musical masterpiece" by The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, "the most audacious big-screen musical in a long time" by Variety's Owen Gleiberman and an "an all-singing, all-dancing Oscars frontrunner" by The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin.
Nate Parker has acted in, written and directed The Birth of a Nation, a drama about Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion.
With buzz about the film allied with headlines about Parker's past, it is bound to be one of the most keenly-watched premieres.
Recent media attention has been focused on Parker's acquittal for rape in 1999 and his accuser's subsequent suicide.
The Birth of a Nation will feature in Black Star, the British Film Institute's symposium to highlight the work of black actors.
Festival director Clare Stewart said: "For me it's one of the significant films of the year. In terms of Black Star, it's an incredibly important film.
"It's not for me to make any further comment about the controversy surrounding the director."
