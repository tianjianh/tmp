£4.65m boost for rural business in Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire County Council has been awarded £4.65m to support the rural economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Firms in Lancashire North and Bowland, Lancashire West, and Lancashire Pennine Moors can seek a share of the £1.63m, £1.56m, and £1.43m pots respectively.
The funds are for capital investments such as buildings and equipment.
The programme runs from 2015 to 2020 and aims to support farms and forestry as well as rural tourism, services and heritage.
Local action groups for each area will be in charge of approving projects and deciding how to allocate the money.
County Councillor Marcus Johnstone said: "Rural businesses and organisations can benefit from [money] towards capital investments, including refurbishment of buildings and capital equipment. Priority will be given to those businesses creating jobs and growth.
"The programme should be open for business shortly, subject to approval."
The council ran the programme from 2007 to 2013, delivering support to companies including Woods Farm Shop in Little Hoole.
Owner John Woods said they were struggling when they applied to the programme in 2012.
They received half the cost of building a new farm shop and now employ nine people.
Mr Woods said: "It was a long process but well worth it. I came across the scheme by accident but we wouldn't have been able to do it without the money."
Mike Damms from the East Lancashire Chamber of Commerce also welcomed the investment.
"It often comes as a surprise to people to realise just how rural Lancashire is. I'm really pleased because this matters very much and will help mobilise all of our economy."
The scheme is funded by the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
