Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says making the fans happy is more important to him than winning trophies.

City extended their winning start in the league to five games with a 4-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday.
They next face Swansea in the EFL Cup and Premier League before a Champions League trip to Celtic, but Guardiola is refusing to think about silverware yet.
"My happiness does not depend on if I am going to win all the titles or not," said the Spaniard.
"My question is: are the people who came to this game really enjoy it? Yes? Wow, that is enough. To win titles or not, we will see."
New signing Leroy Sane came off the bench after 72 minutes  in the win over Bournemouth, but Guardiola says the forward "needs minutes" and will play against Swansea in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, in the first of two games in four days against the Welsh side.
"Leroy was injured at the beginning. It's much better. Now he has had one or two weeks training with us and each day he's getting better. I know his quality," added Guardiola.
City beat Borussia Monchengladbach 4-0 in their opening Champions League group game, but Guardiola stressed how difficult it is to win the competition, with City having only once reached the semi-final stage.
"When the people believe I am going to win the Champions League because I am a really good coach, I don't think so," he said.
