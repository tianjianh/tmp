The 27-year-old man's body was found at an address on Bottom Boat Road, Stanley, at about 09:35 GMT on Thursday.
West Yorkshire Police said he had "suffered serious stab injuries".
Appealing for information, Det Supt Elizabeth Belton, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "This is a very serious incident which is now being treated as a murder enquiry."
She added: "A forensic post-mortem [examination] will take place to determine the exact cause of death but it is apparent the victim suffered stab injuries some time before he was found."
