Pte Shaun Cole, 22, from Edinburgh, had been attending the Ultra Music festival in Miami with two friends when he died.
It was reported that his body was found on a pavement on Sunday and that he died as a result of a head injury.
He was serving with the Royal Scots Borderers. Miami Police are still investigating Pte Cole's death.
Pte Cole's family said: "We would like to inform everyone that Miami Police are now following a line of inquiry that would suggest that Shaun was involved in a hit-and-run incident.
"We would like to thank Miami Police and consular staff and everyone who has offered support to our family over the last few days."
Police in the US said the former Tynecastle High School pupil had suffered a blunt force trauma to the head.
Pte Cole had recently returned from serving in Sierra Leone, where he was helping in the fight against Ebola.
