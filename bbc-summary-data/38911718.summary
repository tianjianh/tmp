In one incident, a stone smashed through a Great Western train window and entered the cab, but no one was injured.
A windshield on a freight locomotive was also broken in the other incident near Trowbridge Road Bridge on Saturday at about noon.
British Transport Police have branded the incidents dangerous and reckless.
"Fortunately, both drivers were unharmed however, as you can imagine, it has left them feeling incredibly shaken," said investigating officer PC Matt Dando.
