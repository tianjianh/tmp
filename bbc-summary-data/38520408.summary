[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wilful fireraising took place in Craigearn Park, Kemnay, on Hogmanay.
No-one was injured in the fire, which was just before midnight, but the property was damaged.
Officers have said there was "significant" risk of harm in this type of incident and urged anyone who saw anything suspicious to get in touch.
Det Sgt Martyn Thomson, of Police Scotland, said: "We are treating the fire as wilful and would appeal to anyone with information to get in touch with us as soon as possible.
"This type of behaviour will not be tolerated. It goes without saying that the risk of harm was significant and the consequences could have been far greater."
