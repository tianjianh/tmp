[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Italy has long been plagued by the activities of the mafia, and a new exhibition of photographs in Venice attempts to uncover the wider effects of organised crime on suburban life.
From the drug smugglers of Naples to the prisoners of Brazil, Gang City examines the connection between violence and civil decay.
Showcasing more than 80 photographs, which date back to the mid-1980s, the exhibition portrays the perpetrators and victims of gang-related crime.
