[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Irish parliamentary committee is examining the reasons why the Republic of Ireland suffered a banking crisis and economic crash in 2008.

BBC News NI's economics and business editor John Campbell looks at the background to the inquiry, what it has discovered and the impact its findings could have.
The Republic of Ireland experienced a catastrophic financial crisis in 2008 from which it still has not fully recovered.
The country's banking sector had to be almost entirely nationalised when the bursting of a property price bubble coincided with a global downturn.
There have been a series of reports on the crisis but this parliamentary inquiry is an attempt to give a definitive analysis.
It is examining the political, economic, social, cultural, financial and behavioural factors that contributed to the crisis.
It is also looking at the preventative reforms which followed.
The inquiry started hearing from witnesses in December 2014 and has worked roughly on the basis of starting with the least involved and moving towards those who were at the centre of events.
The first witness was the Finnish banking expert Peter Nyberg and he has been followed by a procession of journalists, academics, civil servants, auditors, bankers and now politicians.
The major details have simply been restated and reinforced: the banks were arrogant and reckless, the regulators were timid and inept, the experts failed to see it coming, and the politicians were happy to binge on property tax revenues.
Most of what is new concerns the fine detail of the bank guarantee.
That was the fateful government decision in 2008 to guarantee the liabilities of the country's banks, effectively putting the Republic of Ireland's citizens on the hook for the bank's losses.
It seems as though the banks were lobbying for a guarantee much earlier than was previously known.
It hopes to report before the end of the year, probably in November, but it will be constrained in its conclusions.
Irish parliamentary inquiries cannot assign personal blame to individuals or even make findings of fact.
There will be a general election in the Republic of Ireland in the spring of 2016 at the latest.
The governing Fine Gael/Labour coalition will be quite happy that voters get a series of very public reminders that their rivals in Fianna FÃ¡il were in power throughout the crisis.
