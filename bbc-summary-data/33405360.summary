Prop forward Adam Walker was spoken to regarding offences of attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child.
The 24-year-old has not been arrested and voluntarily attended the police station, West Yorkshire Police said.
A statement from the rugby club before its match against Huddersfield Giants on Sunday said it was "appropriate" Mr Walker be stood down for selection.
"This is not an admission of wrongdoing but felt to be in the best interests of everyone, including Adam," the club said.
No disciplinary action has been taken, it added.
Mr Walker, from Bradford, was signed by the Super League team on a three-year deal in 2014.
He previously played for Huddersfield Giants.
