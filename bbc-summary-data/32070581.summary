The southern city is where Enyeama hails from but his night was soured when Farouk Miya's close-range shot deflected in nine minutes from time.
Enyeama, who was presented with a trophy before the match, joins Joseph Yobo on 100 caps for Nigeria.
He can beat that record when the Super Eagles play South Africa on Sunday.
The 32-year-old Lille player is the fourth African goalkeeper to become a centurion after three Egyptians - Essam El-Hadary,  Nader El-Sayed and Ahmed Shobair - previously achieved the feat.
After the match, Nigeria Football Federation president Amaju Pinnick was highly critical of the Super Eagles squad, which was led by caretaker coach Daniel Amokachi.
"We are supposed to be celebrating with Enyeama on his 100th cap, but your poor performance has ruined the party and Nigerians are very angry," he told the players after the game.
"When next you receive an invitation letter to come represent Nigeria, you have a critical decision to make: accept it only if you believe you are in the frame of mind to give your everything or decline if you do not feel that way.
"The camp of the national team will no longer welcome average players or good players with poor attitude."
