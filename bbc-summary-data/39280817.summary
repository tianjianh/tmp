Reality Check: Who benefits from National Insurance U-turn?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chancellor Philip Hammond announced on Wednesday that he would not be raising Class 4 National Insurance contributions as he had planned to in last week's Budget.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reality Check verdict: About 80% of self-employed workers will pay less National Insurance from April 2018, with the rest seeing no change after the government abandoned changes announced in the Budget.
Class 2 National Insurance contributions will still be abolished from April next year. They are paid at a flat rate of £2.80 a week by anyone making profits of more than £5,965 a year.
Figures prepared for the BBC by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 20% of self-employed people earn less than £5,965. They do not pay any National Insurance and will still not pay any - that is about one million people.
The remaining 80%, approximately 3.6 million people, will now get the cut to NI that they had been expecting since George Osborne announced the abolition of Class 2 contributions in 2016.
These figures are not precise because they are based on an ONS survey, which estimates the distribution of earnings for the self-employed.
In an interview the morning after last week's Budget, the chancellor said that 60% of self-employed workers would pay less NI as a result of the abolition of Class 2 contributions combined with the increase in Class 4 contributions.
He said: "Of the 15% of people who are self-employed, 60% will see a reduction in their National Insurance charge. Anyone earning less than £16,250 a year will see a reduction in the National Insurance contributions they pay."
That was clearly not the case - those earning less than £5,965 a year would not have paid any National Insurance either before or after the changes.
The ONS survey estimates that 40% would have paid less NI, while 20% would see no change.
