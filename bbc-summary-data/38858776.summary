Tessa Banks, 33, of Dumfries, had previously been found guilty of having the device in a flat in the town.
A court heard how a bomb disposal expert had been called out to make it safe.
Banks was put under supervision for 18 months and ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.
She was also told to take part in a special behavioural programme.
Banks had denied the committing offence between November 2015 and March last year but she was found guilty at the end of three-day trial at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month.
The court heard that the alert had been raised after a friend told police she had been shown the device and was concerned over what might happen.
The jury was told by a bomb disposal expert that he had cleared the area at the house as he tackled the improvised device made from three fireworks wrapped in a sock.
During evidence it was said that Banks was having issues with the social work department at the time.
It was claimed that she had forgotten the device was there until the friend had seen it.
Solicitor Ranald Lindsay stressed that there was no evidence that Banks had had a hand in making it and described her as "a vulnerable person easily influenced by her partners".
However, Sheriff Brian Mohan pointed out that the device was capable of causing injury to anyone nearby or starting a fire.
