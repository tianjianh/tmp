[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 1-2 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Christian Doidge bagged his 20th National League goal of the season as Forest Green Rovers moved up a place to second with a 2-1 win at Sutton United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doidge took advantage of a howler from on-loan United keeper Will Puddy, signed in the aftermath of 'Piegate' keeper Wayne Shaw's resignation.
The visitors dominated the early stages which featured an argument between Sutton team-mates Nicky Bailey and Bedsente Gomis.
Doidge headed against the bar moments before Mark Ellis nodded in a corner after 32 minutes. Three minutes later Puddy's horror show allowed Doidge a simple goal.
Tempers then flared as Bailey was booked during a melee just before the break.
Rovers' Ellis was sent off late on for denying a goal-scoring opportunity and Kieron Cadogan netted a consolation deep into stoppage time.
