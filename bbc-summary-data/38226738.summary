The 25-year-old will join the Women's Super League club in January when the WSL transfer window re-opens.
Chelsea were knocked out of the Women's Champions League by Wolfsburg in October and in their 2015-16 campaign.
"I know the qualities Chelsea have after our Champions League games and hope I will be able to add to that," Bachmann told Chelsea's club website.
"I want to win trophies and believe I am at the perfect place to do that."
Blues boss Emma Hayes added: "She is a dynamic, creative spark that will make people get off their feet. She will suit the English game, because she is explosive and will make things happen."
Chelsea, who finished second in WSL 1 in 2016, have already signed Norway captain Maren Mjelde from Norwegian club Avaldsnes for next season.
