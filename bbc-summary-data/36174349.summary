Leicester turns blue in support of hometown Foxes

Landmarks, fans and even sausages are turning blue in Leicester as its football team get closer to winning an unexpected Premier League title.

Leicester City Football Club - known as the Foxes - is just one win away from cinching the title.
Last season the team was fighting relegation from England's top flight.
But the club is seven points ahead of second-placed Tottenham and needs only three points from three games to be certain of finishing top.
More than 100 businesses, schools and organisations, including BBC Radio Leicester, are supporting the "Backing the Blues" campaign.
