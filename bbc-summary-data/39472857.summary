Paul McCready, from north Belfast, died in hospital from injuries sustained in an altercation in the Donegall Street area shortly before 01:00 BST.
A 30-year-old man was arrested at the scene.
Police cordons are in place on Donegall Street and Waring Street, close to the Northern Whig bar.
Detectives have appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.
"We are aware that there would have been quite a number of people in the Donegall Street area at the time that this incident occurred and we are keen to speak with as many witnesses and passers-by as possible," DCI Geoffrey Boyce said.
