The 25-year-old midfielder has agreed a one-year contract with the Reds, with the option of a further year.
Tajbakhsh has spent most of his career in non-league and has had spells at Braintree Town, Aylesbury, Enfield and Cray Wanderers.
"We think he is someone capable of stepping up and competing for a place in the squad," boss Dermot Drummy said.
"He's very good technically and has worked hard during pre-season to impress. This is a big opportunity for him to kick on in his career."
Tajbakhsh is Crawley's 13th signing of the summer.
