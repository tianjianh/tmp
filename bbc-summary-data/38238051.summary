World heritage sites, ancient monuments, cultural traditions, myths and legends will be the focus of the 12 month long programme.
VisitScotland said it would throw the spotlight on some of Scotland's greatest assets and its hidden gems.
The line-up was unveiled by Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop in Edinburgh.
It includes:
Ms Hyslop said the programme of nine events were being supported by Â£300,000 in funding.
She added: "As well as our history of many well-known stories and famous, indeed some infamous, historical characters, next year will also give us an excellent opportunity to focus on Scotland's world-renowned archaeology, enticing visitors and locals alike to visit not only our known iconic landmarks with their thousands of years of history, but also our many hidden gems."
More than a third of Scotland's tourists visit the country for its history, according to VisitScotland.
It said ancestral tourism is worth around Â£101m to the Scottish economy.
Malcolm Roughead, the chief executive of Scotland's tourism agency said: "Scotland is the land where great legends were made throughout history, and so it is only apt that we should have such a unique line-up of events and activities for the 2017 Year of History Heritage and Archaeology.
"We know for a fact that visitors come to Scotland in their droves to experience its heritage whether that's visiting a castle, exploring a battlefield or tracing ancestral roots.
"From World Heritage Sites to ancient monuments, cultural traditions to our myths, stories and legends - the year-long programme will spotlight some of our greatest assets and icons as well as our hidden gems.
"We look forward to delving into Scotland's past with visitors and locals alike and coming face to face with history, heritage and archaeology across the country."
In addition to the nine events unveiled on Wednesday, a much wider programme will fall under the Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology banner.
They include Scot:Lands, an adventurous journey across Edinburgh on New Years Day; Celtic Connections; various Burns Night celebrations; and family friendly "moments in time" installation at Edinburgh's International Science Festival in April.
A Â£500,000 fund from the Heritage Lottery Fund will also be used to encourage people across Scotland uncover and celebrate their local history, customs and traditions.
The fund's head, Lucy Casot, said: "Our ambition next year is that everyone, young and old, will have the chance to discover something new about the rich tapestry that makes Scotland, Scotland.
"The door to fun, discovery and learning will be opened wide welcoming in locals and visitors alike.
"Whether its enjoying one of these incredible Signature celebrations, or getting involved in one of the many community-level projects, funded through the National Lottery, 2017 is up shaping up to be an exciting celebration of our shared identity and we are delighted to be a key part of that."
