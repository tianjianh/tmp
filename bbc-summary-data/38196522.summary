The Swans suffered their heaviest defeat of the season when losing 5-0 at Tottenham.
The defeat means they are bottom of the table after Sunderland's win over Leicester.
"We will be ready against Sunderland, which will be the start of an important run of games that are going to spell out what's happening," Bradley said.
"We know it's all to play for in the next five or six matches between now and the start of the new year."
Bradley says the controversial decision to award Tottenham a penalty was a "big turning point" in their 5-0 defeat at White Hart Lane.
Harry Kane converted from the penalty spot on 39 minutes to give Spurs the lead after Dele Alli appeared to dive in the box.
"For me it's a wrong decision. The penalty was a big turning point," Bradley said.
"And then Son's strike minutes later totally changes the game."
South Korea international Son Heung-min doubled the home side's lead before the break with Kane's second and two goals from Christian Eriksen sealing Swansea's fate.
The former United States coach acknowledged his side were "not good enough" against a team who had won just once in their past 10 matches in all competitions.
"We just weren't good enough, we were second best most of the time and when they pressed us we couldn't get the first pass out of pressure," Bradley added.
"There is a lot there in which we need to work on to get ourselves out of pressure now we have to focus on the important run of games.
"I still felt even in the first 39 minutes at times we were second best in terms of some of the duals.
"We all know that to get where we need to go, we cannot concede the number of goals we have in the last two games."
