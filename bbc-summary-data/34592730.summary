One Direction have announced that a gig they cancelled at the last minute in Belfast on Tuesday will now take place on Friday, and two other concerts in the city will go ahead as planned.

Harry Styles said the band was "very sorry" for cancelling Tuesday's show.
Fans were already inside the city's SSE Arena when the gig was pulled at 21:00 BST after singer Liam Payne fell ill.
Styles told BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans that the band had been "trying to get on and then it was just impossible".
Payne was "just very, very ill", he said.
"We very, very much apologise to everyone."
And Payne tweeted: "I'm so sorry to everybody I disappointed last night. I'm feeling better now.
"I really hope everyone can make the rescheduled date on Friday.
"I really can't wait to perform and make it up to everyone later."
Disappointed fans booed as staff instructed them to leave the venue, and one witness said "hundreds" of girls and women had been left weeping.
Concert promoter Aiken Promotions said: "The show tonight has been cancelled as Liam has taken ill, and whilst not serious, he is unable to perform tonight."
And in another statement on Wednesday, the promoter apologised for the cancellation.
That show has been rescheduled for Friday and original tickets are valid.
"We thank everyone for their understanding and their good wishes to Liam," Aiken Promotions added.
Fans unable to attend Friday's concert have been told they will be refunded.
It was the first time in the band's five-year career that they had been forced to cancel a show.
Previously, members had filled in for each other when illness struck.
"To be honest, we feel kind of lucky that we've got to this point and never cancelled one," said Styles.
But the rescheduled show has come at a cost for ice hockey fans in Belfast.
The Belfast Giants had been due to play a game against the Sheffield Steelers at SSE Arena on Friday night.
That has now had to make way for the One Direction gig.
Neil Walker, the arena's general manager, said "all possible options" had been assessed before the decision was made and he apologised to supporters of both teams.
"We are very grateful to them for their understanding and accommodation of the nearly 10,000 young concert fans who were so devastated by the cancellation last night," he added.
"We are now looking forward to three great nights of concerts."
