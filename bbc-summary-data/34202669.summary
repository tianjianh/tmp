Investigation into school pupil E. coli case in Ayrshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health authorities have launched an investigation after a pupil at a school in South Ayrshire was confirmed as having been infected with E. coli O157.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Ayrshire and Arran said it was working to identify possible sources but early indications did not suggest the infection occurred at the school.
It is understood the child is a pupil at Ayr Grammar.
As a precaution the health board has written to parents who have children at the school to offer general advice.
The symptoms can include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, nausea and fever.
In a small number of cases, the infection causes serious illness and complications.
E. coli is most often acquired from animals and foodstuffs, but may also be passed from person to person.
Health officials said "careful hand-washing" was one of the most effective methods of avoiding infection.
