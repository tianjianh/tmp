Michael Asher, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, was last seen boarding a train to Poole, Dorset, on 31 March.
Police say they believe he has been using buses in Dorset, and the last unconfirmed sighting of him was at a Bournemouth soup kitchen.
Mr Asher's family urged him to get in touch.
Addressing him directly in a statement, his cousin Pat Goodsave said: "I'm just so worried about you and want to know where you are."
Mr Asher is described as slim, 6ft-tall and bald. He is known to dress smartly and also to wear a baseball cap.
