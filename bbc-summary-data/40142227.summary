Drinkhall lost 4-1 to European number one Dimitrij Ovtcharov, with team-mates Liam Pitchford and Sam Walker having been eliminated a round earlier.
Walker and David McBeath made it to the last 16 of the doubles in Germany.
However, their challenge was ended by a 4-2 defeat by Taipei duo Chien-An Chen and Cheng-Ting Liao.
"I don't think we even played our best and there's a lot more to work on and improve. It's promising times for us as a pair," said Walker.
Drinkhall and Pitchford went out in the last 64 of the doubles following a 4-2 loss to India's Sharath Kamal Achanta and Sathiyan Gnanasekaran.
"Overall, I'd have like to have done better but in both the singles and doubles I got to where my seeding was, so it wasn't good or bad," said Drinkhall.
No women's squad went to Germany as the top two players - Kelly Sibley and Tin-Tin Ho - were unavailable.
