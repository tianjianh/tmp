New Vale boss Bruno Ribeiro has several more foreign transfer targets in mind.
Knops, a 28-year-old centre-back, is due to be followed to the Potteries on Wednesday by two more foreign signings from French side Monaco.
"It is important to me to come and play for a manager who wants to play football," said Knops.
"That is why I was keen to come. Port Vale is new to me so, when they contacted me, I did my research. I saw a great club with a great stadium.
"League One is a good competition. It is a very good opportunity for me. I watch Premier League football on the TV so I do know a bit about English football."
