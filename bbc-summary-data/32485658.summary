Flt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, died when his Hawk T1 aircraft - Red 4 - crashed after a display at Bournemouth Air Show in August 2011.
A new display will open at the Bournemouth Aviation Museum which includes a model Red Arrow Hawk T1A.
It will also include a collection box for the Jon Egging Trust, a charity set up in the pilot's memory.
Museum trustee David Shore said: "After running a Red Arrows day last August and the level of interest it generated, we decided we wanted to do something in Flt Lt Egging's memory.
"We had discussions with a model maker at last year's Bournemouth Air Show about creating a display for us.
"The display will have information on both Flt Lt Egging and the history of the Red Arrows with a collection box for any donations to the Jon Egging Trust."
The trust helps young people with vocational and academic qualifications. Its Blue Skies Programme pairs students with role models from aviation, engineering and science.
Bournemouth Aviation Museum's display is the latest tribute in the town to Flt Lt Egging.
In August 2012, a sculpture on Bournemouth's East Overcliff was unveiled featuring three glass Red Arrows planes and stainless steel contrails to coincide with the first Bournemouth Air Show since the crash.
