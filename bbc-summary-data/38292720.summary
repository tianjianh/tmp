A 19-year-old man remains in custody after the death of Martin Maughan, 27, in West Walk, Sneinton, early on Saturday morning.
But the stabbing of a 38-year-old man in Mill View Close on Sunday morning is being treated as a separate incident.
The second victim has not been identified and no arrests have been made in connection with his death.
A 43-year-old man arrested after the killing of Mr Maughan has been released on bail.
Chief Inspector Mark Stanley said extra patrols have been put in place in Sneinton to reassure residents.
"(Crime) scenes have been established at both of the incidents to make sure all available evidence is secured and preserved.
"The early indications are that these incidents are confined to people who are known to each other and who were at addresses they were invited to," Ch Insp Stanley said.
The second victim was holding a party celebrating the life of his friend when he was stabbed, the BBC has been told.
