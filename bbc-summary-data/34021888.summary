An 18-year-old who acted as an "inside woman" in the killing of a teenager in London has been found guilty of murder.

Sanna Ibrahim was found guilty of murdering Jeremie Malenge, along with Tre Morgan, 18, a 17-year-old boy and 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
Jeremie, 17, from Hackney, died in Homerton High Street less than an hour after police spoke to him on 6 January.
The Old Bailey heard Ibrahim passed on information to Jeremie's killers.
The trial was halted after jurors reported seeing someone in the public gallery making a cut-throat gesture in their direction while Ibrahim was giving evidence in her defence.
However, the jurors agreed to carry on and went on to find all four defendants guilty of murder after deliberating for less than two hours.
The court heard Ibrahim had travelled with Jeremie and his friend from Swindon to London on the evening of the attack.
When the group arrived at Hackney Central at about 23:00 BST, they were chased by the three male attackers through the streets for half an hour.
While Ibrahim was with Jeremie, she secretly texted and called one of her co-accused 36 times, the court heard.
As Jeremie ran away, Ibrahim managed to meet the attackers face-to-face to pass on information, then rejoined him, the jury heard.
The prosecution said she was "as cool as you like" as she rejoined the victims who were trying to get away in a minicab.
When the attackers caught up with Jeremie in Homerton High Street, east London, he was stabbed multiple times and received a fatal 5in (12.5cm) wound through his ribs, piercing the heart, the court heard. He was later pronounced dead at the scene.
Prosecutor Timothy Cray said: "No excuse has been put forward for these actions and there can be no excuse.
"Instead, the four defendants in their various ways either say 'not me' and then point the finger at each other or say that they were not there at all, despite the clearest evidence that they were."
Jeremie's friend managed to get away.
Ibrahim claimed in court that she had been held hostage by Jeremie and his friend, who had forced her to travel from Swindon to London so they could steal some drugs she was looking after.
Ibrahim was not present at the time of the killing, but was sitting yards away and and saw the killers dispose of bloody knives, the jury was told.
The police said witness statements and CCTV played a key role in the investigation as the footage had captured the stabbing and the attackers fleeing the scene.
Jeremie's father said: "He is a big loss to our family and the killers of Jeremie have really broken our hearts."
Ibrahim, of Hackney; Morgan, of south west London, and the two youths had denied murder.
The 17-year-old boy was also found guilty of a further count of wounding with intent relating to an earlier incident in March 2014, which the Old Bailey heard may have sparked the murder of Jeremie.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also investigating the Met Police's prior contact with the victim on the night of the attack.
The referral was made because it was understood that, in the hour before he was killed, Jeremie was spoken to by police responding to reports of youths being armed with knives in the area.
The group were all remanded in custody until sentencing on 25 September.
