Dementia care home in Haverfordwest recommended for closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A residential care home in Pembrokeshire is being recommended for closure, with the loss of nine jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Perrots Lodge in Haverfordwest provides respite for up to eight people, focusing on dementia care.
But due to a lack of demand, it is proposed that residents be accommodated in Pembrokeshire council's other care homes and by the independent sector.
A report to go before cabinet on 25 April recommends the council relinquish its lease.
Perrots Lodge opened in 2007 and is one of three care homes run by Pembrokeshire council.
A review found its residents could be better accommodated at Havenhurst in Milford Haven, where respite beds were underused.
There will also be extra capacity at Hillside in Goodwick once refurbishments are completed.
There are nine members of staff at Perrots Lodge, and if the decision is taken to close the home, the council said they will be supported to find other work.
