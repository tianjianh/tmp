Birmingham City: Striker Jack Storer signs new two-year deal with Blues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teenage Birmingham City striker Jack Storer has signed a new two-year contract with the Championship club after impressing in pre-season.

The 18-year-old, who initially signed in April on a six-month deal from League Two side Stevenage, has scored seven pre-season goals,
But four of those goals were in what were considered to be senior fixtures.
And, although he was originally brought in to supplement Blues' Under-21 squad, he is now signed up until 2018.
Blues have been in the market for a new striker, having so far been fended off by Dundee for target Greg Stewart and outbid for Sheffield United's Che Adams.
But boss Gary Rowett has now included 6ft 1in front man Storer in his first-team squad for 2016-17, and may even involve him in this Saturday's season opener at home to Cardiff City.
Having previously been in Blues' academy until Under-15 level, Storer became a Stevenage scholar in 2014, signing his first contract before making his one first-team appearance, as a late substitute in their 3-0 league defeat at Leyton Orient last August.
But he was brought back to St Andrew's near the end of last season for an undisclosed five-figure fee on the recommendation of Blues development squad coach Richard Beale.
And his two-goal show in Tuesday's 4-0 win at Aggborough, in which Andy Shinnie and James Vaughan also scored, capped an eye-catching pre-season.
