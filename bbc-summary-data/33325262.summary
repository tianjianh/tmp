Incontinence operations: Women reassured over safety

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Independent experts are reassuring women a common type of surgery for urinary incontinence is safe and effective.

The Scottish government had suggested hospitals consider a temporary suspension of the "mesh" procedure.
And several patients had said the implants had destroyed their quality of life and caused excruciating pain.
But Cochrane Collaboration scientists said their analysis of 81 studies found such problems were rare.
They said the procedure was generally safe in the short to medium term but admitted there was a lack of long-term data and said more figures were needed to be sure of safety beyond five years after surgery.
According to the group, some 14,000 procedures are carried out in England each year to treat stress incontinence - an involuntary leak of urine when pressure builds in the bladder - for example during coughing and sneezing.
About six million women suffer from this across the UK, many affected after childbirth.
The operation involves inserting a sling implant made of artificial mesh to support the muscles of the bladder.
But a growing number of problems reported by patients - such as the mesh eroding and damaging nearby tissues - led doctors to think again.
Hundreds of implant-related claims have been brought to the Scottish courts, with cases also seen in the US and Canada.
Meanwhile, figures from the UK regulator, the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), show there have been 124 adverse reactions reported about mesh implants since the beginning of this year.
And experts acknowledge this may not reveal the full extent of problem, as some women do not report the issues they face.
But the Cochrane group said its research showed the complication rate is low.
And the researchers said most people who had had the procedure felt their quality of life had improved.
They said women should be able to make an informed choice, taking all the risks into account.
But Kath Sansom, a freelance journalist who lives in Cambridgeshire, said she experienced almost constant burning pain after going through the procedure last year.
She told the BBC: "Pre-op I was a super-fit mum... now it's as though I am trapped in the body of an 80-year-old.
"I feel like I'm being cut with cheese wire.
"The operation has succeeded in so much as I'm not incontinent any more... but my quality of life has been destroyed."
And Kate Langley, a preschool play worker who lives near Eastbourne, Sussex, said she had been in and out of hospital since having the operation, with complications giving her crippling pain.
Ms Langley told the BBC: "I'm screaming sometimes I'm in so much pain... and financially we're in massive debt because I haven't been able to work."
She said it had also taken a toll on her marriage.
"It's hard if you don't really have a love life," she said.
Scottish ministers are awaiting the results of an inquiry likely to be published in the autumn and to include evidence gathered by the Cochrane group.
Most women are advised to try non-surgical therapy first, including pelvic floor exercises to strengthen key muscles. But if this fails, an operation is often the next option.
