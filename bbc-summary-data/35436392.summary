The Welsh government report highlighted progress the NHS has made in preventing and treating strokes.
But it also outlined areas for improvement, such as support for patients after they are discharged.
The director of the Stroke Association in Wales welcomed the report but said patient recovery required improvements.
According to the report, 2,317 people died from a stroke in Wales in 2014 compared to 3,158 in 2005 - a 26% fall and a reduction of 841 deaths.
Based on a three-year average, Wales has seen a fall of about 1,000 deaths per year between 2003-05 and 2012-14.
Key findings from the report, which covers 2015, included:
Dr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of NHS Wales, said:  "Our annual report shows that by focusing on a number of areas and through prevention, awareness-raising and education; effective and timely treatment; research and supporting those living and dying from a stroke, we are delivering quality care for people.
"We will continue to build on this progress."
Deputy health minister Vaughan Gething said the report showed stroke services across Wales "continue to improve".
Director of the Stroke Association in Wales, Ana Palazon, welcomed the advances made in emergency and acute care but said the story "is much broader than just that".
"While many people are surviving, they are also having to live with complex impairments and therefore many of the improvements that still remain to be made are across the therapies and the long-term support that stroke survivors require," she said.
"Many stroke survivors often say that even when they have had excellent hospital treatment, once they get home they feel abandoned."
