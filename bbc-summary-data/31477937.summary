The funeral took place at St Patrick's Church in Holywell, just outside the village of Belcoo.
Oisin, who was 13, died in hospital on Thursday after being injured in an incident at St Michael's College, Enniskillen, on Monday afternoon.
He had been on a life-support machine since the incident.
A 17-year-old boy, a sixth former at the school, was detained following the incident. He was later released on bail pending further inquiries.
Hundreds of schoolchildren lined the route of the funeral. Some of them wore GAA jerseys in tribute to the 13-year-old, who played Gaelic football in Belcoo.
Fr Seamus Quinn said Oisin was "a people person".
"He was quiet and easy to be with, with the kind of smile that drew the best out of you, whether you were young or old," he told mourners.
"While Oisin was a leader, he was not at all an egotist.  He wasn't in love with the position of leader and, in fact, Oisin would always take time and make place for people who might not have found it as easy to achieve as he did himself.
"He had the ability to found friendships with those who didn't share his own passions and interests."
Fr Quinn said that when the primary 7 pupils were leaving St Columban's Primary School they were asked to take a private empty page and write words to describe each other.
"These are the words that Oisin's classmates used to describe him as: 'Generous, helpful, giddy, funny, cool, good at football and music and a great friend'," he said.
Earlier this week, Fr Quinn said Oisin's organs are to be used to help five other people
On Friday evening, his body was brought back to his home village of Belcoo.
People lined the streets as the cortege slowly made its way through the village.
