Massive new spider with red fangs discovered in caves in Mexico

If you're scared of spiders, then you wouldn't want to meet this hairy creature in a dark place!

Researchers have discovered a new species of spider living in caves in Mexico.
They noticed its unusually large size and two terrifying red fangs - ewwwwww!
Our emoji face right now is definitely the monkey covering its eyes.
The spider was first spotted back in 2013 but it's taken four years for scientists to officially confirm it as a new species.
It's called the "Sierra Cacachilas wandering spider" and is in the same family as the much-feared, venomous Brazilian wandering spider.
Get this - the spider can grow up to 10cm in length.
Remind me not to go to a cave in Mexico any time soon!
