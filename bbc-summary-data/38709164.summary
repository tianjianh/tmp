Morison met Shane Ferguson's angled cross to shoot through the legs of substitute keeper Heurelho Gomes.
It was no more than Millwall deserved - they hit the bar through Lee Gregory after just 17 seconds and forced two fine saves from Gomes.
Watford, semi-finalists last season, managed just one shot on target.
Gomes, meanwhile, kept out volleys from both Gregory and Morison, before the latter landed the decisive blow.
FA Cup fifth round draw: BBC One on Monday from around 19:20 GMT
Millwall have now beaten two Premier League sides in this season's FA Cup, and this performance was every bit as impressive as the victory over Bournemouth three weeks ago.
With a league match against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium less than 54 hours after the end of this tie, Hornets boss Walter Mazzarri made seven changes to his team.
Not only did his fringe players fail to impress, he also lost goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, who was carried off on a stretcher in the first half after challenging Gregory.
The Hornets are still awaiting international clearance for forward M'Baye Niang, signed on loan from AC Milan, while Mauro Zarate is still suspended from his time at Fiorentina.
The sooner they are available the better as far as Mazzarri is concerned, with Watford, 14th in the table, left to focus on securing their top-flight status.
Reaching the fifth round of the FA Cup is nothing new to Millwall - they managed it as recently as 2013.
And there is a feeling the Lions are heading in the right direction this season under manager Neil Harris, a former Millwall striker.
The 39-year-old has assembled a group of hard-working and talented players who are challenging for a place in the League One play-offs.
Gregory, who was playing for non-league Halifax three seasons ago, could have taken home the match ball but for Gomes, while the cross from substitute Ferguson for the winner was exquisite.
Morison, in his second spell at Millwall, finished superbly to earn his side a richly deserved victory.
Millwall boss Neil Harris: "We were excellent. In the first half we were outstanding but I was starting to think 'will it come?' But we got that moment of magic and fortunately the experience shined.
"This club and team epitomise everything what the FA Cup is about. They are an honest bunch, organised and have quality."
Watford boss Walter Mazzarri: "I'm very disappointed and I am sorry for the fans. We put out the formation we thought was best considering that in two days' time we are playing against Arsenal.
"If the players have the fire I have inside of me at this moment then I'm sure we will react to this result. We need to be like warriors that fight for each ball."
Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright speaking on BBC One
"I don't understand why Watford rested all those players. I don't know what else they are playing for. Steve Morison was immense for Millwall. He epitomised everything Millwall were about."
