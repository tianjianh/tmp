Mum dumped newborn baby in Wigan hospital toilets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother has admitted abandoning her newborn baby in a bin in toilets at a hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool Crown Court heard the boy was found by a cleaner at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, Greater Manchester on 5 July.
His umbilical cord was cut and tissues had been stuffed into his mouth.
Orsolya-Anamaria Balogh, 27, of no fixed address, admitted attempted infanticide and was remanded in custody until sentencing on 16 January.
The court heard Balogh had gone to the hospital's accident and emergency department with her partner complaining of abdominal pain at about 19:40 BST but had told a triage nurse there was no possibility she could be pregnant.
Balogh spent some time in the toilet but left by 22:10 before the nurse was ready to see her at 22:20.
Richard Pratt QC, prosecuting, said at about 22:40 a cleaner noticed the bin felt heavy and heard muffled squeaking.
The cleaner opened the bin and discovered the newborn still in the foetal position.
Mr Pratt said: "The baby survived his ordeal with remarkable fortitude and, with medical intervention, was effectively unscathed by the circumstances of his birth."
Balogh and her partner initially denied she had given birth, but an examination by a midwife revealed she had, the court heard.
She then confirmed she had given birth in the toilet but said the baby had not been breathing and she thought he was dead.
She said she did not know she was pregnant, although police found internet searches on pregnancy and home birth on her computer.
The court heard reports by consultant psychiatrists found the balance of Balogh's mind had been disturbed after the birth.
Judge Neil Flewitt QC told her he hoped to make an order allowing her to be released into the community.
