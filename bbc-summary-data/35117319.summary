US and Cuba to resume regular commercial flights

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US and Cuba have reached an understanding on resuming regular commercial flights between the two countries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unnamed officials in Cuba and the US said an announcement was imminent.
It is unclear when the flights would start because negotiations between the Cuban government and the US airlines could take months.
The move is a significant step nearly a year after the former Cold War enemies began restoring diplomatic relations.
The US reopened its embassy in Havana in August after a 54-year absence.
Small charter flights have been running between New York and Havana for several months, but these flights can be complicated to book.
The understanding reached on Wednesday in Washington is a key development as Cuba and the US continue to negotiate over a number of issues which could ultimately see the US trade embargo lifted.
The announcement comes as travel between the US and Cuba has surged in recent months.
Thousands of Americans are visiting the island and hotels and hostels are booked for months.
