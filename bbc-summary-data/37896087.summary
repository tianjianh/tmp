The incident happened at about 18:00 on Sunday at the Gretna Green Woollen Mill.
PC Graeme McKirde said they were examining CCTV footage and carrying out door to door inquiries.
He said they also wanted to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious on Sunday evening.
"This has the hallmarks of a smash and grab type raid and those responsible seem to know what it is they were after," he added.
