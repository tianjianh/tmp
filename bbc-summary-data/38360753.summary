Peterborough United 1-1 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Baily Cargill grabbed his first Gillingham goal to earn his side a last-gasp leveller at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The on-loan Bournemouth defender hooked in a Scott Wagstaff cross in the second minute of stoppage time to ensure the spoils were shared at the ABAX Stadium.
The Gills had looked to be heading for defeat after substitute Lee Angol fired Posh ahead with 12 minutes to go.
The striker, who suffered a broken leg in pre-season, grabbed his first goal of the campaign with a classy follow-up finish after seeing his initial effort blocked by goalkeeper Stuart Nelson.
But that was not enough to secure a return to the top six for Posh after they were leapfrogged by Southend following Phil Brown's side's victory over AFC Wimbledon earlier in the day.
Posh paid the price for missing a series of gift-wrapped chances with striker Tom Nichols guilty on three occasions after Ryan Tafazolli had seen a free header blocked on the line by Paul Konchesky.
Gillingham's Bradley Dack and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas also saw good opportunities go begging before Cargill's late contribution earned a point.
