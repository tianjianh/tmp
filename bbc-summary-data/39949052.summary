[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincolnshire social worker 'struck off' over lies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A social worker who lied about visiting two children who were potentially at risk of harm has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trudy Taylor was employed as an agency social worker for Lincolnshire County Council until 2015.
A tribunal heard she was asked to visit a family where there had been an alleged domestic violence incident between the parents.
The Health and Care Professions Tribunal Service was told she never made the visits.

Social services were asked to make an assessment of the family in January 2015 after an incident between the parents, the tribunal heard.
Ms Taylor, who had been a social worker for 10 years, was assigned the case.
She recorded visiting the parents and the children at their schools, setting out statements allegedly made by the children and reporting on their demeanour.
In March 2015 the case was transferred to another social worker, witness 1, who visited the family.
He said the family had made it clear they had not been visited and he then contacted the children's school who also said they had no records of Ms Taylor seeing the children there.
He then informed his line manager, witness 2, who confronted Ms Taylor.
She said Ms Taylor said she could not remember the visits and described her as appearing flustered, going red and changing the subject.
Ms Taylor was suspended by her agency shortly afterwards.
She did not appear at the hearing on 8 May but had denied the allegations in an email in February 2016.
The panel determined the misconduct, "involving as it did the risk of harm to vulnerable children", meant the only sanction was to strike her name from the profession's register.
