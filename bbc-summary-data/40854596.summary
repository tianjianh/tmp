Britons Mark Cavendish and Geraint Thomas, European road race champion Alexander Kristoff and world time trial champion Tony Martin plan to race.
The Tour of Britain starts in Edinburgh on 3 September.
There are 20 teams in total taking part and a provisional list of all 120 riders will be released later in August.
"We are delighted with this year's line-up of teams and with riders of the calibre of Geraint Thomas, Mark Cavendish and Alexander Kristoff coming out to say they will be targeting the Tour of Britain, this bodes for a fantastic spectacle for fans," said race director Mick Bennett.
