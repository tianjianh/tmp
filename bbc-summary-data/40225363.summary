Costa, 28, was told by text message that boss Antonio Conte does not have him in his plans for next season.
He said: "I don't know about my future. I have a contract with Chelsea and they are the ones who know what they will do with me.
"I have to wait to see what decision my club makes."
Spain continue to lead Group G after the win in Skopje.
Manchester City midfielder David Silva opened the scoring for the fourth Spain game in a row when he finished Jordi Alba's cutback.
Costa doubled the lead when he tapped in Isco's cross.
Stefan Ristovski pulled one back for Macedonia when he drilled past David de Gea but Spain saw it out.
Spain top the group on goal difference after second-placed Italy beat Liechtenstein 5-0.
Only the group winners are guaranteed a place at next year's finals in Russia, meaning that one of the European giants are set to be in the play-offs.
