Toblerone row: Six snack shockers that got people rather cross

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Toblerone bars are changing shape and some fans aren't very happy about it!

Mondelez International, which makes the treat, has made the gap between the bar's famous chocolate mountain peaks slightly bigger.
This is to reduce the weight of the bar overall.
The company said that it either had to make the bar smaller or make the price higher, and it decided to change the shape.
There has been a mixed reaction to this decision.
Some think Mondelez should have made the chocolate bar shorter so the pieces would stay the same shape. Some think the price should have been increased and the length kept the same. Others think the company has done the right thing.
It's not the first time snacks have hit the headlines. Let's take a look at some other times sweet treats have left a sour taste in people's mouths!
Sometimes, it's not the shape of a snack that companies change, but the recipe instead.
Mars products were given a shake-up back in 2010 when the company decided reduce the amount of saturated fat in its sweet treats, including Mars and Snickers bars.
Many people said the new chocolate bars didn't taste as nice. However, given that they were healthier than the previous versions, there has been no move to switch back to the old recipe.
The favourite Easter treat caused a stir back in 2015 when it was announced the shell of the egg would no longer be made from Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate.
A new chocolate was chosen that contained less cocoa. At first many people didn't like the change, saying it didn't taste as good, but so far, the change has stuck!
Jaffa cakes have had people talking for a whole different reason. Are they biscuits or are they cakes?!
After the snack appeared as a challenge in Cake Week on the most recent series of the Great British Bake Off, many viewers started arguing all over again about what they really were.  But there is actually a serious reason that this matters - and it's all to do with tax.
The UK rules say that customers don't have to pay tax on products like bread, cakes, flapjacks and Jaffa Cakes. However, they do have to pay tax on certain kinds of biscuit and cereal bars.
So, we don't pay tax on Jaffa cakes at the moment. But if the people who argue that Jaffa cakes are biscuits are correct, then maybe we should!
Like with the Toblerone, back in 2012 it was decided that the Dairy Milk bar would be given a new look.
The edges of the chocolate bar were made smoother, which many people were not happy about at all - not least because it made the snack slightly smaller.
The famous chocolate bar had been the same shape ever since it first appeared on shop shelves in 1905! So far, the Dairy Milk has kept its new curves.
Not so much a scandal but more something that might make your stomach turn! Yes, you heard that flavour correctly.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, crisp makers started to experiment much more with weird and wacky flavours of crisps.
One manufacturer decided to make hedgehog-flavoured crisps, which did not go down well with animal lovers.
However, it turned out they were actually made from 'hedgerow' herbs - referring to 'hedge' in the name - and pork fat - which is the 'hog' part. So far, they haven't made a comeback!
Sometimes the scandal isn't that there's been a change - but that a company has stopped making a snack altogether!
This has happened with several products over the years, with many sweets and treats no longer appearing on shop shelves - usually because they didn't prove popular enough.
Cadbury's stopped making Wispas back in 2003 after sales fell in the 1990s. But then brought them back for a short period in 2007.
However, the public put so much pressure on Cadbury's to bring the chocolate bar back permanently that it did!
Cadbury spokesperson Tony Bilsborough said: "We brought it back temporarily to see if the desire was genuine, but fans are still rallying so we took the decision to bring it back for good."
Of course these aren't the only examples of snacks and treats that have got people talking after changing shape, recipes, price and availability over the years.
With costs of ingredients and people's tastes changing, many companies have had to tweak their products and will no doubt continue to do so.
But there are always going to be people who aren't happy about it!
