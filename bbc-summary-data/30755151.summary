[SN]TITLE[SN]
Girl who suffered fractured skull to be returned to parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A toddler taken into care by a council in Northamptonshire after suffering a skull fracture should be returned to her parents, a  judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judge Antony Hughes concluded that the little girl - who is approaching her second birthday - had suffered "nothing more" than an "unfortunate" accident.
He said the county council's conduct of the case had been "exemplary".
But he said social workers who raised concerns had not proved that the couple had failed to protect their daughter.
Family court Judge Hughes said both parents had a history of depression and had experienced marital problems.
But he said no other "healthcare or welfare concerns" had been noted.
Detail emerged in a written ruling by the judge following a family court hearing in Northampton.
Judge Hughes did not identify the family but said the local authority which had launched proceedings was Northamptonshire County Council.
The judge said the toddler was taken into temporary care after being hurt when she was about a year old.
He said her father thought she had been hurt when she fell from an ottoman and banged her head on a marble hearth, an explanation the judge said was "credible".
He said the little girl was "much loved and much wanted" and that "normality" should be restored.
