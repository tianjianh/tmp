[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every pregnant woman in Scotland is set to receive free vitamins, the Scottish government has pledged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some mothers-to-be are already being given the free supplements, but from next spring the entitlement will be universal.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said helping women "enjoy a healthy pregnancy" was key to supporting parents and children.
Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Catherine Calderwood, backed the move.
She said: "We understand the long term positive effects that good nutrition can have for pregnant women and offering these essential vitamins will help to improve the health of mothers, babies and children in Scotland."
Ms Sturgeon said there was "strong evidence" that taking vitamins in pregnancy improved both the mother and baby's health
She added: "Every child deserves a fair and equal chance and offering all pregnant women vitamins sends a strong signal that, right from the very start of life, we are doing all we can to help."
