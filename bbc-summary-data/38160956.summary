A company that converts schoolchildren's artwork into Christmas cards has gone out of business.

A statement on Schoolcardshop's website said its parent company, digital and personalised print supplier Dynamic Colour, was no longer trading.
In an email to customers, the Edinburgh-based firm said the news had come "as a shock to all of us".
"It is not about the money. It is the fact they have images our children took time to do," one mother told the BBC.
Meg Bennett, from Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, said she "had the foresight" to scan her six-year-old son's image of reindeer before submitting it to Schoolcardshop via his school.
But she said: "There's a group of us who have been chatting about this all day and I know other mums did not do that."
Schoolcardshop allows families to create and personalise cards, and schools retain a proportion of the money spent by families on the products.
Mrs Bennett said: "I just feel bad because our children's school are going to get a lot of flak for this."
No-one was available for comment at Dynamic Colour on Wednesday evening.
In an email received by customers, the "Schoolcardshop Team" apologised but said it would not be able to produce this year's products.
It said Dynamic Colour was its parent company but had ceased trading and was in the process of appointing a liquidator.
"This has come as a shock to all of us and we've been trying hard to bring operations to a clean conclusion...
"Unfortunately due to the situation we find ourselves in we are unable to continue in any form."
Other parents have also expressed their upset on Twitter, and are worried they may not get their money back.
It added: "We are all deeply upset to have to give you this news. We are sorry that all participating children and parents will not now receive their cards and gifts but the matter is completely out of our control."
One parent told the BBC: "My daughter's school was one of those that had signed up with this company to produce cards drawn by its pupils.
"We've already paid Â£12 for two packs that we won't now be receiving. Have been told we'll get our money back. I remain to be convinced."
Recent posts from the company's social media accounts mention the launch of an online store, while another tweet from the company's account on 11 November says what "a busy week" its team had.
