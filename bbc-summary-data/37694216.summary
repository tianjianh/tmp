Foley, 42, died suddenly in Paris on Saturday before the Irish province's scheduled game against Racing Metro.
A statement issued by Munster on Tuesday said the squad were "following a modified schedule this week".
Munster A's British and Irish Cup match away to Doncaster has been postponed.
The Munster management and squad gathered on Tuesday after spending much of Monday signing books of condolence at Thomond Park, Irish Independent Park and other locations across the province.
"The thoughts of Munster Rugby players, management and staff remain with the Foley and Hogan families and assisting them at this time continues to be the priority," read the statement.
Explaining the decision to call off the B&I Cup fixture against Doncaster Knights, Munster A head coach Peter Malone said: "With the Munster A squad featuring a number of senior players, planning for an away fixture would not be suitable at this point in time.
"We thank Doncaster Knights and the B&I Cup for facilitating our request in light of the exceptional circumstances."
