The Aspar Ducati rider from Toomebridge was unable to make up significant ground in the hot conditions in Italy after qualifying 16th.
After finishing lap one in 15th spot, Laverty, 30, moved up to 14th after Alex Lowes slid off but that was as high as the Northern Irishman got.
Dani Pedrosa earned his first win of the season after overhauling local hero Valentino Rossi with seven laps left.
Spaniard Pedrosa became the eighth different race winner this season as world champion Jorge Lorenzo completed the podium positions ahead of MotoGP series leader Marc Marquez.
Laverty, who will return to the World Superbike Championship in 2017, remains in 11th spot in the championship.
The Irishman's best finish this year is a fourth place in Argentina in early April.
Pedrosa started only eighth on the grid but the Honda rider produced a tactically flawless race to steadily move up to the front after Rossi had taken the lead from the second of the race's 28 laps.
Marquez, another Spaniard, retains the lead in the world championship standings on 223 points, with Rossi second on 180 ahead of Lorenzo (162) and Pedrosa (145).
