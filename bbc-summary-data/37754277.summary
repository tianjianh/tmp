Arsene Wenger says Arsenal have "a good chance" of winning the Premier League this season for the first time since they went unbeaten in 2004.

Speaking at the club's annual general meeting Wenger, 67, said that the title will be won with between 82 and 86 points this year.
He said: "Today we are in a much more competitive position to fight for the title than five or six years ago.
"I believe we have a competitive team in a very competitive league."
Arsenal are second after nine games, one of three teams on 20 points and only kept off top spot by goal difference.
Wenger says he thinks a further 62 points from their remaining 29 games could be enough for the title. Leicester won last season with 81.
"After nine games we have 20 points, which means the championship will be decided between 82 to 86 points," he said.
"I believe the team has the commitment, togetherness, hunger, desire and unity, and we have a good chance to compete for the Premier League.
"That is the target and I am absolutely committed to fulfilling it and giving my best so that we are successful until the end of the season."

Wenger celebrated his 20th anniversary in charge at the start of October, and his current contract expires at the end of the season.
The Frenchman would not be drawn on his future - apart from joking that he would not be in place for another 20 years - and chairman Sir Chips Keswick was equally non-committal.
"We all recognise the fantastic contribution Arsene has made to the club in the last 20 years," said Keswick.
"We are confident about his ability to take us forward.
"We will sit down and discuss the future at the appropriate time but our focus is on maintaining the current run and competing for trophies."
