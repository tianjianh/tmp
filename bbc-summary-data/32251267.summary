[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lloyd Byfield, 48, admitted stabbing 26-year-old Leighann Duffy after breaking into her Walthamstow home on Hatherley Road last September.
At the Old Bailey, Byfield was told he would serve a minimum of 26 and a half years in prison.
The court heard he had pursued a relationship with Ms Duffy before he smashed his way into her flat.
The six-year-old child who witnessed the assault suffered minor injures, but did not require hospital treatment.
Judge Nicholas Cooke told Byfield he may never be released.
