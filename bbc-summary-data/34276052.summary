The traditional sweets, made from flour, ghee and sugar, are often consumed at celebrations and festivals.
The significance of the weight of the sweet is as yet unknown.
The sweet was unveiled as part of a function by a sanitation company which is celebrating Mr Modi's birthday as "Swachhta Diwas" (Cleanliness Day).
This is however not the strangest birthday gift received by the Indian prime minister.
In 2013, before he became prime minister, Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat sang a sultry "happy birthday" to Mr Modi, Marilyn Monroe style.
