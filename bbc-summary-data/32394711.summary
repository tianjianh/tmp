Supermarket price labelling: Your photos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Supermarkets have been investigated by Which? because of "confusing or misleading" price labels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Readers have been sending in their stories and photos of supermarket price labels that have left them scratching their heads.
Mark in Burnley, Lancashire, emails: Tesco has a offer on PG Tips Strong teabags 80 pack for £2. Next to it is PG Tips Strong 160 pack for £5.74. Most would buy the 160 pack without looking. They do this all the time.
John Clegg emails: Buying washing powder from the Co-op for many years, it has been in a 2.4kg box costing just over £4. The box size has now been reduced to 1.6kg but the cost per 100g for the powder inside has increased dramatically and now costs 50% more per 100g.
Peter Allerhand emails: An example of misleading labelling can be found in Waitrose. Check Hellmann's mayonnaise against Waitrose own-brand Essentials mayo. On the comparison price tags, one tells you the price per 100ml and the other the price per 100mg. Is that the same thing? My maths isn't up to it. I asked the staff, and they looked totally blank.
Mike McAuley emails: I once bought a brand sauce at full price £1.67 from Asda. The same day I spotted the same sauce, same size etc for sale at half price in Tesco. The price at half price £1.69 - 2p more expensive. It was in a prominent position, so people were stocking up thinking it was a good deal.
Jonny emails: I work in a supermarket and the practice there is to list the price per unit/kg/1000g etc for the full price, but where there is a two for £x or other multi-buy, the price per for that offer isn't listed, making it more difficult for customers to work out how good a deal is or whether they are saving just 5p.
Angela Wilson, in London, emails: In relation to pricing tactics, yesterday I had to draw an issue to the attention of staff at my Sainsbury's local in Brixton. Sainsbury's own dishwasher tablets are advertised on the pricing ticket as 30 tablets for £4.40, 14.66p per tablet. Packs of the tablets are above the ticket with only 20 tablets. I asked a member of staff whether the packs of 20 are cheaper, and after a price check discovered they were still £4.40. Presumably the 30 pack has been reduced to a 20 pack and the price has been kept the same, but the mislabelling makes it appear that you would get the 20 pack for less. The pricing ticket was removed when I highlighted the issue.
Phil in Reading emails: A couple of months ago I was in a local Morrisons and there were some 'luxury' sausages on sale.  There was a deal (2 for £5), which seemed reasonable, but the items I wanted, without the deal, would have only cost £4 (well, £3.98), so I couldn't actually buy two packets without spending £1 more than they actually cost!
