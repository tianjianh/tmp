Signal failure disrupts Southampton train services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail passengers going through part of Southampton faced major delays after signalling problems on the line.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South West Trains said the issue meant trains were unable to stop at Redbridge and Millbrook stations.
It affected services between Brockenhurst, Salisbury and Southampton, and Salisbury and Romsey, with shuttle buses brought in to replace trains.
The problem has now been resolved and trains are running normally again.
