The photographs on display include a selection of winning entries from the 2016 competition.
Entrants from more than 120 countries entered the competition and photographers from 21 countries featured among the winners.
Martin Green, chief executive and director of Hull UK City of Culture 2017, said: "Our Roots and Routes season is all about celebrating Hull's global connections and its place in the wider world.
"This exhibition will give people in Hull the opportunity to see unique images of some of the planet's most famous and recognisable places along with exposing them to some far-flung and unfamiliar locations and sights."
The photographs will remain on show until 30 June.
