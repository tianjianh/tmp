Premier League & FA Cup predictions: Lawro v boxer Carl Frampton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures and FA Cup quarter-final ties is boxer Carl Frampton.
The 29-year-old IBF and WBA super-bantamweight champion is looking forward to cheering on Northern Ireland at Euro 2016 this summer.
"I might be in a training camp, but I am hoping to get out to at least one game because it is something not to be missed - it will be something to tell the grandkids about," Frampton told BBC Sport.
"It's amazing for us as such a small nation to qualify, and top our group as well. We've been put in a pretty difficult group in the finals with Germany, Poland and Ukraine, but it would not surprise me if we can get out of that one as well."
*Away team to win replay
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
From last weekend's Premier League games, Lawro got four correct results from 10 games, with no perfect scores.
Lawro's score of 40 points saw him draw with American hip hop artist Fatman Scoop, who also picked four correct results with no perfect scores, but he was beaten by 1Xtra DJ Nick Bright, who picked five correct results, including two perfect scores for a total of 110, that puts him joint top of the guest leaderboard.

Match report
Arsenal were slightly flattered by the 4-0 scoreline in their fifth-round replay win at Hull on Tuesday.

The Gunners also have a few injury problems to deal with and they will be up against a Watford side that are just going to go for it in this tie.
Watford played well in an open game against Leicester last weekend but were beaten by a quality goal, and they will not go down without a fight at Emirates Stadium.
This has become a big competition for Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, again.
He has been getting some stick from a few fans and he probably needs to win the FA Cup for a third straight year just to shut some of them up.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Frampton's prediction: Watford centre-half Craig Cathcart went to the same school as me - Glengormley High School. He was a good player then - he was third-year when I was fifth-year and there was talk of him playing in our fifth-year team, but it never materialised, which is a shame because we were terrible and could have done with him. 3-1
Match preview
This is going to be a tough one for Manchester United because West Ham are on a roll at the moment.

The Hammers do not let teams bully them away from home and they are great at coming from behind in games. They can take the tie back to Upton Park - and I fancy them to win it there.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1 (West Ham to win the replay)
Frampton's prediction: 1-2
Match preview
As soon as Aston Villa conceded their first goal against Manchester City last weekend, they were finished.
I was at Eithad Stadium for that game and the worst thing about it for me was that Villa only started to play a bit when they were 4-0 down.

I feel a bit sorry for Villa boss Remi Garde, because this is not his team - he was not able or allowed to buy a player in January. They are going down, and it is not even with a whimper.
Tottenham were given a bit of a reminder of how tough the Premier League can be by 10-man Arsenal last time out, but this is the perfect fixture for them to get back to winning ways.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Frampton's prediction: 0-3
Match preview
As things stand, Steve McClaren is still in charge of Newcastle but we don't know if there will be a new man in the dug-out by the time this game kicks off.
Whoever the Magpies manager is, they face a very tough task on Monday.
Leicester have got an air about them that says they think they can win the league. They have continued to pick up points without playing well and results have been going their way, which will help convince their players they can do it.

I want them to win it too - they have played the best football and they have tried to win every game, even when they have been behind - and they are destined to be champions.
It would be great if they won it by something like six points so people cannot say they have nicked it, but those who say this is the biggest turnaround by a team in the space of a year are wrong.
The best achievement like that was when Nottingham Forest won the title as a newly promoted team in 1978. That usurps Leicester, but only just.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Frampton's prediction: 2-0
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
*Does not include score for postponed games
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)
