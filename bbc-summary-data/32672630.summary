Egypt's Hosni Mubarak jailed in corruption retrial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been sentenced to three years in jail on corruption charges after a retrial in the capital, Cairo.

His sons were given four years each in the same case which centres on the embezzlement of $14m (Â£9.3m) earmarked for renovation of presidential palaces.
The original conviction was overturned on 13 January over legal procedures.
This was the last court case hanging over Mubarak, who was toppled in the  2011 uprising.
Hosni Mubarak and his sons - Alaa and Gamal - were also fined for the amount embezzled and used to renovate their private residences in Cairo and on the Red Sea coast, as well as a family farm.
The former leader, 87, and his sons were present in the courtroom at a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo.
Some of his supporters wore T-shirts with Mubarak's face and waved and blew kisses as he entered, the Associated Press news agency says.
They shouted in anger as the judge issued the ruling - which can be appealed against.
It is not clear whether the time the veteran former leader has already served will count - or whether he will be sent to jail again.
Egypt's highest court is also due to decide on 4 June whether to allow an appeal against a lower court's ruling that dropped murder charges against Mubarak.
The ex-leader remains at Maadi Military Hospital in Cairo.
