[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The staff member suffered a facial injury and was "badly shaken up" after the armed robbery at the Freshway General Store in Rufford Road, Southport, at about 07:30 BST.
The men left with cash and cigarettes, Merseyside Police said.
Officers said both men wore dark North Face hooded tops and had green scarves covering their faces.
Det Insp Steve Reardon said: "This was a particularly nasty robbery.
"The shop assistant was simply going about their business and thankfully is not badly hurt but it is vital that we catch the people responsible and bring them to justice."
