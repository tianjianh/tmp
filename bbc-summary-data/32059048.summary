Zayn Malik's quit - how successful will One Direction be now?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zayn Malik has decided to leave One Direction after five years with the band.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a statement he says: "I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight."
Harry, Louis, Liam and Niall have said they'll continue touring as a four-piece and will record a new album.
It's not the first time a group has opted to carry on after a member has left the band.
Geri Halliwell left The Spice Girls in the middle of their world tour in 1998.
Baby, Posh, Sport and Scary continued with their North American tour and released another album after Ginger went solo.
They had two number one singles after Geri's departure, before each went their separate ways in 2000.
All five girls reunited in 2007 for a Spice Girls world tour and performed at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic games.
Robbie Williams left Take That in 1995. It's never been made clear whether he was pushed out or left because he wanted to.
The band continued without Robbie for another year before they announced they were disbanding.
Following that announcement the Samaritans set up a special helpline to help fans come to terms with the fact Take That were no more.
In 2005 the four-piece reunited and went from strength to strength.
Robbie rejoined the group in 2010 but left again in 2014, along with Jason Orange.
In 2005 the Pussycat Dolls released their debut album with singles Don't Cha, Stickwitu, Beep, Buttons, I Don't Need A Man, Wait A Minute and Sway.
Carmit (the redhead) left the group after the first album, saying they used to argue about where to go for dinner, but nobody really noticed.
They released their second album Doll Domination as a quintet. It did alright, but then things all went a bit sour.
The others thought Nicole was getting too much attention so Jessica left the group and then Ashley did followed by Kimberly and Melody.
Before Beyonce was Mrs Carter she was in Destiny's Child and their line-up changed quite a bit.
The most-famous line-up was Kelly, Beyonce and Michelle and they once came into the Radio 1 studios and met Scott Mills.
Before all that though LaTavia Roberson, LeToya Luckett, Farrah Franklin (who?) had all at one point asked people to "say their name".
Destiny's Child didn't do bad, despite losing three members over the years. They ended up selling more than 60 million records worldwide.
