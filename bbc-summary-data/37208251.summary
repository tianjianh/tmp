New homes are expected to be built on the site of a former 1970s town centre library, a council has said.

Slough's central library was considered state-of-the-art when it was built but closed earlier this month as part of a redevelopment scheme.
Planning permission was agreed for two hotels to be built at the site earlier this year.
The borough council has recommended 60 apartments are also developed.
"Constructing the new developments will improve local temporary employment opportunities... as well as increasing apprenticeship opportunities enabling local people to improve their learning and skill base," Slough Borough Council said.
Thousands of books have been moved to a new library in The Curve development nearby, which opens on Friday.
The hotels, along with a restaurant, form part of the Heart of Slough project which has also provided a new bus station, cultural centre and office developments.
A decision on the new homes is expected to be made at a special cabinet meeting on 5 September.
