The cuts will fall among assistant store managers in its larger stores.
The retailer said it was "beginning formal consultations" with the people affected.
It will also be transferring 400 staff to the contact centre management company Teleperformance, although they will continue to work at the Boots UK site in Nottingham.
Boots is part of the US group Walgreens Boots Alliance. It has 2,510 stores in the UK.
These cuts are in addition to 700 jobs cuts that were announced last year as part of a three-year strategy to simplify its business and focus on higher growth areas, such as digital sales.
Simon Roberts, President of Boots, said: "We are actively working to make sure our people are rewarded for the great work they continue to do.
"I believe our plans will enable us to build an even better Boots and drive future growth."
