[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 1-2 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Holroyd helped to sink Aldershot with a handy brace in Macclesfield's 2-1 win at the Recreation Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Silkmen curtailed a run of six without a win, as striker Holroyd glanced in his sixth goal of the season to put them into an early lead.
He doubled his tally early in the second half as the home defence failed to stop Danny Rowe's run down the left, and a wicked cross was safely dispatched.
Aldershot netted a consolation with 20 minutes remaining. Two defenders combined as Will Evans went forward to get on the end of a Nick Arnold free-kick and slide the ball past Craig Ross.
