[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man faces trial over armoured vehicle incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 68-year-old man is to face trial accused of driving dangerously in an armoured personnel carrier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Shepherd, of Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, is alleged to have failed to keep his 1954 Alvis Saracen vehicle under control in August 2015.
He is accused of allowing the vehicle on to the opposite carriageway of the B908 road near Alva, narrowly avoiding a collision.
Mr Shepherd pleaded not guilty to the charge at Alloa Sheriff Court.
It is alleged that he failed to stop the six-wheeled tank-like vehicle as it approached the River Devon road bridge in Clackmannanshire, in order to allow another vehicle on the bridge to cross over.
Mr Shepherd's solicitor, Mike Lowrie, asked for more time to prepare the defence case.
He said he had encountered "some difficulty finding an expert with some knowledge of the type of vehicle" to give evidence in Mr Shepherd's defence.
Sheriff Gillian Wade set the trial for 5 July.
The Saracen can carry a squad of eight soldiers plus a troop commander.
It was first built in 1952 for the Malayan Emergency and has a top speed of 45 miles per hour.
