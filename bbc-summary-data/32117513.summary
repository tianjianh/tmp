[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A popular bus service which was scrapped last year has returned for the summer months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cardi Bach, which linked coastal towns and villages between New Quay and Cardigan, ceased running in September 2014.
Ceredigion council, which ran the service, said at the time it was not "self-sustaining".
But it relaunched on Sunday, backed by Welsh Government funding, and will run six days a week during the summer.
Last year's closure of the service was greeted with disappointment from businesses and local councillors along the coastal path with a petition against its demise submitted to the Welsh government.
But Ceredigion council said it had since worked with a campaign group in order secure funding from Cardiff Bay until March, 2016.
It will also allow the council to run a reduced service during the winter.
The new service, running as the 522, will also operate on Thursdays throughout the year to a number of villages along the route.
