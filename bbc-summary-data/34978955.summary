The British men took the lead three times - through Phil Roper, Alastair Brogdon and Alan Forsyth - and each time they were pegged back.
Nevertheless, they top Pool A thanks to good wins against Canada and the world champions Australia.
On Thursday, Britain play the hosts India, who came bottom of pool B after two defeats and a draw.
"We're a bit disappointed we didn't play better but Belgium are a really strong side," Great Britain captain Dan Fox told BBC Sport.
"But, actually, we got the point we needed to top the group and we'll take it from there on Thursday."
India now stand between a much-changed Great Britain squad and their pre-tournament aim of reaching the semi-finals.
"They play really attacking hockey, they've got a lot of skilful players, and what we'll look to do is take the game to them," added Fox.
"The crowd will also be right behind them, so it'll be tough."
