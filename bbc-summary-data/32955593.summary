Neighbourhood police, who were already at the community event at the Bangladeshi Centre in Roundhay Road, came under attack as chairs were thrown and six people hurt.
Further officers had to be called in to deal with the incident at 12:30 BST on Saturday.
The arrests were made for public order and assaults offences, police said.
None of the wounded people suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ch Insp Nik Adams said:  "A small number of neighbourhood PCs and PCSOs supporting a community event have been faced with a violent incident involving large numbers of people during which they themselves have come under attack.
"They have quickly called in further officers to assist and within minutes brought the incident under control."
