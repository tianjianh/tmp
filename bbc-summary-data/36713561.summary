Crewe Alexandra have made their second signing of the summer by bringing in much-travelled striker Chris Dagnall.

The 30-year-old will form a new strike partnership with 37-year-old veteran Ryan Lowe, who returned to the club for a third time earlier this summer.
"We're getting another forward with a proven record, who has scored at this level and above," Crewe boss Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Him and Lowey will have scored more than 320 goals between them."
Dagnall, who began his career at Tranmere Rovers, has also played for Rochdale, Scunthorpe United, Barnsley and Leyton Orient.
Dagnall left Orient to play in the Indian Super League for Kerala Blasters, deep in the south of India, before finishing last season in Scotland in Edinburgh at Hibernian, where he failed to score in 15 appearances, mostly from the bench.
His Football League career has so far brought him 98 goals in 396 appearances, almost a quarter of which have been as a substitute.
Having let 11 players go at the end of last season after his predominantly young side's relegation back to League Two, Crewe boss Davis emphasised the need to bring in more experience at Gresty Road.
He has so far brought in just Lowe and Dagnall, as well as extending 29-year-old former Leicester City defender Zoumana Bakayogo's contract.
"We lost out on a midfield player," added Davis. "He has signed for a League One club. That happens. It wasn't as much a financial decision with this one, more the fact that he has been promised game time in League One."
