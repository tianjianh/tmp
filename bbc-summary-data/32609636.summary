Business units and a restaurant could also be created and the site's engine sheds could be restored to show visitors how they once worked.
Work to stabilise at-risk buildings and clear the site near Swansea City's stadium has already begun.
The copper works was once largest in the world but closed in the 1980s.
Once up and running, the site could run metalwork demonstrations and water activities and a pontoon could also provide mooring for Swansea's community boat Copper Jack.
Access for visitors has already been improved and new pathways, an audio visual trail and information panels have been added.
The project is being led by Swansea council and Swansea University.
