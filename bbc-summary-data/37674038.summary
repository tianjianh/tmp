Scarlets beat Sale 28-11 in Phillips' return to Wales while Sale face the 2014-15 champions at home on Friday.
"We weren't there at all [at Scarlets], but we play against Toulon and that's a massive fixture for us," Phillips said.
"There were some positives and if we take that into next week, we've a good home record so maybe we can do well."
Phillips signed for Sale in summer 2016 following a five-year spell playing domestic rugby in France with Bayonne and Racing 92 and knows Sale's next opponents well.
"Toulon are a great team, they've got stars and it's a great test for us really," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"It's a chance for us to show what we can do and hopefully we can play a bit better than against Scarlets."
After half a decade playing rugby outside of Britain, Phillips is pleased to return and is enjoying his time in the English Premiership.
"I love the club and the boys have been great. I've been settling really well, there's friendly people and it's a great place to live so I've been enjoying that aspect of it and hopefully we can be successful on the field and that will make life much easier," he continued.
"Every game is tough [in the Premiership]. Every team is stacked with stars and really physical and it's a great league to be in to test yourself. I've enjoyed it so far and hopefully we can be successful and win our home games and see what we can do."
