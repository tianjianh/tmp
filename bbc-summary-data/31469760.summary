QPR owner Tony Fernandes has revealed that Chris Ramsey will be given the chance to remain as manager of the club for "a very long time".

Ramsey, 52, was appointed boss until the end of the season on Friday.
But Fernandes has now said Ramsey may remain in charge for longer.
"Chris has an opportunity to be at the club for a very long time," tweeted Fernandes. "There are no guarantees but he has every chance to build a huge managerial future. We are lucky."
Ramsey had initially been in temporary charge at Loftus Road with director of football Les Ferdinand after Harry Redknapp quit to have knee surgery.
Earlier in the week, former QPR striker Kevin Gallen told the BBC that Fernandes had been made to look foolish after publicly claiming he had found a "dream manager" to replace Harry Redknapp.
"It is obvious that manager wasn't Chris Ramsey," Gallen told Radio 5live.
But Fernandes has now clarified his position, tweeting: "We found a great guy to manage us from next season, a dream manager. But actually we had a dream candidate right in front of us in Chris Ramsey."
Brought to QPR in October 2014, Ramsey will work alongside first-team coach Kevin Bond and goalkeeping coach Kevin Hitchcock, with Ferdinand 'overseeing the trio' and helping with training.
