One of India's oldest newspapers has not been printed for the first time in 137 years due to rains and floods in the southern city of Chennai (Madras).

The Hindu, published daily since 1878, did not come out on Wednesday as workers could not access the press.
The paper's publisher N Murali told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that it was the first time this had happened.
The rains have suspended flights and trains and hundreds of people are without power.
The Hindu, which is headquartered in Chennai, is also published in 17 other cities.
"Our Maraimalainagar township was not accessible for the people who run the plant. So, none of our staff could reach the plant. It is located about 30km (18 miles) from the city in Maraimalainagar," Mr Murali said.
"The printing press plant is large so we put it up outside the city. Even if we had printed the paper, I doubt if it could have been distributed in the city," he added.
Other city newspapers like the Times of India, the Deccan Chronicle and the New Indian Express were printed, although it is unclear if they had reached readers in the city.
The army has been deployed to rescue thousands of stranded people after two days of heavy rains.
Flights from the city's airport have been indefinitely suspended after flood waters entered the runway and tarmac areas on Tuesday evening.
Most of the main streets are waterlogged and schools have been shut for the 17th day since November, reports say.
Schools and colleges have been shut in six districts due to the rains.
