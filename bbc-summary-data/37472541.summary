[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 51-year-old is the first managerial departure in the Premier League and English Football League this season.
Orient are 14th in the table after suffering back-to-back defeats, having won three of their nine league games.
Hessenthaler signed a one-year deal in the summer after taking charge for the final five games of last season.
Former Dover and Gillingham boss Hessenthaler was the seventh Orient manager since Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti bought the east London club in the summer of 2014.
The O's finished eighth last season, just six points outside the play-off places.
Hessenthaler was previously assistant to Ian Hendon and then Kevin Nolan at the Matchroom Stadium, and was initially appointed on a caretaker basis in April after former West Ham midfielder Nolan departed.
Assistant manager Andy Edwards, 45, will take charge of the side for Tuesday's home match against Plymouth Argyle.
