Richard Arkless MP marks 100 days at Westminster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A year ago, Richard Arkless was a businessman, lawyer and father of two living a normal life in a quiet corner of south-west Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Today he is an SNP MP, representing more than 75,000 constituents of Dumfries and Galloway, the region in which he was born and raised.
It has been a major turnaround for the man who voted 'no' to devolution in 1997.
By the time the referendum came round last year, he had become a vocal supporter of independence.
He frequently shared a platform with SNP politicians at local debates but it wasn't until after the vote that he joined the party.
Now he is at Westminster, he insists his first loyalty is to the people of Dumfries and Galloway - not the SNP.
"If their interest conflicts with my party's interest, I will side with the people who put me in this position, there's no question about that," he said.
"I'm passionate about the area, it feels as if sometimes we are the forgotten region in the forgotten corner of the United Kingdom and I want that to change and I want to headline that being changed over the next few years."
To some in the south of Scotland, the SNP is responsible for centralising services to the central belt.
With the formation of Police Scotland, the Dumfries control room was one of several across the country that closed, leading to fears of a lack of local knowledge amongst emergency call handlers.
Did Mr Arkless agree with that decision?
"I didn't know a great deal about it at the time," he said. "I wasn't a politician, I was working as a lawyer.
"Naturally, it doesn't sit comfortably with me but I do understand it was a recommendation made by Police Scotland in the overall scheme of things with the cuts they had to face."
His first 100 days in office have not been without incident.
In July, Scottish Secretary David Mundell made a controversial visit to a food bank in Mr Arkless's constituency.
Shortly afterwards the SNP politician lodged a complaint to the Speaker and Cabinet Office, claiming Mr Mundell did not give him "proper notice" that he would be performing a public engagement on his patch.
Despite that, Mr Arkless insists the pair have a "excellent" working relationship as neighbouring MPs.
He said: "I've been to the Scotland Office to see David three or four times since I've been elected, since this kicked off three or four weeks ago.
"And we agreed very rationally that of course there will be times when David and I disagree profusely. I think it would be strange if we didn't.
"But we are neighbouring MPs and we have lots of mutual interests and I have committed, and he has committed very kindly, to working together on those mutual interests regardless of what our political differences may be."
He said they had already held talks on the possibility of a Borderlands "enterprise zone" encapsulating parts of Dumfries and Galloway.
It is one a series of "meaty" projects Mr Arkless hopes to get his teeth into once he has staff and offices in place to assist his new role.
He has held talks with developers about an "extremely exciting" top secret project between Heathhall and Locharbriggs in Dumfries, and is also hoping to see progress on the Stranraer regeneration project.
"There is a disconnect in Stranraer between the plans that are happening and what the public understands it to be," he said.
"So I'm going to try as hard as I can to act as a conduit over the next few months so at least the community of Stranraer feels ownership and can have a say in what's going on in that particular development."
In addition, he plans to meet representatives of Ofcom and internet providers to try to speed up the extension of fibre optic broadband into rural areas and fix a number of 4G blackspots.
He singled out Moniave as a village "full or artists and musicians" which does not benefit from a good internet connection.
"There's a whole range of places across the constituency that are absolutely bustling with energy and enthusiasm and until they can get digital connections they are really hamstrung," he said.
He said the highlights of his political career have included using the power of the SNP group against the Conservative government.
He said: "We've managed to make the government think again on human rights. We managed to make them commit that they won't hold the EU referendum on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections.
"And we've also managed to make them backtrack on amending the Hunting Act, which we thought was a bit of an achievement."
However, it is the work that he has put in to helping constituents that has really stood out for him.
"The real joy of the job so far has been back at home in the constituency for the last few weeks and going to meet so many individual constituents that need your help, so many businesses, organisations that want you to lend a hand," he said.
"It's the humility in that you're in a position now where you can exercise influence and people realise this. Often just listening to them and hearing what they've got to say, and saying that you'll do something, meets with this enormous gratitude that is extremely humbling."
It has led to him committing to giving away about Â£350 a month - his controversial MP's pay rise - to the most needy in the region.
"It's become clear to me... that I need to use this position as much as I possibly can to help the people who live and work here," he said.
