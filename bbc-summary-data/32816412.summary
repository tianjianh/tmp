[SN]TITLE[SN]
What was on Osama Bin Laden's bookshelf?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Osama Bin Laden was a fan of 9/11 conspiracy theories, according to a newly released list of English language books found in his Pakistan hideout.

The list was among documents belonging to the former al-Qaeda chief published by the US government this week.
Among tomes on law and military strategy are books claiming the US was complicit in the 9/11 attacks.
The release comes shortly after the fourth anniversary of Bin Laden's death at the hands of US special forces.
The list of English-language books - which were all digital copies rather than printed editions - reads like a university reading list, largely made up of serious texts on international relations, politics and law.
A sizable collection of manuals for computer programs, printers and virus protection software paint a picture of the more banal side of life as the world's most wanted man.
Bin Laden also owned books by famed Watergate scandal reporter Bob Woodward and US academic Noam Chomsky.
And his interest in conspiracy theories was not confined to 9/11 - there were also books on the kinds of powerful shadowy elites obsessed over by conspiracy theorists, including the "Illuminati" and "Committee of 300".
More mainstream titles on international terrorism also featured heavily in his reading material, as did US foreign policy reports.
Among the more surprising texts, for its apparent simplicity, is A Brief Guide to Understanding Islam by IA Ibrahim.
Another title that stands out is Grappler's Guide to Sports Nutrition by John Berardi and Michael Fry - although it is listed by the US government as "probably used by other compound residents".
The texts suspected of belonging to other residents also include the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records, Children's Edition and Is It the Heart You Are Asking? - a suicide prevention guide.
And ominously, the compound contained a guide to the American special forces video game Delta Force Extreme 2.
Bin Laden was particularly interested in France, it seems, with a large number of texts about the country on various subjects, including culture, economics and wage inequality.
Reports on France's radioactive waste management and shipping companies hint at Bin Laden's terror activities.
Bin Laden was killed by US special forces on 2 May 2011 in a daring helicopter raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
Pakistan had no prior knowledge of the raid, the White House says, and its security services did not know Bin Laden was there.
