The 44-year-old, who takes charge of a record 71st test match on Saturday, has been awarded an MBE for services to sport.
He said he was "very humbled and honoured" and he "would never have a year like this again".
This year's Birthday Honours coincide with the Queen's official 90th birthday.
Owens, from Mynyddcerrig, Carmarthenshire, began officiating as a teenager and quickly progressed to be a professional referee.
He made his Rugby World Cup debut in France in 2007 and took charge of the 2015 Rugby World Cup final.
The same year he was awarded the title of World Rugby's referee of the year.
Off the pitch, he is patron of the Bullies Out charity in Wales.
Speaking to BBC Wales from Fiji, he said the MBE was a "real privilege."
A volunteer who has dedicated her life to palliative care is among the other recipients.
Helen Murray from Dunvant, Swansea, has received an MBE.
She has been involved with Ty Olwen Hospice in Morriston Hospital for 40 years and chairs the Ty Olwen Trust.
"It's great to know the work I do with a fantastic team has made a difference to people," she said.
"I am now more determined to continue to drive palliative care forward so it is accessible for people who need it. I want people to know that a diagnosis is not the end.
"When someone comes up and thanks you - it makes it all worthwhile," she added.
Christopher Williams from Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire, has been awarded a British Empire Medal for services to the Royal Mail and fundraising.
Nicknamed 'smiler', he is one of the longest serving employees at the Tenby delivery office and is a founder member of the Saundersfoot New Year's Day Swim, which has raised more than Â£500,000 for various charities since 1984.
"I am over the moon," he said.
"I've been with the Royal Mail for 21 years and deliver to my home village so I get to see friends and family all day long.
"I'm heavily involved in the swim and am one of only two people who hasn't missed a swim since it started.
"It really brings the community together, with a carnival atmosphere."
The vice-chairman of the National Botanic Garden of Wales board of trustees, John Gwyndaf Ellis, has been awarded an OBE.
The 77-year-old, from Llanddarog, near Carmarthen, has been at the garden for more than 20 years and became a trustee in 1995 - four years before it opened.
"This is a very proud day for me. And a special one for the Botanic Garden, too.
"I very strongly believe that the garden is a product of devolution and the mark of mature nationhood and of a civilised society."
Lifeboat crew member Aileen Jones from Porthcawl, Bridgend county, has been recognised for her years of bravery with an MBE.
She was the first female crew member to receive a gallantry award, one of the RNLI's first female helms and the first female crew member at Porthcawl Lifeboat Station.
As a volunteer, she has completely immersed herself in supporting every aspect of the station - one of the busiest in Wales - for the past 21 years.
"I had a letter from the Cabinet Office and thought 'oh no, what have I done?' When I saw what it was, it was a huge surprise.
"I wouldn't have got this award without the support of the crew over all the years."
