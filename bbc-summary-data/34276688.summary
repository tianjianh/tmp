Officers have appealed for a man known as Alan to come forward as they believe he could have spoken to the attacker before the "prolonged" assault.
The attack, on a woman in her 20s, happened in Turriff Place, Kirkcaldy, at about 22:30 on Sunday.
The woman was first spoken to by the man in Aboyne Gardens.
Police said he mentioned being at a friend named Alan's house in the area of Harris Drive earlier in the evening.
Det Sgt Calum Lawrie said: "We believe 'Alan' is a significant witness in this inquiry, and are keen to speak to him as soon as possible.
"I want to reassure 'Alan' that any information he can give will be treated in the utmost confidence, but could be crucial in identifying the man responsible for this sexual assault.
"We are continuing to support the victim as she recovers from her ordeal, and high visibility patrols continue in the area."
The attacker was described as being 5ft 7ins tall and aged about 30. He was wearing a dark jacket with light jeans and trainers.
