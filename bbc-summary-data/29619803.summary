It's many people's dream to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

Fame and wealth come hand-in-hand when you become the next huge thing in the tech world - and the Duke of York has teamed up with will.i.am to help to develop some of those new big names.
Prince Andrew's answer on how you search for them: "Simple. You don't go looking for them."
Instead iDEA, the scheme he is chairing, looks to create the right environments to nurture young talent.
iDEA, which also features will.i.am on its board of supporters, plans to help thousands of young people develop the skills they need to turn their ideas into digital businesses.
Launched today, the scheme offers participants the chance to earn "badges" endorsed by industry experts, in skills like coding and digital creativity.
According to the iDEA website, these badges are "an effective way to showcase your achievements online" and are recognised by employers and teachers.
There is also a competition to give financial backing to some of the best business plans the scheme receives.
"Nobody went and sought Steve Jobs. Nobody went and sought out a Mark Zuckerberg," he told Newsbeat.
"They just appeared because they were doing something clever. Well, let's create those conditions for young people.
"Let's give them the skills. Let's give them the opportunities so that they can do it themselves."
At first glance, Prince Andrew and will.i.am don't necessarily seem the obvious pairing - but the Duke of York said he invited the musician to join the initiative because of his passion for helping entrepreneurs in technology.
"I was fascinated by what he's achieved," said Prince Andrew.
"He [will.i.am] is a major inspiration to a lot of young people from all sorts of different backgrounds."
The Duke of York added: "He is incredibly focused on what it is that it will take to inspire young people and I've seen him do it and it takes about a sentence from him to change somebody's life."
He also spoke about people wanting to take selfies with the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family, when they make public appearances.
"One finds that if you're walking along a crowd of people, you're faced with an iPad, not a face.
"But it's a live event. Why do you need to film a live event?"
He explained how difficult it was to engage with the public, when they are holding screens up in front of their faces.
He added: "It's disconcerting, not rude or anything, just disconcerting that this is the new reality."
Prince Andrew said his youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, had introduced him to will.i.am's music.
"No, I have not been to his studio, I have not jammed with him, not yet anyway," the Duke of York joked.
"I don't play an instrument so I would be absolutely useless but it would be fascinating to see how he does that process."
He added: "I have a very eclectic music listening habit.
"I do have classical and I do have, as it were, more modern music. I listen to it sometimes in the car but mostly when I'm doing exercise like everybody else."
The Duke of York said he believes the roles and responsibilities of the Royal Family haven't changed that much over the years.
"We're still recognising success, aggregating ideas, challenging the status quo and encouraging young people," he said.
"We're just applying those principles in a different way," he added, referring to the Monarchy's use of the internet and social media.
Prince Andrew said the Royal Family are early adopters of technology and he told Newsbeat that they were keen to stay at the forefront of social media.
"We're engaging in a way that's in keeping with the 21st century and if that means using and applying social media and other devices then we're going to do it.
"It's not that surprising is it, that we're using all those engagement methods?"
He added: "The Palace has been tweeting for a lot longer than I have but I'm the only member of the family that is tweeting separately, apart from both of my daughters."
