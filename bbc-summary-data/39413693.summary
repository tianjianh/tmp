Derek and Maria Broaddus took action after their New Jersey town rejected their plan to raze the property and build two houses on the existing plot.
They say they received three anonymous letters signed by "The Watcher" since buying the Westfield house in 2014.
In one letter, the stalker asks whether they brought the "young blood".
The couple, who have young children, are refusing to move into the six-bedroom house, which they bought for $1.3m (Â£1m).
Their attempts to sell the property have so far failed.
In June 2015, the Broadduses sued the previous owners, claiming that they had also received a letter from "The Watcher", but never disclosed it.
However, that family counter-sued, alleging they were defamed through the amount of attention given by the Broadduses' legal action.
Westfield police have so far been unable to identify the author of the letters.
