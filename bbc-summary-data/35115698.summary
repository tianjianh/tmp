NHS Highland apologises for failing dementia patient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Highland has made a public apology for a series of failings in its care of a patient with dementia whose health deteriorated after falling in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman's treatment at New Craigs Hospital in Inverness in 2014 has been criticised by the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO).
It upheld complaints from her family about a lack of appropriate care after she suffered a pelvic fracture.
The injury was later picked up after she was moved to Raigmore Hospital.
In a new report, the SPSO said it was concerned about the level of nursing care and pain relief the woman received.
The watchdog also criticised NHS Highland's handling of her family's complaint to the health board, describing its responses as "overly defensive and lacking in empathy".
Following the release of the SPSO report, NHS Highland's chief executive Elaine Mead said: "I want to publicly apologise on behalf of NHS Highland for our failings in the care and treatment of this patient.
"We accept the findings in the SPSO report and I will be writing to the family to apologise and to advise that we are taking steps to identify and act on the learning from this case.
"The report will be shared with the staff involved and we will also be holding a significant adverse event review which will be lead by senior clinical colleagues, the results of which we will feedback to the family."
