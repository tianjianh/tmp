George Watson's College pupils get sleep master class

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils at an Edinburgh school are taking part in a master class on sleep education as part of their preparation for exams.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 200 S5 students from George Watson's College will take part in a workshop to encourage them to think about their sleeping habits.
Sound Sleep is a programme run by Sleep Scotland to teach the importance of sleep for memory retention.
Experts said teenagers should be averaging nine hours sleep a night.
However, researchers in America who studied 3,000 pupils found that those who were getting grades of C and below slept around 25 minutes less and went to bed an average of 40 minutes later than those achieving A and B grades.
Sleep Scotland conducted its own survey showing 31% of 12 - 15 years reported staying up regularly until 03:00 with 50% reporting feeling tired in the morning.
