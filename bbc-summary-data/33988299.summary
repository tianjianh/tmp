Authorities from India's premier film institute have defended the midnight arrest of five of its students.

Film and Television Institute of India director Prashant Pathrabe told reporters that he was "mentally traumatised" by striking students.
Mr Pathrabe was held hostage for several hours over a disagreement in the assessment of their final projects.
Students are also unhappy over the appointment of a new chairman who they say is driven by "rightwing interests".
Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Pathrabe said that he had been rescued by police after "eight to nine hours of torture while being illegally detained by students".
"Is it just students' freedom that matters? What about my freedom?," he asked.
The late night arrest of the students had generated outrage in India, with many describing the action as "draconian". The students have been accused of seven different offences, including a non-bailable offence.
The incident is the latest point of confrontation between the students and authorities at the institute which is located in the western Indian city of Pune.
The students have boycotted classes for more than 60 days to protest against "insidious attempts" to fill the administration with people sympathetic to a "hardline Hindu nationalist agenda".
They insist that the new chairman of the institute, Gajendra Chauhan, does not have sufficient credentials to take up the post, and allege that he has merely been appointed because of his affiliation with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
They have refused to attend classes unless he was removed from the post. The government and institute authorities have rubbished the charges and threatened to expel the protesters.
The issue has taken on a political flavour with the Congress party vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal publicly expressing support for the students.
Mr Kejriwal has gone on to offer the students "space in Delhi" until the federal government agrees to their demands.
Prominent actors and directors have also taken up the issue which has been dominating Indian media headlines.
Director Dibaker Banerjee defended the students in a column for the Indian Express, while Bollywood actors like Ranbir Kapoor and his father Rishi Kapoor have also said they are "doing nothing wrong".
