Arsenal will do the "maximum" they can to keep key forwards Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil in north London, says Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.

The pair have been linked with other clubs and, with 18 months remaining on their Arsenal contracts, are in talks with the Gunners about new deals.
"Eighteen months is quite long in football. These players have 18 months, they will be staying 18 months and, hopefully, much longer," said Wenger.
"I don't believe that it is a problem."
He added: "A contract is between two parties and on my side the best position is to achieve it early.
"You have to accept that negotiations are private and secret and we don't have to explain what we do with negotiations."
Asked if he is willing to break the club's wage structure to keep the players, Wenger replied: "Like always we will do the maximum of what we can for every single player."
Chile international Sanchez has 11 top flight goals so far this season and is the joint leading goalscorer in the Premier League along with Chelsea striker Diego Costa.
Newspaper reports suggest he is a target for the Blues and a Chinese club.
"Why should you go to China when you are playing in England?" said Wenger.
"We live in a world where the great players like Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil earn a lot of money and have the privilege to choose where they want to play.
"The commitment of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil is absolutely total and I'm very pleased with that."
