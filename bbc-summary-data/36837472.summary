The 32-year-old has agreed a three-year deal at Carrow Road, having played a starring role in his country's run to the last 16 of Euro 2016.
McGovern was a free agent after leaving Scottish Premiership side Hamilton Academicals earlier this summer.
He links up again with Canaries boss Alex Neil, who managed the Accies from 2013 to January 2015.
"I had some interest from elsewhere, but I'm really looking forward to working with him again now at Norwich," he told the Norwich City website.
"It's nice to join a club where I'll have some familiar faces around me.
"I'm aiming to get into the team, but I know I'm up against some top-class goalkeepers. It's going to be intense competition, although it's a challenge I'll relish."
McGovern played in all four games for Northern Ireland as Michael O'Neill's side reached the last 16 of Euro 2016, before losing 1-0 to Wales.
He has spent his entire career in the Scottish leagues, having started out as a trainee at Celtic before spells at Stranraer, Dundee United, Falkirk and Ross County, for whom he appeared in the Scottish Cup final in 2010.
"Michael is a player that I've worked with before, so I know all about his qualities and his character," said Neil, who managed to beat off interest from Premier League clubs for McGovern.
"He's a fantastic professional, and he showed he's capable of playing at the top level with his performances for Northern Ireland at the Euros. He will come in and offer great competition to our current goalkeepers."
