Peterborough doctor found to have child and animal porn jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor found to have thousands of indecent images of children as well as animal pornography has been jailed for more than two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police found almost 850,000 images of children at Michael Kennedy's Peterborough home, alongside one image of sexual activity with a horse.
It was "the biggest investigation of its kind relating to indecent images seen in Cambridgeshire," officers said.
Kennedy, 52, admitted a number of offences at Cambridge Crown Court.
The GP, of St Pegus Road, who worked at Millfield Medical Centre in Peterborough, was suspended from practising by the General Medical Council after his arrest in March.
He later pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children, one count of possessing prohibited images of children and three counts of possessing extreme pornographic images.

Most of the victims seen in the images, which were both still and moving, were between five and 10 years old.
Det Ch Insp Neil Sloan said: "Never in my time as a police officer have I seen such an extensive collection of such images; more than 800,000 individual images all stored, filed and categorised like a library."
He said while there was no evidence Kennedy had filmed any of the images himself, it was clear he had "an unhealthy interest in indecent images of children and extreme pornography".
Police also stressed there was no evidence to suggest Kennedy had abused his patients.
Kennedy's defence told the court her client was "appalled with himself".
He was jailed for two years and eight months, as well as being placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and being made the subject of a lifelong Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
