The firm, owned by brothers Sandy and James Easdale, recorded pre-tax profits of £3.22m, up from £1.75m in 2013.
Turnover also increased from £33.8m to £35.3m over the same period. The firm said it managed to achieve savings by outsourcing the procurement of mechanical parts and materials.
Managing director Ralph Roberts said McGill's was "back on track" to meet its growth and profitability targets.
"After a year of stifled activity in 2013, mainly a result of the costly Competition Commission investigation, these strong results are in line with forecast," he said.
"The results have allowed McGill's to significantly increase investment in rolling stock and infrastructure back to planned levels which benefit customers and service reliability.
"The profit achieved is in line with expectations of public transport companies of this size, but, crucially, all has been re-invested, ensuring McGill's customers feel the benefit of the business trading according to plan."
