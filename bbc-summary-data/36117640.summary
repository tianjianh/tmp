Prop Ryan Bevington has signed a one-year contract extension to keep him at Ospreys until the end of the 2016-17 season.

The 27-year-old has won 13 Wales caps, the last against Italy in the 2014 Six Nations.
A groin injury has since disrupted loose-head Bevington's progress.
But he hopes to add to his 112 Ospreys appearances, saying: "Having another year gives me a chance to get back in the picture."
Bevington added: "The last two years for me have been difficult with my groin injury.
"I've gone from playing regularly over four or five seasons to not being able to do anything.
"It's been tough, but the Ospreys have been brilliant looking after me, supporting me every step of the way."
Fellow Wales loose-heads Paul James and Nicky Smith plus another former Wales Under-20 loose-head Gareth Thomas are Bevington's rivals.
"If I can get back to where I need to be then we'll have four players all pushing each other," said Bevington.
Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy said: "Ryan knows he faces a tough challenge within the group. It's a challenge that only he can overcome."
