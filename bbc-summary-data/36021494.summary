George Ray came closest to opening the scoring for Crewe before the break when his header was saved by Elliot Parish.
George Moncur's penalty put the visitors ahead in the second-half after Ray tripped Frankie Kent in the box.
But Saunders headed in James Jones' corner to leave Colchester eight points from safety with three games to play.
Crewe coach James Collins told BBC Radio Stoke:
"It has been a tough and long season. You could tell it was two teams that are down there.
"But it was important that we got something. The players had to dig in and got a late reward.
"Callum Saunders has been ill for a lot of the season, so it's been a bit up and down for him.
"But he has the ability to run in behind and threaten. To see him score a goal like that is a real positive."
