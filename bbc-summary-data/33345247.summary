Christopher and Sharon Bell, from Killingbeck in Leeds, have been described as "hard-working" by neighbours.
The BBC understands the couple had two grown-up children and a third, teenage child.
In a statement, their family said they were "deeply saddened" by the deaths.
There was "very little information surrounding the circumstances of the tragedy", the family said, but they would work with authorities to establish what happened.
"Our thoughts are with all those affected", they added.
Adrian Thompson, of Northern Rail, said Mr Bell worked for the firm at Leeds station.
He was "a much loved and highly valued colleague who will be sadly missed", he said.
Mrs Bell was said to be a health and care worker.
Mark Brady, a neighbour of the couple who had known them for 28 years, said: "It's absolutely devastating, I've watched his kids grow up and his grandkids grow up.
"It's absolutely ridiculous and sad.
"They worked hard saving up to have nice holidays like this."
Norman Jarvis, the couple's next-door neighbour, said the Bells were a hard-working couple who worked unsociable hours
Thirty of the 38 victims of the attack, at a beach resort in Sousse on Friday, are thought to be British.
Tunisian authorities have arrested several people on suspicion of helping gunman Seifeddine Rezgui.
The 23-year-old student, who had links to the Islamic State jihadist group, was shot dead by police after the killings.
