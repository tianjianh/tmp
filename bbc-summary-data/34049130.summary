Motorcyclist Craig Steadman, 28, was involved in an accident with a car on the A55 near Llanfairpwll on Monday.
Emergency services were called at about 17:30 BST, but Mr Steadman was pronounced dead at the scene.
George Rawlinson, RNLI operations director, said: "Craig was a well-respected member of the lifeboat crew at Holyhead and will be deeply missed."
He added: "This is tragic news and on behalf of all of us at the RNLI, I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to Craig's family, friends and RNLI colleagues."
Mr Steadman was a member of the lifeboat crew at Holyhead on both the station's all-weather and inshore lifeboats.
His mother Sharon described him as "such a kind and helpful boy. He would do anything for anyone and put others first".
Mr Steadman was on the RNLI crew for two years until 2006 and rejoined in 2011 after a period teaching at a sailing college in Salcombe, Devon.
He also worked as an engineer at RAF Valley and more recently in the bakery at Tesco, Holyhead.
His father Ray said: "He had dedicated his whole young life to saving others. I am so proud of him."
Craig's partner Tracy described him as "the love of my life", adding: "I only wish we could have spent the rest of our lives together."
