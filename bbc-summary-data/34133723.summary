A Fox News anchor is suing a US toy company, Hasbro, for more than $5m (Â£3.3m) over a toy hamster that she says resembles her and shares her name.

Harris Faulkner said the company's portrayal of her as a plastic hamster "was demeaning and insulting".
She filed a legal case saying the toy resembled her traditional professional appearance, including complexion, eye shape and eye make-up design.
The toy is part of the company's popular Littlest Pet Shop collection.
It was first introduced in 2014, according to legal documents obtained by entertainment news website Deadline.
The legal case, which was filed at a district court in New Jersey on Monday, said Hasbro had "wilfully and wrongfully appropriated Faulkner's unique and valuable name and distinctive persona for its own financial gain".
It said Mrs Faulkner, who has been a Fox News anchor for 10 years, had never given the toy manufacturer permission to use her name or likeness and in January demanded they stop using the product.
But three weeks later, it said, the doll was still available on the Hasbro website.
Ms Faulkner said she did not want to be associated with a toy that is a "known choking hazard that risks harming small children".
However, Julie Duffy, a spokeswoman for the company, said the Littlest Pet Shop toys "meet and exceed all safety standards".
The company is behind other well-known toy brands, including Transformers and My Little Pony.
