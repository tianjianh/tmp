[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 1-1 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Jake Jervis scored an 84th-minute penalty as League Two pace-setters Plymouth drew 1-1 at home to Hartlepool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools boss Craig Hignett was sent to the stand by referee Gavin Ward for his protests following the award of the spot-kick for a foul on substitute Jimmy Spencer by Toto Nsiala.
Former Plymouth winger Nathan Thomas put Pools 1-0 up from a deceptive 21st-minute cross-shot from the left that looped over back-pedalling goalkeeper Luke McCormick and into the top corner.
Argyle had penalty appeals turned away by Ward in the 29th minute when Lewis Hawkins appeared to lead with his hand while diving to clear Graham Carey's cross.
Carey was then denied by a superb Trevor Carson save in the 42nd minute as the goalkeeper flung himself to tip over the play-maker's top corner-bound free-kick.
Spencer's header flew just wide of the far post in the 66th minute and Pools countered with skipper Nicky Featherstone's 20-yarder, which deflected inches wide.
Following Jervis' equaliser, Pools defender Scott Harrison was sent off for a second bookable offence in the first of six minutes of stoppage time but there was little time for Argyle to find a winner.
