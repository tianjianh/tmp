[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whitely scored his third goal in only his third game of the season, slotting past Graham Stack from a one-on-one opportunity.
Williamson levelled, however, for the Spitfires after taking Danny Hollands' curled through ball in his stride.
Ayo Obileye was then brought down in the box by substitute Kevin Lokko, and Williamson netted from the penalty spot.
Whitely also registered from 12 yards 16 minutes from time to save a point and enhance even further his prolific start to the campaign.
