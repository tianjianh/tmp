[SN]TITLE[SN]
Read Beyonce and Adele's powerful, emotional Grammy speeches in full

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Beyonce and Adele both gave powerful, emotional speeches at Sunday night's Grammy Awards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beyonce's was entirely scripted  (she read it from a folded piece of card), making a bold statement about the beauty of being black.
Perhaps aware that she would be beaten in the best album vote, the star delivered it early into the ceremony, as her album Lemonade was named best urban contemporary album.
Here it is in full.
"Thank you so much. Hi baby [waving to her daughter, Ivy Blue]. Thank you to the Grammy voters for this incredible honour, and thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank God for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support.
"We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable.
"It's important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror - first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys - and see themselves, and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race. And I feel it's vital that we learn from the past and recognise our tendencies to repeat our mistakes.
Thank you again for honouring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight. This is incredible."
Adele, on the other hand, spoke off-the-cuff as she won the prize for album of the year.
The star, who had only just sat down after being awarded song of the year for Hello, had seemingly expected Beyonce to take the next prize.
She lost her composure as she spoke, even appearing to concede victory to her idol.
Here's what she said.
"Thank you. Hi guys. Hi, everyone. Hi, hi, hi.
"As you can see it took an army to make me strong and willing again enough to do it [make this album], but thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
"Five years ago, when I was last here, I also was pregnant, and I didn't know. And I was awarded that shortly after. I found out shortly after, which was the biggest blessing of my life. And in my pregnancy and through becoming a mother I lost a lot of myself. And I've struggled, and I still do struggle being a mom. It's really hard. But tonight winning this kind of feels full circle, and like a bit of me has come back to myself.
"But I can't possibly accept this award. I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonce. And this album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental. Beyonce, it's so monumental, and so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-baring and we all got to see another side to you that you don't always let us see. And we appreciate that. And all us artists here [expletive] adore you. You are our light.
"The way that you make me and my friends feel... The way you make my black friends feel, is empowering. And you make them stand up for themselves. And I love you. I always have and I always will.
"Grammys, I appreciate it. The academy, I love you. My manager, my husband and my son. You're the only reason I do it. Thank you so much. Thank you very much to everybody."
