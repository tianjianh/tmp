A £1.2m flood defence scheme to protect hundreds of homes in Stockton has been given the go-ahead.

Homes and businesses in the Lustrum Beck area were among those worst affected by floods in 2012.
The Environment Agency has issued the grant to protect the 183 properties from future floods.
A spokesman for Stockton Council said it was important they tried their "utmost" to ensure there was no repeat of 2012.
The work will include raising the banks at Browns Bridge, improving the flow of the beck downstream to prevent blockages and improvements at Durham Road bridge to allow water to pass more rapidly and easily.
Councillor David Rose, the council's cabinet member for the environment, said: "We know how devastating flood damage is and want to do our utmost to ensure there is not a repeat of the Autumn 2012 floods in the Lustrum Beck area.
"We have worked tirelessly with the Environment Agency in recent years to find a way of securing funding to allow us to build the much needed flood defences so I'm delighted that this scheme is now set to progress."
Stockton Council has also invested £100,000 in emergency flood barriers and pumps to provide "more on-the-ground flood support" across the borough.
The council and the Environment Agency will start work in the summer.
