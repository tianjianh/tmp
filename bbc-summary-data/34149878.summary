National Grid said the leak, in Oakbrook Road on Thursday morning, was caused by "third party" damage to a steel gas pipe during roadworks.
About 100 properties on Cruise Road, Frickley Road, Fulney Road, Oakbrook Road and Westwood Road were evacuated.
Engineers worked until the early hours of Friday morning to repair the leak, the company said.
Sheffield City Council said people were allowed to return home from 22:00 BST on Thursday and thanked a nearby school for providing shelter.
Stephanie Van Rosse, from National Grid, said workmen had knocked a control valve off a gas pipe during road resurfacing works.
She said an investigation would start later.
