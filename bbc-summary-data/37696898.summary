Jimmy Savile's Leeds flat, where the disgraced broadcaster lived for more than 30 years, has been demolished.

The former BBC presenter stayed in the penthouse at Lake View Court in Roundhay Park until his death in October 2011 at the age of 84.
It was bought by a couple living in the next-door flat in 2013 who said it had been left in a "terrible condition".
Planning permission was granted to flatten the top floor flat and build a new apartment.
The flat is where Savile hosted the weekly meetings of his inner circle, which became known as The Friday Morning Club.
It is thought at least one of his victims may have been abused at the property, but an inquiry could not prove the allegation.
One of Britain's most prolific sex abusers, Savile exploited his celebrity status to abuse hundreds of adults and children across the country, assaulting or raping them in television dressing rooms, hospitals, schools, children's homes and his caravan.
The abuse is thought to have begun in the mid-1940s, when he was in his late teens or early 20s, and lasted until 2009.
The revelations prompted the Metropolitan Police to launch Operation Yewtree, set up to investigate historical sex offences.
In his lifetime, millions knew Jimmy Savile as an eccentric TV personality.
One of Britain's biggest stars, he was a larger-than-life character who was known for tea-time TV favourites such as Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It as well as stints on BBC Radio 1.
He was also, to some, Saint Jimmy, a diligent fundraiser who raised Â£40m for charity. But, a year after his death in 2011, allegations of abuse surfaced.
It transpired that he was, in fact, one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators. He had been exploiting his status to prey on hundreds of people - girls and boys, men and women, but mostly vulnerable young females.
