[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee United 2-1 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United kick-started their season with a well-earned win over Morton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Andreu's second half brace ensured they ended a poor week with three points.
Morton were unable to recreate their League Cup win over the tangerines though Sean Dillon turned a Ross Forbes free kick past his keeper to ruin Cammy Bell's clean sheet.
The victory means Ray McKinnon's men move to within six points of leaders Queen of the South.
In a match of few chances a single goal difference was always likely to be enough and so it proved.
However, Andreu could have scored much earlier as he spurned United's best first half chance.
Racing onto a through ball his shot was snuffed out by Andy McNeil in the Morton goal.
As the opening 45 wore on, Jim Duffy's side began to feel their way into proceedings and Aiden Nesbitt hit the post with an effort from the edge of the area.
Cammy Bell was beaten and Ton skipper Thomas O'Ware spooned the rebound over the bar.
Blair Spittal did well to work space in the box as United began the second half smartly.
But his shot was spectacularly saved by McNeil.
Morton struggled to impose themselves in the second period and the hosts eventually opened the scoring just beyond the hour.
Andreu's effort found the corner despite the best efforts of McNeil.
But for one or two shaky moments in defence United deserved their win and Andreu's second saw him capitalise on poor defending.
He bore down on McNeil and calmly slotted home.
Dillon's late own goal came too late for Morton as United ensured revenge for their midweek defeat at Cappielow.
