Five suspects arrested over an attack on a football fan are having their cases considered by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin was left with brain damage after being assaulted following a match at Southend United's Roots Hall ground in March.
Essex Police said the men have been released from bail and "reports submitted to prosecutors".
It is now up to the CPS to decide whether or not to bring charges.
The suspects, who are all from Essex, are a 19-year-old from Wickford, a 19-year-old from Basildon, a 23-year-old from Rochford and two men aged 27 and 30 from Westcliff.
Each was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.
This week a 22-year-old man from Southend and a 19-year-old man from Basildon arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm were re-bailed until 17 December.
Seven other suspects are due to answer bail in the next month.
Mr Dobbin, from Mildenhall in Suffolk, was beaten outside The Railway pub as he and a group of friends walked towards Prittlewell station following the Cambridge United match against Southend United.
Essex Police said he was an "entirely innocent person" who is now "looking at the possibility of having to live with a permanent brain injury".
He is recovering at a head injury rehabilitation centre in Norwich.
In September his wife released images of Mr Dobbin in hospital in an attempt to put an end to football violence.
