Campaigners have raised thousands of euros to erect a memorial for almost 800 infants buried in the grounds of a home for unmarried mothers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bodies of 796 babies, toddlers and children were buried in unmarked graves in Tuam, County Galway, between 1925 and 1961.
One of the children was nine years old when buried.
The infants' death records were found by a historian researching the former home.
Catherine Corless told BBC Radio Ulster she was "staggered and shocked" at the number of people buried without headstones.
The causes of death included malnutrition and infectious diseases, such as TB and pneumonia.
Campaigners now hope to erect a sculpture and put plaques with all the children's names along the eight foot wall at the site.
The campaign has won support from the TD (Irish MP) for the area, CiarÃ¡n Cannon, who has called for an inquiry.
It is understood that the Bon Secours Sisters, who ran the home for unmarried mothers, have donated some money to the memorial fund.
They have also met with the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Michael Neary, to discuss holding a memorial service for those who died.
