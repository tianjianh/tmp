Club memorabilia, bar stock, furniture and toilets were damaged in the blaze at Wellingborough Town's Dog & Duck ground.
A statement from AFC Rushden & Diamonds, which co-shares the ground, said changing rooms were being professionally cleaned and it planned to host Beaconsfield this Saturday.
Police are treating the blaze as arson.
The fire broke out in the early hours of Monday at the ground behind the Dog & Duck pub on London Road, which is home to non-league Diamonds and Wellingborough Town.
A pop-up bar has been set up by a local firm for the Diamonds to use on Saturday and the electrics are being checked-over, but the clubhouse remains out of action.
A statement from the Diamonds said: "The club would like to place on record its gratitude to the numerous offers of help."
It added: "Saturday's fixture against Beaconsfield SYCOB FC will proceed as normal."
Wellingborough Town are playing at Wisbech on Saturday.
