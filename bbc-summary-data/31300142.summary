Kent Police negotiators and firearms officers were called to Hersden, near Canterbury, at 23:20 GMT on Sunday.
Marc Traylor, 40, and the 16-year-old girl are from the same family, police said. It is understood they are father and daughter.
Mr Traylor is in a critical condition while the girl is critical but stable with stab wounds, the force said.
Two knives have been recovered from the scene.
The shooting has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
The IPCC confirmed its investigators had been sent to the scene.
Peter Johnson, who lives opposite the property, said he thought he heard two shots.
"I saw up to about 10 police cars and two armed response units... and what looked like a young girl being carried up the road towards the ambulance.
"About half an hour after that I noticed they brought the man out on a stretcher," he said.
