A girl drowned after her extra-large buoyancy aid became snagged on a sinking speedboat, an accident report has concluded.

Emily Gardner, 14, from Gloucester, was trapped under the vessel when the buoyancy aid became caught off Brixham, Devon, in May.
The speedboat capsized after hitting a large wave, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch report said.
The one adult and two other teenagers on board managed to swim to shore.
Emily was wearing an extra-small wetsuit, but the report said the adult extra-large buoyancy aid was not a close fit, increasing the opportunity for it to become snagged.
She was freed 25 minutes after the boat capsized and given medical treatment, but she never regained consciousness.

The report said the speedboat driver, who was a co-owner of the 26-year old vessel bought second hand on eBay the year before, "was not wearing the kill cord" which stops the engine when activated in an emergency or when the driver is thrown from the vessel.
It also said the driver had "relatively limited experience" in that particular speedboat.
A new propeller and "not ideal" sea conditions should have "suggested a more cautious approach when venturing out, rather than applying almost full throttle as soon as the boat was in open water", said the report.
The report did not make any recommendations but said the Royal Yachting Association and British Water Ski and Wakeboard intended to publicise the safety issues.
At Emily's funeral in May the Reverend Susan Cooke, who conducted the service, said: "Emily was obviously a very fun loving and happy girl."
