Herbert Howe quits Liverpool elected mayor race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A local hairstylist, who was standing as an independent for Mayor of Liverpool, has withdrawn because of the "viperous attitude" of local politics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Herbert Howe was one of the first candidates to announce he would stand when councillors voted to move to an elected mayor system in February.
Mr Howe said he was "frightened of the political system" and did not want to be "put into the lion's den".
Nominations for the post of elected mayor close on 4 April.
Mr Howe, a local personality who featured in an ITV docu-soap Shampoo, launched his campaign on Wednesday with a champagne reception.
He had promised to give his mayor's salary to groups providing activities for youngsters, including the Scouts, Boys Brigade and Sea Cadets.
He also pledged to tackle the regeneration of the Anfield area of the city and put pressure on Liverpool FC to make a decision on whether the club planned to build a new stadium or remain at Anfield.
Mr Howe said: "Somebody said to me 'Herbert, we will find skeletons in your cupboard.'
"I said 'I haven't got a cupboard', but it was a viperous attitude and I couldn't live with that.
"I would not like to be put in to the lion's den and not be given the chance to speak as the person I am.
"I wish anybody going in for it the very best of luck."
Liverpool's current council leader Joe Anderson has been selected as the Labour candidate for elected mayor.
The Liberal Democrats deputy leader Richard Kemp has been selected as the party candidate, Tony Caldeira will stand for The Conservatives and John Coyne is to represent the Green Party.
Steve Radford is standing for the Liberal Party and Tony Mulhearn for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
Independent Liam Fogarty has also announced his intention to stand.
Paul Rimmer is expected to be nominated as the candidate for the English Democrats.
