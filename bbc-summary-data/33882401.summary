Labour leadership: Leighton Andrews backs Yvette Cooper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yvette Cooper has been urged to "show her passion for change" by a Welsh government minister backing her for the Labour leadership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said Labour needed a leader to win elections, not "return to the politics of the 1970s or 1950s".
Fellow ministers Vaughan Gething and Ken Skates support Andy Burnham, while three Labour AMs back Jeremy Corbyn.
No AMs have publicly come out in support of Liz Kendall.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has not named his preferred candidate, but has said veteran left-winger Mr Corbyn would be an "unusual choice" for the party.
On Wednesday, Mr Andrews said he understood the "romantic appeal of anti-austerity politics", but said Labour had to be able to win power to change things.
At the general election in May, Labour had "appeared both pro-austerity and economically incompetent, which was a hell of an achievement", he added.
"Labour must either be in the business of bringing change or else it is worthless," he said.
Declaring his support for Ms Cooper, Mr Andrews said Labour needed a leader "who looks and sounds different from the blokeish Westminster culture, who understands that the personal is political".
Mr Corbyn, who ended a two-day campaign visit to Wales with a rally in Cardiff on Tuesday, has more nominations from local parties in Wales and across the UK than any of the other three contenders.
But the only Welsh MP to nominate him - Huw Irranca-Davies - said he only did so to ensure a broad range of candidates, and that he intended to vote for Ms Cooper.
Mr Burnham has the backing of nine Welsh MPs and four AMs, while Ms Cooper has support from eight Welsh MPs and four AMs.
Ms Kendall is backed by five Welsh MPs but no AMs, while Mr Corbyn has support from three AMs.
The winner, to be chosen by a vote of Labour party members, will be named on 12 September.
