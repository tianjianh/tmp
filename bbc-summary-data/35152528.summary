Hotel and flats planned for Edinburgh city centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a hotel, flats, a public square and a cafe have been lodged for a vacant site in Edinburgh's city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A planning application has been lodged for the proposed redevelopment of the buildings on King's Stables Road.
The one and two bedroom flats would include 25% affordable housing and student accommodation.
The buildings on the site, formerly council offices, storage premises and workshops, have lain vacant since 2009.
They were put on the market last year by the council.
Its a joint venture between Peveril Securities - the development arm of the Bowmer and Kirkland Group - and Campus Development Management.
Charles Vyvyan from Campus Development Management, said: "This corner of the Grassmarket has lain neglected for a number of years, and these exciting proposals will breathe much-needed life into this part of the Old Town, providing a hotel, student accommodation, flats and facilities to accommodate and promote the arts.
"We were highly sensitive to the fact that the site is within the UNESCO World Heritage site boundary, and as we worked our way through the planning process engaged closely with the local community, updating them on our proposals and listening to their feedback.
"We also want to ensure that the local; community and stakeholders have plenty of further opportunity to comment on the proposals, and have invited the council to extend the period for commenting on the planning application until later in January, to take account of the Christmas and New Year holiday period."
