Mullins will lose about 60 horses as a result, including Don Poli, third in this year's Cheltenham Gold Cup and Ryanair Chase runner-up Valseur Lido.
"I put up my fees for the first time in 10 years and Gigginstown chose not to pay them," Mullins told At The Races.
The horses will be split between Gordon Elliott, Mouse Morris, Joseph O'Brien, Henry de Bromhead and Noel Meade.
Elliott told the Irish Independent he was likely to train about 20 of them, including Don Poli, Apple's Jade and Blow By Blow.
Gigginstown said the decision had been made with "considerable regret".
It added: "We hope that an agreement can be reached at some time in the future which will allow Willie to resume buying and training more graded winners for us."
The stud is owned by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
Mullins said: "There's a fantastic team of horses going to whoever's going to get them, I don't know where they are going to go.
"It's all only been in the last few hours that this has come about. I wish them the best. It's the way it is. We just move on, I think."
