Sam Wood grabbed two tries in three minutes to give Huddersfield an early lead before Liam Finn responded.
Ben Jones-Bishop then grabbed a first-half double of his own to help put Wakefield 16-8 up at the break.
Ukuma Ta'ai and Oliver Roberts tries edged Giants back in front before McGillvary completed the win.
Huddersfield's second victory from three Super League games this season puts them third in the table and among four sides equal on points with early competition leaders Castleford.
Defeat leaves Wakefield third from bottom and winless in 11 Super League matches, with their last win coming before the Super 8s last season.
Unforced errors hurt them after the break as the hosts mounted their comeback, with Ta'ai powering over before Roberts edged them ahead from close range.
The visitors then lost Jones-Bishop to a head injury before McGillvary got on the end of a Danny Brough kick eight minutes from time.
And with his second successful conversion of the night, Brough moved up to 10th in the all-time Super League points scoring list.
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone told BBC Radio Leeds:
"I'm really happy for the boys, we had a bit of soul-searching to do at half-time, it wasn't too good and the momentum definitely was with Wakefield at half-time.
"But we talked a little bit about the team we wanted to be and how we wanted to defend and work together.
"It was really pleasing to see some of our young players grow as the second half unfolded."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:
"That's two weeks on the bounce now we've put ourselves in position to win a game and not come away with the two points.
"We went chasing the game for some reason in the second half when we were comfortably in front.
"We came up with some really poor decision in the final third and we got taught a big lesson tonight."
