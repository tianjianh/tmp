The Scots open their tour with an Intercontinental Cup match from 21-24 January, before one-day internationals on 26 and 28 January.
They then play two Twenty20 internationals on 30 and 31 January in the lead-up to the ICC World Twenty20 in India, which begins on 8 March.
"Hong Kong are going to be tough opponents," said coach Grant Bradburn.
"We know them well and respect them as a strong fellow associate nation.
"As a squad this Scotland team are determined to continue showing a growing strength in our performances in all three formats of the game.
"We have had some precious time together reflecting on 2015 and planning ahead for the first quarter of 2016. I am hugely impressed with the skills within this squad and the desire to continually improve.
"The players have embraced the variety of skill development in the off season which has included boxing, pilates and hot yoga to compliment specific skill enhancement".
South Africa-born Wheal, 19, who has a Scottish mother, took seven wickets as a Scotland XI beat Marylebone Cricket Club in August.
Sussex batsman Matt Machan returns to the squad after missing Scotland's successful World T20 Qualifier campaign in July.
Gavin Main misses the Hong Kong tour after electing to play in New Zealand early next year while Ruaidhri Smith has exams in January and also misses out, but both are available for selection for the World T20.
Scotland squad for Hong Kong: Preston Mommsen (capt), Alasdair Evans, Bradley Wheal, Calum MacLeod, Con de Lange, George Munsey, Josh Davey, Kyle Coetzer, Mark Watt, Matt Machan, Matthew Cross, Michael Leask, Richie Berrington, Rob Taylor, Safyaan Sharif.
