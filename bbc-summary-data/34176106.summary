Aylesbury child sex abuse trial: Men jailed for abusing schoolgirls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six men who groomed vulnerable under-age girls for sex "for the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket" have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Old Bailey heard the abuse in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, involved multiples rapes, child prostitution and administering substances to "stupefy".
The men, from Aylesbury, Milton Keynes and Bradford, abused the two schoolgirls between 2006 and 2012.
Most were given long prison sentences - the longest being 19-and-a-half years.
The jailed men are:
The offences, which all the defendants denied any involvement in, took place in cars, vans, flats and sometimes the girls' homes in Aylesbury, their trial heard.
The court heard evidence from both victims, who came from troubled backgrounds and were befriended by the men who gave them alcohol, DVDs, food and occasionally drugs.
When she was 12 or 13, one of the girls - known as A - was passed between 60 Asian men for sex and had been conditioned to think it was normal behaviour, the jury was told.
The girls started to believe the men, some of whom were married with children, were their boyfriends.
Referring to girl A, judge John Bevan QC said that "for the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket, she became 'liked' by stall holders in Aylesbury market, taxi and bus drivers".
"Why these defendants focused their attention on white under-age girls is unexplained but I have no doubt vulnerability played a substantial part in it," he said.
"If they pursued Asian under-age girls, they would have paid a heavy price in their community."
In a statement, girl A spoke of her feelings of "worthlessness" as she battled depression and alcohol addiction, adding: "I feel my teenage years were taken away from me."
The second girl - known as B - said today's sentencing was "academic" because "no sentence could ever put right what happened".
Alan Collins, solicitor for girl B, said they would be taking legal action against Buckinghamshire County Council for its "negligence" which "resulted in the unnecessary suffering of these victims".
David Johnston, children's services director at the council, said it was "determined to do everything we can to stamp out all forms of sexual abuse in Buckinghamshire", urging other victims of abuse to come forward.
The authority declined to comment on the legal claims.
