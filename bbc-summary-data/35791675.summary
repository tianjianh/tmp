Sam Wood headed home Joe Jacobson's cross to put the Chairboys ahead, but Charlie Wyke levelled from Hallam Hope's exquisite through ball.
Carlisle keeper Mark Gillespie brought down Garry Thompson in the box, but then saved Jacobson's penalty.
The visitors had Marcus Bean sent off for a reckless challenge on Mark Ellis, but Carlisle could not capitalise.
The Cumbrians gave a debut to Sunderland midfielder Michael Smith as a second-half substitute after signing him on loan for the rest of the season.

Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio: "On the road it's been a long three or four days, but it's been a worthy one.
"Two points we've taken home, some say lose one and win one and you get more points, but I think the mental state of the boys, especially seeing that game out with 10 men today, was superb.
