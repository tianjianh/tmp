George Cobbledick, of Walnut St in Derby, was found guilty of rape and serious sexual assaults against the eight-year-old in the early 2000s.
At Derby Crown Court he was also convicted of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl in the mid 1990s.
Police said they would seek justice for abuse victims no matter the age of the offences or culprit.

Cobbledick was ordered to serve a year on extended licence and be on the sex offenders register for life.
Det Insp Steve Shaw said: "George Cobbledick abused his first victim when she was aged 12, at a time when he would have been in his late 60s.
"His callous abuse continued in the early 2000s, starting when his victim was aged just eight.
"What I hope this case demonstrates is that, no matter how long ago the offences took place, and no matter how old the perpetrator, we will strive to bring them to justice."
