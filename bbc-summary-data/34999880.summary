Thursday's action saw Britain add three medals to take their tally up to five.
Carlin took victory ahead of Hungary's Boglarka Kapas, while bronze went to Sharon Rouwendaal of the Netherlands.
Roberto Pavoni set a new personal best to win 400m individual medley silver, while Andrew Willis' new English record earned bronze in the 200m breaststroke.
Welsh swimmer Carlin, 25, finished in a time of eight minutes 11.01 seconds to add short-course gold to her Commonwealth Games and European titles and continue her impressive 2015 after winning bronze at the World Championships in August.
Loughborough-based Pavoni narrowly missed out on victory to Italy's David Verraszto.
In the 200m breaststroke, Bath's Willis came in behind gold-medallist Marco Koch from Germany - who set a new Championship record - and Hungary's Daniel Gyurta in silver.
On Wednesday, Britain's Adam Peaty and Hannah Miley won silver medals in the men's 50m breaststroke and the women's 400m individual medley respectively.
