England in UAE: Pakistan omit Mohammad Amir and Saeed Ajmal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan have left out bowlers Mohammad Amir and Saeed Ajmal from their squad for the three-Test series against England in the UAE next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ajmal, 37, is omitted after struggling on his return to the game following a ban for an illegal bowling action.
The 23-year-old Amir is available after completing his ban for spot-fixing, but has not been selected.
Both players have enjoyed success against England, averaging less than 20 with the ball against them in Tests.
Ajmal was instrumental in inflicting a 3-0 whitewash on England in their last tour of the UAE, finishing as the leading wicket-taker in the series with 24.
But since his ban he has not been as effective and has been superseded by Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar as Pakistan's first-choice Test spinners.
Left-arm seamer Amir, the youngest player to reach 50 Test wickets, has played only Twenty20 cricket since he was cleared to return to the sport earlier this year, following his ban in 2010.
Middle-order batsman Fawad Alam could play his first Test in five years after being recalled to the squad, while left-arm seamer Wahab Riaz is also included after recovering from a hand injury he sustained in Sri Lanka.
England begin their three-Test series with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on 13 October.
Pakistan squad: Misbah-ul-Haq (capt), Ahmed Shehzad, Shan Masood, Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Fawad Alam, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Wahab Riaz, Imran Khan, Rahat Ali, Junaid Khan.
