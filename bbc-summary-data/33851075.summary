It is thought Jerrell Elie was at a party in Gordon Grove, Brixton, when a fight broke out and he was chased.
An Audi car also took off at speed towards Flaxman Road, where police later found the teenager, from Camberwell, with head injuries.
Moments later the car was seen driving down Gordon Grove, under the railway arches.
Two men, aged 29 and 30, have been arrested in Wandsworth on suspicion of murder.
A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as head injuries and Det Insp Brian Fitzpatrick said it was likely these were caused by being struck by a car.
He said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened in Flaxman Road, or the events leading up to Jerrell's death.
"The party was well attended and it was a warm evening with a lot of people out and about - if you saw anything at all please contact us in confidence."
