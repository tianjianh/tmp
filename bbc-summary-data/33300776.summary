Son Adam and daughter Donna said it was "a source of comfort they were enjoying a holiday when they were taken".
Donna added: "Dad loved to travel and share a drink with others. He was very friendly and full of gusto. It was perhaps apt, or ironic, that he died on holiday."
Mr Fisher's brother, Roland, described him as a typical Leicester lad, who liked fishing and kept birds of prey.
