Exeter City 2-3 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter slipped to five points off the League Two play-off places as Mansfield seal all three points in a five-goal thriller at St James Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Tafazolli fired in to give Mansfield the lead before Malvind Benning struck to make it 2-0.
Long-range shots from Football League Young Player of the Month Ollie Watkins and Christian Ribeiro levelled matters.
But Tafazolli rifled in again two minutes later with a drive from distance to give the visitors victory.
The result means Exeter slip a place to 10th in the League Two table while Mansfield move up to 12th.
