The show, filmed in Reyoarfjorour, Iceland, is the most expensive British drama ever made at Â£30m.
It has featured Michael Gambon, Christopher Ecclestone and The Hunger Games actor Stanley Tucci, who plays DCI Eugene Morton from Scotland Yard.
In the UK the first episode was watched by more than 2.5m people and is Sky Atlantic's most successful original commission.
The show follows a small town and its inhabitants in the Arctic who have to deal with a series of violent crimes seemingly caused by a strange illness.
Zai Bennett, channel director of Sky Atlantic, said: "Simon Donald created a unique and unsettling story which, week after week, has captivated our customers.
"I am absolutely delighted that we will be bringing Fortitude back next year with a story that promises to engage, challenge and enthral us all over again."
Fortitude launched in the US through Participant Media's television network, Pivot, which is confirmed to return to co-produce the second series.
It is shown by more than 100 broadcasters around the world including ABC Australia, Superchannel Canada, OTE Greece and Canal+ France.
The first series concludes on Sky Atlantic on Thursday night.
