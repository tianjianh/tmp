[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been sacked and three others disciplined after they failed to help a security guard struggling with a violent thief.

Merseyside Police PC Jonathan Webb, 48, was in a patrol car with colleagues last December when a Tesco manager asked them to help his guard nearby.
A disciplinary panel found him guilty of gross professional misconduct and gave PC Mark Higgins a final warning.
The hearing was told the officers had been discussing their Christmas party.
Two others who also faced the disciplinary hearing in Wavertree, PC Paul Birch and PC Joanne Parr, are to be given "management advice."
The officers were discussing an incident at the Christmas works party before driving off, the tribunal heard.
PC Birch, 36, previously told a disciplinary hearing he did not hear Tesco manager David Markey requesting help from his front seat passenger PC Webb as they were flagged down in Dale Street.
They were all yards away from security guard Shaun Rigby as he apprehended Roy Fagan, 31, a shoplifter. Fagan later admitted assault and stealing Â£4.62 of whisky.
The interaction between the officers and Mr Markey was said to have lasted nine seconds.
PC Webb said he did not realise the seriousness of the situation, and told the man he did not have the correct kit, and to call the police later.
CCTV played to the panel showed Mr Rigby struggling with Fagan.
