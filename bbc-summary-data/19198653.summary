[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerrie Lawrie, 41, was reported missing after failing to catch her flight home in August last year. Police found her in her apartment.
Papers from Glasgow Sheriff Court show £495,000 of assets were left behind to her sons and parents.
She also requested her antiques and Elvis memorabilia be sold at auction.
This is except for four "life-size famous mannequins" which have to be displayed in a museum.
Tributes were paid on a special Facebook page after her death with people expressing their condolences.
And Ms Lawrie's friend John Helms said: "I'll remember Gerrie as a beautiful, happy, friend who loved life and the people around her."
