Cardiff City fans have been reacting to the ultimatum to manager Malky Mackay who has been told to resign or be sacked by the club owner.

Among them are celebrities, supporters' clubs and politicians including Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan who calls Mackay's treatment "disgraceful".
Owner Vincent Tan sent a letter to his manager by email, listing in depth his grievances.
Mackay has previously said he will not resign.
He did not appear at the club's scheduled news conference on Friday but is understood to have taken training ahead of Saturday's fixture at Liverpool.
BBC Sport reports that the Cardiff owner has instructed chairman Mehmet Dalman to meet him in London on Friday night for talks to decide the future of Mackay.
Dalman convinced the Malaysian businessman to hold one final round of negotiations.
But Mackay is now expected to take charge of the team at Liverpool.
Around 30 fans held a protest outside the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday.
One of the demonstrators Sian Branson said: "We're losing the best manager we've ever had.
"We love Malky Mackay, he helped take us to where we are now and we're clear of relegation.
"We think it's wrong he's not being given the change to finish what he started."
Vince Alm, spokesperson for Cardiff City Supporters' Club, told BBC Radio Wales he had mixed feelings about the owner's actions, saying: "For a professional businessman to behave in this manner is incredible.
"What you have got to balance it with is he has put a lot of money into the club and he is a successful businessman.
"It's sad really. If you look at everything else he is ticking all the boxes doing a fantastic job expanding the stadium, a new training ground, putting money into the community."
In a letter emailed to Mackay on Monday, it is understood the owner listed in depth his grievances with the manager.
The billionaire owner criticised 41-year-old Mackay at length in a range of areas, such as signings, transfer budgets, results on the pitch and style of play.
One of Mr Tan's concerns surround a perceived overspend of the transfer budget.
A Cardiff spokesman told BBC Sport: "The club is not party to any letter sent from one person to another."
TV football pundit and former England player Gary Lineker joined a growing number of Mackay supporters who took to social media like Twitter to air their views, tweeting: "The Cardiff owner's email demanding Malky Mackay resign or be sacked beggars belief."
MP Mr Brennan said: "Malky Mackay is an impressive and dignified man and a professional to his fingertips."
Assembly member and Cardiff City fan Leighton Andrews also took to twitter to rally support for Mackay.
Swansea East AM Mike Hedges tweeted: "Malky Mackay is Cardiff's best manager in my lifetime. Cannot believe they want to sack him".
Cardiff City were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in May and currently lie in 15th place, four points above the relegation zone.
Malaysian businessman Mr Tan has already sparked protests from some supporters for his controversial rebranding of the club in 2012.
He insisted on a club shirt colour change from blue to red, as well as a new club crest in his move towards making the club more appealing to supporters and potential investors in Asia following promotion to the Premier League widely attributed to Mackay.
Mr Tan told BBC Wales earlier this year: "We want to do what is good for Cardiff and for the long-term survival, and hopefully Cardiff can be around for a long time and, God willing, be around in the Premier League."
