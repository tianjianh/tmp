[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grimsby striker Padraig Amond sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the penalty spot to level the tie and send the semi-final into extra-time.
Braintree were reduced to 10 men as Mark Phillips saw a second yellow card.
And Omar Bogle's header from a free-kick after 110 minutes secured Grimsby a place at Wembley on 15 May.
The Mariners have reached the play-offs for four consecutive years after being relegated from the Football League in 2010, but this is only the second time they have reached the final.
They lost to Bristol Rovers on penalties in 2015.
In front of a crowd of 3,102, the biggest at Cressing Road since 1952, the visitors troubled the Braintree defence as Jon Nolan shot over from distance and Bogle dragged a 20-yard effort wide.
Sam Habergham fired high over the bar for part-timers Braintree but they were stretched with 10 men and were outpaced by Grimsby going forward.
