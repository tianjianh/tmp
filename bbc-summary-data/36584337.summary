Duncan Taylor has been ruled out of Scotland's second and final Test against Japan in Tokyo on Saturday.

The Saracens centre, 26, has failed to recover from a hamstring injury sustained in Scotland's 26-13 win over Japan in Toyota City last weekend.
No replacement will be flown out. Scotland have cover in midfield with Peter Horne, Matt Scott and the uncapped Huw Jones.
Winger Sean Lamont has also played Test rugby at centre.
Vern Cotter's team, named on Thursday, is likely to show a host of changes from the first Test.
Rory Sutherland, 23, will start his first match for his country at loose-head prop in place of the injured Alasdair Dickinson, who was replaced in the squad by Gordon Reid.
Reid, 29, had his first full training session with the squad on Tuesday. The Glasgow Warriors forward was on an Ayr beach during Saturday's first Test when he was contacted by Scotland team manager, Gavin Scott, telling him he was required in Tokyo.
"I was with the family, it was a nice day on the Costa del Ayr," he said. "I wasn't watching the game but I had it taped. When I got the phone call, I said to the missus, 'Just to let you know, I'm going away'. She was pretty angry, to be honest, because it was such short notice.
"It was just because I was leaving her. She doesn't like us to be apart. Young love, eh? Well, it's getting a bit older love now."
Scotland trained in persistent rain and Reid added: "Looks like I brought the Scottish weather with me."
Last week, Cotter said he would seek to give everyone game time on tour and back-row forward Josh Strauss, not in the 23-man squad in Toyota City, will likely appear from the start.
Flanker John Barclay is carrying an injury but trained on Tuesday. There are slight injury concerns over prop WP Nel and loose forward Ryan Wilson also.
