In a statement released by the MoD, a Royal Marines spokesman said the corporal was a devoted family man.
He added: "Never one to follow the well trodden path, he was confident in his own abilities and was always looking for new challenges."
Cpl Stephens's family had requested his identity not be released until now.
The number of British military personnel killed on operations in Afghanistan since 2001 is 340.
The spokesman said Cpl Stephens was a trusted friend and colleague.
"He was blessed with the innate ability to brighten the darkest room; he also possessed a disarming sense of humour.
"Measured and thoughtful, his strength came from a depth of experience and knowledge that he was keen to share with others."
He added: "Above all else Seth was a doting husband and father. His absolute dedication and unfailing love for his family was abundantly clear for everybody to see.
"He could always be relied upon to be there for his family and friends, whose needs he always placed before his own. Their loss is immeasurable and our condolences go to them.
"If there is some solace to be gained, it lies in knowing that Seth died doing the job he genuinely loved, alongside comrades that had the utmost admiration for him."
Defence Secretary Liam Fox also paid tribute to the marine and said: "It is clear that Cpl Seth Stephens was a consummate professional whose positive energy and sense of fun made him a popular and highly respected marine."
