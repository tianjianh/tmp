They were training with the British Army in a field near Larkhill Camp, on Salisbury Plain, on Wednesday evening at the time.
Wiltshire Police said two officers in the third truck in the convoy suffered "life-changing injuries" to their legs.
The driver of the truck and eight other personnel received minor injuries.
Casualties were treated at the scene and taken by emergency services to Southampton General and Salisbury District Hospitals.
Others were treated at the Army Medical Centre at Westdown Camp.
Six of the 11 soldiers who received treatment remain in hospital.
Wiltshire Police said it carried out a "detailed examination" of the area overnight to determine the circumstances surrounding the crash.
The British Army said the the incident would be "duly investigated", but it would be "inappropriate" to make any further comment at this stage.
In a joint statement, the British and Indian Armies said they continue to receive updates on the condition of the soldiers who remain in hospital, and their "thoughts are with all those affected by the incident".
They also thanked the emergency services "for their outstanding response and the superb care" provided to the injured.
The soldiers were participating in Exercise Ajeya Warrior, an exchange training exercise between the British and Indian forces held every two years.
It involves an Indian infantry company integrating into a British battalion to share expertise and techniques in combat scenarios.
Salisbury Plain is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is the largest military training area in the UK.
