[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumbarton 1-0 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Docherty's third penalty in two games brought Dumbarton a precious win over Dundee United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sons defender converted confidently after Gregor Buchanan was judged to have been shoved in the box at a corner kick.
Ryan Stevenson's free-kick from the edge of the box had earlier hit the crossbar for the hosts.
United struggled to turn possession into chances but came close when Jamie Robson's volley was saved.
Home goalkeeper Alan Martin was called upon again late on to deny Coll Donaldson a leveller in a match where the visitors often looked out of sorts.
It leaves Ray McKinnon's side without a win in the Championship after two games, although contrasting good form came in the League Cup against Partick Thistle.
The impressive and raucous orange and black flag display by United fans pre-match deserved more of a performance and initially it seemed it would come.
But early possession failed to penetrate as Scott Fraser and Blair Spittal missed opportunities.
Hibernian twice came to the foot of Dumbarton Rock last season as favourites yet left with nothing, and taking big scalps at home is becoming a habit for Stevie Aitken's Sons.
You could tell the hosts were gradually getting their teeth into the frustrated Tangerines and it really began to show after halftime.
Robert Thomson - a former United striker - hit a tame shot when clean through before Stevenson's rocket of a set-piece rattled the woodwork, but his corner soon led to the match-winner.
Amidst the jostling, referee Gavin Duncan spotted a more severe shove on Dumbarton defender Gregor Buchanan by Mark Durnan and Docherty's left foot thumped the penalty to Cammy Bell's right hand side.
It was Docherty's third penalty conversion in two games after netting a couple in the defeat to Dunfermline last weekend.
Simon Murray and Nick van der Velden were introduced to inject more into United's attack but once Dumbarton had their valuable lead they were not for giving it up.
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: "We deserved that result. Without the ball today we were terrific in shutting them down.
"When we did get the ball we played well to make some good chances in the second half and on another day might have got another couple of goals.
"I'm just delighted we've got a win against a side who will be up there challenging at the end of season.
"It's just as well Mark Docherty's not on a goal bonus because he'd be bleeding the club dry."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I'm very disappointed that we can play so well on Tuesday then not play to that standard today.
"Far too many players didn't realise how tough this is, so it's a learning curve and they have paid the penalty today in not taking anything from the game. It's a rude awakening.
"After half an hour we came down to their tempo and it suited Dumbarton.
"I'd need to see it back [the penalty award] but if that's what it is [a shove] then there's going to be penalties galore this season."
