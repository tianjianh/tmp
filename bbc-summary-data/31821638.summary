The organisers of Record Store Day 2015, which will take place on 18 April, have announced this year's list of exclusive releases.
The annual event started in 2007 in America to celebrate the culture of independent record stores, with the UK following the year after.
As with previous years the list, made up of more than 500 acts, is a mix of new and more established artists.
Mumford and Sons will be teasing fans with a 7" single containing two unreleased tracks from their upcoming album Wilder Mind, while Foo Fighters have announced an exclusive Record Store Day 10" called Songs from the Laundry Room containing never before heard tracks and demos.
Dave Grohl is the official ambassador of Record Store Day 2015.
The Foo Fighters frontman will lead the festivities on the day, with events taking place on every continent except Antarctica.
The 1975, Chvrches, George Ezra, Gorgon City and Calvin Harris are also among the newer names on the list of releases.
Other names including Biffy Clyro, Django Django and Imagine Dragons will be releasing singles and albums on vinyl.
Classic releases by Bob Marley, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and The Kinks will also be available.
The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr will also be releasing and a special 7" cover of Depeche Mode's I feel You as well as a live Smiths track.
More than one million vinyl records were sold in the UK last year - the first time the milestone has been reached since 1996.
The Official Chart Company has also said it will soon launch a weekly vinyl chart.
