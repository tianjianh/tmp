Great Britain's Para ice hockey team will miss the 2018 Winter Paralympics after losing their World Championship B Pool bronze medal play-off.

The team needed to finish in the top three to secure a spot at next year's Pyeongchang qualification tournament.
However, in the play-off in Japan they were comprehensively beaten 5-1 by Slovakia - a team they had only lost 1-0 to in Friday's final pool game.
Matt Clarkson grabbed a late consolation strike for GB.
GB had lost heavily to the Czech Republic and Japan in their first two pool games and those two countries will join Slovakia at next year's tournament, from which the top two finishers will qualify for the Games in South Korea.
GB were last represented in the sport at the Winter Paralympics in Turin, Italy in 2006, when double gold medal-winning sprinter Richard Whitehead was part of the squad.
