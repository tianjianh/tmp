Allan Bryant, 24, was last seen leaving the Styx nightclub in Glenrothes on 3 November 2013.
Police carried out extensive searches of the area, using specialist teams of divers and dogs, but there have been no further confirmed sightings of him.
His family hope the march will remind people that he is still missing.
About 100 people walked through the town in a bid to prompt members of the public to come forward with information.
Police Scotland welcomed the march.
Ch Insp Nicola Shepherd said: "The search and inquiry into Allan's disappearance continues and we are totally committed to finding Allan.
"Throughout our investigation we have been supported and assisted by many of Allan's family and friends who have turned out in large numbers to volunteer to help search for Allan.
"Their assistance and support has been invaluable to the officers dedicated to this inquiry.  The support from the wider community in Glenrothes has been remarkable and is testament to the community spirit and their willingness to help.
She added: "We continue to support his family and seek assistance from the public to think back to what they were doing on the night of Saturday 2nd November and into Sunday 3rd November 2013.  Were you in the area?  Did you see Allan?
"Allan's family are desperate for news about him and I would appeal to anyone who has information, no matter how insignificant they may feel it is to contact us."
