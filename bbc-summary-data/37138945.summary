[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rochdale 1-1 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An own goal from goalkeeper Ryan Clarke in the 95th minute denied Neal Ardley's AFC Wimbledon their first win of the season as Rochdale earned a share of the spoils at the Crown Oil Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andy Barcham's first-half header looked as though it would be enough for the Dons to lift themselves out of the bottom four, but Clarke punched Jamie Allen's corner into his own net to leave the visitors bottom of League One.
The Dons were ahead 12 minutes into the game, the goal emanating from a Rochdale attack.
Donal McDermott's corner was inadvertantly sent back to the set-piece taker by Matt Lund and when McDermott attempted to beat Chris Whelpdale he was dispossessed deep in Wimbledon territory.
Whelpdale raced the length of the field down the right before clipping a cross into the centre for Barcham to head past Conrad Logan.
Dale pushed hard for an equaliser after the break with Jamie Allen smashing a shot against the crossbar and Clarke denying Calvin Andrew on two occasions.
The home side's task was made more difficult when Callum Camps was sent off for a second bookable offence, but Clarke's good work was undone when he diverted Allen's corner deep into time added on into his own net.
