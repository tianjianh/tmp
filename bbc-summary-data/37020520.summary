A pipe bomb has been found during a security alert in north Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It began on Tuesday morning after a small metal object was discovered on North Queen Street.
As a result, a number of families living in the area had to leave their homes.
It was examined by an army robot and a controlled explosion was carried out. It was later declared to be a "viable device" and has been removed for examination.
The road between New Lodge Road and Duncairn Gardens was closed during the alert but has since reopened.
The incident had caused "massive inconvenience, disruption and upset for the local community of north Belfast", said Det Insp Mary White, who thanked the public for their "patience and cooperation".
"I am appealing for anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the North Queen Street area close to Spamount Street or anyone with any information that could assist with the investigation to contact detectives."
A woman who entered the scene to retrieve a football was handcuffed and taken away by police.
