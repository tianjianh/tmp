Rhys Priestland: Bath fly-half expected Wales squad omission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bath fly-half Rhys Priestland has backed the Welsh Rugby Union's selection policy, despite being omitted from the latest national squad.

The new rule means only three players who play for clubs outside Wales can be picked in the squad.
Priestland, 29, was not one of the three wildcards selected for the autumn Tests.
"If all the best players left without any consequence, Welsh rugby would be in a pretty tough position," he said.
Priestland's club-mate Taulupe Faletau, who is a doubt for the four Tests, joins George North and Jamie Roberts as the wildcard picks.
Ospreys pair Dan Biggar and Sam Davies, along with Gareth Anscombe of Cardiff Blues, are the fly-half options in Rob Howley's squad.
Priestland said: "It hasn't helped that I haven't played, so If I was picking the squad I wouldn't have picked me - I would have picked the other three as well.
"It's no real surprise and it will be nice for me to get some game time at Bath and hopefully hit a bit of form."
Priestland, capped 48 times, joined Bath from Scarlets after the 2015 World Cup, announcing soon after that he would take an 18-month break from playing for Wales.
He reversed his decision two months later, featured in all five games of the 2016 Six Nations, and went on the summer tour to New Zealand.
He still wants to play for Wales, despite being overlooked for the autumn Tests against Australia, Argentina, Japan and South Africa.
"It's going to be a tough ask for me but never say never," he said.
"I might hit a bit of form again and you never know."
