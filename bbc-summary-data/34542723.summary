Glenn Miller: Holiday lodges approved for site of last hangar concert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The site of a memorial to American bandmaster Glenn Miller is to become a holiday complex despite protests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A plan for 55 lodges at Jack's Green on the RAF Kings Cliffe site, where Miller played his last hangar concert, has been approved by East Northamptonshire Council.
An online petition attracted more than 300 signatures and parish councils complained about the impact of traffic.
Historian Kevin Flecknor said he had "major concerns" over the memorial.
Landowner Philip Ashton-Jones said it would remain "exactly as it is today".
Miller, who was a major in the US Army, leading the Army Air Force Band, played his final concert with his orchestra at RAF Kings Cliffe on 3 October 1944.
In December that year the band leader went missing over the English Channel while flying to Paris.
A memorial to commemorate the final concert was erected in August 1983.
Mr Flecknor, who lives in Kettering and works as UK liaison for the Cold War Museum Berlin Chapter, said: "I have major concerns about the Glenn Miller Memorial and I fear for its safety."
He wants it moved to a new spot away from the holiday complex but still on the former World War Two American Air Force base.
Wansford Parish Council objected over fears of increased traffic through the village already affected by lorries and cars accessing the industrial estate next to the development.
Yarwell Parish Council was also concerned over traffic levels because the stretch of road to and from the A47 was already very busy.
The main concern of protesters signing the online petition was for a colony of dormice, which is a protected species.
There are also believed to be two extremely rare butterflies at Jack's Green - the purple emperor and black hairstreak - and the protected violet click beetle.
