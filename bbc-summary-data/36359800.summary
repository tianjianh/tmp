The third and final osprey chick of the season has hatched at the Loch of the Lowes nature reserve.

Watching volunteers and webcam viewers saw the chick hatch at the reserve near Dunkeld on Monday.
A webcam trained on the nest has been viewed almost 500,000 times since the female bird, nicknamed "Lassie", returned to the reserve in March.
The nesting pair of ospreys have been seen bringing back salmon and trout to feed the three chicks.
Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "We're delighted that our pair of ospreys has successfully hatched another brood of three chicks in their second season at Loch of the Lowes.
"They are excellent parents and plenty of food is being brought back to the nest to help the hungry young ones quickly grow into adult birds."
Scottish Wildlife Trust said the male osprey, LM12, flew over the nest fighting off intruding ospreys and crows over the weekend.
