[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry votes to join West Midlands combined authority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry has officially agreed to join the proposed West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), following a city council vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councils controlling Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Solihull and Dudley have already backed the plan.
The aim is for the authority to be set up by April following a consultation including the government.
It would follow a similar formation to Greater Manchester Combined Authority.
Powers to be granted to the WMCA are still being negotiated but may include the ability to increase council tax and collect and spend business rates.
Coventry City Council's Labour group unanimously voted in favour of joining, but the Conservatives presented a motion calling for closer working with the county of Warwickshire.
The decision to join WMCA was passed by 32 votes to 12.
