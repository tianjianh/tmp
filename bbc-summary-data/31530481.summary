[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 68-year-old was found seriously injured and unconscious on Helvellyn in the Lake District by a search dog, early on Wednesday.
The man, from Penrith, Cumbria and described as "very experienced and well equipped", suffered a cardiac arrest during the rescue operation, which took more than four hours.
After being resuscitated, he was taken to hospital in Newcastle where he died.
His wife had alerted emergency services when he failed to return home on Tuesday.
The rescue operation involved more than 40 people from five teams and a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter.
Patterdale Mountain Rescue said "atrocious" weather conditions meant the chopper was forced to retreat to the Greenside Mines area where it waited until the rescuers were able to carry the man down the mountain on a stretcher.
Mike Blakey, Patterdale MRT team leader, said: "We would like to express our deepest sympathy to his wife, family and friends. He was well equipped and knew what he was doing in a place that he loved."
The man's identity has not yet been released.
