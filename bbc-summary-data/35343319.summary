[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People were admitted with diarrhoea and vomiting over the weekend and some have been confirmed as cases of norovirus.
Managers have stopped the admission of patients into rooms where people have the illness to stop it from spreading.
They said that move has slowed admissions from the emergency unit into the wider hospital.
Admissions to four wards have been stopped as a precautionary measure, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said.
