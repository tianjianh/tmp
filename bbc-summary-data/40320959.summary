[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident took place on Woodburn Road in Dalkeith at about 00:10.
No-one was injured and police, who want to trace a black saloon car seen in the area, said it did not appear that any damage was caused to the property.
Ch Insp Kenny Simpson said it was being treated as a "targeted incident" and added that there would be extra patrols in the area over the coming days.
"As part of our inquiries, we're urging anyone who may have seen suspicious behaviour in the area around midnight, or has any information about this, to get in touch," he said.
"We're particularly eager to trace a black, older saloon-type vehicle which was travelling in the area around this time and last seen heading in the direction of James Lean Avenue."
