Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said 25 firefighters were still damping down hotspots and observing the area.
Most of the fire engines left at about midnight, after 75 firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze at its height.
The Forestry Commission said the hot weather was a "contributing factor".
The fire started at about 13:40 BST off the B1107 between Thetford and Brandon, near Kingfisher Lake.
Derek Sim, fire station manager at Thetford, said he expected crews to remain on site for the rest of Thursday.
"The fire got into the undergrowth and it's quite difficult to deal with when it's in the undergrowth," he said.
"It's very dry, the wind is just picking up and the temperatures are expected to rise again today.
"It's mostly been undergrowth damage although some of the lower levels of the trees have been damaged by the fire."
Roger Woods, communications manager for the Forestry Commission, said on Wednesday the weather was a "contributing factor" and they were on "high alert".
The site is Forestry Commission land and was planted with Corsican pine in 1988.
The forest's series of concerts will go ahead as planned as the blaze affected a different part of the woodland.
A fire investigation into the cause is to be launched.
