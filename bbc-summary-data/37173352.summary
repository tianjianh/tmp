An Isle of Man rider has set four world land speed records on a motorcycle he built in his basement.

Bike enthusiast Paul Hodgson set the records at Bonneville Speed Week in Utah between 13 and 19 August on the machine he designed and built at his Lonan home.
He said he was "very tired, happy and content" with his achievements.
The former British sprint champion's fastest speed was more than 181mph (291 km/h).
Mr Hodgson, who was also chief engineer when a Manx team broke a 33-year-old speed record in 2012, saw his records come in four separate categories of the modified 500cc class, based on fuel type, frame and streamlining.
The Manx Gas Service technician was responsible for the design, electronics and all engineering work on the bike, which started as a 1994 Yamaha FZR600.
He originally shipped the bike to the US to take part in last year's Bonneville event, but it was cancelled, leaving him separated from machine for a "frustrating" 12 months.
The 44-year-old said: "It was a little frustrating having a bike sitting in the USA for so long without being able to improve it.
"I have many new ideas and probably would have changed a number of things if the bike had been on the same continent as me."
He added that he believed the bike could achieve over 200mph (321 km/h) and was planning further record attempts.
