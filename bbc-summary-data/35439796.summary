The 12 June elite race starts with a 1500m swim at Roundhay Park before a 42.5km cycle route into the city centre, ending in a 10km run towards the finish line in Millennium Square.
About 5,000 amateurs will tackle a similar route on the same date.
The city was officially placed on the 2016 series' calendar in May, replacing London as the UK venue.
Other stages on the series include Yokohama in Japan, Stockholm in Sweden and Cape Town in South Africa.
Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, from Horsforth, are expected to take part in the elite race, which is being held in the afternoon following the conclusion of the amateur event.
Alistair said: "The multi-lap bike course goes into the heart of the city centre, making it really technical and spectator-friendly, with plenty of opportunities to watch the racing."
Following a swim section in Waterloo Lake, competitors will ride through Roundhay, Moortown, Meanwood, Weetwood, Headingley, Woodhouse and the city centre.
Four laps of the city centre on foot will end at the finish line in Millennium Square.
Roads around the route are expected to close by 05:00 on the day of the event and will be closed for a minimum of 12 hours.
