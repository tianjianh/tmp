However, goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg is out of Friday's game because of a groin problem.
Watford's Jose Holebas and Ben Watson are available after recovering from respective foot and groin injuries.
Tom Cleverley is ineligible to face the Toffees under the terms of his loan deal, while Miguel Britos and Craig Cathcart are still out.
Steve Bower: "Only Liverpool and Chelsea have won at Goodison Park in the Premier League since Ronald Koeman arrived, and the Everton boss will want that record in tact after their final home game of the season.
"A win would see Everton record their highest points tally at home in 27 years and end a run of one point from nine before they embark on their summer recruitment drive.
"Having lost five consecutive away games without scoring a single goal, Watford don't look one of their more problematic opponents.
"The season has faded away for Walter Mazzarri's side and, with Chelsea and Manchester City still to play, they will be thankful that their points are already on the board."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman on Ross Barkley's future: "The board is already working for a while to persuade him to stay but it's up to the player.
"We need an answer before the end of next week or we will sell the player.
"If you need so much time then you have doubts.
"I like to work with players who like to stay. We're already trying to get players who want to play in the front positions for next season."
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri on his side's recent poor form: "West Ham lost five in a row, West Bromwich Albion lost four; these periods can happen. Of course, I hope for it to not happen, and I don't like it.
"Let's not forget, when we had a complete squad, we reached seventh in the Premier League. We were 10th for the majority with a fully-fit side.
"In some seasons unexpected things can happen. We reached 40 points with six games left, and now we will see how well we finish."
