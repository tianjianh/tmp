[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mark Jones appointed chief executive of Goals Soccer Centres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals Soccer Centres has selected a veteran leisure industry figure to lead the company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Jones, 55, is leaving the Rank Group, where he led Grosvenor Casinos, to become chief executive of the five-a-side football company on 1 July.
The appointment follows a major review by Goals of its operations and the firm's performance in recent years.
It was set up after East Kilbride-based Goals reported its first annual loss in 12 years.
The company currently operates 46 centres in the UK and one in California.
Goals launched a search for a new chief executive in January after announcing that former incumbent Keith Rogers would relocate to the US to become president of its American business.
Mr Jones previously held a number of senior roles in the leisure industry. He is a former managing director of Mecca Bingo, chairman and chief executive of Premium Bars and Restaurants and chief executive of Yates Group.
Goal chairman Nick Basing said: "I am delighted Mark is joining to lead the company through its next phase of development.
"Mark has an exceptional and experienced track record of managing leisure brands and growing businesses."
Mr Jones said: "I am delighted to be joining Goals.
"Whilst the company has experienced its recent issues, it remains an excellent business with significant potential both here in the UK and in the US.
"I look forward to working with the Goals team and driving the business forward."
