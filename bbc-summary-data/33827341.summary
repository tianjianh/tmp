[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men are being sought in connection with two armed robberies in Edinburgh and Hillend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first happened at 06:40 at Gilmerton Newsagents on Drum Street.
One of the men stayed with a motorbike while the other two held up the shop with a bladed weapon before leaving with a three-figure sum.
Meanwhile, three men on a motorbike stole cigarettes at knifepoint from a Esso petrol station on the A702 Biggar Road, Hillend, at about 07:50.
As before, one man stayed with the bike while the other two entered the premises. They were wearing hoodies and scarves over their faces and spoke with local accents.
The men in the first robbery were last seen turning into Ferniehall Drive and then onto Old Dalkeith Road heading in the direction of Sheriffhall.
A major investigation is now underway involving specialist police units including air support and dog handlers.
Police are appealing for help from the public.
Det Insp Steven Bertram, of Police Scotland, said: "We believe both incidents are linked and, due to the brazen nature in which they were carried out, officers are eager to arrest all three men and ensure they are brought to justice.
"Traffic in this area of the city would be building up around the time of these offences and I am sure the sight of three men travelling at speed on a motorbike would have caught the attention of passing motorists.
