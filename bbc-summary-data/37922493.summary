[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prop Hill, 29, who is currently playing for England in the Four Nations, joined Wolves from Leigh in 2012 and has agreed a new five-year deal until 2021.
Academy product Currie, 22, played for Ireland at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and has signed a deal until 2020.
Both players were named in the Super League Dream Team last season for their performances.
"It's fantastic to have extended my contract," Hill told the club website. "There's no better place to be than here at the moment."
Currie added: "The club must have appreciated what I did last year as they approached me this off-season and it was impossible to say no to signing an extension."
