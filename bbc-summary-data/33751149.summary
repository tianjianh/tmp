The fire at the house at Hazel View was reported to police at about 05:00 BST on Sunday.
Jennifer Dornan, a mother-of-three, was found dead at the scene. Police said the cause of the fire is being investigated.
Witnesses said flames could be seen billowing through the house from miles away.
Tanya Watson, a friend of the woman, said: "She was the life and soul of everywhere she went - there's guys here this morning paying tribute to her who have only met her once, she made that much impact on somebody's life as soon as she entered it.
"This is  huge loss to our community, she was involved in everything, every aspect, from community centres to youth centres she was involved and her kids were heavily involved, she put herself out there and made herself known and she was perfect."
Another friend, Andrea Gallagher, said: "She was just so bubbly and outgoing, she was just a best friend to everybody.
"If you ever needed your kids minded she'd have said ' no problem, just drop them in, I'll keep them overnight'.
"Anything, she'd have done it for you,"
Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Jennifer McCann said: "People here are just devastated, the community, the family .
"I've been speaking with the young woman's family - this is a mother of three young children, to die so tragically in this way, it's just beyond words."
