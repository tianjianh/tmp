It dropped 0.4% to 2,088.66, dragged down by a fall in Facebook shares and continued uncertainty over next week's US presidential election.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq share index also dropped for the eighth day running, falling 0.9% to 5,058.41.
The Dow Jones finished 0.2% lower at 17,930.67. All three indexes started the day higher before slumping back.
"It's a pretty simple equation: uncertainty goes up, stock market goes down," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds.
US stocks have suffered this week amid a narrowing of Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her rival Donald Trump.
On Wall Street, Facebook was down 6% after it reported weaker than hoped for figures overnight and warned advertising growth would slow "meaningfully" next year.
Exercise tracking firm Fitbit was one of the heaviest fallers on Thursday - down 34% - after it made a weak earnings forecast.
Among the stocks bucking the trend was media giant 21st Century Fox, which jumped 7% after reporting better than expected earnings.
