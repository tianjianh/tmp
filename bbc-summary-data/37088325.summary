Murray, 29, beat Juan Martin Del Potro, 27, in Sunday's final in Rio to claim his second successive Olympic gold.
That win came weeks after his second Wimbledon title, with Murray also heavily involved in Great Britain's Davis Cup win last year.
"It's an incredible achievement what he's done and he's not going to stop there," Smith told BBC Scotland.

"He's so motivated. He's playing the best tennis of his career, results show that. His consistency this year has been absolutely exceptional. He works so hard.
"Every match means so much to him. He manages to win matches even when he's not playing his best level and that's such a skill.
"There's an awful lot to look forward to. He's at the peak of his career.
"We are very, very fortunate to have him. He is incredible to have around."
Smith said watching fellow Scot Murray claim his second gold was "an emotional moment".
The world number two also won the 2012 US Open and has reached the final in both the Australian Open and the French Open.
Spaniard Rafael Nadal and American Andre Agassi have won the 'Golden Slam' of all four Grand Slam events and Olympic gold.
"It's very, very difficult," said Smith of Murray's chances of repeating Nadal and Agassi's feat.
"Andy would be the first to tell you that. Winning any Slam is an incredible feat. There's so many good players out there.
"Every single Slam, he's there - winning or making finals or latter rounds. He'll have opportunities.
"He will not think that way. It's about the process behind it.
"Because of his meticulous work ethic and dedication to what he does, he will produce opportunities to go on and win more majors."
