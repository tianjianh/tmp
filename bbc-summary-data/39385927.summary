Guernsey FC striker Ross Allen says he is "not optimistic" about playing in the Muratti final in May after returning from travelling abroad.

The 30-year-old is his club's record scorer with 224 goals in 203 games, but has not played since early November.
"I feel fit, but there's a match fitness and an aerobic fitness that will take time to get back," he said.
"It was so good to get away - this Guernsey FC project has been very intense for five or six years."
Allen resumed training with the Isthmian League Division One South side this week and he is likely to be named on the bench for the trip to Chatham Town on Saturday.
The Green Lions are only one place above the relegation zone, but have a seven-point buffer with seven games of the season remaining.
"I've got no right to earn a place at all in the next few weeks because these boys have been here doing it all season and a lot of them are in a lot better shape than me," Allen told to BBC Radio Guernsey.
"The Muratti - hopefully I can work hard and be in with a shout, but I'm not too optimistic about that.
"It's more the Island Games for me - I think I've got time to get ready for that and that's a big goal, a big incentive, a bonus at the end of the season."
