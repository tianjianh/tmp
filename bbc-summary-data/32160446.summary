Construction growth 'slows' in March survey says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Growth in the UK's construction industry slowed in March, according to a survey by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Worries over who will govern following May's national elections hit expansion, according to the survey.
However, confidence rose to a nine-year high, it said.
The construction purchasing managers' index fell to 57.8 last month after a four-month high of 60.1 in February.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
Lost growth was most evident in the civil engineering sector, survey compiler Markit said.
Builders were delaying decisions before a new government emerges, it said. Employment in the sector rose at the slowest rate in more than a year.
Shortages of materials and subcontractors pushed up prices, the data suggest.
