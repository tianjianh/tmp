League of Ireland Premier Division: Cork City v Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City midfielder Barry McNamee is likely to miss Friday night's Premier Division match against leaders Cork City because of a hamstring injury.

Manager Kenny Shiels said he was 99% sure McNamee would not be fit and that there were also doubts over defenders Aaron Barry and Dean Jarvis.
Shiels is without Rory Patterson for about three months as the striker is recovering from a fractured ankle.
Derry are third in the table having won four of their first five league games.
Their only defeat was against Bray last week - their first match since the sudden death of team captain Ryan McBride.
Cork are six points clear at the top having won all seven of their fixtures.
Boss Shiels felt Derry played better in the defeat by Bray than in the four games they won.
"You can dominate a match for an hour and end up in the losing team," said Shiels.
"That is what happened last week - football is so unpredictable.
"We are positive about the performance and just ask for the same again against Cork."
