[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales striker Natasha Harding has left Women's Super League side Manchester City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harding joined City in March 2015 after her proposed move to Washington Spirit in the United States fell through when she was denied a visa.
The 26-year-old's exit comes after City signed Sweden striker Kosovare Asllani.
"To the Man City fans I want to say a special thanks and let you know how much your support has meant to me during my time at City" she tweeted.
"You made me feel welcome from day one and I appreciate everything you have done for me, I'll never forget it."
Harding spent five years at Cardiff City before switching to Bristol Academy in 2012.
She was appointed Wales vice-captain by manager Jayne Ludlow in 2015.
