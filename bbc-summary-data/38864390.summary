[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 1-1 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Debutant Josh Parker snatched a stoppage-time goal to clinch a late point for Gillingham against Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parker stepped off the bench to head home an equaliser after Remi Streete had earlier given the visitors a 49th-minute lead.
A poor first-half saw Vale's JJ Hooper miss when it was easier to score, stabbing an effort wide with Stuart Nelson out of his goal after a contested cross.
Despite the hosts beginning to impose themselves afterwards, they could not seriously trouble goalkeeper Leonardo Fasan, although there was hope for Gills after Ryan Jackson's low drive was deflected wide.
There was only one side seriously in it after the restart. Vale's second-half shape was more rigid, frustrating the tired-looking Gill and a deep corner saw Streete reach the ball first, guiding it into the net.
But Parker found himself unmarked in the box late on and his header rescued a point for Gillingham, who are still without a win in 2017, while their opponents are also still in the same position and one point further back.
