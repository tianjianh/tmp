France 2-1 Sweden

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Pogba and Dimitri Payet were on target as France marked the first anniversary of the Paris attacks with victory over Sweden in a World Cup qualifier at Stade de France.

A minute's silence was observed before kick-off to remember the 130 victims of the attacks on 13 November 2015.
Emil Forsberg's free-kick put Sweden ahead in the second half but Manchester United's Pogba quickly equalised.
Payet's 65th-minute winner moved France three points clear in Group A.
The West Ham midfielder had earlier set up the equaliser for Pogba, the world's most expensive player nodding home his team-mate's precise free-kick.
Payet capped a bright performance with the decisive goal, turning the ball in from close range after Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen fumbled.
Security was predictably tight at the national stadium two days short of the poignant anniversary, with around 1,200 stewards and 400 police officers deployed in and around the ground.
The minute's silence was observed in the presence of French president Francois Hollande, who was also present a year ago when three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the ground during a friendly against Germany - killing one and forcing the stadium into lockdown.
"We have to remember," Hollande told French television. "One year ago, almost to the day, we were here for a friendly game and three bombs were detonated, with one man being killed.
"We have to remember there were 130 people who died and hundreds of others who were injured. For them and for those who survived we must remember."
