Five of 14 routes experienced major disruption on Hogmanay.
Nearly all low level services via Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central were cancelled in the afternoon.
Some replacement bus services were later put in place.
ScotRail said the problems were caused by damage to overhead cables at Hyndland in Glasgow and apologised for the disruption.
Services passing through Hyndland have been suspended for the rest of Saturday.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: "There has been some overhead damage at Hyndland, one of the busiest junctions on the north Clyde so we've had to suspend services through Hyndland.
"We are trying to run some shuttle services to keep people moving.
"Services running through Hyndland to Queen Street low level station are suspended for the rest of the day.
"We apologise to customers."
