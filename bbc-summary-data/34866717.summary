Williams, England's most-capped player, and Nobbs have been sidelined through hamstring injuries, while Duggan returns from an ankle problem.
The Lionesses face Bosnia in Bristol on 29 November (15:30 GMT).
It will be their first home game since finishing third at this summer's World Cup in Canada.
The same squad will also travel to Duisburg to play Germany on Thursday, 26 November (17:00 GMT) in a friendly.
Manager Mark Sampson said: "2015 has been an amazing year for the team and our supporters, full of special memories for everyone involved.
"To end the year with a match in Germany, one of the biggest tests in women's football, and then the team's homecoming in Bristol against Bosnia is a fitting way to mark such a big year for the game."
