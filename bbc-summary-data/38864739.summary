Colchester United 2-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester boosted their play-off chances with a deserved win over Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts suffered a double injury blow early in the game when Frankie Kent and Lloyd Doyley were both forced off.
But they took an 18th-minute lead through Kurtis Guthrie, who netted with a low 25-yard drive after being found by Denny Johnstone.
Barnet goalkeeper Josh Vickers denied Craig Slater and Alex Wynter also went close, while at the other end Sam Walker produced a fine save to deny Curtis Weston from close range.
Colchester doubled their lead in the 42nd minute when Brennan Dickenson squeezed home his shot.
John Akinde headed home Mauro Vilhete's cross with four minutes remaining but it was too little, too late for the visitors.
