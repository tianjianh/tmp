Five Doncaster men admit Adam Szurgocinski killing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five men have admitted killing a man in a "sustained physical attack" in Doncaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Szurgocinski, 26, died in hospital after being attacked at a property in Jubilee Road on 14 September 2014.
Mateusz Halabura, 25, Pawel Wegorzewski, 20, Rafal Palinski, 29, Jaroslaw Owczarczyk, 32 and Sebastian Gurski, 30, from the Doncaster area, pleaded guilty to manslaughter midway through a trial at Leeds Crown Court.
They were charged with murder before.
Police said Mr Szurgocinski suffered a brain haemorrhage after being subjected to "a sustained physical attack".
Det Insp Sean Bird, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Questions about what happened to Adam that day have not been answered, as none of those accused have offered any explanation prior to admitting their guilt."
The force arrested 16 people on suspicion of murder in the months that followed Mr Szurgocinski's death.
A sixth man, Dariusz Bogusz, 32, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in February.
All six men will appear at Sheffield Crown Court for sentence on 6 May.
