The captain, who retired hurt on 60 with a back problem on the first day in Adelaide, returned to make 128.
"The way he played speaks words for the guy," said Steve Smith, who hit 162 not out as Australia reached 517-7.
The Test was delayed after Hughes, 25, died after being struck by a ball while playing for South Australia.
Clarke, 33, helped carry his team-mate's coffin and made an emotional speech at his funeral on 3 December.
Clarke, who received a standing ovation from the Adelaide Oval crowd after reaching three figures, celebrated his century by kissing his helmet and embracing Smith.
"He came out here and tried to do something for Hughesy," said Smith. "He certainly did that."
Smith also praised Clarke for his efforts over the past three weeks.
"It's been tough for all of us, but he's spent the whole time by Hughesy's family's side," said Smith. "Just the strength and courage he's showed throughout those times was unbelievable."
Australian batsman David Warner also hit a century on day one of the Test and dedicated it to Hughes.
The Test is the first in a four-match series, which ends in January.
