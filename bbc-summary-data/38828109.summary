The 21-year-old Somalian-born player also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance at Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court.
The offences took place on 9 September 2015 in Nelson Street, Glasgow.
Feruz - who is on loan at Swindon Town from his current club Chelsea - had his case continued until later this month for reports.
The former child refugee was tipped as a future star after joining Celtic aged 10.
The Parkhead club had successfully campaigned for him and his relatives to avoid deportation from Scotland.
But, after six years, Feruz left for Chelsea - and later reportedly downplayed Celtic's role in the deportation case.
He has since gone out on loan to several clubs, including Scottish Championship side Hibs.
