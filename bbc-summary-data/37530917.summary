Sunday's 10k and half-marathon races rounded off three days of action in Scotland's biggest mass participation running event.
Scotland's Callum Hawkins claimed victory in the half-marathon, setting a new Scottish record.
He is the first Scot to win the great Scottish Run since 1983.
Hawkins held off the challenge of the defending champion, Moses Kipsiro of Uganda, clocking a time of  60 minutes 22 seconds.
It rounded off a good season for Hawkins, who came ninth in the marathon at the Rio Olympics in the summer.
Kenya's Joel Kimutai came home in third ahead of England's Chris Thompson.
Fellow Kenyan, Betsy Saina, claimed victory in the women's race with a course record time of 67:20.
The half-marathon was set off by Commonwealth and Olympic medallists Charlie Flynn, Mark Bennett and Karen Bennett.
Olympic gold medal-winning cyclists Callum Skinner and Katie Archibald started the 10k event.
After heading off from George Square, the runners followed routes through the city before finishing in Glasgow Green.
