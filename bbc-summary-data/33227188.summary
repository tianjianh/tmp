The Turkana and Samburu communities in northern Kenya have fought for decades over cattle, grazing rights and access to water.
About 15 people were killed in renewed clashes in May, local media reported.
The peace deal covers the same area where at least 42 police officers were killed in 2012 by cattle rustlers.
It was the deadliest attack on the police in Kenya since independence.
Communities living in and around Baragoi town in Samburu county have also agreed to return weapons stolen from police during the 2012 attack, Kenya's Capital FM reports.
The ceasefire between the minority Turkana community and the Samburu people, who make up 80% of the county's population, was signed after three days of negotiations between local community leaders, MPs and Kenya's National Cohesion and Integration Commission, it says.
