Sightseers have been urged to keep away from a dead whale and be aware of the tides.

The 46ft-long (14m) sperm whale died on Thursday after it was washed up alive on the shore near Hunstanton, Norfolk, hours earlier.
A cordon has been put around the animal and King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council said people should not touch it or let dogs near it.
It is "unlikely" the carcass will be removed over the weekend.
The council has also warned people not to collect and eat shellfish from the area and that water sports enthusiasts should be aware the sea quality could be affected.
It had consulted with Public Health England over the advice after another sperm whale was stranded last month.
Visitors urged to stay away from whale
In 2011 at the resort, a beached sperm whale - which is a protected species - had its teeth and jaw removed and put up for sale on Facebook.
"Anyone removing, or attempting to remove, parts of the whale could be committing a criminal offence," the council said in a statement.
The huge mammal is lying on land owned by the Le Strange family estate.
Estate representative Jonathan Fryer reiterated the council's advice and said he would ask people to "consider what they are coming to look at - it's a very sad event".
He said it was "unlikely" the bull's body would be removed over the weekend.
It is not yet known how the whale will be removed and where it will go as various organisations need to be consulted, he added.
A post-mortem examination was carried out on Friday, but Rob Deaville, from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, said it could takes months to "work out why these whales have come into the North Sea".
It is the 30th sperm whale to have died this year after becoming stranded on beaches in northern Europe and England.
