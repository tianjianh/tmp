[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council bin lorry driver in court over fatal crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council bin lorry driver has appeared in court charged with causing the death of an elderly man in an electric wheelchair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Hamilton is accused of causing the death of 80-year-old Peter Wills by driving carelessly in a Stirling Council bin lorry near Dunblane.
The pensioner died at the scene of the crash in December last year.
Hamilton, 43, made no plea or declaration during a private hearing at Stirling Sheriff Court.
The Bonnybridge resident faces a single charge alleging that he "carried out a reversing manoeuvre without taking adequate steps to ensure it was safe to do so", resulting in the vehicle striking Mr Wills and causing fatal injuries.
The incident is said to have happened on Sheriffmuir Road on 3 December, 2014.
The case was continued for further examination, and Hamilton will re-appear in court at a later date.
