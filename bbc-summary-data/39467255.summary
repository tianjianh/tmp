Northern Ireland's Jonathan Rea made it five World Superbikes wins from five by snatching victory in race one in Spain after Welsh rival Chaz Davies crashed.

Davies had just regained the lead on the penultimate lap in Aragon when he slid off to allow Rea to extend his championship advantage to 47 points.
It is a commanding lead for 30-year-old Rea who is aiming to become the first rider to win three WSB titles in a row.
Italy's Marco Melandri was second in Saturday's race and Tom Sykes third.
Englishman Sykes is Rea's closest rival in the championship standings with Davies now in third.
Thirty-year-old Davies, who had started on pole, was able to walk away after his accident and was clearly frustrated about losing a winning position so late in the race after a thrilling duel with the back-to-back champion.
The second race of the Spanish round takes place on Sunday at 12:00 BST.
"The only way I was going to win was if Chaz made mistakes," said Rea.
"He was really strong in that last sector so someone was looking down on me today. I hope he is OK.
"I had a sore throat yesterday, and was bunged up today, so this win feels like my best ever.
"It was very even today and I'm sure tomorrow is going to be another great fight."
