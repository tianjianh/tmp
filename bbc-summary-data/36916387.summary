Fertility services will remain in Hartlepool, following a  battle between the council and health bosses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Licensed fertility treatment, including IVF, was under threat at University Hospital Hartlepool due to staff shortages.
The council claimed a lack of proper consultation and was granted a High Court injunction stopping the closure.
Following a consultation, the unit will remain in the town but will be run by an alternative provider.
Deepak Dwarakanath, from North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust, said:  "We understand this has been a difficult time for our staff, patients and their families.
"The outcome of the consultation means that patients will continue to receive treatment in Hartlepool and we are reassured that patients will continue receive the best possible care in the future."
Councillor Christopher Akers-Belcher, leader of Hartlepool Council, said: "This is a victory for democracy and common sense.
"Everyone can now look forward to a new provider delivering such a hugely important service to the people of Hartlepool and beyond."
