Filmed on his phone, Rurik Jutting describes how he raped and tortured Sumarti Ningsih before killing her.
Mr Jutting pleaded not guilty to the murder of two Indonesian women in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He did plead guilty to manslaughter, but that has been rejected by the prosecution.
Police found the bodies of Sumarti Ningsih and Seneng Mujiasih in Mr Jutting's luxury flat in November 2014.
Prosecutors say his first victim, Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was tortured for three days after arriving at the flat in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district on 25 October.
In one video shown to the jury on Tuesday, he is heard asking her if she loved him before torturing her.
"Do you want me to hit you? If you say 'Yes', I hit you once. If you say 'No' I hit you twice," he is heard saying.
"If you scream I will punch you, you understand?"

The only sound that can be heard from Sumarti Ningsih is a muted squeal, reporters in court said.
The footage was shown to jurors on individual screens. Although reporters in court could not see the footage they could hear the audio.
Clips then shown to the jury appeared to show Mr Jutting saying how he had killed Sumarti Ningsih in the bathroom at his flat.
"My name is Rurik Jutting. About five minutes ago I just killed, murdered, this woman here," he says, pointing the camera down briefly to show the body.
"I've held her captive since early Saturday, I've raped her repeatedly, I tortured her, tortured her badly," he says.
He then talks about using cocaine and prostitutes in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
At one point he said he fantasised about returning to the UK, kidnapping teenage students and forcing them to become his sex slaves.
The BBC's Danny Vincent in court, says the Cambridge-educated banker sat silently looking away from the screen playing the video.
When police arrived at the flat on 1 November 2014 they found the body of Seneng Mujiasih, 26, with knife wounds to her neck and buttock.
The body of Sumarti Ningsih was found in a suitcase, decomposing.
Mr Jutting faces a possible life sentence if convicted in what is Hong Kong's biggest murder trial in years.
The case is being closely watched by migrant workers in Hong Kong and a group campaigning for their rights has staged a protest outside the court.
Mr Jutting worked at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch as a securities trader up until a few days before the discovery of the bodies.
