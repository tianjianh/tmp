The remains, missing the head and arms, were discovered in a lay-by just off the A628 at Tintwistle on 10 October.
No DNA match has been found, but the man was 18-40 years old, with white or light-coloured skin and 5ft 8ins to 5ft 11ins (1.73m to 1.80m) tall.
A picture of a suitcase similar to the one used has been released and officers have appealed for information.
Police said they believe the remains were dumped sometime between 21:00 BST and midnight on Sunday, 9 October.
They said inquiries were being widened to include missing people cases from areas including Manchester, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Cheshire, Merseyside and Staffordshire.
The pictured suitcase was described as a 196 litre black Samsonite Rhapsody Stockton.
Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam said: "We have had more than 60 calls from people coming forward with information, or suggesting who this man may be.
"We're grateful to these callers but unfortunately, we have still not been able to identify the man.
"He could have gone missing from anywhere in the country, but simply hasn't been reported missing by those who know him."
