Cooper said his goodbyes to his Glenavon team-mates at Tuesday's Premiership match against Ballinamallard at Mourneview Park.
"I'll be heading off to take up a two and a half year soccer scholarship and study for a degree at the University of New Hampshire," said Cooper.
"It's an opportunity I can't really turn down at this stage."
Speaking to Glenavon's website, Cooper added: "I hope to get selected for the College team which is the top division of college soccer in the States and the University has a few affiliated teams from the MLS."
Cooper thanked Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton and chairman Adrian Teer for their support since moving from Ballyclare Comrades in July 2015.
"The club took a risk on me when they signed me a couple of years ago so I've a lot to thank everybody at the club for.
"I've some great memories and of course winning the Irish Cup is the stand-out one for me. I'm sad to see it end but it's a new chapter in my life that I have to take."
