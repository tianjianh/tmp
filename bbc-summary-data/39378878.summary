Four boxes on the Horsendale Estate in Nuthall, Nottinghamshire, have been covered up for more than a week as they cannot be emptied or checked.
The Nottingham Post reported residents have complained about the inconvenience and lack of information.
Royal Mail said specialist new keys had to be made but it was hoped this would be done "in the next few days".
Neil Mitchell, who works in a newsagents, said: "It came as a complete surprise, the first we knew of it was when people came in to ask what had happened.
"Lots of people are confused and annoyed as we have recently lost the local post office and the nearest open box is more than a mile away."

Broxtowe borough councillor Paul Simpson, who lives in the affected area, said: "It is not satisfactory. The open boxes are, for some people, a car ride away, maybe a bus ride.
"It is inconvenient and has taken too long to sort out."
A Royal Mail spokesperson said: "Leaflets were put on on the boxes to explain what had happened, that they were out of service after the keys were misplaced.
"We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience this may have caused."
