Cleethorpes couple face trial over school absence for weddings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple accused of taking their son out of primary school to attend two family weddings have appeared in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The parents, from Cleethorpes, each received fines for their son's eight-day absence from a North East Lincolnshire school during term time.
They took him out of school last June to attend the weddings.
At Grimsby Magistrates Court, both denied two charges of their son failing to attend regularly at school.
In court, the pair said they believed their son had an attendance record of more than 90%. But the prosecution said it was at 87%.
The pair are due to stand trial at the same court on 24 March.
In a statement, North East Lincolnshire Council said: "In consultation with the local Magistrates Court and our legal team, we have introduced a 90 per cent threshold.
"It is up to head teachers to decide if an absence from school is authorised or unauthorised."
