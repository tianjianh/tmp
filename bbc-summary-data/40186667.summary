Andy Hill was performing aerobatics when the jet crashed on to the A27 in Sussex during the Shoreham Air Show on 22 August 2015.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said cockpit footage showed the plane "responding to the pilot's control inputs".
Mr Hill has been the subject of a manslaughter investigation by police.
The pilot was first interviewed by Sussex Police in December 2015.
In a statement, which did not name Mr Hill, Sussex Police said: "A 53-year-old man from Hertfordshire has been re-interviewed by officers from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team investigating the Shoreham air crash.
"He attended a voluntary interview under caution at a police station in Sussex on Thursday, 1 June."
In its final report on the disaster, the AAIB listed a series of failings including poor risk assessments.
Investigators said the jet crashed in a fireball because it was too low to perform an aerobatic manoeuvre.
A pre-inquest review into the deaths of the 11 men will take place on 20 June at the West Sussex Coroner's Court in Crawley, but no evidence will be heard.
