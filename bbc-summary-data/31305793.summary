[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newsround's new website better on tablets and phones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You'll have noticed our website's looking a bit different - here's why.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More and more of you are using tablets and phones to browse online.
The number of children doing this is roughly doubling every year. One in three UK kids aged 5-15 now has their own tablet.
What that means is that websites need to make sure they work as well on smaller screens as they do on computers and laptops.
So this week, Newsround and CBBC have got brand new sites.
There are still the same stories and clips that you're used to seeing on Newsround, but now it all works much better on smaller screens, and it's got our new Newsround look too.

So stop reading about it, and go and have a look!
We'd love to know what you think too, so why not drop us an email and let us know?
Send us your first impressions of the new website to newsroundcomments@bbc.co.uk.
You must ask your parent, teacher or guardian for permission before you send us a comment.
We may show your comment on our website or in our TV bulletins. We'll show your first name and which town you're from - but we won't use your details for anything else.
