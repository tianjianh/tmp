With a 1-0 first-leg lead, City scored an away goal in the 64th minute when England striker Toni Duggan's superb swivel and shot went in off the post.
Nanna Christiansen stabbed the ball in moments later to make it 1-1.
But Brondby rarely looked likely to overturn a resilient City side's 2-1 aggregate lead after that.
The English league champions would have had to concede a further two goals to be knocked out and, in the end, were deserved winners and will join Europe's elite in the last eight in March.
City - the last remaining British side in this season's competition - had the two best chances of the first half but Nikita Parris shot over from 15 yards shortly after Duggan's close-range header had been brilliantly saved on the line.
After the break, midfielder Jill Scott saw a powerful header from a corner cleared off the line before a sweet half-volley from Parris clipped the woodwork, as the visitors pushed for the tie's decisive goal.
And Duggan found it soon afterwards, showing fine technique to send an excellent shot on the turn in off the post from outside the area.
Brondby striker Christansen gave the hosts hope of a comeback by scoring from six yards - the first goal to be scored against City in European football.
But a late fightback with further goals would have been unrepresentative of the level of control Nick Cushing's side had on the tie over the two legs, with the English midfield trio of Scott, Isobel Christiansen and Keira Walsh impressing throughout.
