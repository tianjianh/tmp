Evans had been due to remain with the Saddlers until 26 January but was recalled from his loan on Saturday.
The 21-year-old, who scored four goals in 16 appearances on loan at Walsall, moves on a three-and-a-half-year deal.
"I'm sure he will become an even better player working in our environment at Reading," said manager Brian McDermott.
