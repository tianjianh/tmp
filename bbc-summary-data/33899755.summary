Tom Brady courtroom sketch inspires mirth online

A New York artist's courtroom sketch of New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady has drawn mirth on Twitter, with hundreds of users poking fun at the not-so-recognisable likeness.

Twitter users pasted the sketch on everything from Edvard Munch's The Scream to an image from the film E.T.
The online uproar prompted the artist Jane Rosenberg to ask for forgiveness.
"I apologise to Tom Brady if I didn't make him as good looking as he really is," Ms Rosenberg said.
"I'm probably going to go home and feel terrible," added Ms Rosenberg, who has been a courtroom artist for more than 35 years.
Mr Brady was in a New York court on Wednesday fighting a decision by the National Football League (NFL) to suspend him for four games.
The NFL claims Brady broke league rules by using deflated footballs during a playoff game last season. Deflated balls can be easier to catch, giving a player an unfair advantage.
Married to supermodel Gisele Bundchen, Brady is known for his movie star good looks - something that many felt the sketch failed to capture.
"Based on these sketches, Brady was involved in some sort of horrible accident before the hearing," tweeted Boston Globe sports reporter Peter Abraham.
