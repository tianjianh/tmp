A care home where faeces were found on a sofa and a window sill is among nine sites rated inadequate by inspectors.

Walls and furniture at Lofthouse Grange and Lodge in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, were also stained, damaged and dirty, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said.
The watchdog has just released details of visits to 41 sites across the north of England.
Homes in Blackpool, Hartlepool, Keighley, Preston and Rotherham were also deemed inadequate.
The CQC said interactions between staff and residents were good when it visited Lofthouse Grange last year but identified several areas of the home that needed cleaning.
"The service was not safe. Many areas of the home were dirty and unhygienic. We found faeces under a seat on a settee, and faeces were also found on the window ledge in a small lounge," the report said.
"Furniture was stained and dining chairs were damaged. Walls in the dining rooms had food stains on them and food debris was found down the side of kitchen cabinets."
A spokeswoman for Orchard Care Homes, which runs the site, said a "robust" plan was in place to address issues highlighted in the report.
She added: "We are not complacent and will continue to monitor the home very carefully through our own rigorous internal inspection and compliance processes."
Other sites deemed inadequate included Royd Hill Nursing Home in Keighley, where inspectors found people were not being given enough fluids, and Orchard Lodge Care Home in Blackpool, where sliding bolts were discovered on the outside of bedroom doors.
The Spinney Residential Home in Leeds and Aadams Residential Care Home in Preston were both given the lowest rating for failing to protect people from the risk of potential abuse.
Following its inspection, Aadams management decided to close the home "in the best interests" of residents, the report said.
Of the sites recently inspected, 20 were given a "good" rating and 12 "required improvement".
Debbie Westhead, CQC deputy chief inspector, said: "Whenever we find a service to be inadequate, we will consider taking further action on behalf of the people who use the service."
