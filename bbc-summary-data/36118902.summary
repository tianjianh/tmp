Ayr United 0-3 Airdrieonians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Airdrieonians missed out on a chance of promotion, despite beating Ayr United in Scottish League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stranraer's win over Cowdenbeath prevented Airdrie joining Ayr and Peterhead in the promotion play-offs.
Alan Lithgow opened the scoring from close range early on before Dylan Mackin fired into the top corner for the visitors' second.
Sean Crighton added gloss to the scoreline in the second half and Ayr will face Peterhead in the play-offs.
