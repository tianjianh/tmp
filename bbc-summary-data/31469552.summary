BBC Radio Derby has launched the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal to help protect children from skin cancer.

The appeal has been prompted by Colin's diagnosis with stage four melanoma in 2013.
The presenter's openness and optimism as he battles the disease has touched thousands of listeners.
He said the appeal could make a difference in helping fight back against the disease.
The BBC is working with the Derby Telegraph and charity Skcin, which specialises in skin cancer prevention.
The appeal has been set up to help educate children in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire about how to stay safe in the sun.
Colin has worked at BBC Radio Derby for more than 10 years.
In that time he has been a news reporter, Derby County commentator, and presented hundreds of programmes, most recently the breakfast show.
In 2001, a dermatologist confirmed Colin had skin cancer.
"I was terrified," he said. "At that age, you're invincible. Or so you think."
The cancer was cut out at a hospital in Birmingham, regular check-ups followed and was effectively discharged after five years without any reoccurrence.
He said: "Life was good, I was cancer free, healthy and happy."
However, one morning he woke up to discover a lump under his groin and it has since spread to his brain.
He was told in November he only had months to live.
"I haven't given up hope of a 'miracle' cure. The longer this disease can be kept stable, the more chance I have.
"New groundbreaking treatments are being introduced giving fresh hope to patients and their families.
"There's still so much work to be done and this appeal could make a real difference in helping fight back against this brutal disease."
