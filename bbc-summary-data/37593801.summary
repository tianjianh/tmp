[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-1 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Ellis Harrison volleyed an 90th-minute winner as Bristol Rovers came from behind to beat Gillingham in a competitive League One clash at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker met a left-wing cross from fellow replacement Cristian Montano at the far post and hammered a right-footed shot in off goalkeeper Jonathan Bond from the corner of the six-yard box.
Gillingham had taken a 62nd-minute lead when Rovers failed to defend a long throw from the right and Josh Wright popped up unmarked at the far post to fire low past Kelle Roos.
Man of the match Chris Lines grabbed an 82nd-minute equaliser, exchanging passes with Matt Taylor and breaking through the middle before coolly shooting past Bond.
A drab first half saw Rovers go closest after 21 minutes when a good move involving Charlie Colkett and Taylor ended with Stuart Sinclair firing wide of the near post.
Gillingham defended well, but were unable to create much going forward, despite some promising approach play often inspired by the industrious Bradley Dack.
