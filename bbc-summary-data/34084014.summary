The 21-year-old took 1-35 on his England debut in Monday's five-run Twenty20 victory over Australia.
Ipswich-born Topley took 36 wickets in 19 limited-overs matches for Essex this season, but was limited to just two appearances in the County Championship.
He has taken 125 wickets in first-class cricket at an average of 25.78 since making his debut in 2011.
"I am delighted to be joining Hampshire, a club I have admired from a distance for some time," Topley told the Hampshire website.
"I know I am not the finished article and hope that, at 21 years old, Hampshire can help me develop into a regular international bowler in the coming years."
Hampshire director of cricket Giles White hopes the county can help Topley realise his ambitions both domestically and internationally.
"He's a young player with plenty of potential," he told BBC Radio Solent. "We're looking forward to working with him and obviously he has got a lot of ambition having played for the England T20 squad.
"He wants to play Test cricket, so hopefully we can help him realise his ambition as well as play a big part in our future over the years."
