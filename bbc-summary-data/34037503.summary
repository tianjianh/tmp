The slip happened on Heol Y Beiliau in Llantrisant at about 18:10 BST on Sunday.
Head of control at South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Jennie Griffiths, tweeted that debris was "falling into homes and placing pressure on them".
The council said the suspected cause was the collapse of a retaining wall at one of the properties.
Emergency planning and building control officers remained at the scene on Monday morning.
Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said: "As a precautionary measure, emergency services evacuated a number of homes last night, with the residents moving in with friends and family.
"These households have not yet returned to their addresses and council emergency planning officers are meeting with those affected.
"A council structural engineer is also on site to assess the situation."
