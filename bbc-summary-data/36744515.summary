All-Ireland SFC qualifiers: Monaghan, Cavan, Derry and Fermanagh all in action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Football qualifiers continue on Saturday with Monaghan and Cavan playing after their Ulster SFC defeats and Derry and Fermanagh also in action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cavan boss Terry Hyland recalls Seanie Johnston, Padraig Faulkner, Ciaran Brady and Liam Buchanan for their game against Carlow at Breffni Park.
Thomas Mallon, Chrissy McKaigue and Ciaran McFaul return to the Derry team for the tussle with Meath at Owenbeg.
Monaghan face Longford at Clones with Fermanagh against Mayo at Castlebar.
The Farney County may face a tougher task than Cavan in regrouping from the Ulster semi-final replay defeat last weekend.
Longford may have needed extra-time to account for a woefully out-of-form Down at Newry two weeks ago but the Leinster county were full value for their victory.
For their part, Monaghan were decidedly second best against Donegal in the provincial semi-final last weekend even though they were only a point behind at the finish.
Malachy O'Rourke, who has yet to name his team, has the job of rallying his side after they lost their Ulster title and it may prove no easy task against the Longford side led by inspirational skipper Mickey Quinn.
Cavan shipped five goals in their defeat by Tyrone last weekend in an uncharacteristically sloppy defensive display but they should regroup to see off Carlow.
The inclusion of Faulkner, Brady, Buchanan and the mercurial Johnston sees James McEnroe, Niall Murray, Martin Reilly and David Givney dropping out.
Damian Barton's Derry changes mean that Mickey Conlon, Neil Forrester and Liam McGoldrick drop out of the side that defeated Louth.
Meath were not disgraced in their 0-21 to 0-11 Leinster semi-final defeat by Dublin but Derry will still believe that they are capable of overcoming the Royals.
James Kielt hit 1-9 in Derry's 1-18 to 2-10 win over Louth three weeks ago and Oak Leaf fans will hope the Kilrea man can have another influential afternoon.
The pick of Saturday's six qualifiers is Fermanagh's tussle with Mayo at Castlebar as the home side aim to bounce back from their surprise Connacht semi-final defeat by Galway to see off Pete McGrath's Ernemen.
Most pundits are tipping Mayo to keep their All-Ireland title hopes alive but the noises from the Fermanagh camp suggest they are convinced that they can pile more misery on Stephen Rochford's squad.
Mayo will also go into the contest minus midfielder Tom Parsons who tore a hamstring in training in midweek while Ger Cafferkey and Jason Gibbons also remain out with Chris Barrett and Conor Loftus also unlikely to feature despite returning to training after injury.
In contrast, Fermanagh appear to have no major injury worries, apart from long-term absentee, Ryan McCluskey.
Cavan: R Galligan; K Brady, R Dunne, P Faulkner; F Flanagan, C Moynagh, C Brady; T Corr, L Buchanan; D McVeety, G McKiernan, K Clarke; C Mackey, E Keating, S Johnston.
Derry: T Mallon; G McKinless, C McKaigue, K McKaigue; C McFaul, B Rogers, C Mullan; C McAtamney, N Holly; D Heavron, C Bradley, E Brown; J Kielt, E McGuckin, M Lynch.
