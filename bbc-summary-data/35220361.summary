It joins Vancouver, Reykjavik and Amsterdam in the Rough Guides list of the best cities to visit in 2016.
A Â£25m revamp of the centre of Hull is under way, in preparation for hosting the UK City of Culture event in 2017.
Martin Green, chief executive of Hull's City of Culture organisers, said the guide was "ahead of the curve".
He said the city was "going through great positive change".

"I think this is a great recognition that Hull is a city changing and on the up," said Mr Green.
"Like a lot of cities of its type Hull has suffered economically, but I think there is a lot going on here to change that and it's not just about the fact we are the UK City of Culture in 17."
"They [Rough Guides] like to get ahead of the curve and signpost what's coming up."
Hull was the only UK city to make it on to the top 10 list.
The guide described Hull as having "atmospheric old-timey pubs, eight excellent museums and a picturesque Old Town with cobbled streets".
