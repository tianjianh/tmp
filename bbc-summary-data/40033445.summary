Joe Mattock: Rotherham United defender signs new two-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Joe Mattock has signed a new two-year deal with Rotherham following their relegation to League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mattock, 27, made 37 appearances for the Millers this season as they finished bottom of the Championship.
The left-back joined in June 2015 from Sheffield Wednesday, having also played for West Brom and Leicester.
He follows Jonson Clarke-Harris in committing to the club, but Richard Wood and Richie Smallwood are yet to decide, having been offered new deals.
Rotherham released Lee Camp, Stephen Kelly, Joel Ekstrand, Kelvin Wilson, Tom Thorpe and Chris Dawson earlier this month.
