Call for national parks to be 'dark-sky destinations'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new project is seeking to promote national parks as dark-sky destinations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Discovery in the Dark Wales website includes advice on discovering new adventures beyond stargazing and astronomy.
It is produced by the Brecon Beacons, Pembrokeshire Coast and Snowdonia national park authorities.
Organisers said it could lengthen the tourism season beyond the summer months and limit light pollution.
Activities include astrophotography and wildlife-based adventures.
Hannah Buck of Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority said: "This project aims to make everyone aware of the potential benefits that lie in the starry skies above them."
The project was funded by Visit Wales as part of the Welsh Government's tourism strategy.
