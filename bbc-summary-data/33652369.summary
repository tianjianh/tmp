The vessel had reportedly been hired for an engagement party and was sailing north of Cairo when it was hit by a cargo ship late on Wednesday.
A number of children were among the dead, including four babies.
Rescuers are continuing their search for other bodies and the captain of the cargo boat has been arrested.
It is not clear if the couple celebrating their engagement were among the casualties.
Family and friends gathered at the river to await news of their loved ones.
Ahmed Helmy said at least five of his relatives had died. "Two children are missing," he said, according to AFP news agency.
Many people chanted anti-government slogans on the banks of the river, as the search continued.
Traffic had been heavy along the Nile, as Egyptians celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
