Dog owners have been urged to keep their pets under control after a spate of fatal attacks on sheep in the Forest of Dean.

Philip Whitehouse, who farms in Mitcheldean, said he had lost 12 sheep in three dog attacks since July.
A Gloucestershire firm that trains dogs how to behave near farm animals said attacks were becoming more common.
Gloucestershire Police urged owners to keep their dogs on leads when near livestock in the countryside.
Mr Whitehouse said: "In July we had seven lambs killed, in the second attack two or three dogs were involved and four sheep drowned, and in the last attack two or three sheep were injured and one had to be put down.
"We've never had three attacks in a short space of time before."
Keith Fallon from Cotswold Pet Services, which trains dogs how to behave, said: "We've seen a rise of attacks by dogs on all types of livestock, and not just livestock - we've also seen attacks on cyclists and joggers, and car chasing."
David George, from the National Farmers Union (NFU) in the South West, said: "There's no such thing as a bad dog - it's bad owners.
"It's important that people know where their dogs are and what they're doing, and they don't just let them off [the lead] to run unsupervised."
Gloucestershire Police's rural and environmental crime liaison officer, Sgt Simon Clemett, said: "Nationally there probably is an increase [in attacks].
"Within Gloucestershire we're seeing it more because we're taking more of an interest, and we're taking action against it."
He said police were working with the farming community and the NFU, and signs were being erected on land where public footpaths crossed farmland, to warn dog owners to keep their dogs on leads.
