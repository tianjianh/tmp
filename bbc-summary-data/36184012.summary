England all-rounder Ben Stokes took four wickets but rain hampered Durham's fightback against Surrey at the Oval.

Stokes had Matthew Pillans caught by Scott Borthwick and bowled Gareth Batty as Surrey were bowled out for 457.
Keaton Jennings and Mark Stoneman hit fifties as Durham sailed to 114-0 but the pair fell to Zafar Ansari and Batty respectively in consecutive overs.
The visitors reached 156-2 at the close after only 33 balls were bowled after tea due to rain and bad light.
With England selector James Whitaker present at the Oval, Stokes warmed up for England's upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka by polishing off Surrey's tail.
Stoneman, who may be looking to fight his way into being Alastair Cook's next opening partner, followed up his unbeaten century against Middlesex last week with a quickfire 57 and found the boundary seven times.
After Jennings (53) was bowled by Ansari, Stoneman departed after being trapped in front by the hosts' captain Batty 10 balls later.
Rain took the players off the field and bad light prevented any further play, with day two called off at 17:45 BST.
Surrey wicketkeeper Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London: "It has been a good day, especially when you get all of your batting points.
"We would have liked a few more wickets, but it is a good wicket so as long as we hang in there and try to be persistent and see what we can get out of the wicket, then we're doing alright.
"Both the Durham openers were playing very well, Jennings especially he started to take the spinners on and play some reverse sweeps. We did not want the run rate to get away from us, so it was good to get him.
"It's about trying to bore the batters, really. You know you're not going to get a lot of movement but generally here you see later on in the game wickets can be taken quite quickly with the turn."
