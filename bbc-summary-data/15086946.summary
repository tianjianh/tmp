The 24-year-old has made four appearances for Spurs this season, the most recent of which as a second-half substitute in the 5-1 home defeat against Manchester City on 28 August.
Ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Shamrock Rovers, Redknapp said: "He needs another operation.
"He has already had one but there is still a problem with him. It's a blow."
Huddlestone has established himself as a key figure in the Spurs set-up in recent years, following his move to White Hart Lane from Derby in July 2005.
He made more starts than any other outfield player in all competitions in the 2009-10 season as Tottenham finished fourth in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League for the first time.
Writing about the his injury on Twitter, Huddlestone said: "Thanks for the supportive msgs [messages], I will do everything I can to be fully fit asap. Once the op is complete I will have a better idea of time."
Huddlestone won the first of his three England caps in November 2009 against Brazil and was named in manager Fabio Capello's provisional World Cup squad last summer, only to not make the final cut.
