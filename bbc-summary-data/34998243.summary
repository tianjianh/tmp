Andrew Ingram, from Christmas Common, near Watlington, Oxfordshire, supplied the 20ft (6.1m) tree after winning this year's British Christmas Tree Growers' Association (BCTGA) competition.
He said he was "hugely proud and very pleased" by the honour.
The switching-on ceremony was attended by Prime Minister David Cameron alongside guests and carol singers.
Mr Ingram's daughters Jessica, 25, and Rebecca, 23, also attended the event.
Hans Alexanderson, from Santa Fir Christmas Tree Farm in Guildford, was runner up and won the competition for the best wreath. He has supplied a tree for No 10's Pillared Room.
Mr Ingram, who won in 2011 and 2013, said winning a third time was a "remarkable feat".
He added: "I think it reflects very well on my right-hand man Gary Walford, who does a lot of the day-to-day work and keeps on being able to produce these outstandingly good trees.
"The real secret is we do all the right things. We make sure they're fertilised and kept clean, but it's almost like topiary, fiddling with the tree to absolutely make the best of it and make it look perfect."
Harry Brightwell, secretary of the BCTGA, said the ceremony acknowledged the "incredible work which goes into growing superb real British trees".
He added: "This lovely real British Christmas tree should bring some Christmas cheer to all those that enter No 10."
In 2014 Mr  Ingram hosted the competition to find the best Christmas tree in the UK.
The BCTGA has provided the trees for the prime minister's residence since 1982.
