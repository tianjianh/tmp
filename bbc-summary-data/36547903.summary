[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Ford and Jack Nowell return to the England starting XV for Saturday's second Test against Australia in Melbourne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bath fly-half Ford was a replacement for Luther Burrell in England's 39-28 win in the first Test, while Nowell replaces Marland Yarde.
Ford starts at number 10, with Owen Farrell moving to inside-centre and Burrell dropping out.
"We've picked a 23 to get the job done," England coach Eddie Jones said.
Jones has opted for a 6-2 split on the bench, with Jamie George, Jack Clifford and Elliot Daly named among the replacements.
"We weren't satisfied with last weekend's performance and we know there's lots to improve on," he said.
"We know the job isn't done. We came here to win a Test series and that's what we intend to do."
England captain Dylan Hartley said that the squad is buoyant after achieving only England's fourth Test win in Australia, but must build on it if they are to clinch the three-Test series.
He said: "That win means nothing unless we back it up this week. We enjoyed making history, but the bigger picture is this week and all our energies have gone into this.
"We have had the best week's preparation and we're desperate for this game."
