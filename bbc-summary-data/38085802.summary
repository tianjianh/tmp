A new retirement village has opened in Flintshire, but it is not your average old folk's home.

North Clwyd Animal Rescue in Trelogan, near Holywell has created the village to ensure its oldest dogs live out their final years in comfort.
Each dog has an individual room with an armchair, bed, outdoor run and even under floor heating after money was left by a supporter after they died.
Fundraising manager Nicky Owen said: "I think they are very happy."
The charity rescues about 1,800 animals a year and the retirement home is for older dogs which are more difficult to find new homes for.
Animal welfare manager Karen Weed said: "You don't want to see older dogs in the kennels. It's not the place for them.
"So we are trying to make it as nice as possible."
The retirement village officially opens at the start of December.
