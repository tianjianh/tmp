The victim, identified by police as 21-year-old Reuben Morris-Laing, was found outside the Premier Express store on Robin Hood Street in the St Ann's area.
He was found shortly before 21:30 GMT on Wednesday and taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, where he died.
Nottinghamshire Police said it was a knife crime incident and they have increased patrols in the area.
A cordon remains in place at the scene.
A post-mortem examination is taking place and the Mr Morrie Laing's relatives have been informed.
The incident has prompted Nottingham City Council's leader to call for tougher penalties for knife crime.
Council leader Jon Collins said: "My thoughts and sympathy go out to the family and friends who have lost a loved one in this senseless attack.
"We are working with the police and other partners to help catch the perpetrator and to more widely tackle knife crime, which so sadly ended in tragedy last night.
"When the government introduced a five-year mandatory sentence for possession of a firearm, it had a big effect on significantly reducing the number of people carrying and using firearms.
"A clear mandatory prison sentence would send a clear message and I am sure would have a similar impact."
