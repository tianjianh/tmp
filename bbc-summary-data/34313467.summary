Natalia Doherty: New appeal in 12-year-old 'murder' case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new appeal for information about a woman who disappeared more than a decade ago has been launched by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalia Doherty, 50, was last seen alive on 15 April 2003 in Eastbourne, where she was living at the time.
Police believe she travelled to Luton near that date to stay with her former husband, Gerald Doherty, at the Regents Arms in Hastings Street.
Officers now believe she was murdered as inquiries have shown no sign of her being alive.
The Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire major crime unit said a new investigation began in January 2014 and she is now "presumed murdered".
They believe that on or after the date she was last seen alive, Ms Doherty, a mother-of-three, who was also known by the surnames Wilkanowska and Logan, travelled to Luton but there were no confirmed sightings of her in the town.
It is also known she went to stay with Mr Doherty in Luton near the time of her last confirmed sighting but officers need to establish whether this visit was before, on, or after the 15 April.
Mr Doherty has since died and detectives said it needed the public's help to establish a timeline of her last activities.
Det Insp Jerry Waite said it was an "extremely complex" case.
"We know Natalia had close links with the Luton area around the time of her disappearance, and we understand she was brought to stay with her former husband in a pub in the town in 2003," he said.
"We would appeal for anyone who recognises Natalia or her late estranged husband Gerald Doherty from their time at the Regents Arms at this time, to get in touch.
"Natalia's children have been unable to rest not knowing what happened to their beloved mother and we are committed to bringing anyone who may have been involved in her death to justice."
