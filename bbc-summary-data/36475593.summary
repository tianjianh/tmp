A poor Jordi Alba pass led to Georgia midfielder Tornike Okriashvili scoring the only goal on 40 minutes.
Spain boss Vicente del Bosque had his Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid players available for the first time since last month's Champions League final.
But his side, who had not lost since March 2015, lacked the creativity to beat the world's 137th-ranked team.
Spain are aiming to win their third successive European title at Euro 2016, which will be hosted by France.
They face the Czech Republic in Toulouse on Monday before further group matches against Croatia and Turkey.
