Enthusiasts in Wales will be encouraged to share their finds and stories with museums and local communities.
The five-year Saving Treasures, Telling Stories project is backed by Â£349,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Peter Wakelin, director of collections and research at National Museum Wales, said the aim was to save treasures and make them more accessible.
"Each year hundreds of objects of archaeological significance are found by metal detectorists in Wales and there are some 20-30 discoveries of treasure," said Mr Wakelin.
"This is a crucial resource for understanding the past."
The lottery funding will pay for:
Mark Lodwick, finds co-ordinator in Wales for the Portable Antiquities Scheme, added: "We'll celebrate all the good news of people's discoveries, working with communities and finders, and make sure every find is reported for the benefit of archaeologists."
Delwyn Samuel, from the Gwent Metal Detecting Club, said the scheme would enhance the "very good relationship" detectorists already had with the authorities.
He added: "I would love to see more young people involved - they're all sitting behind their screens but we need them on the ground."
