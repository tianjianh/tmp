Airdrieonians 0-1 Partick Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle christened the new look League Cup with a hard-fought victory over League One Airdrieonians.

One goal from Kris Doolan was enough to ensure the game did not go to penalties.
Every time Doolan scored last season, Thistle won, and they did again.
But the new format did not exactly fire the imagination of public on a miserably grey and wet summer's night and there was a crowd of just 1,632 inside the Excelsior Stadium.
There was, though, an emotional minute's silence and the playing of the French national anthem before kick-off in tribute to the victims of the Nice atrocity.
Thistle's line-up was peppered with new signings, including Ziggy Gordon, Danny Devine, Chris Erskine and emergency goalkeeper David Crawford, and for the first time Kevin McBride was in charge of Airdrieonians.
And the new boss, playing a 4-4-2 shape with a diamond in the middle, had to look on as his team were pegged in by waves of Thistle attacks in the first half.
But, in fairness, they looked well organised defensively throughout the opening 45 minutes and denied their Premiership opponents any clear-cut chances.
Doolan, Erskine and Lawless - all twice - Devine and Welsh all found some space but could not test goalkeeper Rohan Ferguson. Doolan also actually netted but he was clearly offside.
Against all that, it took Airdrie 24 minutes to create anything and actually it demanded a good save from Crawford to deny Andy Ryan, who tried to strike a low shot across him.
So, all square and goalless at half-time and the prospect of a UK first - straight to penalties with no extra time and an extra point for the winner of the shootout - came ever closer.
However, shortly after the break, Thistle had something to say about that. Hugo Faria, who had come on for Marc Fitzpatrick a few moments earlier, was caught in possession by Doolan, who burgled him of the ball just 25 yards out.
He took a couple of steps forward and delivered a low shot that beat Crawford low at his right-hand post.
The Jags suddenly had a grip on the game that they richly deserved, at least in terms of pressure.
Airdrie battled hard for an equaliser and only a wonderful block from Devine denied an effort from substitute Kevin Schmidt that might have triggered that shootout.
Thistle, who play two divisions above the home team, deserved their win and, late in the game, sub Ade Azeez should have scored a second goal, but Airdrie under McBride looked to have something about them.
They could yet be worth the watching this season.
