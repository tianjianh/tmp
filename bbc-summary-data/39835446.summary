St Davids RNLI was called at about 15:10 BST on Saturday after a person walking on the cliff path at St David's Head spotted a man wearing a backpack clinging to rocks in the water.
The RNLI was joined in the search by the Coastguard and a rescue helicopter, but stood down at about 21:00.
A search of rocks and caves on the coast was carried out on Sunday.
At lunchtime on Sunday, the coastguard handed the search on to Dyfed-Powys Police.
A spokesman for St Davids RNLI said rescue teams found a coat containing money in the water during the search on Saturday, but there were no forms of identification in the pockets.
The search involved St Davids, Fishguard and Broadhaven Coastguard rescue teams, St Davids and Fishguard RNLI Lifeboats and the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, as well as police officers.
Ieuan Williams from UK Coastguard said they were appealing for help from the community to find out who the man might be.
"If someone hasn't returned home or back to where they were staying, please can you contact either the police or ourselves," he added.
Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were also trying to determine the identity of the missing man.
He is described white, in his 60s, with a lean build, short hair and "distinctive white-coloured eyebrows".
He was wearing a dark-coloured rucksack sand dark blue or black trousers with a dark blue long-sleeved top.
Police said a brown sheepskin bomber jacket was found near where he was seen in the sea "possibly belongs to the man in question".
