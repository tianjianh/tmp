Women's Super League: WSL 2 clubs invited to apply to replace Notts County Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Women's Super League Two clubs have been invited to apply to join WSL 1 for the 2017-18 winter season, to replace the defunct Notts County Ladies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Notts folded in April and the Football Association wants to rebalance the two tiers of the WSL with 10 teams in each.
WSL 2 sides have been asked to show how they can meet the additional licence criteria and financial demands at the higher level.
A decision on the successful bidder will be made in June.
It will be based on the applicant clubs' skills in business management, youth development and marketing, as well as the quality of their facilities and their performances on the pitch in the past 12 months.
Before Notts' liquidation, there would have been 10 teams in WSL 1 for 2017-18, and 11 in WSL 2.
With one match remaining, Everton are top of the WSL 2 Spring Series - a one-off, smaller league competition designed to bridge the gap before the WSL reverts to a winter schedule in 2017-18.
Everton can win the title on Saturday, however, there will be no promotion and relegation between the top two tiers at the end of the Spring Series.
One of either Blackburn or Tottenham, who face each other in a promotion play-off at the end of May, will join WSL 2 for the 2017-18 campaign.
Current WSL 2 clubs will have until 30 May to submit their business plans and budgets.
