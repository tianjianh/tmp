[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former stray dog Ted to star in La Boheme in Manchester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stray dog rescued from a life on the streets is to make his stage debut later in a production of Puccini's classic opera, La Boheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ted will tread the boards for the first time with owner Joanne Burrow in a production at Manchester's Opera House.
The Yorkshire terrier, who came to Ms Burrow underweight and "in such a state", will play the pet of one of the main characters, Musetta.
She said she was sure he would "immensely enjoy" the show.
Ted was rescued by Manchester and Cheshire Dogs Home, where Ms Burrow works, at the age of one.
She said when he first arrived, she thought he "wouldn't make it", but "now he's such a loving and friendly dog [who] has come out of his shell".
She added that he was not "fazed by crowds, noise or light" and would "no doubt immensely enjoy" his time on stage.
