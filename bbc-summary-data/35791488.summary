Millwall continued their League One promotion push as Chris Taylor's early goal wrapped up three points against Sheffield United.

The hosts went ahead in just the second minute when Steve Morison crossed to Taylor, who finished from close range.
Billy Sharp could have levelled when he linked on to Matt Done's cross but keeper Jordan Archer caught his header.
Paul Coutts forced Archer into a low near-post save after the break but Millwall held on to win.
That win keeps the Lions fifth in League One, six points off second-placed Wigan while Sheffield United slip a place to 12th.

Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London: "We weren't brilliant at times. We played well and should have been out of sight by half-time.
"At this stage of the season it's about getting points on the board. We defended our box really well. I thought the centre-halves were outstanding."
