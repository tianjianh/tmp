The Ayrshire resident spoke of the futility of war, saying that both sides wanted to be winners, but "there are no winners in war".
Mr Forsyth told BBC Scotland's Lisa Summers: "We joined the army, boys of our age, we thought we were going to change the world - we didn't. It is still the same. We still have concentration camps, starvation, people looking for a safe home to bring up their youngsters. But selfishness and greed are still there."
He was a wireless operator with the 15th/19th King's Royal Hussars in the The Royal Armoured Corps.
Mr Forsyth was also one of the first to arrive at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as it was liberated.
Memories of the starving people he met on his arrival haunt him to this day, he said.
