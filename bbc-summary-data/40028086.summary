[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City have agreed to sign Reading defender Dominic Hyam and Portsmouth goalkeeper Liam O'Brien.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both players will begin two-year deals to play for the relegated club in League Two next season from 1 July.
O'Brien, 25, was not offered new terms at the end of his second Pompey spell.
Centre-back Hyam, 21, leaves Reading having not made a first-team appearance, but he does have League Two experience following a loan spell at Dagenham and Redbridge last season.
"Dominic is a strong and aggressive centre half, who comes from a very good academy set-up," Coventry boss Mark Robins told the Sky Blues' website.
"Liam is a quality goalkeeper, who we will be working hard with to maximise his potential. We are building a club, not just a team, for our short and long term aims."
O'Brien did not make a first-team appearance in his first spell at Portsmouth, going on loan to Eastbourne Borough.
He later played for Barnet and Dagenham, before returning to Pompey in August 2016 on a short-term deal.
