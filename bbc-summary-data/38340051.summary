The 27-year-old has left the Championship side after they went into liquidation because of their financial situation.
The former Wales Under-20 international previously played for Scarlets and moved to Welsh in 2014.
"Nick is an experienced centre who was available at the right time for us," said Falcons boss Dean Richards.
