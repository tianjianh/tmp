The 7.5 metre (24.5ft) male shark was discovered on Kirk Michael beach on the west coast of the island.
A Manx Basking Shark Watch spokeswoman said people should not go near the carcass as it is very decomposed.
The Isle of Man government will take samples for scientific investigation before burying the shark.
Marine Officer for the Manx Wildlife Trust Lara Howe said from initial inspection is looks like the creature died from "natural causes."
"We recommend that people don't touch it or let their dogs near it as the carcass can contain harmful bacteria," she said.
Basking sharks are are the second largest fish in the world, feed on plankton and are usually spotted in Manx waters from mid-May.
Anyone who sees a shark off the island's coast over the next few months can report the sighting to either Whale and Dolphin Watch or the Manx Basking Shark Watch.
According to Jackie Hall of the Manx Basking Shark Watch, the sharks may be native and never actually leave Manx waters.
