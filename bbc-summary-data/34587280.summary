Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb will no longer seek the Democratic presidential nomination.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Webb has said on Tuesday that he is considering how he might "remain as a voice" in the campaign, possibly as an independent candidate.
Mr Webb has struggled to gain traction in the Democratic primary, often polling at or below 1%.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading the race, followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
"I am withdrawing from any consideration of being the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidency," Mr Webb said. "This does not reduce in any way my concerns for the challenges facing the country â€¦ or my intentions to remain fully engaged in the debates that are facing us."
During the first Democratic debate, he struggled to explain why he was at odds with his party on key issues like gun control and affirmative action.
He also often complained about his lack of speaking time.
Mr Webb, who was a Navy secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan, became a Democrat after opposing the Iraq War.
He had been promoting criminal justice reform and an overhaul of campaign finance laws while criticising President Barack Obama's foreign policy.
