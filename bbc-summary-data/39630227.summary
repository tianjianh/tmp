The 23-year-old New Zealand-born second row joined the Pro12 club in October on a short-term deal until this summer and says the fans helped him feel at home.
"I have to pinch myself when the supporters chant my name," Alainu'uese said in a club statement.
"I've never had that before and that gets me going and keeps me playing hard for the team and the fans."
Alainu'uese is well known to Dave Rennie, who will take over from Gregor Townsend as Warriors' head coach for next season.
The forward, who has made 15 appearances for Glasgow after arriving from Waikato in his homeland, played two times for Rennie's Chiefs in Super Rugby last season.
"It'll be good to work with Dave Rennie again next season, but at the moment, I'm just focusing on Gregor and Dan McFarland and doing what they want me to do," said Alainu'uese.
"I've really enjoyed my time in Glasgow.
"There is a lot of competition within the squad and I've learnt a lot from the other second rows at the club."
Alainu'uese, whose new contract is subject to a visa, becomes the 14th player to re-sign for Warriors ahead of next season.
Four new arrivals have also been announced so far, while five academy players have signed professional contracts.
Townsend said Alainu'uese had made a particular impact while Glasgow's Scotland internationals were on Six Nations duty.
"Brian has fitted in really well since joining us earlier this season," said the man who is taking control of the national side.
"He has made a number of improvements, both physically and in his set-piece play, and he played well during the Six Nations window.
"We believe that there is a lot more to come from him and we're delighted that he'll continue his development at Scotstoun over the next two years."
