The 29-year-old already has Premier League experience, having played at West Brom during the 2013-14 campaign while on a season-long loan.
"The manager [Sam Allardyce] explained to me how the team plays and how he needs me," he said.
"I explained to him where I prefer as my position in his team. This is a new team with very good players."
Amalfitano arrives in London having fallen out with Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa, who punished him when he refused to train away from the senior squad.
The midfielder, who has one cap, started his career at Sedan before moving to Lorient and then Marseille.
"I enjoyed my first year in English football and for that reason I have come back and hopefully I can improve again," he added.
"The first year was good for my experience and I will try to help West Ham now by giving my best and continue to improve in this league. I like this country and this is the best league."
