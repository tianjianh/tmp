[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old victim had been standing at a bus stop in Wallacewell Quadrant in Glasgow at about 23:45 on Friday when a car pulled up beside him.
A young man who was a passenger in the car got out and chased him with a hammer into a nearby park.
The car was then driven at him and hit him before two other men jumped out and attacked him with weapons.
The attackers then got back into the vehicle - a small silver car - before driving back onto Wallacewell Road.
One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with blond hair. He was wearing a red top.
The other two men are described as being in their late teens to early 20s.
Their victim is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
Det Con William Corkindale of Shettleston CID said: "This was a horrendous attack which has left the victim seriously injured and it is imperative that we trace the people responsible.
"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time the incident took place, who may have witnessed what happened or saw anything suspicious, to come forward.
"We understand that the front passenger window of the small silver car involved was smashed and so I would also ask anyone who noticed a car matching this description to get in touch."
