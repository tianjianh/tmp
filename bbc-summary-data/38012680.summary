Gordon Strachan: Mark McGhee backs Scotland coach to carry on in role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland assistant manager Mark McGhee insists he would be surprised if Gordon Strachan did not carry on as national coach.

Strachan would not be drawn on his future following last week's 3-0 defeat by England.
The Scots are second bottom of their World Cup qualifying group on four points after four games.
"I'd be amazed if he doesn't," said Motherwell boss McGhee when asked about Strachan continuing in the role.
"I think in terms of the performance he got the best out of the players, so I think he's entitled to move on to the next games and see if we can improve on the results."
Scotland next play Slovenia at home in March before the return meeting with England at Hampden in June.
Double-headers against Lithuania and Malta and then Slovakia and Slovenia later in 2017 complete the qualifying campaign.
Group winners progress to the 2018 finals in Russia while the eight best runners-up from the nine European sections will play-off for four further qualification spots.
Group F started positively for Scotland with a 5-1 win away to Malta but only a late goal prevented defeat at home by Lithuania and Slovakia then humbled the Scots 3-0 in Bratislava before a repeat scoreline at Wembley.
"Everyone has their opinions and they're entitled to those opinions," said McGhee.
"Whatever anyone else says, we'll just keep doing what we're doing until someone takes the keys off of us.
"If people look at it objectively and properly and see that players are doing their best but we fall short because we're either not good enough or have a bit of bad luck then I think we're entitled to say, 'okay let's keep going because we're still getting the best out of the players that we can get'."
