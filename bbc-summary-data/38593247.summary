A statement from the organisers said they were advised to cancel the performance in light of "events that happened around New Years Eve".
This seemed to be a reference to reports that many woman were "molested" during celebrations.
However police have denied this is the reason for cancelling the concert.
"The organisers sought permission for today's programme only on 10 January. But our entire force is busy with security arrangements for the APMC Yard (agricultural produce marketing committee yard) elections. Let them seek fresh permission in time for their concert, we will allow it," Bangalore range Inspector General Seemant Kumar Singh told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi.

He is scheduled to perform in Mumbai and the southern city of Hyderabad this weekend.
#DavidGuetta has begun trending on Twitter in India with many criticising what they call the police inability to maintain law and order in one of India's biggest cities.
