The 28-year-old Israel international, who is recovering from surgery on an ankle injury, will remain at the Amex Stadium until the summer of 2019.
Kayal has scored three goals in 72 appearances for the Seagulls since joining from Celtic in January 2015.
"It is important to us that we keep hold of our key players," Albion boss Chris Hughton said.
