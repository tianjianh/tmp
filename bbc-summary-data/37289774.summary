The rape investigation was launched after the 21-year-old woman was attacked in Union Terrace Gardens in the early hours of 28 January.
Crimestoppers has offered the reward of up to £5,000 for information that leads to conviction in the case.
The charity stressed the reward would only be paid if information was passed to Crimestoppers directly.
Angela Parker, the Crimestoppers national manager for Scotland, said: "This attack was on a young woman in the heart of Aberdeen.
"We are now offering a substantial reward for anyone with information to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.
"By contacting Crimestoppers, via the phone (0800 555 111) or our anonymous online form, we don't ask for any personal details, you won't have to speak to the police, and you won't have to go to court. Just tell us what you know, not who you are."
