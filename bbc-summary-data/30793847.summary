Dumfries and Galloway learning support summit staged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to overhaul learning support in Dumfries and Galloway schools are being put under the spotlight in the first of a series of consultation events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 50 posts, including specialist teachers, are earmarked to go as part of a strategy to streamline the service and cut costs.
The plans have been opposed by some parents and the EIS teaching union.
Education committee chairman Jeff Leaver said he understood the unease but safeguards would be built in.
The learning support strategy is to be the focus of a series of family engagement forums.
The first is between 18:00 and 19:30 at Moffat Academy.
