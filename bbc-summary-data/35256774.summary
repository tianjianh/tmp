The remains of Sian Blake, 43, and her children Zachary Bilal Kent-Blake, eight, and Amon Ben George Kent-Blake, four, were found at the family's south-east London home on 6 January.
A police spokesperson said they had died from "head and neck injuries".
Ms Blake's partner is being sought by police over the deaths.
However, the BBC understands Arthur Simpson-Kent, 48, left the UK and may be in Ghana.
Ms Blake and the couple's sons had not been seen since 13 December. They were reported missing three days later.
Police said a missing persons' investigation had been launched on 16 December after officers attended the family's home in Erith.
This was undertaken following information from the children's charity, the NSPCC, over concerns about Ms Blake's health, police said.
Forensic specialists were called in to search the family home on 4 January. The bodies were found during excavations in the garden two days later.
Significant attempts had been made to conceal the bodies, police said.
Det Supt Paul Monk, from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said the police were "continuing to appeal for any information about the movements of Arthur Simpson-Kent".
Ava Blake, Ms Blake's sister, has claimed the former EastEnders star had previously said she wanted to leave her boyfriend.
Sian Blake, who had motor neurone disease, played Frankie Pierre in the BBC One soap between 1996 and 1997.
The Met has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over how the investigation was handled.
