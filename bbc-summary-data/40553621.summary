The 31-year-old Welshman was second overall when he broke his collarbone in a crash on the damp descent of the Col de la Biche during stage nine.
He also crashed out of the Giro d'Italia in stage nine in May.
Writing on Instagram he said: "Jersey for sale... Only worn once, slight signs of use. Might need a wash."
