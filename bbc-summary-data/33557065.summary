Ward and Simon will open the best-of-five tie at 12:30 BST on Friday, followed by world number three Andy Murray against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
Britain are trying to reach the World Group semi-finals for the first time since 1981.
The doubles take place on Saturday and reverse singles on Sunday.
The winners will face Australia or Kazakhstan in September, with Britain guaranteed a home tie should they progress.
Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot are scheduled to face Nicolas Mahut and Richard Gasquet in Saturday's doubles, although nominations can change up to one hour before play.
Britain beat the USA 3-2 in Glasgow in March to reach the last eight.
French captain Arnaud Clement described himself as a "lucky captain" with three of the world's top 13 singles players to call upon, along with last month's Queen's Club doubles champions.
The big decision on Thursday was who to leave out of the opening matches, and it is world number 13 and Wimbledon semi-finalist Gasquet.
"Richard just needs a little more time for recovery after his semi-final last week," said Clement.
"Gilles and Jo had a little more time to prepare for the tie, so that's the reason. They are all very close and for me it's a logical choice."
British captain Leon Smith said: "That's the advantage they have, the strength in depth they've got. They've got such a strong team.
"I don't know how Richard is feeling. He obviously had a great Wimbledon. It may change in the morning, you never know."
There was no debate over who would take the singles spots for the home side, with Smith again calling upon world number three Murray and Davis Cup hero Ward.
The Londoner won a stunning five-set match against American John Isner in the previous round, and this week broke into the world's top 100 for the first time.
"Every one of these guys has given 100% when playing for Great Britain and it won't change this weekend," said Smith.
"There's no doubt there will be some aches and pains and a bit of tiredness from a long grass-court season. It's demanding for them, but you'll see no lack of desire, effort and passion to try and win the matches."
Smith could face his biggest test of the weekend when confirming Saturday's doubles team, with the option remaining to bring in Andy Murray to play all three days, despite his brother and Inglot impressing in Glasgow.
Murray will play Tsonga for the 13th time, with the Scot leading 10-2.
"It's going to be difficult because he's one of the best players on grass, but I feel good, I'm in good shape," said Tsonga.
"The most important thing for me is to know it's possible to beat Andy."
Ward, ranked 89th, takes on Simon, the world number 11, for the first time.
"I practised a lot with James over the last two years because our coaches are really close, so I may be the one who knows him the best on our team," said Simon.
"I know what to expect and it's going to be hard. I feel I'm ready for the match."
Team bonding has been a big part of Britain's success in recent years and the whole squad are staying together at a London hotel for the duration of the tie.
The spirit in the camp must be strong, judging by how the players are passing the time away from the court.
"We played one game where basically everyone has to give themselves a rating out of 10 for their looks, and the total package," said Andy Murray.
"Then everyone else has to mark you, and you see how close to reality you are. Wardy was way off!
"So Dom would score points for intelligence, whereas Wardyâ€¦"
