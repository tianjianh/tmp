Police said the man, in his 30s, died in hospital after being found in Rocky Lane, Heswall, on Sunday.
Initial reports indicated he had suffered serious injuries and the death was being treated as "unexplained".
But Merseyside Police say tests have now confirmed there was no evidence found of an assault having taken place.
