Hinchingbrooke Hospital to remain in special measures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first NHS hospital to be privately run will remain in special measures after inspectors said emergency services were still "inadequate".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hinchingbrooke Hospital was placed in special measures in September 2014 when it was run by Circle Health, who handed control back to the NHS last April.
The Care Quality Commission report says some improvements have been made, but concerns remain over patient safety.
The hospital is expected to comment on the report later.
CQC inspectors visited the hospital, which is near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, in October and November and found a service "in a transition period following structural management changes".
Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, said the inspection "highlighted a number of concerns" about how Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust "manages and monitors risk in a number of areas".
"There were also concerns regarding the A&E department including infection control practices," Sir Mike said.
"Urgent and emergency services are rated as "inadequate" overall."
The CQC highlighted areas where the trust must improve, including:
Sir Mike said inspectors also saw a number of areas of good and outstanding practice, including the chaplaincy service, "which remains excellent and supportive to patients, their families and carers".
He also praised work to help patients with dementia.
The CQC said the trust would continue to be monitored and more inspections would take place.
Ben Gummer, minister for care quality, said it was "encouraging" that progress had been made in the "leadership and working culture" across the hospital.
"However, I am disappointed that concerns remain on aspects of patient safety," he said.
"It is now vital the trust works closely with regulators to put in place the necessary improvements."
