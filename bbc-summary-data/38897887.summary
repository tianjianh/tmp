The hosts led 12-7 at half-time courtesy of Mills' boot while Chris Ashton scored Saracens' try.
After the break Mills and Alex Lozowski traded penalties before Worcester's fly-half added two more.
Schalk Brits' late score put pressure on Worcester but Mills had the last say from the tee and secured the victory.
Worcester's start was a positive one as they dictated much of the opening half and kept hold of possession well. Mills missed his opening attempt at goal but from thereon he found his range.
Warriors dominated much of the possession and field position in the first 40 minutes and took advantage of Saracens' uncharacteristic ill-discipline.
The fly-half pushed his side into a 9-0 lead before Ashton pounced on a kick through from Lozowski and the latter added the conversion.
At 12-7 in the hosts' favour, history indicated that Saracens would mount a strong second-half comeback but in fact, after Mills and Lozowski had traded penalties, Worcester took charge.
Mills made Saracens' continued infringements prove to be costly and they kept their composure.
With seven minutes to go Saracens' pack drove over and Brits dotted down, yet the final say of the game went to Worcester's match-winning fly-half.
Victory pushes Worcester five points clear of Bristol at the bottom of the table, while Saracens have to be content with second position.
Worcester director of rugby Gary Gold: "I'm proud of the guys as they had to take in a lot of information in a short space of time. As long as we showed fight, the result wasn't as important.
"We didn't want to do anything flash and there wasn't anything scientific in our tactics but we needed to shore up our defence.
"It'll prove to the boys that they can do it but the issue is whether we are able to repeat it and it's not a one-off, as we have to play many of the good teams in the Premiership in our remaining fixtures."
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: "It was very disappointing but all credit to Worcester, who pressurised and harassed us throughout.
"Our set-piece was very poor, particularly in the first half, as we couldn't gain a platform.
"We chased the game too early, our discipline was bad and they kicked very well to keep us on the back foot."
