Gwynedd boy, 12, admits two arson charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 12-year-old boy started a gorse fire in Gwynedd - days after causing £2,000 worth of damage by sparking a shed blaze, a court has heard.

The youth, who cannot be named, set a gorse fire at Cwm Bowydd Farm in Blaenau Ffestiniog on 22 April - as grass fires swept across Wales.
He admitted two charges of arson at Dolgellau Youth Court on Thursday.
The boy was given a 10-month referral order and his parents must pay £2,284 in compensation.
Richard Williams, defending, said many young people had lit gorse fires, adding: "I am not minimising what happened, but [neither] my client nor his parents ever thought that it would end in criminal proceedings."
In April, fire crews across Wales dealt with hundreds of grass fires, which had been deliberately set, triggering calls for more prosecutions.
