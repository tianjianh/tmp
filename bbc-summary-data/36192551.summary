The 28-year-old's only appearance for the Vikings this season came in the Challenge Cup win over Rochdale.
Coach Daryl Powell said: "Paddy comes to us at a crucial period.
"Whenever he has played against us he has had a strong influence on the game, he is a tough defender and carries the ball very strongly in all areas of the field."
