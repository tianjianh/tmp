'Revenge fly-tipping' act backfires in Lincoln

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been fined for "revenge fly-tipping" after he dumped some of his ex-wife's property at her home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Peter Hutchinson, 72, of Church Lane, Skegness, dumped bedding, furniture and a mirror, with a note saying "some things you didn't steal",  Lincoln Magistrates' Court heard.
Some had been daubed with green paint and damaged with solvents.
Hutchinson was found guilty of two counts of fly-tipping and was ordered to pay £2,300 in fines and costs.
On Friday, the court heard his ex-wife recognised the items as coming from the house they had shared in Station Road, in Burgh le Marsh.
North Kesteven District Council, who prosecuted Hutchinson, said he had insisted he was simply "returning" the items.
But the court agreed it was waste and he was fined £625, with costs of £1,229.88, a victim surcharge of £63 and compensation to Mrs Hutchinson of £400, totalling £2,317.88.
Councillor Richard Wright said: "The district council has never tolerated fly tipping, and although Hutchinson considered himself to be returning the items, he was in fact committing an offence.
"We take this very seriously, and will prosecute anyone who is caught doing so."
