Bolton baby death: Partial DNA links to Alia's father found

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have found 11 partial genetic matches to the father of a baby girl discovered dead in a country lane in Greater Manchester a year ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The newborn baby, whose body was found in Ox Hey Lane in Lostock, was given the name Alia - meaning beautiful
In a bid to find Alia's parents, officers identified her mother's DNA and the partial DNA of her father.
Police have so far contacted nine of the men whose DNA records were found on "available databases".
The search focused on approaching potential matches in the Lancashire and Greater Manchester areas.
Detectives previously found a number of potential DNA matches to Alia's mother's family and officers will again be revisiting those.
During an update with the coroner in preparation for an inquest, police said Alia was found in a shirt which is part of Tesco's Florence and Fred clothing range.
Officers discovered 51 of the shirts were sold in the area, but have eliminated 50 people from the inquiry.
The pre-inquest hearing was adjourned until June to allow police more time to trace Alia's parents.
Alia, who was wrapped in clothing and placed inside a plastic bag, lived for up to two hours before she died.
Since she was found on 14 March 2013, police have not identified Alia's ethnicity or established the cause of her death.
She was discovered by dog walkers with a message written on a Tesco carrier bag requesting an Islamic burial.
Det Sgt Aaron Duggan said: "Although it is probably very difficult to talk about what happened, I remain hopeful that... her mother or father may feel the time is right to come and talk and let me know what happened to their baby."
