The works of nine authors chosen in three age categories will be distributed to schools and local libraries by the Scottish Book Trust.
A copy of the three Bookbug category books will be given to every primary one child during Book Week Scotland.
Young readers will pick their favourite with the winner named next March.
The shortlist, which celebrates the most popular children's and young adult books by Scottish authors or illustrators, is split into three age categories - Bookbug readers (aged 3-7), Younger readers (8-11) and Older readers (12-16).
The contenders are:
Jasmine Fassl, head of schools at the Scottish Book Trust which runs the awards, said: "The Scottish Children's Book Awards are a perfect way to celebrate Scotland's talented authors and illustrators while also helping participating children to develop an independent love of books and reading.
"Hundreds of schools and libraries from literally every corner of Scotland involve tens of thousands of children in reading and reviewing the shortlisted books every year, proof of both the eagerness of Scottish young people to make their voice heard and of the quality of the shortlisted books."
