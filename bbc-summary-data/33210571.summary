[SN]TITLE[SN]
Life after Edwina

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When Edwina Hart became the economy minister, the joke doing the rounds among business leaders was whether, after years ruling out the use of the private sector in the Welsh NHS, she would do the same in the Welsh economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was always going to be a meeting of two worlds giving someone with such a strong trade union background that brief.
But on the whole the business lobby liked her approach which was to make up her mind quickly and it was a reminder of how so many of the decisions made in government are more managerial than political.
She always denied it when I put it to her but she radically changed many of the economic development policies that had been introduced by her predecessor Ieuan Wyn Jones.
He had tried to take Wales away from the kind of old-fashioned grants that existed under the Welsh Development Agency, and introduced a focus on a relatively small number of sectors he felt had a future.
She re-introduced grants and broadened out the focus on particular sectors so that it encompassed virtually the entire economy.
There are no other Welsh government departments with a personal stamp on it like hers and I understand she enjoys a degree of autonomy in the way she runs it that's not afforded to any other minister.
Despite criticism, her approach has been unashamedly interventionist. It's impossible to say whether the Welsh government would have bought Cardiff airport for £52m two years ago without her, but the decision had the Edwina Hart stamp all over it.
If something is failing in the private sector, she believes in using the levers at her disposal to step in.
Without great fanfare, she built up the Welsh government's property portfolio to try to inject life in the economy after the recession.
So if she judged that commercial property firms were slow to invest in new office space in the centre of Cardiff, she followed the recommendations of her advisor David Goldstone to use public funds to buy up office blocks.
The amount of money spent by Welsh ministers to buy industrial sites, business parks and office blocks for economic development could reach £120m.
She has also commissioned a huge number of reports, often called task and finish groups, and created a network of advisory boards, or committees as they used to be called, which regularly attracted the inevitable "talking shops" tag.
There are panels covering sectors and enterprise zones and the city regions of Swansea and Cardiff as part of what has been a giant information-gathering element to her time in the job.
There are three major projects that need to be looked at in the light of her departure next year.
Firstly there is the plan for an M4 relief road which at £1bn would be the largest capital project undertaken by a devolved government in Wales.
Secondly, there is the proposal to re-nationalise the biggest rail franchise in Wales when the current agreement with Arriva Trains Wales comes to an end.
And thirdly there is the metro, an ambitious scheme to improve bus and a rail services in and out of Cardiff.
An announcement on this is expected within days. The smart money is on there being a recommendation to create a new body to to specifically deliver the project.
All of these complex and expensive schemes are wrapped up at various technical stages but we shouldn't under-estimate the importance of personalities in driving through big change.
Edwina Hart has been their main champion of all of these schemes and her departure will bring a new dynamic to all of them.
The M4 relief road is increasingly looking politically difficult for Labour to deliver with opposition from the other parties appearing to harden by the month.
The absence of Edwina Hart next year just made prospects for that motorway look even less likely.
Her decisions also brings the tally of departing Labour AMs to eight with Gwenda Thomas, Keith Davies, Jeff Cuthbert, Christine Chapman, Gwyn Price, Rosemary Butler and Sandy Mewies.
We often talk about the inevitable changing face of the assembly next year as a result of the expected arrival of UKIP members but the internal changes for Labour are significant with more than a quarter of AMs standing down.
All eyes now will be on the quality of the candidates.
