The Londoner, who plays Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, faces competition including Fifty Shades Of Grey actress Dakota Johnson.
Brie Larson, who appears in new drama Room, and Kingsman: The Secret Service actor Taron Egerton are also nominated.
They are joined by Bel Powley, from 2015's The Diary Of A Teenage Girl.
The London-born 23-year-old has already risen very far, very fast, having found global fame as a rebellious Stormtrooper in the new Star Wars adventure.
Before that, he had played just one lead film role, in 2011's action comedy Attack the Block, plus smaller parts in TV shows like 24: Live Another Day and BBC Three's Becoming Human.
He is due to appear opposite Tom Hanks and Emma Watson in the film adaptation of Dave Eggers' novel The Circle later this year.
The 26-year-old shot onto the radar after playing Eggsy, Colin Firth's protege in spy caper Kingsman, winning him the best male newcomer title at the Empire Awards.
Before that, he played Edward Brittain in Testament of Youth, the adaptation of Vera Brittain's wartime memoirs, and is now set to play the leads in a biopic of skier Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards and a new version of Robin Hood.
The daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson and the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, Johnson comes from a distinguished Hollywood dynasty.
She had parts in The Social Network, the 21 Jump Street remake and Fox sitcom Ben and Kate before landing her most high-profile role, as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades trilogy.
She may officially be a rising star, but the 26-year-old Californian already has a long list of screen credits including Short Term 12, Trainwreck, 21 Jump Street, Don Jon and The Spectacular Now.
She is now a favourite for this year's best actress Oscar for playing a woman held captive role with her young son in the big screen adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel Room.
Powley, 23, from London, began her career in CBBC series MI High and played Bianca in TV sitcom Benidorm.
She graduated to feature films last year, playing Minnie in coming-of-age drama The Diary of a Teenage Girl and Princess Margaret in A Royal Night Out.
Film fans will be able to vote for their favourite and the winner will be announced at the Bafta Film Awards in London on 14 February.
Previous winners include James McAvoy, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hardy and Jack O'Connell.
