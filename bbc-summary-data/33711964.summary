[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Yuill, 28, was found dead at the scene just off the motorway near Stirling on Wednesday 8 July. Lamara Bell, 25, died later in hospital.
The eulogy at the service was read by Mr Yuill's step-mother Anita Dollard in front of about 100 friends and family.
The funeral was held at Saint Francis Xavier's Church in Falkirk.
Ms Dollard described Mr Yuill as a livewire who talked constantly.
She said he was a great brother to his six younger brothers and sisters, a "cheeky chappy" and a "loveable rogue".
Ahead of the service Gordon Yuill, John's father, said: "Today, we lay our beloved son, John Yuill, to rest after his tragic accident on the 5th July 2015, which also claimed the life of his girlfriend, Lamara Bell.
"We would like to say thanks for all the support we have received from friends, family and the community."
A statement on behalf of the Bell family, addressed to John Yuill and his family, said: "With our deepest sympathy. For those we've loved and lost. We can never be more than a thought apart.
"For as long as they live in our memory they live on in our hearts.
"May friends comfort you, faith uphold you and loving memories heal your heart."
It emerged after the crash that it had been reported to police by a member of the public the previous Sunday.
Officers only attended the scene after receiving a second call from a different person.
Ms Bell died in hospital from injuries that included broken bones and kidney damage caused by dehydration.
A review into the way the police handle calls in their control centres is to be carried out, examining how control centre systems and staff manage, answer and prioritise calls.
