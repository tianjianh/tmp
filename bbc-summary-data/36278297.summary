Grealish, 20, has played for the Republic at under-21 level but turned down a call-up to the senior squad for a friendly against England.
He is named in Gareth Southgate's 20-man squad for the Toulon Tournament.
England will take on Portugal, Guinea, Paraguay and Japan in their group games later this month.
Birmingham-born Grealish qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents.

The Young Lions open their campaign against Portugal on 19 May before playing Guinea four days later.
They take on Paraguay on 25 May and round off their group campaign two days later against Japan.
