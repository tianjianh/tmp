The 1990s soul singer Kenny Thomas has launched an £80,000 fundraising appeal to pay for treatment for his daughter, who has a brain tumour.

Four-year-old Christina Thomas was diagnosed about two weeks ago.
Doctors told her parents chemotherapy or radiotherapy might prolong her life but would not save her.
Mr Thomas, who lives in Norfolk, said this would result in "enormous suffering" and he wished to raise funds to "find alternative" treatments.
The 48-year-old, whose song Thinking About Your Love was a hit in 1991, said: "At worst, we hope she will have a comfortable time and live longer than expected.
"At best we hope it could have an impact on the tumour."
As first reported in The Sun, Christina was diagnosed with a midbrain glioma on the brain stem about two weeks ago, after she developed a limp.
Within two hours of the diagnosis, Mr Thomas was "with Christina in a back of an ambulance, at very high speed, going over to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge".

The musician said: "I can only compare it to your worst nightmare that you simply can't wake up from."
Mr and Mrs Thomas set up a fundraising webpage, which has so far raised more than £34,000, in the hope of finding alternative treatment.
He is currently researching "non-harmful" procedures in the United States and Mexico.
Christina is being given "all the nutrients and correct diet she needs" and they hope this will give her the strength to travel if they find a hospital which might be able to help prolong her life.
Mr Thomas said: "If you can buy yourself another year, in that time some other treatment might present itself."
But he added "if the worst happened, the money would go to charity".
