The honour for Dame Barbara, 78, best known for playing pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders and for her roles in the Carry On films, is for services to charity and entertainment.
McCoy, the 20-time champion jockey, who won the lifetime achievement award at this month's BBC Sports Personality of the Year, becomes Sir Tony for services to horse racing.
A total of 1,196 people are on the list, with just over three quarters of the recipients people who have undertaken work in their local community.
Dame Barbara, 78, who is also an ambassador for Age UK, said she was "proud and extremely humbled".
"For a girl from the East End born into a working-class family and an evacuee during World War Two, this is truly like a dream," she said.

Other thespians on the list include celebrated Welsh actress Sian Phillips, who is made a dame; stage and screen star Imelda Staunton, who receives a CBE, and Luther actor Idris Elba, who becomes an OBE. James Nesbitt, who is made an OBE for services to acting and Northern Ireland following years of helping families affected by the Troubles, said his honour was "really rather gratifying".
An OBE for sports presenter and former tennis player Sue Barker is for services to broadcasting and charity, and Jacqui Oatley, the first female commentator on Match Of The Day, is made an MBE.
Sporting stars from past and present are well represented, with former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law made a CBE for services to football and charity, and two-time Tour de France winner, cyclist Chris Froome, and multiple world champion snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan among the OBEs.
Falklands veteran and charity campaigner Simon Weston becomes a CBE.
There is also recognition for Britons who helped in the fight against the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, with several medics on the list including Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated three nurses in London after they contracted the disease working in Sierra Leone, receiving a knighthood.
A knighthood given to the Conservatives' general election strategist Lynton Crosby for political service saw Labour suggest the honours system had been "degraded", with shadow home secretary Andy Burnham describing his inclusion as "outrageous".
But the Tories defended the Australian's "contribution to the democratic process", saying it amounted to "public service".
In business and industry, there are damehoods for Easyjet chief executive Carolyn McCall and the founder of high fashion website Net-A-Porter, Natalie Massenet. Ann Summers chief executive Jacqueline Gold is made a CBE.
The youngest recipient on the list is 13-year-old Jonjo Heuerman, from Kent, who receives a British Empire Medal after raising Â£250,000 for the Bobby Moore Fund at Cancer Research UK.  The eldest is Dorothy Start, 99, from Hertfordshire, whose BEM is in recognition of more than half a century of community work.
Compared to the 2015 Birthday Honours, there were slightly more men on the New Year list - 52% of recipients. However, there was an increase in the proportion of awards to women at senior levels, with 38% of the top honours going to women compared to 31% in June.

Football Association director Heather Rabbatts - who became the FA's first female board member in 2012 - becomes a Dame for services to football and equality.
AP McCoy, who retired in April after a 23-year National Hunt career that included 31 Cheltenham Festival winners, as well as two Gold Cups and one Grand National success, said he had been "speechless" when he learned of his knighthood.
"I am very proud of it," he said. "I am very proud for horse racing because it has been so good to me."
