Phone system poses 'threat' to South Yorkshire Police operations

South Yorkshire Police's ageing call-handing system will not be replaced until June 2017 despite being branded a "threat" to police operations.

A report presented to the Police and Crime Commissioner gave the current system a "no assurance" rating.
It also said staffing issues at the force's control room added to delays in non-emergency calls being answered.
Ass Chief Const Jason Harwin called the delays "unacceptable" but said the new system would "make a real difference".
The report said the 15-year-old system had experienced a series of "disruptive incidents" since March 2015 as a result of a software update.
It went on to say that as a result the "age and relative fragility" of the associated hardware and software "will continue to pose a threat to operational continuity until they are replaced".
The report said the average waiting time for calls made to the 101 non-emergency service since May had reduced from three minutes and 13 seconds to two minutes and 12 seconds.
However, one man said he waited 34 minutes to get through earlier this month.
"I actually drove home made a cup of tea for me and my wife, made my tea and was sat down eating it before they answered," Dave Gaugtier told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"The service is brilliant but the contact number is garbage."
The report said that in May there were 24 vacancies in the control room, resulting in 23 police officers and eight "adjusted duties officers" being drafted in to help.
Mr Harwin said the force was working to address the issues.
"We recognise the issues that we've got, we are bringing in extra staff in, we're doubling the amount of recruits we're bringing in to our control room, but, just as importantly, we're introducing new technology that will make a real difference," he said.
