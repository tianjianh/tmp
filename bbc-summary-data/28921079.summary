The officers were searching for a stolen car when they saw the pair, one of whom was on bended knee, on Saturday evening in Gladstone Park, Dollis Hill.
The crew saw the proposal take place but did not know what the answer was.
The MPSinthesky Twitter account tweeted: "We think we have just seen the most romantic guy in north London."
Images of the pair were shared with the account's 95,500 followers and the officers tweeted if anyone knew the engaged couple they had some great photos to share with them.
Officers believe the message had been spelt out using lit candles to stand out against the night sky.
