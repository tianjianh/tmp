The Citroen driver from Dungannon won three out of the four stages in the Tour de Course.
Ogier stayed within touching distance of the Meeke, who is aiming to follow up his dramatic victory in Rally Mexico with another win.
Huyundai's Thierry Neuville holds third, 25.8 seconds off the lead.
Meeke took control early on the first Asphalt round of the season, winning the opening stage before adding two more stage wins before the end of the day .
Four-time world champion Ogier was fastest in SS3 in his M-Sport Ford to cut Meeke's advantage to just over eight seconds, however he responded on the final stage to extend his advantage over 10 seconds.
"It's been a good day," said Meeke, 37. "You always have to be wary of Seb, because he never gives up. But I'm comfortable with my pace, so let's see how we go on Saturday."
Meeke's Citroen team-mate Craig Breen holds an impressive fourth, with the Waterford driver locked in a tight battle with Spaniard Dani Sordo.
