[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The energy company behind one of the south of England's biggest wind farms has scrapped its plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
EDF Energy Renewables wanted to put up 14 turbines to generate electricity for up to 14,900 homes at Bullington Cross near Winchester.
The application was turned down at a joint meeting by three Hampshire Councils last year.
The firm has now confirmed it is withdrawing its appeal against the decision scheduled for later this year.
In a statement EDF said: "After reviewing the scheme in the light of recent government announcements on onshore wind, the company has told the government's planning inspectorate that it will not be proceeding with the appeal hearing."
The proposed site for the 25m high (410ft) turbines was on agricultural land to the north of the A303.
Campaigners are celebrating after the news, Douglas Patterson, of Keep Hampshire Green said: "It's just amazing to have the whole ordeal over with finally."
Mr Patterson turned down approaches by EDF to have six of the proposed turbines on his land.
He said: "I was offered Â£40,000 per turbine per year index-inked for 20 years, that is quite a lot of very easy money but I couldn't live with myself if I did that, it would have been immoral to go ahead and do it."
The Ministry of Defence had also formally objected to the scheme.
