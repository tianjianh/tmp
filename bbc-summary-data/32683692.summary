Their show, Saturday Night Takeaway, received the first prize at the 2015 Bafta TV Awards, a night recognising the biggest names on the small screen.
Picking up the prize, Ant McPartlin told the audience: "What a great start to the show - for us. We're delighted!"
Broadcaster and critic Clive James and Channel 4 News journalist Jon Snow will receive lifetime achievement honours.
Later in the show Benedict Cumberbatch will find out whether he has won his first Bafta for Sherlock - after losing out in 2011 and 2012.
Meanwhile, Broadchurch star Olivia Colman is cited for a fourth consecutive year.
However, neither actor is in attendance at the ceremony.
Read the full list of nominations.
At the beginning of the evening, BBC One led the field with 23 nominations, while non-traditional broadcasters were also starting to make an impact.
In the international category, two of the four nominations went to streaming service Netflix - for the dramas Orange is the New Black and House of Cards.
But the category was eventually won by HBO series True Detective.
The awards, hosted by Graham Norton, are being held at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, and will be shown on BBC One from 20:00 BST.
"It feels like Christmas Eve," joked Lee Mack, whose BBC One panel show Would I Lie to You? is up for best comedy entertainment programme.
"I always assume we won't win and usually I'm right," added his co-presenter Rob Brydon.
James Corden, whose comedy series The Wrong Mans is up for an award, jetted in from the US, where he recently started presenting his own chat show.
"I landed at 14:00 BST and I leave at 09:00 tomorrow morning," he said. "I'm on the plane longer than I'm here!"
One of this year's nominated shows is BBC Two drama Marvellous, the story of a man with learning difficulties who became kit man with Stoke City Football Club.
Lou Macari, the club's manager at the time, told the BBC earlier that he had never expected to be invited to such a glamorous event.
The former footballer told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I'm thinking: 'What am I doing at [the] Baftas?'.
"But I'm there and I'm going to enjoy it."
Meanwhile, League of Gentlemen star Reece Shearsmith tweeted a good luck message to all the nominees adding: " Tough categories. I wouldn't want to be a judge. Oh, I was."
