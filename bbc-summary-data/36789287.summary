Federico Macheda put Cardiff ahead midway through the first half before Forest Green's Christian Doidge saw his penalty saved by Ben Wilson.
The hosts were awarded a second spot-kick, which Kieffer Moore converted.
Forest Green's new striker Matt Tubbs and Olly Mehew struck after the break to seal the hosts' win.
Trollope picked an experimental Cardiff side as he assessed his squad after returning from Euro 2016, where he was a part of Wales' coaching set-up.
However, there were starting places for Macheda and fellow striker Adam Le Fondre, who both looked set to leave Cardiff having spent part or all of last season on loan at Nottingham Forest and Wolves respectively.
The rest of the team was comprised of young fringe players and, despite taking the lead, the Bluebirds were well beaten by their non-league opponents.
