A full-scale search was launched after 19-year-old Manchester University student Joshua Caley disappeared at about 01:00 GMT on 1 January.
Footage of a man falling into Ramsey Harbour from the East Quay was captured on security cameras.
The book of condolence has been opened at the town hall in Ramsey.
A spokesman for Ramsey Council said he hoped it would "enable people to record their memories of Josh and express their sympathy to his family at this sad time".
Following his "unbearable" disappearance, his mother Joy asked people to keep looking for him.
The teenager had been due to see in the New Year with his parents at the home of family friends.
