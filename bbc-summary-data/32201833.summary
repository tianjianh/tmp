Pension reforms get cautious response

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired people in the UK have responded cautiously to the government's pension reforms, with relatively few opting to withdraw all their cash.

Of several hundred phone calls to one big provider, just 7.7% were inquiries about cashing in a whole pension.
Hargreaves Lansdown said the first day of the reforms - Bank Holiday Monday - was relatively quiet.
Most calls were about long-term pension plans, such as buying an annuity, or setting up drawdown plans.
The government's guidance service has also got off to a quiet start.
So far, just 380 people have booked face-to-face help sessions with Citizens Advice in England and Wales, although the booking service has been open for more than two weeks.
Nearly 1,400 people have booked guidance over the phone with the Pensions Advisory Service, while just under 200 have already had appointments.
Experts - including the Association of British Insurers (ABI)- have been advising people not to rush into new pension arrangements.
So far, it looks as though many people may be heeding their advice.
