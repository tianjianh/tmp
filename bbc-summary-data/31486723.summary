John Shimmin replaces Chris Robertshaw as Manx Policy and Reform Minister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Shimmin will replace Chris Robertshaw as the Isle of Man's Policy and Reform Minister, the Manx government has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The news comes  after Mr Robertshaw resigned after less than a year.
Mr Shimmin, a Member of the House of Keys since 1996, said: "The job is a challenging one but the work is essential if we are to secure a sustainable future for the island."
The former economic minister will start with immediate effect.
Last year Mr Shimmin stepped down as minister of economic development after a row over the legality of a hotel bail-out.
He was the minister in charge of the Â£4.5m rescue package for the Sefton Group over which legal experts reported he had acted beyond his powers.
Treasury Minister Eddie Teare, who is heading the Council during the Chief Minister's absence through illness, announced Mr Shimmin's appointment.
Mr Teare said he brought considerable experience to the role and his return to the Council of Ministers was "most welcome".
Mr Robertshaw blamed the rate and pace of reform in the Manx government for his resignation, describing it as "inadequate".
The East Douglas MHK said his role had become "impossible".
