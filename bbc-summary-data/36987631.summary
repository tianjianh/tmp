Super League side St Helens have announced a profit of more than £30,000 for the 2015 financial year.

Revenues at the Merseyside club increased by 10% from £7.1m in 2014 to just below £7.8m.
The financial result is a turnaround for Saints, who lost more than £370,000 during the 2014 season, when they won the Grand Final at Old Trafford.
"It reflects the state of the financial position and commercial performance," said chairman Eamonn McManus.
"The financial position is undoubtedly more challenging in the 2016 season, deriving largely from a number of months when the rugby results were not as we would hope for and expect. This inevitably had a detrimental effect on crowd numbers and their related revenue streams."
