Eight children's centres could close in Northamptonshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight children's centres could close and nine more could be moved to libraries under plans revealed by Northamptonshire County Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority is trying to cut its annual spend on such centres from £10m to £7m.
Those earmarked for closure are in Northampton, Kettering, Wellingborough and Bugbrooke.
A six week public consultation on the closures is open online with a decision expected in May.
County council deputy leader and cabinet member for children's services Councillor Heather Smith said the proposals had been devised in consultation with "our providers, Action for Children, Spurgeons and the Corby Children's Centre Consortium".
"Reduced funding from central government and unprecedented demand for public services means the county council will have to make £65m savings in the coming financial year, including a £3m reduction in children's centre services."
Those listed for closure are at Wootton, Headlands and Parklands in Northampton: the Ronald Tree centre and Thornton Centre in Kettering; the Croyland and Oakway centres in Wellingborough, and the centre in Bugbrooke.
