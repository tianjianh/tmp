It's from grass called 'hairy panic' that's found in every Australian state. It's 'hairy' as it's got long hairs along the edges of its leaves.
It grows really fast and can form tumbleweeds - dead grass with seeds inside - which get blown away and are making a huge mess!
One woman said she spent eight hours clearing the weeds, but they blew in again the next day.
Some residents are saying that the tumbleweed is coming from a nearby field that a farmer hasn't looked after properly.
Whatever the cause, it's making a big mess in the local houses - watch the clip to see for yourself!
