More than 1,000 people have turned out at a country park in a bid to break the world record for the the biggest ever game of hide-and-seek.

The current Guinness record for a hide-and-seek game involved 1,437 people.
The record-breaking attempt at Milton Country Park near Cambridge was organised by Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue (CamSAR).
It is understood the total turnout, while "close", was just short of the world record-breaking target.
The exact number has yet to be confirmed.
The search group hosted a hide and seek competition in 2014 which attracted 400 people and another last year which drew in 1,100.
A spokesman for CamSAR said: "If all (those) who had pre-registered had come then we would have just beaten the record.
"Still, probably more importantly, those who spoke to me said they were having a great time at least."
CamSAR is expected to consider another record-attempt next year.
The current record was set on 1 January 2014 in Chengdu, China.
