[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter and Stevenage cancelled each other out and had to settle for a point apiece in a draw at St James Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter started brightly and Troy Brown saw a header cleared off the line early on, and Ryan Harley dragged a shot wide with a shot from 20 yards.
However, Stevenage broke the deadlock with their first attempt at goal on 31 minutes. Jobi McAnuff picked the ball up in midfield and ran at the heart of the defence, who backed off, and the winger fired a low shot past the recalled Bobby Olejnik and into the bottom corner.
However, Exeter equalised on 52 minutes when an excellent cross by Lloyd James picked out Reuben Reid and he bundled the ball in from six yards.
Exeter always looked more likely to score in a second half of few clear-cut chances. Substitute Liam McAlinden saw a shot deflect over the bar and Jack Stacey fired wildly over the bar as the game drifted into stoppage time.
Stevenage failed to register a shot on target in a one-sided second half, but defended well to limit Exeter to so few opportunities.
