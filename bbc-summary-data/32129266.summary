'Slave contract' Durham teacher Kelvin Loraine in classroom ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who admitted having sex with a teenage girl and asking her to sign a "slave contract" with him, has been banned from the classroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kelvin Loraine, from Durham, began an online relationship with the girl when she was 15, a disciplinary panel heard.
He encouraged her to send him explicit photos of herself, the National College for Teaching and Leadership was told.
The 31-year-old worked at Hetton School, near Sunderland, but the girl was not a pupil.
The panel concluded Mr Loraine, who received a caution from Durham Police in July 2014 for possessing an indecent photograph of a child, should never work in a classroom again.
He met the girl, who cannot be named, on an online chatroom in March 2013 when she was 15 years old.
He encouraged her to send him between 30 and 40 sexually explicit pictures of herself, but claimed they did not have sex until after her 16th birthday at a hotel in Plymouth.
The panel said the pair entered into the "slave contract" shortly after she turned 16.
It said Mr Loraine's behaviour amounted to serious sexual misconduct.
In its conclusion, the panel said: "The panel have judged the facts to amount to both unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute.
"The panel are satisfied that Mr Loraine's behaviour is incompatible with being a teacher.
"Despite his previous good history as a teacher and his expressions of regret, the panel have recommended that it is both appropriate and proportionate to impose a prohibition order."
Hetton School said Mr Loraine, who taught maths, was suspended when his police caution came to light. He resigned shortly afterwards.
