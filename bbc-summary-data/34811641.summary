In April, the force set up Intervene to Protect a Child, to recognise the signs that someone may be sexually abusing or exploiting children.
It also helps officers to be aware of clues which may indicate a child is at risk.
Durham Police has been hosting events for other forces and health and education workers across the UK.
In April, the force set up Intervene to Protect a Child with Mentor Forensic Services to recognise the signs that someone may be sexually abusing or exploiting children.
The force said PCSOs had identified suspicious behaviour after attending the training and had "safeguarded children as a result".
