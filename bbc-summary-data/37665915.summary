[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number one Novak Djokovic suffered a surprise 6-4 6-4 defeat against 15th seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the Shanghai Masters semi-final.

Spaniard Agut, 28, had lost all five previous meetings with the Serb, 29.
But the world number 19 took the first set in 42 minutes with his first break point and broke three times in the next to triumph in an hour and 47 minutes.
Britain's Andy Murray plays world number 32 Gilles Simon of France in the second semi-final on Saturday.
Djokovic, a three-time winner of the event, was aiming to reach his 10th final of the season but could make little headway against Bautista Agut's intrepid, athletic baseline tactics.
The Serb failed to take the two break-point chances he was able to create in the opening set and it was his opponent who seized the opportunity, prompting Djokovic to smash his racquet beyond repair.
Djokovic had committed 37 unforced errors before beating world number 110 Mischa Zverev in the previous round, and was soon a point away from a 5-2 deficit in the second set against Bautista Agut.
He held off three match points as the Spaniard's serve showed signs of tension, but made further mistakes when serving to level at 5-5 - with 29 unforced errors in total during the contest - as his opponent secured a place in a Masters final for the first time.
