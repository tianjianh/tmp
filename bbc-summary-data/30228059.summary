Ebola outbreak: the West Africa you don't see

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When you think of West Africa in the news, what comes to mind? For many with no direct experience of the region, it will be Ebola and images of doctors in protective clothing, disinfectant buckets and body bags.

Of the 18 countries in West Africa, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have been worst affected by the disease.
The Ebola death toll in west Africa stands at 6,928, according to the World Health Organization.
Band Aid 30 was released to raise money for the relief effort - but the song has been widely criticised.
Rapper Fuse ODG, who is British-Ghanaian, said: "It's quite detrimental to the continent."
"I'm always banging on about how amazing Africa is and shedding light on the positive sides," he added.
Negative portrayals of west Africa are part of the reason he played no part in the charity single.
Ghana itself, where the 27-year-old was raised, has not had any reported Ebola cases.
But even in the countries worst affected by the virus, beauty and hope can be found everywhere.
Vidiya Sathananthan is working with Last Mile Health in Liberia, a charity that helps provides healthcare training and assistance in remote areas.
She is 23 and originally from Boston in the US. Since June, she's been based in Zwedru and Konobo, both in southeastern Liberia.
Vidiya says that in spite of Ebola, there will be peace and joy in the nation this Christmas.
She told Newsbeat: "In western media, people aren't seeing that there is such a rich life here even though it is hard.
"It is difficult but people are still being very compassionate and loving and caring despite all of that.
"People still want to have a life, kids still want to go to school, they still want to go to university.
"Life doesn't stop because of Ebola.
"People are still enjoying life, the holidays are coming, things are changing for the better, it's not a scary closed-off place."
She explained "In the area I work there is not that much Ebola but the fear of Ebola is still present.
"People are taking on preventative measures and being cautious, and are not shaking hands anymore but shaking elbows.
"In a beautiful way life goes on, people still are going to the markets, kids are still playing.
"There is still so much life here. There is this incredible hope in communities that they will persevere and get through.
"They will get through the war, they will get through the rebuilding after the war, they will get through Ebola and they will make it onto the other side and they will continue to fight and make Liberia into what it can be."
Moses Amara is from New England, in the west of Sierra Leone.
He's a volunteer with charity YCare International, which is helping train young people to spot the signs of Ebola and stop its spread.
He told Newsbeat: "There are positive signs and there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Ebola crisis, it will soon become a thing of the past for the country and once it is off our head, then the whole political social economic aspect of the country will turn around.
"We have great people in the country, great education and for all the youth, there is application of learning. I see things are really improving for the better.
One of the most encouraging things you see is in the young people and their willingness to learn... the awareness, that is what has really amazed me about my country, that, for the past decade.
Moses does admit things are hard.
"Basically the way things are going presently in this country, there is not much to write home about."
However he does say that people "are really trying to be happy, amidst the Ebola turmoil, because we are really seeing great signs of improvement with regards to the disease. All the residents and authorities are working tirelessly assiduously to try and make Ebola a thing of the past in this nation.
"It's a very lovely country, we have great people here. No one wants to be left behind."
