The collision happened near Delgatie Castle in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, at about 11:45 on Sunday.
Police said a 42-year-old woman who was a passenger in a red Volkswagen Golf, which was involved in the crash, was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
A 30-year-old man who driving a black Citroen C2 was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

An 18-year-old woman, who was also a passenger in the Volkswagen, sustained a serious leg injury and is said to be in a stable condition at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
Three other people who were travelling in the Volkswagen received treatment for minor injuries, police said.
