'Significant progress' needed in public service technology

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Significant progress is still needed to manage information and communications technology (ICT) in Scotland's public services, according to the official spending watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Audit Scotland has reviewed how the Scottish government and its agencies handle ICT, and found it suffers from a lack of civil service expertise.
The report updates progress since 2012.
It covers Registers of Scotland, the Crown Office, the Procurator Fiscal service and Disclosure Scotland.
It found that the Scottish government introduced an assurance framework two years ago, but it was not clear enough, and the Scottish government "did not oversee its implementation effectively".
There are now revised arrangements and the watchdog believes these need careful management and strong leadership. It was only last August that the Scottish government sought to find out the scale of its ICT skills gap.
In 2013, the 21 largest Scottish government bodies spent Â£739m on suppliers of ICT-related goods and services.  The spend had increased 15% since 2011, as government extended online access to services, partly to improve efficiency.
Caroline Gardner, Auditor General for Scotland, said: "When managed effectively, ICT programmes have the power to transform public services, and make a real and positive difference to people's lives.
"However, the difficulties in managing ICT programmes in both the public and private sector are well documented, and remain a complex challenge for the Scottish government and central government bodies. While steps have been taken to improve, and overcome obstacles such as the shortage of ICT skills in the public sector, today's report shows that significant progress is still needed.
"Our recommendations reflect the continuing work by the Scottish government and central government bodies and are intended to help them achieve the full benefits of effective ICT, particularly in this time of reducing budgets and increasing demand for public services."
A Scottish government spokesman, responding to the report, said: "We welcome that Audit Scotland's report recognises a substantial proportion of their recommendations have already been implemented and that further work is under way.
"We will continue to drive forward reform in the delivery of public services in Scotland, building on our solid reputation for effectiveness and efficiency.
"The Scottish government is committed to continuing joint working across central government to further improve ICT programme delivery, which is helping us deliver tangible improvements in public services."
