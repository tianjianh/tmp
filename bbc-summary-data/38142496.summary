Following on from her project The Apology, Casey focuses on Tasmania, where she explores "the notion of deliberate historical forgetting throughout Australian history".
"The work considers loss, historical memory and national silencing," she says.
"Portraits of indigenous Tasmanians reflect on the strength of bloodlines, identity and attachment to place."

Bruce's work is called Xenitia, which she describes as a Greek term that encompasses ideas of foreign lands, the state of being a foreigner, otherness, to be estranged, loss, distance, and a profound yearning for home soil.

To Sea Again by Faraz Pourreza-Jorshari documents the lives of ex-fishermen living in Grimsby.
Pourreza-Jorshari writes: "This unified sense of government betrayal, growing social inequality and bigotry of the media, led to the vote against the elite establishment in the 2016 EU referendum. This is a story about resilience of friendship, loyalty, integrity and pride."

Paola Paredes aims to raise awareness of a human rights issue in Ecuador.
She writes: "In Ecuador approximately 200 facilities exist to 'cure' homosexual men and women.
"Operations are masked under the guise of drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres.
"Imprisoned against their will, those interned are subject to emotional and physical torture.
"I recreated scenes from these 'clinics' based upon victim testimony.
"Being gay and from Ecuador, I chose myself as the protagonist of the images."

Stephanie Rose Wood has documented three Spiritualist Churches on the edges of London.
Wood writes: "The work is a study of loss, absence, and the need for reassurance that life as we perceive it is not the totality of our existence."

Wei Wu returned to Chengdu, her hometown, and spent three months walking more than 300km (200 miles) photographing the River Funan, from one end to the other.
