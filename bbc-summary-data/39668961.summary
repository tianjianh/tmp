Robert Kay, from Bonnyrigg, stabbed Carlo Volante, in a "one sided violent attack" in broad daylight in front of the victim's girlfriend, Mhairi Hughes.
Kay, 36, must serve a minimum of 17 years before he can apply for parole.
Judge Lady Rae said: "This was a brutal killing with an extreme level of violence used towards the deceased."
At the High Court in Glasgow on Thursday, Kay had pleaded guilty to murdering the 40-year-old in Bonnyrigg on 3 January 2017.
The court heard that he rented a room to Miss Hughes who was in a relationship with Mr Volante, who had moved in with her.
Following the attack, Mr Volante was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but was pronounced dead.
He was found to have 14 sharp blade injuries with nine of them being stab-type injuries.
Defence QC Donald Findlay said Kay had no recollection of the incident and his last memory beforehand was an alleged threat made by Mr Volante.
Det Insp David Pinkney, of Police Scotland, said: "Kay's guilty plea is testament to the overwhelming evidence gathered against him and provided by the local community.
"This spares Carlo's family and friends from reliving this horrific ordeal if it were to go to a full trial.
"My thoughts and sympathies are with Carlo's loved ones at this time and I would like to thank them all for their assistance and support during our investigation."
