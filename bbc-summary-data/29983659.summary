A British man accused of murdering two women in Hong Kong has appeared before magistrates and been remanded into custody for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rurik Jutting, 29, was remanded for psychiatric reports to be prepared and is next due in court on 24 November.
He was arrested after police found the victims - both thought to have been sex workers - in his apartment in the Wan Chai area early on 1 November.
He had resigned from a job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch a week earlier.
Before moving to the company, he worked at Barclays in London for two years.
A LinkedIn profile under his name suggested he was a Cambridge University graduate. Winchester College, an independent boarding school in Hampshire, confirmed he had once been a student there.
Police said Mr Jutting called them to the luxury residential building where he lived at 03:42 on 1 November (19:42 31 October GMT).
One of the victims, named in a court document as Sumarti Ningsih, was found in a suitcase after being killed on 27 October, a charge sheet said. She had sustained neck injuries.
The second woman had wounds to her neck and buttock. She has not been officially named, but was known locally as Jesse.
BBC Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu said the two victims were well known in the Wan Chai entertainment district.
It could now take months or even years for the case to come to conclusion, our correspondent added.
