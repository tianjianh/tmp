[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford slumped to a seventh defeat in eight games as Shane Duffy gave 10-man Blackburn victory at Griffin Park.

Rovers claimed the points for a first away win in nine league games despite Grant Hanley's red card after nearly an hour for a second bookable offence.
Substitute Tony Watt teed up Duffy who fired into the roof of the net with only four minutes remaining.
Defeat for the Bees was their 10th in 13 games, and leaves them just six points off the bottom three in 18th.

Hanley's dismissal looked set to leave Blackburn still searching for an overdue win after he was booked for fouling Everton loanee Leandro Rodriguez in the first half and then shown a second yellow card for deliberately handling an Alan Judge cross in the 57th minute.
Brentford - on manager Dean Smith's birthday - failed to capitalise, though, as Alan McCormack sliced an effort wide and Yoann Barbet tested Jason Steele from a free-kick.
Judge saw an injury-time effort tipped wide by goalkeeper Steele after Duffy had broken the deadlock, before centre-back Harlee Dean headed wide in the closing seconds.
Rovers eased any fears of being dragged into the relegation dogfight as they moved up to 14th, three points above the Bees.
Brentford head coach Dean Smith:  "I didn't think there was much in the game so to lose it like that so late on is hard to take.
"I wanted us to be hard to beat today and I thought we were for the most part.  We didn't work the keeper enough and our decision making wasn't quite right when it mattered.
"We haven't got the number of wins we think we would have done (since January) but to blame the current situation on our transfer policy is wrong because we can't and won't overstretch ourselves.
"Blackburn are a big, strong and experienced side and in a different league budget-wise to us."
Blackburn boss Paul Lambert:  "We are playing really well at the minute and should have more points on the board.
"I thought we deserved the win and looked pretty comfortable in the game. To cap it off late on with a world-class goal like that was fantastic.
"This is a consolidation season now but it will be a big summer. It is up to the club whether they want to go for it or keep doing this.
"I know from recent performances that we are a better side than where we currently sit in the league."
