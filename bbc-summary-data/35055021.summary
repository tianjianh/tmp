[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton man guilty of selling fake Hajj trips

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of theft over the false advertisement and sale of £3,000 Hajj package trips on a TV channel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mudassir Shaheen was convicted after 10 Muslim families who bought the trips, which involved a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, did not receive tickets.
The 38-year-old, from Green Lane in Bolton, is due to be sentenced at Bolton Crown Court on 14 January.
The Hajj is the pilgrimage that forms the fifth pillar of Islam.
Every adult Muslim must perform the journey to the birthplace of Islam at least once if they are physically able and can afford it.
Package trips usually last between a fortnight and a month, although the price of some tours, which sell for up to £10,000 per person, has often been criticised for being too expensive.
