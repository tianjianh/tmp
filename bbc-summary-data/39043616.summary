She believed that if she had had the right support and been in the right environment then she would not have faced the struggles that she did.
Ms Wells said: "I came out at the age of 13 at an all-girls Catholic school only to be told by those around me that it was just a phase."
With no support or guidance, the situation led to more confusion, the MSP told her fellow politicians during a debate on LGBT History Month Scotland 2017.
