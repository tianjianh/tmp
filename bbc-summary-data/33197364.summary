Wrexham historical abuse trial adjourned at Mold Crown Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury in a long-running historical sex abuse trial at Mold Crown Court will resume its deliberations next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jurors have been told victims were passed around a group of men at the Wrexham home of Gary Cooke, 64, in the 1980s.
Mr Cooke and six co-defendants deny a range of sex offences against boys aged 10 to 15. The trial began in April.
The jury started their deliberations on Friday. The judge asked them to resume on Monday.
The men were charged following an investigation by the National Crime Agency under Operation Pallial.
