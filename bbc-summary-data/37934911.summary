Michelle Logue said Gerard Mulligan did not see a psychiatrist for weeks after he killed his father, despite being on suicide watch for some of that time.
She said Mr Mulligan's solicitor phoned the prison regularly to try to arrange a psychiatric appointment.
His first visit with a psychiatrist was on 2 November, Ms Logue said.
Mr Mulligan took his own life at the high security jail on Saturday evening. The Prison Service said the PSNI, coroner and prisoner ombudsman have launched investigations into the death.
The 44-year-old had been on remand charged with murdering his father, Gerald Mulligan, at his home in Limehurst Way, Lisburn, on 25 September.
Ms Logue said in a letter to her from prison, Mr Mulligan said "he had never felt as alone in his entire life".
"His solicitor told me he had been ringing... to try and get him an appointment with a psychiatrist, but he only saw the psychiatrist last Wednesday," she told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
"So he hadn't seen or spoken to anybody about these mental health issues for all those weeks."
Prison authorities and staff must show more understanding for inmates, said Ms Logue.
"The people in there have done wrong but they have to be treated as human beings," she said.
"They have to be more caring and sympathetic. To me they do what they have to do, but no more."
Ms Logue said Mr Mulligan had tried to phone her several times on the day he took his life.
"I was working on the Saturday morning and he tried to phone me twice," she said.
"He tried to phone me four times in two minutes on the Saturday afternoon at 15:30 and I had laid down for a sleep and missed his calls  - the same day that he killed himself.
"I feel terrible guilt, because I was the love of his life and he told me I was the only thing that was keeping him going.
"So I believe maybe if I'd have spoken to him I could have stopped him on that day. But I believe it was inevitable [that he would eventually take his own life].
"I think he thought when he couldn't get through to me that I had fell out with him and that's a very haunting thought for me."
