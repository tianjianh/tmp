But despite offers of "nine-figure" sums of money, Mayweather, who retired after his 49th successive victory last September, is not planning a comeback.
"As of right now, I am out completely," said the 38-year-old multiple world champion.
"If I do get the itch to come back, it really won't be for the money but I have to get paid. That's why the nickname is Floyd 'Money' Mayweather."
American Mayweather won world titles at five weights and retired with an unblemished record.
Currently visiting eight cities in the United Kingdom as part of a speaking tour, he spoke to BBC World Service Sport about his current activities.
Mayweather beat Manny Pacquiao in the most lucrative fight in history in his penultimate bout last May and has ruled out the possibility of a rematch. That's despite Michael Koncz, Pacquiao's business adviser, claiming contact had been made with Mayweather Promotions about the possibility of another fight.
"Everything that you guys are hearing that Michael Koncz has said and what [promoter] Bob Arum has said is totally false. Totally false. I haven't spoken to Bob Arum, I haven't spoken to Michael Koncz.
"And as far as people keep talking about Mayweather Promotions, I dictate and control what goes on with it. Leonard Ellerbe is the CEO but everything has to go through me and I have to put the green light on any and everything."
Mayweather promotes WBC super-middleweight champion Badou Jack and wants him to have a unification fight with Britain's IBF champion James DeGale.
"James DeGale is a very, very good fighter and he is solid. I like him. A lot of personality. The ultimate goal is for him and Badou to fight in a unification bout. Do I think that can happen? Absolutely.
"He talked to me the other day when I was in Los Angeles at the fights. He said he would like to fight Badou Jack. But everything takes time. Eventually it will happen.
"If he continues to win and Badou continues to win, which I truly believe both will, the ultimate goal is to match those two in a super bout, down the line."
"I really wouldn't want to say the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. You know, I am no longer active. I would like to say the best ever (TBE).
"It's not being cocky or arrogant, it's just the proof is in the pudding. I think I have earned the right to call myself TBE. And I have lived up to the name TBE by going out there, day in, day out, when I was active and winning.
"Have I have ever took a loss before? Yes. In life. You lose a loved one, that's taking a loss. When your children hurt, that's a loss. When you are sick, that's a loss. But I got to where I got to from a lot of hard work, a very strong team, a smart team that stood behind me."
Mayweather beat British world champion Ricky Hatton in a world welterweight title fight in December 2007 and will meet up with the Manchester fighter again in Bolton as part of his tour.
"Ricky Hatton was a legendary fighter, a lot of heart, great guy, great person. But in the sport of boxing, a very competitive sport, the best have to fight the best. When Floyd Mayweather faced Ricky Hatton, he was at the top and I was also at the top. He has a great family. Great mother, great father. He is a good guy. But things happen."
"Life is great. My family has a comfortable life from me going out there and taking chances and taking risks. That was the ultimate goal. My kids will be going to college real soon.
"I am very happy that I was able to be a risk-taker. Roll the dice and take chances. Me being in the 12th grade, leaving school, leaving everything behind, leaving my family behind to go out there and do something that I love to do. It paid off in the long run."
