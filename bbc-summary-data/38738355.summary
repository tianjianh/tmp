A confidence-boosting workshop was held by the health board in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, on Monday.
Look Good Feel Better is a national charity and sessions will take place every six weeks.
They are aimed at giving women cosmetic skills to combat the side effects of cancer treatment.
The sessions are free to women undergoing treatment for any type of cancer and are led by beauty volunteers who teach the women how to draw on missing eyebrows and eyelashes and how to cope with changes to skin.
Head of the programme Lisa Curtis said: "Finding out you have cancer is daunting and life changing. The added stress of the appearance related side-effects can often feel overwhelming.
"Our workshops bring women together for an afternoon filled with laughter and friendship and they leave with a much needed confidence boost."
Pat Morris from Prestatyn has just finished eight rounds of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.
She said the treatment had been gruelling, but she had learned to cope.
"You do lose your hair, you feel a bit down, your skin's dry and rough," she said.
But she added the pampering session had been a "boost" and a "real treat."
