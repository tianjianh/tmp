[SN]TITLE[SN]
Community council election to be held in Leith

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An election is to be held for a community council in Leith due to a high volume of nominations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seventeen people have been nominated for the 12 seats on Leith Links Community Council.
Some of the other 43 community councils in Edinburgh struggle to persuade enough people to come forward.
Online voting will open on Wednesday 19 October 2016 and eligible voters in the area will receive information in the post on how to get involved.
Anyone aged 16 or over in the area can vote provided they are registered on the electoral roll.
Polling day will be on Thursday 27 October from 14:00 - 20:00 at Leith Community Education Centre.
Maureen Child, City of Edinburgh Council's convener of the communities and neighbourhoods committee, said: "Our aim is to deliver democratic processes that people can take part in and trust.
"To offer different methods of voting including online, we hope to make it easier for people to have a say and that can only be a good thing.
"We hope that by offering flexible ways to vote that it will attract even more interest in the Leith Links election.
"Community councils are an ideal way to support communities to thrive, to allow people from all backgrounds to meet and share ideas and to make change happen.
"They are a fantastic way of making public sector agencies aware of the needs of local areas, and can really help to make changes for the better."
