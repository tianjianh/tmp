Former Finland striker Shefki Kuqi is the leading contender for the manager's job at League One side Port Vale, reports BBC Radio Stoke.

The 39-year-old, who won 62 caps, has managed in Finland since his long playing career ended in Scotland at Hibernian in 2013.
After a spell at FC Honka, he is currently in charge at PK-35 Vantaa, who are bottom of the Veikkausliiga.
Vale have been without a manager since Rob Page left to join Northampton Town.
Aside from a brief trial with Wolves under Colin Lee, Kosovo-born Kuqi's long career in Britain started at Stockport County in January 2001.
He scored 114 goals in 438 appearances for the Hatters, Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich, Blackburn, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Swansea, Derby, Newcastle, Oldham and Hibernian.
Port Vale had been strongly linked with Portuguese Jose Morais, 50, who was part of Jose Mourinho's backroom team at Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Chelsea.
Morais was made favourite by leading bookmakers to take over from Page.
But he has now slipped to second favourite behind Kuqi - and BBC Radio Stoke have now been advised that he is unlikely to get the job.
