On Saturday, Posh signed Nuneaton striker Aaron Williams, 22, and 19-year-old midfielder Callum Chettle, son of ex-Nottingham Forest player Steve.
They followed the arrivals of forward Shaquile Coulthirst, defender Harry Toffolo and midfielder Adil Nabi.
"This club is all about finding talent that has great potential," Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"We've been conscious that Conor was going and we'd need to create options in the forward areas. I'd like to think we've done good business."
Saturday's 2-1 loss at League One leaders Gillingham saw Westley's side drop out of the play-off places into seventh.
