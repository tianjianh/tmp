[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rhyl Home Bargains car park 'murder over drugs turf war'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was murdered and two others were injured in a "vicious" attack over a drugs turf war, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Mason, 48, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, died after being stabbed at the town's Home Bargains car park on 27 October.
James Davies, 20, Anthony Baines, 30, and Mark Ennis, 30, from Liverpool, deny murder and malicious wounding with intent.
Jake Melia, 21, also from Liverpool, has admitted all charges.
Paul Lewis QC, prosecuting, told Mold Crown Court Mr Mason was "repeatedly and fatally stabbed" by the three defendants and Melia, as he sat in a van in the car park.
Justin Trickett and Sam Illidge were also stabbed but their wounds were less severe.
The court heard the attack was the result of a "turf war" which had erupted between two rival gangs over the control of the drugs trade in the Rhyl area.
The defendants and Melia were members of the "Pensarn Crew", sometimes called "Ste's Crew", Mr Lewis said.
Mr Mason and the others were members of "Mark's Crew", or "Marco's Crew" - although it was not suggested that Mr Mason was the leader.
"The fatal attack appears to have been an act of retribution on the part of the defendants and Melia," Mr Lewis added.
Jurors were shown CCTV footage of a white Renault van near The Cob area of Rhyl on the afternoon of 27 October, with "an incident" taking place in the background.
The court then viewed footage, shortly after, of Mr Davies and Melia walking towards Wellington Road, where the Pensarn gang allegedly ran a drugs operation from a flat.
Mr Lewis said their clothing was "visibly wet and muddy" and a witness would claim they told him they had been forced to run into the water to escape an attack.
Mr Lewis said Mr Davies and Melia believed Mr Mason and Mr Illidge were responsible for the attack.
He added: "Both armed themselves with kitchen knives...and said that they were going to get revenge for what happened to them."
The jury was told Mr Davies said he was going to "do them in," but they "wanted assistance" first.
The case continues.
