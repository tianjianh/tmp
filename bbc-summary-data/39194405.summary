Police have issued a warning after the incident in the Peebles area.
The fraudster said he was calling from the Royal Bank of Scotland and that his victim's account had been compromised.
He told the elderly man that police were already aware of the situation and called back two days later to convince him to transfer thousands of pounds into a holding account.
Police said anyone being contacted with such claims should hang up immediately.
