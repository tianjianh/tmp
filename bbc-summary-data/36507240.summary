Police have recovered £500,000 worth of drugs after raiding a property in Dunfermline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 25-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman have been arrested and are expected to appear at Dunfermline Sheriff Court on Monday.
Officers said they were acting on intelligence when they searched the property in the town's Birrell Drive.
They found about 7,000 diazepam tablets, 5kg of herbal cannabis, 3.5kg of diamorphine and 2kg of cocaine.
Supt Ricky Ness said: "Thanks to some excellent work by local officers and specialist resources from across the east, these drugs will no longer be able to make their way onto our streets.
"The success of this recovery would not have been possible without information from the public, which is why it's vital that the community continue to tell us about their concerns or suspicious behaviour in their neighbourhood."
