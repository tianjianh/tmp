Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow have had their divorce finalised.

The divorce, which was signed off by a Los Angeles judge on Thursday, states that neither Paltrow nor Martin will pay spousal support.
The pair married in December 2003 and have two children together.
In March 2014, the couple announced they were separating, with the process described as "conscious uncoupling" on Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop.
The concept is based on the idea of a joint spiritual journey, resulting in an amicable split which also takes the needs of any children into account.
The website crashed due to the volume of traffic when the couple's statement was published and the now-infamous phrase drew scorn from some quarters.
Paltrow later distanced herself from the original post, although she did actually use a version of the "conscious uncoupling" phrase in the blog post announcing the split, written under her and Martin's names.
Paltrow filed for divorce in April last year, citing irreconcilable differences.
Speaking to the BBC's Stephen Sackur last month, the actress spoke about the furore over the original announcement.
"It was such a difficult time in our lives... we didn't know that the conscious uncoupling phrase was going to inspire so much conversation.
"Ultimately, it's had a very positive impact... I'm very proud of it, I'm very proud of us.
"It's a commitment that I make every day to my children, that I adore their father and that we're a family, even though we're not in a romantic relationship."
Paltrow won an Oscar in 1999 for her role in Shakespeare in Love, while Martin and his band have won seven Grammy Awards.
They married in secret ceremony in December 2003, days after they announced Paltrow was pregnant with their first child.
They had already been together for a year, after reportedly meeting backstage at a Coldplay concert.
