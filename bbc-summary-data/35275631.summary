Labour 'needs a period of calm', Lord Falconer says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour Party needs a "period of calm" in the wake of resignations during Jeremy Corbyn's cabinet reshuffle, Lord Falconer has said.

The shadow justice secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet changes had been "an amazing distraction" from the country's issues.
Three shadow ministers quit on Wednesday in protest at the reshuffle.
And MP Alison McGovern has resigned from a party policy review group saying she could not work with the leadership.
Lord Falconer insisted the Labour Party remains a "broad church" but to be effective that broad church must not be "at war with itself".
"The country needs an effective opposition," he told the BBC.
"The floods, the junior doctors about to go on strike for the first time in 40 years, what's going on with Britain's support for the justice system in Saudi Arabia, these are issues that we should be focusing on. They are just examples.
"We as a party, in the wake of the reshuffle, which is an amazing distraction from all of these issues, need to be coming together and doing the work to provide an alternative to this government, which is a very bad government."
When Lord Falconer was asked if he would have made the same decision as Mr Corbyn in the sacking of Pat McFadden from the shadow cabinet, he said: "The decision as to who is in and who is out of the shadow front bench team is entirely a matter for the leader."
But when pushed on the issue again, Lord Falconer said: "I certainly wouldn't have fired him."
Mr McFadden was given his marching orders from his role as shadow Europe spokesman for apparent disloyalty.
Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, told the BBC Two's Daily Politics: "We need to draw a line under last week's events and move on."
Labour should "realign our fire not on each other... but on this government," Ms Powell said.
She said the resignation of Ms McGovern - MP for Wirral South and chairman of Blairite pressure group Progress - from a child poverty policy review was "a shame because I think she has a huge amount to offer".
Ms McGovern's decision comes after junior shadow ministers Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty, and Kevan Jones quit.
