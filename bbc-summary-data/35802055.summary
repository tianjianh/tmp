[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Representatives from the channel islands have faced questioning from MEPs on taxation systems.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guernsey tax director Rob Gray and Jersey international affairs adviser Colin Powell were quizzed by an EU committee.
Both made statements and the questioning included issues such as tax avoidance and exchange of information.
Jersey chief minister Senator Ian Gorst said it was important to comply with "all relevant international standards".
The European Parliament set up the Taxe 2 Special Committee to examine tax rulings, aggressive tax planning and information exchange in EU Member States and third countries.
Senator Gorst added their aim was to "pursue a good neighbour policy in our relationship with the EU."
"Commissioner Moscovici has described Jersey and Guernsey as important partners of the EU through our continued active engagement in international initiatives for fighting tax evasion, fraud and abusive tax avoidance."
