Ross County are hopeful of taking as many as 10,000 fans to next month's League Cup final against Hibernian.

The population of Dingwall is little more than 5,000 but Staggies chairman Roy MacGregor recalls the backing they had at the 2010 Scottish Cup final.
"It was a Highland gathering," he told BBC Scotland. "There was an exodus to Glasgow that day.
"It felt like a family wedding. We're hoping for something the same this time."
County, who lost to Dundee United at Hampden in that 2010 final, have been given 7,000 tickets to sell, while Hibs have around 25,000.
"We'd like to get more tickets and, provided we sell our allocation, we can," explained 62-year-old MacGregor.
"We're encouraging people to buy them early, to make sure you are there."
The Staggies sit fifth in the top flight and are also in the last eight of the Scottish Cup, where they host Dundee United next weekend.
Manager Jim McIntyre delivered the club's second major final by beating Ayr United, Falkirk, local rivals Inverness CT and Celtic.
"We set ourselves the goal of finishing in the top six and to get to, certainly, a cup semi-final," said MacGregor.
"We've surpassed that and now it's about keeping focused. On three fronts, it's a job-and-a-half for Jim.
"If we are lucky enough to pick up silverware that would be a bonus. It would be part of the history of the club, part of the progression.
"Winning silverware means you are taken more seriously.
"The rest of Scotland has sat up and taken notice, particularly over the last couple of years, with probably more than half of the clubs in the Premiership from north and east of Perth. I think that's a statement in itself.
"We're proud to be there but we don't take anything for granted."
Prior to Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Dundee United in the league, the Dingwall club paid tribute to the team of 1966-67, who won the Highland League for first time and met Rangers in the Scottish Cup.
"As a 12-year-old boy on the terrace at Victoria Park, that's what gave me the bug," remembers MacGregor.
"It's quite difficult to take in how far we have come in those 50 years.
"For people my age they have seen progression from the Highland League to the Premiership and now two cup finals.
"For a young fan, it's the beginning of a journey. Where will the next 25 years leave Ross County? Can we get into Europe? Can we win something regularly?
"I'm not sure where the journey is going to end but it's great to be part of it."
