Peter Robinson has received a standing ovation after his final question time as first minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The 66-year-old announced last week that he would leave his roles as first minister and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader within weeks.
Several MLAs paid tribute to him during Monday's session and wished him well.
He described the experience as surreal, saying it was "as if one was dead and listening to the obituary".
As assembly speaker Mitchel McLaughlin wished Mr Robinson well, a number of MLAs from Stormont's two main parties rose in applause.
Lagan Valley MLA Paul Givan said his grandfather had helped found the DUP in the 1970s alongside Mr Robinson, and added that the departing leader "transcends three generations of my family".
"I want to thank him for the legacy that he has left us and left Northern Ireland more secure than ever before within the union," Mr Givan said.
"It has been a privilege to serve with him in this assembly."
David McIlveen, an MLA for North Antrim, recognised his party leader's "four decades of faithful service".
"I have no hesitation in saying that whenever books are being written about Mr Robinson many of his critics will be lucky to get a footnote," he added.
Jim Allister, a former DUP MEP who split from the party to form the Traditional Unionist Voice, also wished Mr Robinson a "long and healthy" retirement.
DUP members gave Mr Robinson a standing ovation as he gave his final speech as leader at the party's annual conference on Saturday.
