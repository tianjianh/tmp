Jim McCafferty, who previously lived in Glasgow and joined Celtic in 1990, now lives in Belfast.
The alleged victims are believed to have been in their mid-teens.
A police spokesperson said: "A 71-year-old male has been arrested by detectives after presenting himself at a station in Belfast.
"He was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences against children in Northern Ireland. He is currently helping police with their enquiries."
Mr McCafferty initially worked for Celtic as a scout, later becoming one of the club's kit men and working with the youth team.
Football child sex abuse claims: What has happened so far
In 1996 he left the Glasgow club suddenly, citing personal reasons.
For several years he worked for other Scottish clubs including Falkirk and Hibs, before moving to Northern Ireland about seven years ago.
This is the latest in a series of abuse allegations in football across England, Scotland and Wales.
Some 350 people have come forward to say they suffered sexual abuse as children at the hands of coaches.
On Tuesday, the PSNI announced it was investigating what are described as "a very small number" of allegations of child sexual abuse related to football clubs in Northern Ireland, although it is not yet clear which clubs are involved.
