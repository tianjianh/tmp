[SN]TITLE[SN]
Elgin flood alleviation scheme practically complete

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An £86m flood alleviation scheme for Elgin is now practically complete.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A footbridge over the River Lossie - the final piece of engineering - has been formally opened, leaving only work such as landscaping to be finished.
Moray Council leader Stewart Cree said: "Today marks a milestone in the history of Elgin."
In August last year, the council said partially completed flood alleviation schemes saved hundreds of homes and businesses.
Moray had been one of the areas of Scotland hit by the remnants of Hurricane Bertha.
Mr Cree said: "This is Scotland's biggest-ever flood scheme to date and the largest civil engineering project undertaken in Moray.
"This and the other four schemes - Lhanbryde, Rothes, Forres and Findhorn - amount to a £150m investment by the council and the Scottish government in the safety of our community."
