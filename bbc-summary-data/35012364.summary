The Toulouse flanker, 34, scored six tries in 80 caps and led the national side a record 56 times, including to the 2011 World Cup final.
His final game was the 2015 World Cup quarter-final thrashing by New Zealand.
"We arrived at the same conclusions," he told L'Equipe of his conversation with Noves. "That is why I am convinced that my choice is dictated by reason."
The Ivory Coast-born back-rower - the 2011 World Player of the Year - played for nine seasons at Toulouse under Noves, who took over as France coach from Philippe Saint-Andre after the World Cup.
Dusautoir made his France debut against Romania in 2006 and a year later scored a try and produced a legendary defensive performance as his side stunned New Zealand 20-18 in the World Cup quarter-finals.
He also scored France's solitary try in the 2011 World Cup final when the All Blacks avenged the defeat of four years earlier with an 8-7 win to secure their second global triumph as hosts.
