Flight EZY6238 was carrying 170 passengers from Berlin to Bristol on Sunday when it was diverted to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.
"The aircraft landed routinely and was met by emergency services as per procedure and as precautionary measure only," said an Easyjet spokeswoman.
She described it as a "technical issue" and apologised to those affected.
As well as the pilot, some passengers reported the smell of smoke in the cabin but they were able to disembark the plane normally.
Ellen Braksator wrote on Twitter: "We're all okay, there was a strong smell of smoke on flight deck and emergency landed in Schiphol. No panic."
Nick Canham also tweeted: "I'm a passenger on EZY6238 Berlin-Bristol which just emergency landed in Amsterdam due to strong burning chemical smell."
A replacement Easyjet aircraft was organised to carry passengers onto Bristol after a delay of three hours in Amsterdam.
The airline said it was investigating to determine what caused the smoke.
