Ex-BBC DJ Jimmy Savile sexually assaulted victims aged five to 75 in NHS hospitals over decades of unrestricted access, investigators say.

He assaulted patients in bed, and claimed to have abused corpses, reviews into his conduct on NHS premises found.
The reports cover 28 hospitals including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to victims, saying Savile's actions "will shake our country to the core".
Savile, a Radio 1 DJ who also presented the BBC's Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before allegations that he had sexually abused children were broadcast in an ITV documentary.
The reports on Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor are detailed and, at times, graphic.
They explain how Savile was allowed unsupervised access to vulnerable patients, with a failure to question the risks of his unconventional and promiscuous lifestyle.
The Leeds investigation found:
Mr Hunt told the Commons one victim being treated at Leeds General Infirmary feared she was pregnant after being abused.
There were also reports that Savile made jewellery out of glass eyes taken from dead bodies from the hospital mortuary, he told MPs.
Sixty people have recounted how they were abused by Savile at Leeds General Infirmary, many were young people and teenagers.
One victim "Jane" - who was 16 when she was assaulted - told the BBC Savile took her to a local shop to buy sweets and magazine, but soon afterwards sexually assaulted her in a hospital basement.
"He pulled me in immediately and started to kiss me with his tongue", she said.
"At the same time his left hand went on to my right thigh under my dress."
"There was no conversation up until that point. I couldn't have said anything even if I'd wanted to, because he had his tongue in my mouth, which wasn't pleasant".
After the assault she said she felt "dirty and ridiculously stupid". She said she began to tell nurses about the incident but when they laughed felt she couldn't finish.
"All the staff accepted it, patients accepted it, clearly the porters accepted it as well."
Mr Hunt apologised on behalf of the government and the NHS, saying of the victims: "We let them down badly."
The health secretary said there was a "deep sense of revulsion" over the findings.

Why the NHS must heed the lessons of Savile
He added: "As a nation, at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes.
"Today's report shows that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes."
Mr Hunt is writing to all NHS trusts asking them to ensure they are confident about patient safety.
A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "deeply shocked", adding it was "important lessons are learned".
The Leeds report was clear that no one person is to blame for what happened at the hospital other than Savile. But it did describe a lack of curiosity about his activities.
Lesley McLean, Victim Support manager for West Yorkshire, said: "The parents of the children [Savile] abused in Leeds hospitals were already anxious about their child's health.
"What they thought was a treat for their loved one was actually their worst nightmare."
Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust issued a statement apologising to "each and every one of Savile's victims".
"There should have been far more scrutiny of him and what he was doing at our hospitals over the years, and more robust safeguards and internal controls in place to protect our staff and patients in our care," chief executive Julian Hartley said.
In 1988, Savile was appointed by the Department of Health as the head of a taskforce overseeing Broadmoor.
The report describes an inappropriate culture at Broadmoor that allowed sexual liaisons between staff and patients and discouraged reporting of concerns.
The Broadmoor report found:
The report said the numbers were very likely to be an underestimate of the true picture because so many former patients simply wished to forget their time at Broadmoor.
Noami Stanley, a psychiatric nurse who treated patients who told her they had been abused by Savile at Broadmoor, said police and senior medical staff dismissed her concerns as an "irritation".
She told BBC Radio 4's World at One: "I explained what I heard and what I believed was going on in Broadmoor.
"There was a pair of police officers who appeared surprised and looked immediately to my superiors as if to say 'do something about this woman, she's nuts'."
She said of the senior nursing officer present: "He gave me quite a severe ticking office and said if I ever ever spoke out of turn like that again I would receive a disciplinary and might get sacked."
Marjorie Wallace - now chief executive of the charity Sane - also visited the hospital regularly in the 1980s when she was researching a book.
She said there was "obviously something sinister" about the DJ and attempted to raise the alarm after witnessing his treatment of two female patients: "I went to the Department of Health and said 'What is Jimmy Savile doing here?"
But she says she was told Savile was bringing Broadmoor out of the "dark ages" and that he was a "good person, liberating this closed institution".
Labour's Andy Burnham said giving Savile "gold-plated keys" to the hospital was "one of the greatest failures in public protection and patient safety we've ever seen".
The shadow health secretary called for an over-arching, independent inquiry into the scandal.
"It would appear Savile was appointed to this role without any background checks at all," he told the BBC. "There needs to be more independent scrutiny of how the government of the day handled this."
Reports have been issued on: St Catherine's Hospital (Birkenhead);  Saxondale Mental Health Hospital; Portsmouth Royal Hospital; Dewsbury and District Hospital (including Pinderfields Hospital); High Royds Psychiatric Hospital; Cardiff Royal Infirmary; Great Ormond Street Hospital; Exeter Hospital; Ashworth Hospital; Barnet General Hospital;  Booth Hall;  De La Pole Hospital; Dryburn Hospital; Hammersmith Hospital; Leavesden Secure Mental Health Hospital; Marsden Hospital; Maudsley Hospital; Odstock Hospital; Prestwich Psychiatric Hospital; Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead; Royal Victoria Infirmary; Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton; Whitby Memorial Hospital; Wythenshawe Hospital, and Woodhouse Eaves Children's Convalescent Homes in Leicester.
A report about Wheatfield's Hospice, which is run by the Sue Ryder charity, has also been released.
Leicestershire Police has launched an investigation after one victim of Savile, who was abused as a young boy at a children's convalescent home in Woodhouse Eaves, told an enquiry team the entertainer was involved in the death of another child.
However, no reference to a child's death could be found in the records of the home, Roecliffe Manor, which closed in 1969.
Since the allegations about Jimmy Savile came to light, the police have looked into how many victims there may have been. A review of why he was never prosecuted has also been carried out.
But this is the most comprehensive account of how he was able to offend and get away with it for so long.
Reviews into his behaviour at the BBC and care homes are expected later this year - and will no doubt shed even more light on the scandal.
But for now the failings of the NHS - an institution that is there to care for the vulnerable - are in the spotlight.
He enjoyed unsupervised access, particularly at two sites, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, and was able to use his fame to intimidate junior staff.
What is more, senior management were too unquestioning.
The reports are loathe to blame individuals.
But with cases of abuse and improper conduct being reported up until 2009 - albeit much less frequently than in the 1960s and 1970s - the NHS has a lot of soul-searching to do.
A key report into Savile's activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital has been delayed after new information recently came to light.
Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville, where his now-defunct charitable trust was based, as well as an office and living quarters at Broadmoor.
Reports concerning two other hospitals - Rampton and Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust - have also been delayed.
There are also new investigations at Springfield Hospital and Crawley Hospital.
It is understood investigations at two hospitals - the Royal Free Hospital in London and Pennine Acute NHS hospitals Trust - found nothing to report.
The revelations made in a 2012 ITV documentary about Savile prompted more than 100 people to come forward, giving accounts of how they were sexually assaulted by Savile on NHS premises and in other places.
A report by the NSPCC said Savile abused at least 500 victims, including some as young as two.
BBC health reporter Pippa Stephens said there have been many significant changes in the law since the time Savile committed abuse.
