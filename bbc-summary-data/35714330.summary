Taylor Crozier managed the feat on an 81-yard par three at The Playgrounds at Bluejack National in Montgomery, Texas.
Crozier's achievement earned him a hug from 14-time major winner Woods, who has been off the PGA Tour with back issues - and a mention on Twitter.
"First hole at The Playgrounds and this happened," Woods tweeted, along with a video of the shot.
