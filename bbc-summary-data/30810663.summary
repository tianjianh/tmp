Neil Brand's Sound of Song - exploring the secret behind popular songs - will launch the year-long season on Friday.
In May, Strictly judge Darcey Bussell will lend her dance expertise to BBC Young Dancer 2015's Grand Final, broadcast live from Sadler's Wells.
The former Royal Ballet principal said she was "delighted to be involved".
Brand's Sound of Song, on BBC Four, will explore the elements that come together to create great songs, from Elvis Presley's 'slapback' echo in Memphis to the tape loops used by The Beatles at Abbey Road.
Other highlights of the year include:
"Over the next 12 months we'll be offering everyone extraordinary access to some of today's great artists and performers," said the BBC's director general Tony Hall.
"When the BBC gets behind something, working closely with lots of others, we can offer opportunities like no one else."
