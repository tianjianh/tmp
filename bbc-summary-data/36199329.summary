Paul Collingwood completed his 32nd first-class ton on day four as the visitors declared their first innings on 607-7, a lead of 150 runs.
England all-rounder Ben Stokes produced a devastating spell of bowling, taking three wickets in 16 balls for 12 runs, as Surrey collapsed to 65-3.
But Ben Foakes (36 no) and Curran (54) held firm to ensure the hosts secured the draw, with four wickets in hand.
Having resumed on 75, former England batsman Collingwood breezed his way to a club-record 22nd century for Durham, in an innings which included 11 fours and a six.
With the away side looking for a first win of the Championship campaign, Stokes trapped Arun Harinath lbw before having Rory Burns caught behind and Kumar Sangakkara caught at second slip.
Surrey's top-order struggled and when Scott Borthwick took a stunning catch in the slips to dismiss Jason Roy off Brydon Carse, the hosts were still trailing by 11 runs with only five wickets remaining.
However, Foakes and Curran's 83-run sixth-wicket partnership helped Surrey to 244-6 at stumps, giving them their second draw of the season and Durham's third.
Surrey bowler Tom Curran told BBC Radio London:
"We came in today in a decent condition, they batted well to get a lead and credit goes to the Durham bowlers - they bowled well to get in a position where they thought a win was on the cards.
"We came out fighting and in the grand scheme of things we are pleased with the draw.
"When I came in, Ben [Foakes] and I broke it up into small 10-15 minute intervals, they came hard at us.
"Ben Stokes is a true competitor, you couldn't get the ball out of his hand and he kept coming in on a tough wicket to bowl on and I enjoyed the battle with him today."
