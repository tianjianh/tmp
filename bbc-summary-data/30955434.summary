The triplets were born earlier this month, and keepers recorded this great footage of them playing with their mum, Kirana.
Sumatran tigers are one of the most endangered species of big cat, with fewer than 400 left in the wild.
They can only be found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, but the jungle where they live is increasingly being destroyed and they are at risk of poaching.
These little cubs will be spending a lot of time bonding with their mum, and the keepers will be keeping a close eye on them too.
