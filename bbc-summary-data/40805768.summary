Both were injured in pre-season with 19-year-old Cash set to miss around three months while Ward, 31, could be out of action for up to six weeks.
Forest boss Mark Warburton said: "It is a blow as they worked so hard and were outstanding in pre-season.
"We look forward to welcoming them back soon - they will work hard with the medical team and that will fly by."
Cash suffered ligament damage in his ankle in the pre-season friendly with Girona, while Ward has a calf injury.
Forest begin the new Championship season at home to Millwall on Friday, 4 August (Kick-off 19:45 BST).
