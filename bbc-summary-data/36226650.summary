North Kessock-based Charlie Phillips has spent years observing and photographing the mammals along the firth's Highland and Moray coastlines.
Many of the dolphins can be easily identified by the WDC field officer and others who work for the charity.
The animals are known by names including Zephyr and Yoda.
Among the animals photographed by Mr Phillips on Thursday was Zephyr's baby.
An estimated 102 individual dolphins breed and feed in the firth, according to a recent survey of the animals.
The Moray Firth and North Sea provide habitat for the world's most northerly resident population of bottlenose dolphins.
The species is protected by European Union rules.
