[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four trains from different eras have travelled side by side in a special event celebrating the past, present and future of Britain's railways.

The world-famous locomotive Flying Scotsman was joined by an HST and InterCity 225 from Virgin Trains' fleet, and one of its new Azuma trains.
They lined up on the East Coast Main Line at Tollerton, North Yorkshire, at 06:00 BST before travelling to York.
Hundreds of people lined the route to witness the unique event.
Paul Kirkman, director of York's National Railway Museum, which owns the Doncaster-built Flying Scotsman, said: "The East Coast Main Line has long been famed for speed and style.
"In the 19th Century elegant locomotives were designed to haul trains on this route, cementing its reputation as a railway racing stretch operated by thoroughbred engines.
"The four-train line-up epitomises the evolution of the later generation of fast, elegant and stylish trains - all with a shared bloodline - that epitomise the history of the route from the 1850s to today."
