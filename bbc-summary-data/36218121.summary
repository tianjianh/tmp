Bristol Rovers: No more appeals over Sainsbury's stadium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers will not be lodging any further appeals over Sainsbury's decision to pull out of a deal to buy the club's Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
High Court judges rejected an appeal in March after the club lost a court battle last year over the ??30m deal.
They ruled the supermarket operator acted lawfully when it ended its conditional contract to buy the ground.
Chairman Steve Hamer confirmed no further action would be taken in an interview on BBC Bristol.
He said the club is in the process of agreeing a new contract with the University of the West of England (UWE) to build a new stadium on its land in Stoke Gifford.
The original agreement was dependent on the Memorial Stadium deal with Sainsbury's.
