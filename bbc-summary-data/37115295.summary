Fresh plans lodged for £12m Conwy Falls hydro power scheme

Fresh plans have been lodged for a controversial £12m hydroelectric scheme on the River Conwy.

RWE Innogy UK wants to build the power station on the Conwy Falls, south of Betws-y-Coed - one of the most scenic stretches of the river.
In March, the Snowdonia National Park Authority's planning committee rejected the scheme.
It followed opposition by environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and local businesses.
In the new application, the company has said it would provide a safer exit for kayakers above the falls, and that there would not be any major surges in flow which would affect fish stocks.
