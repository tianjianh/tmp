The 27-year-old was suspended in August for an undisclosed reason and, following an internal investigation, he did not feature again in 2015.
Australia-born Carney has scored 63 tries in 62 games since joining the Tigers at the start of 2013.
"There are few stronger players in the league than Justin Carney," said Salford head coach Ian Watson.
"We are really looking forward to working with and getting him on track with our philosophy and goals here this season.
"Justin is an immense athlete with a strike rate that is up there with the best in the world. He is exciting to watch and our fans are going to enjoy watching him run at defences week in week out."
Salford owner Marwan Koukash revealed on Twitter that they have the option to sign Carney at the end of the loan spell.
