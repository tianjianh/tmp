[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 2-3 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronaldo Vieira scored a late winner as Leeds United came from behind to beat Norwich in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norwich took a first-half lead when Robbie Brady's header was deflected in off Leeds defender Luke Ayling.
Pontus Jansson headed home Pablo Hernandez's corner to level the scores, before Ayling set up Chris Wood to fire the visitors in front.
Kyle Lafferty slotted in to put Norwich back on terms, before Vieira's 25-yard strike won it in added time.
The result extended Leeds' unbeaten run to five games in all competitions, while Norwich's winless run was stretched to four matches.
Alex Neil's side have let in eight goals in two games and they are without a clean sheet in 13 league fixtures, conceding 26 times in that period.
The Canaries were top of the Championship table on 15 October, but have since fallen to fifth, 10 points behind leaders Newcastle.
Leeds have taken 22 points from their last 10 games, a run which has seen them climb from 22nd place to sixth in under two months.
Leeds manager Garry Monk: "Over the course of the game I thought we were the better team and got what we deserved in the end.
"I think the first 20 minutes was the best start to a game we have had since I have been here. We looked sharp, should have put some of our chances away and then found ourselves behind when we conceded a really poor goal.
"I told the lads at half-time that if they repeated those first 20 minutes in the second half there was a result to be had and full credit to the lads, they went out there and did just that.
"That's one for the fans to enjoy. It's a great result, but there is nothing to be won yet. We know we are not the finished article yet, but we are making good progress."
Norwich boss Alex Neil: "I thought we were a bit nervy early on, but once we got our goal we settled down and at half-time I told them to go out and get the second goal.
"But once Leeds scored there was a fear about us and although there was nothing wrong with the lads' effort it was obviously a very disappointing result.
"It's a difficult time but three weeks ago we were top of the league. I don't think I have become a bad manager in three weeks and I don't think the players have become bad players in three weeks either.
"Having said that I accept the buck stops with me - if we do well I get praised and if we are doing badly I get criticism, I fully accept that. We just need to raise our game and turn this around."
