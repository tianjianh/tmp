About 200 people attended the service in Douglas which included a montage of childhood photographs set to his favourite Backstreet Boys song.
All those who attended the service at St Ninian's Church followed his family's wishes to wear blue.
The entrepreneur, from Plymouth, died following an asthma attack last month.
His mother Rosemary Baggs said: "We didn't want people to wear black - Stuart wouldn't have wanted that.
"His favourite colour was blue so it seemed fitting."
Baggs launched his company Bluewave Communications in 2007 and, days before his death at the age of 27, held a press conference to launch his latest product.
When he was aged 21 in 2010, he became the youngest ever candidate to appear on the BBC One show The Apprentice.
Baggs, who was fired in the semi-final, became famous for his one-liners, which included "Everything I touch turns to sold" and "I'm Stuart Baggs the brand".
Following his death, Lord Sugar was one of the first to pay tribute to the charismatic contestant, tweeting that Baggs was "one of the stand out characters".
Mrs Baggs told Manx Radio: "The Stuart we knew was so different to the Stuart in the public eye.
"He was a very loyal, caring and funny person, who was the life and soul of any party.
"Stuart was always the person someone would want as their plus one because you would be guaranteed a good night."
Friend Shelly Rourke said he never judged anyone because he felt so acutely aware that everyone judged him. "He didn't want anyone else to feel like that," she said.
"Stuart would do anything for you. Seeing everyone wearing blue today will be a testament to how much people loved him."
Another friend Jo Cutsforth said: "The guy was exceptionally hard-working and very, very passionate.
"He was a boy with a dream and for almost 10 years he made that dream come true."
Paul Moulton, who spoke at the funeral, said: "Everyone wore blue as it was his favourite colour and his company name.
"Anyone who knew Stuart would know that he would have laughed his socks off at the idea."
