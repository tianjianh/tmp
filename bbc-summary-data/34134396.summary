[SN]TITLE[SN]
Re-thinking the referendum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Soon we'll see the UK government's proposals for further devolution when it publishes draft legislation.
We know a lot of the details already.
But one question remains unanswered: will there be a referendum on whether the Welsh government should have powers to vary income tax?
Not everyone thinks it is necessary.
Carwyn Jones has suggested the Welsh government should get those income tax powers without a referendum, as long as a deal can be struck on the size of its budget.
So, did Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb give consideration to the first minister's views over the summer?
"Yeah sure," he told us today, while visiting a factory making armoured vehicles for the military.
"I've been thinking about it and I've been listening to a lot of the arguments that have been made from different quarters as to why we may or may not need a referendum.
"Clearly that's something we are still thinking about and we will look at that again in the autumn when we focus again on these issues."
Autumn (seasons have a habit of arriving late in the political calendar) is when Mr Crabb will publish a draft Wales Bill, before legislation starts going through parliament in early 2016.
Everything is on course to hit that timetable, he said.
"We want to get this right," he said.
"We are taking our time. We're doing our homework on this and we're taking to Welsh government about all of the details and we're trying to make progress with it."
