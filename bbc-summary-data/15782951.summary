[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old from Liverpool, a member of 2nd Battalion The Rifles, died when he was hit by a bomb whilst on patrol.
He was serving with Delhi Company of the 1st Yorkshire Regiment, attached to the Combined Force in Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province.
His family said he was "loved by all" and would be missed.
In a statement his mother Carol, sister Kirsty and brother Ryan said: "Peter was very fit and he always wanted to join the Army. He was committed to carrying out a full career there. He will be missed by his family and friends and is loved by all.
"Peter was a loving son and grandson and will be especially missed by his girlfriend, Aimi. He will also be missed by loving dog Macey."
L/Cpl Eustace - known as "Eust" to his friends - worked briefly as a painter and decorator before joining the Army seven years ago. He served tours in Basra, in southern Iraq, and in the Sangin district of northern Helmand.
His commanding officer in 2 Rifles, Lt Col Bill Wright, said L/Cpl Eustace was "blessed with a huge character that matched his size".
"He had nothing left to prove as a warrior. He was one of those men you can completely rely on when things get tough," he said.
Capt Mark Endersby, of 2 Rifles, said it was a testament to L/Cpl Eustace that all around him, including the Afghan soldiers he fought alongside, were "deeply hurt" by his loss.
L/Cpl Eustace's death takes the number of British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 to 386.
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was "hugely saddened" to learn of the death.
He said: "The touching tributes I have read show that he was a professional and natural soldier who was held in the highest regard by all those who worked with him.
"He fought bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan prior to this tour where he has paid the ultimate sacrifice for us at home in the UK. My thoughts are with his loved ones."
