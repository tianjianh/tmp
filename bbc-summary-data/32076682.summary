A primary school in North Lanarkshire has been badly damaged by fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze broke out at St Dominic's Primary, in Petersburn Road, Airdrie, shortly after lessons ended for the day on Thursday.
A spokeswoman for North Lanarkshire Council said no pupils were in the school at the time.
She said fire crews were still at the scene and the damage was thought to be extensive. It was unlikely, she said, that the school would open on Friday.
