Korakaki, 19, was pushed to a seventh series by her 34-year-old opponent after missing a shot for gold.
However, Korakaki held her nerve to add gold to the bronze medal she won in the 10m pistol event on Sunday - her country's first medal of these Games.
Switzerland's Heidi Diethelm Gerder beat Zhang JingJing 8-4 in the bronze medal play-off.
