[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, in his 70s, was clocked driving at high speed on the M55 towards Blackpool on Monday evening.
Police said a patrol car signalled for him to stop but he came off the motorway and pulled into a Tesco car park at Clifton Retail Park.
He told police he "knew they were there" but needed the toilet. He has been reported for speeding.
Lancashire Police said: "We followed him and signalled for him to stop at junction four. He didn't stop - but didn't speed off either - and turned towards Tesco.
"We again signalled for him to stop and caught up with him at the retail park.
"He told us he knew we were there but was desperate for the toilet so didn't stop."
Sir Alex Ferguson was found not guilty of illegally driving on a motorway hard shoulder in 1999 after he told a court he was rushing to get to a lavatory.
Magistrates agreed with the then Manchester United manager's defence that it was an "emergency," and cleared him.
Bury Magistrates' Court was told he had been suffering from severe diarrhoea while driving on the M602, in Eccles, Greater Manchester.
