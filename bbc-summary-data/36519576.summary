The 29-year-old has scored 24 goals in 80 matches since joining the Canaries from Stoke City in the summer of 2014.
Of those goals, 21 came in 2014-15 as Norwich won Championship promotion, but they were relegated last season.
"It's nice to get this deal over the line early on so I can come back fully focused for next season," he said.
"Within a couple of weeks of joining I realised what a good club this was. It's a good set of players and the manager is really enthusiastic and wants to help the lads improve.
"We need to come back with fresh optimism to get the job done and get promoted again next season."
