A memorial to a stadium that was home to one of the oldest rugby league clubs in England has been unveiled in front of hundreds of fans.

Hull FC played at the Boulevard Stadium for 107 years until moving to the KC Stadium in 2003.
The Boulevard Stadium was demolished in 2010 and the Boulevard Academy school opened on the site in 2013.
The monument, in the grounds of the school, also commemorates fans whose ashes had been scattered at the ground.
Fans' group FC Voices organised the memorial, which was unveiled by the city's Lord Mayor.
Lisa Jewitt, the organisation's chair, said: "It has always been FC Voices intention to ensure that we never forget our old home at the Boulevard and that its importance and significance to the game of rugby league, the club and indeed the local community, is commemorated for future generations."
Hull FC was formed in 1865 and was a founder member of the Northern Union, as rugby league was then known, in 1895.
