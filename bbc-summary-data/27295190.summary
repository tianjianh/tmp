Robbie Powell: CPS meeting for father of dead boy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who has campaigned for an investigation into his son's death from a treatable disease is having a meeting with the Crown Prosecution Service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Powell, from Ystradgynlais, Powys, died at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, of Addison's disease in 1990.
His father William wants charges brought against doctors and officers involved in Robbie's death and an alleged cover-up that followed.
The CPS confirmed no review was underway ahead of the meeting.
Mr Powell has said that in the past charges were not brought by the CPS because of the passage of time since an alleged offence, but he felt more recent cases such as the spate of historical sexual abuse allegations against celebrities had changed that approach.
An inquest into Robbie's death held in 2004 heard a hospital consultant had ordered a test which would have picked up Addison's disease, which affects the adrenal glands, but the test was never carried out.
In the two weeks before his death, Robbie was seen seven times by five doctors, none of whom realised he might have Addison's.
The jury returned a verdict of natural causes aggravated by neglect.
An original police inquiry by Dyfed-Powys Police into Robbie's death did not lead to any prosecutions.
An investigation of the force's handling of the matter conducted by Avon and Somerset police found it was badly managed by senior detectives.
In 2003, Mr Powell met representatives of the CPS who said there was evidence of some grounds against a number of people involved in the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence for a jury to convict on some potential charges.
They said the passage of time since Robbie's death and earlier CPS decisions not to prosecute had led them to a similar conclusion not to act.
A spokesman for the CPS said of the current meeting: "There is no review into the case currently underway. The meeting is to allow Mr Powell the opportunity to explain his concerns to us."
