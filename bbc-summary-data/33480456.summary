[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted abducting, assaulting and raping a 15-year-old girl during a 32-hour ordeal in Fife.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard Mark Armstrong, 26, kidnapped the girl in Dunfermline between 12-14 March, as she returned home from netball practice.
He also pled guilty to assault and robbery offences against other women in the days leading up to the attack.
Lady Wise called for background reports and remanded him in custody. He was put on the sex offenders register.
The court heard that Armstrong warned the girl he had a flick knife and he would use it if she tried to get away or call for help.
He throttled her and subjected her to a prolonged sex attack in the grounds of a derelict cottage.
Armstrong then led the girl back to his home in Dunfermline in Fife and continued to subject her to sexual abuse and rape. The girl later said it happened "over and over again".
Advocate depute Jane Farquharson told the court: "The accused only spoke to tell her what to do, to shut up or stop shivering."
"The victim describes feeling scared and increasingly angry and that she just wanted to go home," said the prosecutor.
The court heard that at one stage he took her back to the scene of the original rape after saying she could go home, but instead of letting her go he took her back to his house.
The victim's mother had reported her missing after searching for her daughter. Police who were searching the derelict cottage at Kingseat Road found the girl's T-shirt, bra and broken glasses.
After Armstrong finally released the girl, she called her mother.
She was able to describe a wheel at the entrance to Lochore Meadows country park where her mother was then reunited with her.
Police who arrived at the scene described seeing the mother hugging the girl who was "shaking, crying and occasionally howling".
Miss Farquharson said the Crown would be seeking that an application be made for the imposition of an Order for Lifelong Restriction on Armstrong.
The judge told Armstrong: "You have pled guilty to an appalling course of criminal conduct culminating in violent and sexual offences of the utmost depravity against a young girl then aged 15."
Det Insp David Russell, of Police Scotland, said: "Today represents the culmination of a lengthy investigation which was assisted greatly by those who were victims to the actions of this depraved individual.
"Thankfully these types of incident are uncommon but when they do occur Police Scotland will take swift action to apprehend those responsible.
"Whilst I pay tribute to all the victims of Armstrong who suffered from his actions, the bravery and courage of the young victim who was subjected to the terrifying ordeal was outstanding.
"It is due to the detail and clarity of evidence she was able to provide that her abuser was traced and taken into custody."
