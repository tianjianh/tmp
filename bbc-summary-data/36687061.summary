Rory McIlroy bogeyed his final hole but has a share of the lead at the French Open after shooting a five-under 66.

The world number four is five under at 2018 Ryder Cup venue Golf National, along with Mikko Ilonen, Brandon Stone, Thongchai Jaidee and Jeunghun Wang.
England's Andy Sullivan is two shots back in a share of ninth at halfway.
Masters winner Danny Willett missed his second cut in a row after a 72 left him five over, but Lee Westwood made the weekend by shooting 70 to sit two over.
McIlroy had talked of struggling with his swing after Thursday's first round, but started in commanding form on Friday by making birdies on four holes on the front nine.
His excellence saw him move clear at the top until his only blemish on his card at 18 dropped him into the pack.
