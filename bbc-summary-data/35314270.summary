GB are fifth in the World Cup standings after finishing third and eighth in the two previous legs.
The final race in Hong Kong will be the team's last competitive action before March's World Championships in London.
"We're in a really good position at the moment. We've been recording some of our fastest times," said Wales' Horne.
"Personally I'm feeling stronger than ever. I've had some personal bests over short and longer distances so I feel I've got my stamina and speed there.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what I can deliver and how I can help the team."
Horne, 26, was part of the GB team that won bronze in the opening leg of the World Cup series in Colombia in October.
An inexperienced team was sent to the second leg in New Zealand, but GB will be approaching full-strength in Hong Kong where only injured Katie Archibald will be absent.
The qualifying rounds begin on Friday, with the semi-finals and final over the following two days.
"We've got certain things we want to try out in Hong Kong," added Horne, who will be joined by Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand and fellow Welsh riders Elinor Baker and Emily Nelson.
"It's about gaining further experience - it's another great opportunity to get three rides with the girls and keep working on things I need to."
Nelson will be the least experienced squad member, joining the established quartet for the first time.
The 19-year-old raced in the second leg in New Zealand and hopes to make another impression before the World Championships.
"It's the first time I've ridden with the girls and I've felt really included," she said. "It's all very relaxed.
"This weekend is a real opportunity. It's a really good chance to test the waters."
