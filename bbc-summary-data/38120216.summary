Crystal Palace striker Connor Wickham faces a long spell on the sidelines after suffering a "serious" knee injury in his side's 5-4 defeat at Swansea.

The former Sunderland striker, 23, came off on a stretcher after he dug his foot into the turf awkwardly in an attempt to tackle Gylfi Sigurdsson.
He left the ground on crutches and with his right knee heavily strapped.
"It's been a tough day for us because Connor looks like he's got a serious injury," said Palace boss Alan Pardew.
Both sets of fans applauded Wickham off the pitch after he sustained the injury early in the second half, forcing a seven-minute stoppage.
"Connor got the injury and that affected us, it was a bad injury," added Pardew, whose side led 4-3 going into stoppage time but conceded in the 91st and 93rd minutes as Swansea gained a remarkable win.
"Those seven minutes he was getting treatment proved costly for us," said Pardew. "A really tough day for us."
