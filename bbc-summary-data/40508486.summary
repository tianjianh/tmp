[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "unassuming" piece, dating to 1873, had been valued at £1,000 because of the damage, Charterhouse Auctioneers in Sherborne, Dorset, said.
The walnut table received interest from Paris, London and a dealer who was bidding from Glastonbury Festival.
London's Victoria and Albert Museum holds the original drawings for the table which is attributed to Victorian designer Edward William Godwin.
The table, which had a small part of the leg missing, had been owned by a woman near Bristol who sold it because she was moving house.
Auctioneer Richard Bromwell said: "By today's standards it is not too avant-garde, but back in 1873 there had been nothing quite like it ever produced before."
