[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Tsang, 31, from Oxford, was convicted in his absence last month at the city's crown court of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault. The crimes were committed in Hampshire.
When the IT worker fled he was also awaiting sentence for other offences, including three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16.
Tsang, of Sandy Lane, was due before magistrates in Hong Kong on Saturday.
The Chinese national was convicted of sexual offences against a teenage girl at a trial at Oxford Crown Court earlier this year. He was on bail awaiting his second trial when he fled.
During the hunt for Tsang, Det Chief Insp Katy Barrow-Grint said his victims had been through "a living nightmare at his hands".
The process to have Tsang returned to the UK for sentencing will now get under way.
