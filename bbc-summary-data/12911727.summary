Stuart Lubbock: Barrymore pool death anniversary appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten years on from the death of a man at Michael Barrymore's home, police have renewed their appeal for information.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Lubbock, 31, died at the entertainer's former home at Roydon, Essex on 31 March 2001.
Post-mortem tests found he had suffered severe internal injuries indicating sexual assault and his bloodstream contained ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol.
Essex Police said they were committed to establishing how Mr Lubbock died and how he received his injuries.
A new investigation began in 2006 and remains ongoing.
Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Wilson of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: "I am convinced that somebody knows exactly what happened to Stuart, and so far they have not shared this information with us.
"Ten years have now passed since his death and maybe those people who have harboured this information since 2001 may feel the passage of time may make it easier for them to now come forward and tell police what they know."
