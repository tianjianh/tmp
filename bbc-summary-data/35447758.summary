The former Stoke City trainee had only scored two league goals in his career before Tuesday but doubled that tally in a crazy opening 45 minutes that ended 6-1 to the hosts.
Sam Hughes, who opened the scoring after five minutes, scored two while Ross Laffayette struck for Aldershot.
After the break, Chester's Ross Hannah scored a double of his own, either side of Dan Walker pulling one back.
The win, which saw the hosts move up to 15th in the National League, was Chester's biggest since reforming in 2010.
In terms of Chester's overall history, it was well short of the old club's record 12-0 win set in 1936 against York City, but this was their highest-scoring victory since winning 8-2 at home to Peterborough in Division Four in August 1972.
They did win by a seven-goal margin when they beat Fulham 7-0, also at their old home at Sealand Road, in April 1989.
Alabi became the first Chester player to score four goals in a game since Andy Milner in a 6-0 home win over Doncaster in February 1997.
And all in front of a gate of just 1,425 - the club's lowest league crowd in the six years since they were reformed.

Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey: "It's hard to explain it but it's totally unacceptable performance and we apologise to all the Aldershot Town fans because that was a performance that we're not proud of.
"I take full responsibility and it's me who has put that team out onto the pitch and it wasn't good enough. I felt it was right for me to apologise to them personally.
"I think Damon Lathrope has been a big miss because he's the one player who can get the ball down and pass it to get us into good positions. We will be in tomorrow to make sure the boys know that performance was unacceptable."
