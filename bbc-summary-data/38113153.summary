Jamey Osborne fired the visitors in front early on, before doubling the lead from the edge of the box.
Danny Hylton pulled one back after Jack Marriott's pass, and Jonny Mullins slotted in an equaliser soon after.
Luton dominated from then on, with two goals each from Jack Marriott and Stephen O'Donnell ensuring a comfortable finish for the hosts.
The Moors had reached the second round for the first time in their nine-year history with a penalty shootout victory at Yeovil in the first round, and seemed set to go even further when Solihull-born Osborne placed his second goal into the bottom corner.
But the visitors were unable to match Luton in the second half, as the Hatters advanced to the third round for the fourth time in their past five attempts.
Match ends, Luton Town 6, Solihull Moors 2.
