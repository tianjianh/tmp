A Yes campaigner has denied that she lied about an MP assaulting her on the day of the independence referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patricia McLeish was asked by defence lawyer Liam Ewing if she had made the whole thing up as part of a political campaign and replied: "Certainly not."
Marie Rimmer, Labour MP for St Helen's and Whiston, is on trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court accused of assaulting Miss McLeish outside a Glasgow polling station on 18 September 2014.
The 69-year-old denies the charge.
She also denies behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on the same day, by repeatedly approaching volunteers and pointing in the face of Dennis Ashcroft.
Miss McLeish, who is a Unison convenor and member of Solidarity, gave evidence during the second day of the trial, which began in April.
She also denied that after the alleged assault she had called Tommy Sheridan, the leader of Solidarity.
Mr Ewing accused Miss McLeish of chanting: "Vote Yes and get Tories and red Tories out."
She told Glasgow Sheriff Court that she would have used the phrase "New Labour Tories" and added: "I wasn't shouting. I had swollen glands that day."
The public sector employee claimed that Miss Rimmer asked her where she worked and then was "in her face".
She denied a suggestion that there had been a heated argument on both sides which had been sparked by talk of politics in Liverpool in the 1980s.
Miss McLeish said she was handing out leaflets outside the polling station at Shettleston community centre on September 18, 2014, with another Yes campaigner, and Miss Rimmer was campaigning for the No camp.
She told the court: "The accused came in to my face twice. She asked me if I was a shop steward and I replied 'yes'.
"The next piece of conversation was 'where do you work'. I said local government and she said she was the leader of St Helen's Council.
"I thought after she claimed to be the leader of a council that she obviously had mental health difficulties."
Miss McLeish told the court she was kicked on the left shin by Miss Rimmer and reported the incident to the presiding officer.
The trial before sheriff Kenneth Hogg continues.
