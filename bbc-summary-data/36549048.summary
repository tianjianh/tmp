The incident at Pentrefoelas happened at 06:40 BST, close to the spot where a man died in another crash on Wednesday.
North Wales Police said Thursday's collision involved a Citroen Xsara and a VW Golf.
The road was closed for about three hours while investigations were carried out, but has since reopened.
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said they sent two emergency teams to the scene between Pentrefoelas and Cerrigydrudion.
"A woman was taken to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd for a check-up. A female child was also taken in with minor injuries."
"A male was given a precautionary check at the scene but did not require further treatment."
