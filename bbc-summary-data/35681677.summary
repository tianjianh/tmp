[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Early reports suggested a man had been hit by a van near the Hounslow Heath sale at about 07:00 GMT and a large group was fighting with knives.
A number of weapons were recovered at the scene and the event, in Staines Road, has been closed for the day.
Three men have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and remain in police custody.
Staines Road is currently closed between Martindale Road and Green Lane.
Officers initially said five men had been seriously hurt. Met Police have since clarified they found one man with leg injuries who was taken to hospital by ambulance and two further men were being treated in hospital for stab wounds and a serious arm injury.
Keith Todd, who lives nearby, said: "It is the first time [a fight has happened] in what must be 30 years of the car boot."
"It's a bit quieter at this time of year because of the weather but there's normally about 100 stall holders."
Mr Todd said there were only three stall holders left on the car boot site which was in the process of being cleared.
