The cost of prescription medicines in the Bailiwick of Guernsey fell by nearly £1m to £12.78m in 2012.

Geraldine O'Riordan, Guernsey States Prescribing Advisor, said it was down to a range of measures including an increased use of generic drugs.
She said the island's use of generic drugs over branded medicines was among the highest in the world, having risen from 38% in 1997 to 88% in 2012.
Ms O'Riordan said costs were also being reduced by a drop in overprescribing.
"Quality is really, really important, the generics we use come from the UK supply... they're made by a very small number of highly reputable companies," she said.
Guernsey's Social Security Minister Allister Langlois said it was a "significant saving" and meant medicine was prescribed to those in need "at a cost that is sustainable".
