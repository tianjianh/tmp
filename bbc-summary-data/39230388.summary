[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A children's care worker has been struck off after forming an "inappropriate relationship" with a vulnerable young woman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deborah Smith began meeting the woman after she left a home and they would go for coffee and bikes rides, a Care Council for Wales hearing was told.
Police were called to the woman's home after neighbours were "concerned something untoward was going on".
No crime had been committed but police alerted Cardiff council about Ms Smith.
Jo Finch, investigating officer for the council, interviewed Ms Smith and found "she showed no remorse or insight into her actions".
When Ms Smith was asked to describe the relationship she said: "As an advocate and a friend."
She said in interview: "When this incident happened we were friends. I'm not prepared to talk about my personal life."
It was told Person A suffered from a borderline personality disorder and would be considered a vulnerable adult as she was in receipt of care services.
Ms Smith was found to have caused harm to Person A, who wrote a letter of support saying she felt "distressed and overwhelmed with guilt" after finding Ms Smith was suspended in November 2014.
Ms Smith did not attend fitness to practice hearing at Cardiff's South Gate House.
