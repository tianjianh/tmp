Strikers David Clarkson and Wes Fletcher and midfielder Jack Leitch have been released, along with under-20s goalkeeper Brett Long.
Loan players Connor Ripley and Morgaro Gomis return to Middlesbrough and Hearts, respectively.
James McFadden, who is recovering from a broken ankle sustained in March, is among those considering new terms.
Scott McDonald, Steven Hammell, Keith Lasley and Stephen McManus and Craig Samson are the other experienced first team players mulling over offers - on reduced wages.
Manager Mark McGhee also wants to keep defender Ben Hall, while Craig Moore, 21, has been offered a deal after hitting 14 goals in 30 games while on loan with Ayr United.
David Ferguson and Dylan Mackin have been offered terms to stay following their loan spell at Airdrie while the club aims to retain under-20s squad members Robbie Leitch, Jack McMillan, Ross MacLean and Ryan Watters.
McGhee told the club's website: "We're talking to the lads and their representatives at the moment. I've gone on record saying I would like to retain the nucleolus of the squad then add some fresh faces in the key positions where we feel we are a little light.
"We obviously need to know what the lads who are already at the club intend on doing so we can plan accordingly and we hope that will become clearer in the next week or so."
