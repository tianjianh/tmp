Some 3,600 properties in Thorne near Doncaster were warned by Yorkshire Water on Friday not to use their tap water for drinking or cooking.
Tests have confirmed the water is safe to drink once boiled, the company said.
It added investigations into the cause of the contamination were focused on an industrial estate in the area.
Residents are being warned they may notice elevated levels of chlorine in the water, which the company said was used safely as part of normal water treatment processes.
People can still collect water from a distribution centre at Trinity Academy School in Church Balk but this also has to be boiled before use.
Yorkshire Water said it was continuing to distribute bottled water directly to the homes of vulnerable customers.
A spokesman said: "The protection of public health is our number one priority and we will only lift the new advice to boil water as soon as it is safe to do so."
