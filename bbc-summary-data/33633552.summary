[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A misspelt sign at a stop on the extension to Nottingham's tram network has been labelled "ridiculous" by residents and businesses.

The "Chillwell Road" sign appeared on Chilwell Road on Wednesday as workers put the final touches to the extensively delayed project.
The Â£570m tram extension to Chilwell and Clifton began in March 2013 and was supposed to open in December.
Nottingham Express Transport (NET) called the sign "a genuine error".
Greg Genders, who owns Crossplay Music on Chilwell Road, said: "I'm not really sure how they've made that mistake after all this time. Ridiculous."
Karen Lang-Norris, landlady at the nearby Hop Pole pub, said: "I couldn't believe it when I saw it. What a waste of money after all this time.
"Tram staff have been walking up and down this road for months, it's ridiculous."
Rachel Griffiths said: "The businesses on this road have had a lot of difficulties keeping going and residents have had a lot of difficulties managing the traffic.
"Things have been going wrong every day so it is just another thing that undermines people's ability to be positive about the tram.
"It is a little thing that won't take much to fix but it is something that could have been easily checked."
An NET spokesman said "a genuine error" had been made and the sign would be replaced "as soon as possible".
He said the opening of the line was "imminent" but a fixed date could not be given.
