Munster: European clash with Racing 92 rescheduled for January

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Munster's postponed European Champions Cup fixture against Racing 92 has been rescheduled for 7 January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pool 1 fixture, due to be played on 16 October, was postponed because of the sudden death of Munster head coach Anthony Foley in a Parisian hotel.
It will now take place at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir at 15:45 GMT.
The rearranged match means a new date will be agreed for Munster's Pro12 meeting with Edinburgh, which had been scheduled for 7 January.
The fixture would have been the Scottish club's first match at Myreside, where Edinburgh will play their home matches between January and May, rather than Murrayfield.
