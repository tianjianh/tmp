The victim, who was in his 30s, was attacked in Downshire Place, off Great Victoria Street.
Police have said the murder is not being treated as a hate crime, and they do not believe race was a factor.
A witness told the BBC he saw paramedics performing CPR for 10 minutes at the scene before leaving the area without blue lights or a siren.
An 18-year-old man has been arrested.
Det Insp Darren McCartney said: "We are continuing to investigate the murder of Hazem and we would appeal to anyone who was in the Downshire Place vicinity of Great Victoria Street last night at around 10.45pm to contact police.
"I would also ask anyone who has any footage captured from the incident to get in touch."
