Details of an ambitious Scottish celebration to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death have been announced.

The BBC SSO, Glasgow School of Art, The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and the University of Glasgow will all collaborate for the first time.
Director Graham McLaren will work with them to create performances, exhibitions and screenings.
They are all inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The idea is to look at how Shakespeare's words and stories continue to influence hundreds of years on.
The festival will culminate with one multi-media event at Glasgow University's Bute Hall and its atmospheric Cloisters on 23 April next year - the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare.
Mr McLaren, the man behind critically-acclaimed National Theatre of Scotland productions including The Tin Forest and In Time O' Strife, will be curating and directing the work of students, professional artists and academics from all four partners for the final festival, Dream On!.
He said: "Thirty years ago I was taken to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (then RSAMD) by a wonderful, canny drama teacher to watch Shakespeare for free.
"I sat in the Old Athenaeum Theatre and, quite simply, a fire in me ignited and a lifelong love of this great institution started.
"You will understand then the real privilege I feel leading RCS students with such a remarkable array of local and international collaborators and artists in what is certain to be Scotland's most significant response to celebrate Shakespeare's 400th anniversary."
Prof Anton Muscatelli, the principal of the University of Glasgow, said he was proud to be hosting the event.
He added: "The University of Glasgow will play centre stage in what will be a creative, inspiring evening of performance, dance and music - a fitting tribute to William Shakespeare, a man whose own artistic skills and creativity helped shape the English language and English literature around the world."
