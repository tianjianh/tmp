Wayne Fleming, who was known as Bagsy, was last seen near his home in Glenrothes in March.
His remains were found in the town's Riverside Park on Tuesday in an area of dense woodland.
Police said they were treating his death as unexplained while further investigations were carried out.
Det Sgt Sean Ferrier said: "Officers have been in contact with Mr Fleming's family since the discovery of the remains and we continue to offer our support to them during this very sad time.
"We have also informed the families of other local missing men from the Glenrothes area to make them aware of this development."
Police had been carrying out a major search operation for Mr Fleming, who had not been in contact with his family since early March. He was formally reported missing at the start of July.
