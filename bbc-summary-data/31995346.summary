Objector stops flood protection work due to start in Powys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on flood protection in Powys has been stopped due to an objector to the scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys council said the latest phase of work in Talgarth to help protect 19 properties was due to start in March.
However, they say a single objection has delayed the process which has resulted in funding being lost.
Councillor John Brunt said: "We are extremely disappointed and are actively seeking a resolution to the objection."
