[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wide range of historic and ancient items discovered across Scotland have been catalogued in the annual Treasure Trove report.

They include a Roman wine dipper found in the Borders, a historic brooch from the Highlands, and a gold ring discovered in Midlothian.
The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR) Catherine Dyer said it had been another "magnificent year".
She thanked members of the public who had reported their finds.
The latest report covers the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014.
It details matters dealt with by the QLTR and the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel (SAFAP).
Under Scots law, it is the prerogative of the Crown to receive "all lost and abandoned property which is not otherwise owned".
The latest Treasure Trove report includes more than 800 objects discovered by more than 250 "finders".
They are generally given a small ex gratia payment to recognise their contribution.
The items found included a gold Merovingian coin dating from the 7th Century discovered at Coldstream in the Borders.
Such coins were in use across England, but finding one in Scotland is highly unusual and this was the first of its type to be located north of the border.
A Roman wine dipper was discovered at Hawick, while an Iron Age strap mount, which would have decorated the trappings of a horse and chariot, was found at Dunbar in East Lothian.
Other finds included a medieval silver crucifix at Loch Leven in Perth and Kinross, and a 16th Century gold finger ring decorated with white enamel which was discovered at Roslin in Midlothian.
Ms Dyer said: "The report confirms that this has been another magnificent year with some outstanding finds being reported, preserved and displayed in breathtaking museum collections around Scotland."
Some canister shot from Culloden in the Highlands was also unearthed, as were fragments of a bronze age sword blade found at Dundrennan in Dumfries and Galloway and a Roman brooch located at Charlestown in Fife.
