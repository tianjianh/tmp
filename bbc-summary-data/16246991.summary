His daughter, Susanna, said the actor died of cardiac arrest at his Manhattan home on Friday.
Frazer began his career in the 1950s playing character roles in various TV series including The Phil Silvers Show.
He played Captain McNeil during all five seasons of the Telly Savalas cop show, which ran from 1973 to 1978.
He also had roles in The Andy Griffith Show, The Untouchables, McHale's Navy and My Favourite Martian.
The actor made his big-screen debut in 1963 Sidney Poitier film Lilies of the Field and appeared in two early Woody Allen comedies, Take the Money and Run and Bananas.
After the initial run of Kojak, Frazer reprised his role as Captain McNeil in the 1983 TV film Kojak: The Belarus File.
In recent years he had guest roles on all three programmes in the Law and Order franchise.
He also appeared in independent film The Pack with Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss, which screened at a number of film festivals earlier this year.
Susanna Frazer described her father as a "very truthful, naturalistic actor".
