The CCTV image of Janet MaKay was from about 13:30-14:00 on Wednesday 16 September - the day she went missing - on Glasgow Road, Clydebank.
Ms McKay, of Knightswood, got off the M11 First Bus onto Glasgow Road.
Police have urged people in Clydebank and the surrounding area to check their gardens and outbuildings for her.
Ch Insp John McBride said: "This is the first confirmed sighting of Janet since she went missing, and it would appear she has travelled to the Clydebank area.
"Although this CCTV sighting is a week ago, when she went missing, I need people to help us, cast your mind back, did you see a woman fitting Janet's description in those areas?
"Can you help with any information, however insignificant you might feel it is? Please call police immediately on 101."
Officers returned to the Knightswood area on Wednesday to speak to pedestrians and motorists.
Police have also issued images of a light cream jacket and brown handbag Ms McKay had when she went missing.
She is also believed to have been wearing dark trousers, dark maroon boots and could possibly have had a pink jacket with her.
Ms McKay is described as white, 4ft 10in tall, with a slight build and short grey/white hair.
Her family are increasingly concerned for her wellbeing.
Daughter Rhona Walters said: "A week has passed and mum hasn't had any medication. Obviously there are implications with that.
"Her doctors have said she was good for about a week and after that it will give us a bit of concern.
"Anyone out there, please be vigilant for an elderly lady, whether my mother or not, who is in a distressed state or confused."
Ch Insp John McBride added: "Her family are devastated and very distressed at her disappearance, and just want to get her home safe and well as soon as possible.
"We've been co-ordinating a number of searches in areas that Janet may be or have travelled to, but unfortunately these have proved unsuccessful.
"The support we've received from the local community and beyond has been a great help, and thousands of people have shared her image online along with the appeal."
He said police had been working with bus companies as Ms McKay was known to travel around the city centre as well as around Knightswood, Scotstoun and Govan, and further afield to the Largs and Helensburgh areas.
Ch Insp McBride reiterated an appeal for bus users to keep an eye out for her.
"We've also circulated Janet's image and description to the charity Missing People, who have been able to issue this image to Royal Mail delivery staff via their handheld personal digital assistants and they are arranging for her image to be displayed in their digi-boards in train stations," he added.
"I would like to strongly reiterate our appeal to the public, please help us by sharing Janet's image online. If you live in the areas that Janet was last seen or in an area she may have travelled to, please check any outbuildings or sheds you might have as she may have taken refuge in there."
