British number one Nick Matthew says the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia could be the perfect place to call time on his squash career.

The world number four said his current form means defending the Commonwealth title for a second time is realistic.
"I will be close to 38 and going to the Gold Coast would be a nice swansong," Matthew told BBC East Midlands Today.
"Squash is my life and hopefully I will stay in the sport forever, but that might be the end of my playing career."
Sheffield-born nine-times national champion Matthew had previously contemplated retirement before his victory at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow three years ago.
But that success, coupled with a fine injury-free season which has included another national title and the runner's up spot at last week's prestigious British Open, means he is eager to prolong his career.
"Glasgow was a great platform for squash. A million people watched the singles final live on TV," said Matthew, who now plays for Nottingham in the Premier Squash League.
"A year ago I didn't know how much longer I would be able to suffer it on tour; I was really struggling with injuries, but I have come back and have been playing some of the best squash of my career."
At 36, Matthew was the oldest British Open finalist since Pakistan's Hashim Khan in the 1950s, but he missed out on a fourth title when he lost to Gregory Gaultier.
"I was disappointed not to have won because you start dreaming of that fairytale ending and being one of the oldest ever winners," he added.
"But I have to look at the journey I have been on, and it is great feeling like I can contend at this level a bit longer. I hope it wasn't just a flash a pan. I hope I have got the preparation nailed on after lots of injuries."
The only noteworthy medal missing from former world number one Matthew's trophy cabinet is out of his control.
"The one regret of my career, and probably any squash player's career in this era, is that squash has not yet been an Olympic sport.
"We feel that we could would grace the Games - it would be our pinnacle and that gold medal would be the ultimate."
