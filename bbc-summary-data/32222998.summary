In pictures: Guinea-Bissau's party people

Thousands of people flock to a tiny island off Guinea-Bissau to party hard at a three day music festival every Easter:

It can take five hours by ferry from the West African nation's capital, Bissau, to reach the island of Bubaque. Its festival is now in its sixth year and musicians came from Senegal, France and Portugal as well as Guinea-Bissau to enjoy the shindig.
Guinea-Bissau-born artist Star Candinha, pictured, was among the singers this year. Other performers included a founder of modern Guinea-Bissau music Sidonio, gumbe rhythm musician Manecas Costa and reggae artist Ombre Zion.
Acts ranged from hip-hop to traditional music, like this dance troop which kicked off the festival.
Like most of the revellers, rapper MC Lady travelled across the water from Bissau. More than 5,000 people came to the festival on Bubaque, which has a population of less than 10,000.
The influx of visitors didn't stop Bubaque islanders from catching a game of football.
The visitors stayed on the island for three days, hanging out on the beach by the concert venue. Bubaque is one of the nearly 90 islands that make up the Bijagos archipelago off the coast of Guinea-Bissau in the Atlantic Ocean.
Festival director Brian King says the archipelago's inhabitants want it to be recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage site, which would require they show it has a globally unique biological diversity as well as unique cultural traditions.
Exhausted after the partying, people head back home on ferries specially put on for the Bubaque Festival revellers. (Photos from Ricci Shryock)
