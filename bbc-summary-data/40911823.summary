Scotland scored twice in three minutes in the final quarter to win 2-1 in Glasgow.
James Carson gave Wales the lead from a penalty corner, but Ben Cosgrove and Alan Forsyth won it for the hosts.
Earlier the Wales women's team lost 3-0 to Italy to finish fourth at their EuroHockey Championships in Cardiff.
Chiara Tiddi, Celina Traverso and Federica Carta scored the Italian goals.
"We came out fighting for the bronze today but just couldn't hit the line," midfielder Sian French told BBC Wales Sport.
"We'll keep on pushing as a team for the next two years and we'll come back even stronger next time."
Because two teams get promoted from the B Division, Wales's men will compete in Europe's top tier at the next EuroHockey Championships in 2019.
On Friday, Wales women's hopes of rising into Europe's top tier were shattered in a 2-1 defeat by Russia.
Wales' men secured promotion to their top tier by beating France 4-3 in their semi-final in Glasgow.
Wales women had beaten Austria and Poland, but lost to Belarus on the way to the semi-finals.
Neither Wales side has been in the EuroHockey A Division since it was reduced to eight teams more than a decade ago.
The nation's women were playing in the third tier just four years ago.
