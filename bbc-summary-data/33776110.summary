The 19-year-old is the second Gunners youngster to join the Tigers for the 2015-16 season after midfielder Isaac Hayden, 20, also agreed a loan deal.
Akpom has previously had loan spells with Brentford, Coventry City and Nottingham Forest, but failed to score in 21 league appearances.
He could make his debut for Hull in their Championship opener against Huddersfield on Saturday.
Akpom told the club website: "I'm really happy to be here and I'm looking forward to helping the team push for promotion.
"Hopefully we can be successful and I can help with that. We're going to be one of the stronger teams in the Championship."
