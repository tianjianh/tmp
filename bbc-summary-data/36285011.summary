[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff at Luas are taking industrial action in an ongoing row over pay and conditions.
A further two days of strike action are planned for 26 and 27 May as well as further days in June.
Tram operator Transdev is believed to be willing to resume talks with SIPTU if the drivers indicate that there is a solid basis for doing so.
The company's managing director Gerry Madden has said he believes it is the final opportunity to resolve the dispute before more serious, unspecified, consequences for both sides.
Meanwhile, Luas drivers have amended the times of their additional strikes, scheduled for June, in order to avoid potential disruption to students doing the junior and leaving certificate examinations.
They have formally notified Transdev that the strikes on 8, 9 and 10 June - the first three days of the state examination timetable - will take place between 16:00 and 22:00 local time.
Four-hour stoppages are also planned for 2, 3 and 7 June.
Siptu has accused Transdev of locking its members out of talks in the ongoing dispute.
Speaking on RTÃ‰'s Morning Ireland, Siptu's divisional organiser Owen Reidy said drivers wanted to resolve the dispute but required a "fair and sustainable" deal with management to do so.
He said that the company had refused to agree to talks for the last 19 days and also would not engage in talks that involved a third party negotiator.
