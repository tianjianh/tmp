[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 3-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich went top of the Championship as they got the better of a stubborn 10-man Burton Albion side at Carrow Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Olsson fired Norwich ahead in the first half, but Burton levelled as Lucas Akins netted from close range.
Parity lasted less than a minute as Jacob Murphy put Norwich back in front as his effort went in off the post.
Tom Flanagan was sent off for a second booking as he handled in the area, but Robbie Brady's penalty was saved before Ivo Pinto shot high into the net.
Norwich are now a point clear at the summit after previous leaders Huddersfield went down 1-0 at Reading.
Burton had the better of the early play, although they only had Lloyd Dyer's 15th-minute shot over the bar to show for it before Olsson got on the end of Graham Dorrans' pass having started the move out wide.
Akins steered in Albion's equaliser straight after half-time following a goalmouth scramble, but seconds later Murphy put Norwich back in front with his fifth goal of the season from Cameron Jerome's lay-off.
Flanagan was harshly given his second booking as a shot from outside the box hit his arm, but Jon McLaughlin got down to his right to keep out Brady's penalty before smothering a Jerome effort soon after.
Although Burton's Jackson Irvine sent a header just wide, Norwich dominated with a man's advantage - Brady hit the side-netting and Olsson went close to his second before defender Pinto wrapped up the points.
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"I am satisfied with the result because that is the main thing in any game, to win it.
"As for the performance, well I thought there were a number of good individual displays but did we play well as a collective unit? I think we could probably have been better.
"The main thing is we are getting results, that is what it is all about."
Burton manager Nigel Clough:
"We were playing against a side who were in the Premier League five months ago, who could afford to change their whole side after winning at Everton in the cup in midweek.
"So to have pushed them so close, and created so many chances, is a good thing, I suppose.
"In the end we were punished for conceding two really poor goals. The second one should never have happened - we had just equalised and you have got to defend better than that from the kick-off."
