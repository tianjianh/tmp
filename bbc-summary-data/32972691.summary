The commission is pursuing the US giant for alleged anti-competitive behaviour over its shopping service.
But Ms Vestager says there are still active investigations into its mapping, travel, flight, third party data and advertising businesses.
She told BBC Business Live there had been "a number of complaints about the copying of third party content".
The Danish politician explained why she was starting her investigations around the area of Google's shopping service, rather than any of the other of the company's activities.
"I found it was just prudent to take one of the first areas in which there was complaints, and then of course to refresh the case when it comes to the data," she said.
"But also to find a way to move the case forward."
In April, the European Union filed a complaint against Google over its alleged anti-competitive behaviour.
Announcing the decision at the time, Ms Vestager said any action against Google was aimed at helping consumers and innovative companies in Europe.
Google has been under investigation for the past five years after allegations that the firm's promotion of its own shopping links amounted to an abuse of its dominance in search.
Ms Vestager told the BBC that no tool should be "taboo" or left "untouched" when dealing with competition issues.
If that means going to court she says the commission will take a company to court, but if "the best thing is to settle [out of court], then we will settle".
She also said that the European single economic market had to remain "open and competitive".
