Councils and utility companies could be fined up to £5,000 a day for leaving roadworks unmanned at weekends, the Department for Transport has said.

The proposal is among measures the government is considering to reduce congestion on English A-roads.
Roadworks on major routes would also have to take place seven days a week so that projects are completed sooner or be lifted until they resume.
The transport secretary said the plans offered "welcome relief" for drivers.
Patrick McLoughlin said: "Roadworks can be essential but that doesn't mean they should be in place any longer than is absolutely necessary.
"These commonsense measures will be a welcome relief to those trying to get from A to B on our local roads."
It is estimated there are about two million roadworks every year, with drivers losing millions of hours annually by being stuck in traffic.
Councils and utility companies would be fined for needlessly inconveniencing drivers by leaving road works in place over weekends when no-one is working on them.
Penalties could also be handed out to those who leave temporary traffic lights in place after work has been finished.
Daily fines of £5,000 currently exist for roadworks that overrun.
The Department for Transport plans would only apply to A-roads, which are managed by local authorities.
Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: "Road users see red when they come across sets of temporary traffic lights that are stopping traffic but there are no workmen in sight or the work has actually finished.
"Ministers can't stop utility companies digging up the roads but they can make firms pay the price if the work is not done swiftly and they do not tidy up after themselves."
