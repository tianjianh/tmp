[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has resumed deliberations for a second day about whether a tenant murdered his landlord in Swansea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denied murder.
The body of Mr Warburton was found in a disused quarry in north Wales over a month after disappearing.
The two-week trial at Swansea Crown Court has heard claims that the accused "lost control" after a request for sexual favours.
The jury was sent out to consider its verdict on Monday afternoon.
