A beachside rock concert featuring the Kaiser Chiefs had to be abandoned when the high tide inundated the arena.

The band were due to play the Wave 105 Night Air on Bournemouth beach on Friday night, as part of the resort's four-day annual air festival.
Concert-goers were told to leave the beach when the sea encroached into the audience area and damaged the stage.
Organisers apologised and blamed "a combination of exceptional wind and sea conditions".
Travis had played earlier in the evening, but with the sea creeping into the audience area and threatening the stage structure, the decision was taken to cancel the Leeds band's headline slot shortly before 22:00 BST.
Festival organisers insisted the tidal conditions "could not be fully anticipated".
"This was caused by direct southerly/south-westerly winds and short period strong waves which added to the forecast high spring tide," a statement said
"This created high levels of water on the beach that had been unprecedented in all the years of staging the event. This decision was taken in the interest of public safety,"
About 5,000 fans were at the event.
Anthony Carrier from Fawley in Hampshire, who was at the show with his son and his friend, said about a quarter of the audience area became covered in water when the announcement was made that the show was ending early.
"I was more concerned about people getting trampled than getting wet," he said.
"For the amount of people, it was the right decision - it was only going to get worse.
"There was a lot of booing but it wasn't unexpected."
The Leeds band posted an apology to fans on Twitter. Lead singer Ricky Wilson said: "Some things can't be predicted.
"Tonight our show in Bournemouth was cancelled - the stage was in danger and they didn't want it falling on you, and they didn't want us on it when it fell."
With winds of up to 49mph expected, all daytime flying displays have been cancelled on Saturday.
More concert performances due to take place later have also been cancelled due to damage to the beach stage areas.
