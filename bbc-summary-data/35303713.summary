The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has been named as the official charity for the Tour de Yorkshire.

All money raised is to be used by the RNLI in Yorkshire where it operates nine lifeboat stations.
The cycle race to be held over three days covers 320 miles (515 km) through the county.
It is to start on 29 April in Beverley, East Yorkshire, and end on 1 May in the North Yorkshire resort of Scarborough.
Last year's inaugural race was watched by an estimated 1m people.
The race was launched after Yorkshire hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014.
Leesa Harwood, from the RNLI, said they relied on "voluntary donations and without our supporters we simply wouldn't be able to provide crews with the equipment and training they need."
The RNLI Flood Rescue Team recently helped hundreds of people during flooding in Cumbria.
The organisation operates about 235 lifeboat stations in the UK and Ireland and more than 200 lifeguard units on UK beaches.
