A couple badly injured in the Boston Marathon bombings have marked the third anniversary of the attack by donating £10,000 to a charity appeal helping flood victims in Cumbria.

Eric and Ann Whalley, originally from Cockermouth and Maryport, have given the money to the Cumbria Community Foundation's Flood Recovery Fund.
The appeal was launched in the wake of heavy storms in December.
The Whalleys, who now live in Boston, emigrated 27 years ago.
Mr Whalley lost sight in one eye and suffered shrapnel damage to his brain when terrorists detonated two bombs close to the finish line of the city's annual marathon on 15 April 2013.
His wife sustained shrapnel and burns injuries to her limbs, neck and face.
They underwent more than 20 operations each in the aftermath.
A social media campaign launched following the attack raised £100,000 for the medical bills of the former Cockermouth Grammar School pupils.
In a statement accompanying their donation, the couple, who are both 68, said: "We were so touched by the well wishes, kindness, support and generosity from family, friends and fellow west Cumbrians which helped significantly with our recovery.
"We are sad to learn about the devastation resulting from the floods in Cumbria and we would like to thank you all by giving forward."
Andy Beeforth, chief executive of the foundation said the Whalleys "embody the true 'Spirit of Cumbria' which we have seen time and again since the terrible floods".
