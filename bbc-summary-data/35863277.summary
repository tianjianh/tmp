World Twenty20 2016: England could play three spinners - Moeen Ali

England could play three spinners in their World Twenty20 match against Afghanistan in Delhi on Wednesday, according to Moeen Ali.

If conditions in Delhi favour slow bowling, uncapped left-armer Liam Dawson would be an option to join Moeen and Adil Rashid in the England line-up.
"It's definitely a possibility," Moeen told BBC Sport.
"We have to look at the wicket and adapt to conditions. If there's spin there, why not?"
If Dawson does make his international debut, it would be a remarkable rise for the 26-year-old, who coach Trevor Bayliss had not seen play in a competitive match before he was named in the England squad in February.
England, World T20 winners in 2010, will move closer to a place in the semi-finals if they defeat Afghanistan, the only nation outside of Test cricket left in the tournament.
Eoin Morgan's men arrive in Delhi on the back of a record run-chase of 230 to beat South Africa in Mumbai on Friday, a victory that halted a run of six successive defeats in white-ball cricket.
"That's given us a boost," said Worcestershire all-rounder Moeen, 28. "Before the defeats we were very confident, so that has been restored a little.
"The guys have been lifted, but not over the top. We know Afghanistan will be a tough game.
"They're a dangerous side who we won't be taking lightly. We have to play against them in the same way we would any other side."
