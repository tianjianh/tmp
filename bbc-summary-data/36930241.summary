[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 0-3 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town struck three second-half goals as the Hatters claimed a comfortable opening-day victory at last season's League Two play-off finalists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Danny Hylton got his side up and running with a 50th-minute opener after Argyle failed to effectively deal with full-back Stephen O'Donnell's cross from the right.
When the ball bounced out to Hylton, he hammered it home on the rise from close range.
Luton doubled their lead on 70 minutes when Jack Marriott raced on to an incisive through ball from Cameron McGeehan, outpaced marker Yann Songo'o and side-footed past advancing keeper Luke McCormick.
In stoppage time Hylton teed up substitute Jonathan Smith to stroke home Luton's third goal.
Both Hylton and McGeehan had been denied by McCormick in the opening 45 minutes.
In the opening minute of the second half Argyle's new skipper denied Marriott with a full-length save as the forward cut in and let fly with a rising angled drive from the left.
Luton's Dan Potts - booked after 71 minutes - was dismissed in the final minute following a second caution.
