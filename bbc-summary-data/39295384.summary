Caixinha takes charge of his first Rangers match on Saturday against Hamilton Academical.
Miller, 37, has been helping coach the club's under-20s.
"I'm about to assess that situation," said Caixinha. "We have a list of candidates. We are going to start the assessment as soon as possible."
And he added: "We are going to have someone that can give me that knowledge, someone that is really linked with the history and tradition of this club and how big it is to represent this club."
Caixinha will work with assistant Helder Baptista, fitness coach Pedro Malta and goalkeeping coach Jose Belman, the latter replacing Jim Stewart.
Former Scotland striker Miller is out of contract in the summer but is hopeful of continuing to play.
"My focus is firmly on being a player for as long as I can," he said. "You're a long time retired so I'm firmly focused on the game at the weekend and continuing my duties as a player until the end of the season and hopefully beyond.
"I still feel like I have a lot to offer on the field at the moment. It would definitely have to involve still being a player."
Caixinha held a meeting with Miller and other senior players, including captain Lee Wallace, and the manager said: "Kenny spoke to me for one more minute and he told me something I already knew, that he was doing something part-time with the under-20s.
"OK, perfect, all the time that is not colliding with our work, I am very glad that you keep doing that work. But I also know that he wants to still play."
And the Portuguese says it's "not clever to change everything" before his debut as Rangers manager.
"We are just trying to pass the biggest principles, the biggest behaviours in each moment in the game," added the 46-year-old. "We don't have time to do that much.
"We want to combine two moments and be aggressive in those two moments. I am talking about the defensive organisation, so I want a team that is more dynamic.
"I want to have the ball - of course to attack you need to have the ball. But I need to have a team that attacks spaces rather than just touches the ball. And especially I want a team that is much more aggressive landing on the finishing position.
"After that, I want a team that is always attacking. So, we have the ball, we attack our opponent's goal. We don't have the ball, we attack the ball again."
