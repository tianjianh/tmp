Police Scotland said 33 flats in Gourlay Yard had been cleared and pedestrian access to the area in City Quay was restricted.
The fire service has temporarily secured some sections of the roof but permanent repairs are needed.
Dundee City Council was arranging accommodation for the residents.
A police spokesman said: "Barriers are in place at Gourlay Yard to prevent pedestrian access to the area and in the interests of safety, police would ask that members of the public do not approach the building."
