Rovers lost to Salford in the Million Pound Game on 1 October, with all Super League contracts automatically voided.
But Lunt has agreed to stay under the terms of his old deal, which has three years left to run.
The 29-year-old, who joined the club from Huddersfield in 2015, scored eight tries in 23 appearances last season.
"As far as I'm concerned, I was part of the team that got the club relegated and I want to be part of the team that gets the club promoted back up to Super League again," he told the club website.
