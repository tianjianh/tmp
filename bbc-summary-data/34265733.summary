US confirms state visit for China's Xi Jinping

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US has confirmed Chinese President Xi Jinping will be given a state welcome when he visits in September.

Mr Xi's visit comes after President Barack Obama's trip to China in November last year.
The White House said Mr Xi would be hosted at the White House for a state dinner on 25 September.
It will be "an opportunity to expand US-China co-operation", said a spokesman, and to "address areas of disagreement constructively".
Mr Xi is expected to travel to Seattle on 22 September before visiting Washington and New York, where he is due to give a speech to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Among the issues likely to be on the agenda for the visit is China's increasing assertion of power over territory it claims as its own in the South and East China Sea.
China has long claimed large parts of the maritime territory and islands in the two seas - angering countries with overlapping claims - but has in recent years been actively building up its presence there and carrying out land reclamation work.
Cyber espionage will also be a point of tension. Last week, Mr Obama said alleged Chinese cyber attacks are "not acceptable".
Several hacks on US institutions have been blamed on China, including one involving the details of millions of government staff.
China has said it is opposed to cyber crime, and is itself the victim of US hacking attacks.
The visit also comes at a time of concern about the global impact of an economic slowdown in China.
