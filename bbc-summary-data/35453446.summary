The Team Sky rider attacked 15km from the end of the 174km event and opened up a 20-second gap on the chasing group before claiming victory by six seconds.
Australian Leigh Howard won a bunch sprint for second. Pre-race favourite Simon Gerrans of Australia was fifth.
Kennaugh's fellow Isle of Man rider Mark Cavendish retired before the end.
"It's good for my morale," said 26-year-old Kennaugh. "It's good to prove to people I'm not messing around.
"I don't want to be just another rider. I want to be the rider the team can look to in order to lead races."
