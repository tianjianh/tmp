Super League: Hull KR 12-14 Wakefield Wildcats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield got their first win of the Super League season by a narrow margin against a Hull KR side that failed to take goal-kicking opportunities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers outscored Trinity by three tries from Kieran Dixon, Adam Walker and Ken Sio to two, but Dixon and Ryan Shaw failed with the goal attempts.
Liam Finn's penalty goal proved crucial on the back of converted scores by Mickael Simon and Stuart Howarth.
The win was Wakefield's first regular-season success since 1 July 2015.
Chris Chester's Hull KR have just a point from their opening three games, following a draw with Castleford in their opening match.

Rovers started brightly and a smart pass by Iain Thornley put Dixon in, but Wakefield fought back soon after when Simon bashed over.
The visitors moved ahead when Howarth crossed on the left side, on the back of a scything run from winger Tom Johnstone.
Rovers again targeted the left and Walker was too powerful to stop from close range, but Dixon pulled another kick wide.
Wakefield looked as though they had let the chance to score pass when Rovers mopped up another repeat set, but Maurice Blair was sent to the sin-bin and Finn stroked the penalty goal through to extend the lead.
Sio went over but Rovers were unable to draw level through Shaw and both he and Dixon had tries ruled out by referee Robert Hicks as time ran out on the hosts.
Wakefield coach Brian Smith: "There is something about our group, as a group together, and I see that most days.
"There is a good togetherness and toughness about them and they might shock everybody as the season goes on.
"We can make ourselves into a really decent team and it will be because of those qualities, not a miracle."
Hull KR coach Chris Chester: "I'm the leader of this team and we're in it together. We've got a short turnaround which is good as we try and put things right for the next game.
"I can't put finger on why we were so poor for the first 40 to 50 minutes. It's disappointing, the way we played."
