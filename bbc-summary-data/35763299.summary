Mark Sampson's side had lost their previous two matches to the USA in Tampa and Germany in Nashville.
Chances were rare on a difficult pitch, although France's Claire Lavogez hit the woodwork in the first half and Katie Chapman shot wide for England.
USA won the event courtesy of a 2-1 victory over Germany.
The hosts came from behind to win through two goals in the space of six minutes, scored by Alex Morgan and Samantha Mewis, after Anja Mittag had fired Germany into the lead at FAU Stadium, Boca Raton.
Next month, England face Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Euro 2017 qualifiers, looking to continue their 100% start to the campaign after two games.
Vice-captain Jordan Nobbs said before Wednesday's game that playing in the SheBelieves Cup would be "crucial" to their preparations for their qualifying campaign and, despite two defeats, the Lionesses had acquitted themselves well against the world's best teams.
They were narrowly beaten 1-0 by world champions USA in their first game before being edged 2-1 by Germany, finishing ahead of France in the table on goals scored.
England have not beaten France since 1974 and, certainly in the first half, it looked like their wait for an overdue win would go on as they struggled to deal with their opponents' pace on the counterattack.
However, they improved in the second half, effectively playing France at their own game with long balls forward.
The added pace of substitute Eni Aluko, who earned her 100th cap, started to cause the French problems but England could not get a second goal.
England boss Mark Sampson: "We were so close to the win against one of those big guns.
"It was a game of two halves. We had to grind out the first, but in the second half we were outstanding.
"This tournament has been a really good experience and we take a lot away from it."
