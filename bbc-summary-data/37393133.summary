[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton battled back from a goal down to beat Doncaster 3-1 in a thrilling game at Kenilworth Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors missed a glorious chance early on, with John Marquis heading wide from two yards out, while Andy Williams nodded against the top of the bar moments later.
Rovers had the ball in the net on five minutes, but Marquis was flagged offside moments before beating Christian Walton, while Joe Wright sent a header wide from a corner.
Doncaster went ahead after 21 minutes when James Coppinger slammed home his fifth of the season from close range, while Town captain Scott Cuthbert was stretchered off in the aftermath after a nasty head injury.
However, Luton then came storming back into the contest and were level on 36 minutes when Olly Lee's wonderful fizzing cross was powered home at the back post by Cameron McGeehan.
The game changed four minutes before the break when Danny Hylton's wonderful backheel sent Jack Marriott away and he slotted under Doncaster goalkeeper Marko Marosi to give Luton a lead they had scarcely deserved.
After the break, McGeehan went close to making it 3-1 when his shot deflected over, while Tommy Rowe's tame free-kick was easy for Walton.
Marriott almost had a second, his shot bouncing into the grateful gloves of Marosi, before Luton made sure of the three points with 81 minutes gone as Pelly Ruddock was felled in the area by Wright, and McGeehan fired the spot-kick into the roof of the net.
The Hatters were reduced to 10 men in the closing seconds as Hylton picked up his second booking, before Walton saved superbly from Marquis as Luton ran out winners.
