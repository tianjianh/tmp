Floodlights are set to be installed at Durham's Emirates ICG allowing it to stage World Cup matches in 2019.

Councillors approved six, 55-metre tall floodlights which will allow the county to hold day-night international fixtures, having already hosted Test and one-day games at the venue.
Chester-le-Street is one of 10 host Test venues put up for the tournament.
"World Cup cricket will be coming to the north east," Durham chief executive David Harker told BBC Newcastle.
"I had a horrible fear without the lights we couldn't bring that here in 2019, which would be a huge shame.
"Having the lights was very much a condition of the award of three games.
"We must have permanent lights to the required standard. If we couldn't deliver on that then there would be no World Cup games."
With some of the groundwork already in place, Harker said he felt the lights would not cause as much disruption as feared by more than 100 local residents who submitted their objections to the council.
"I am confident when the lights are up the impact won't be as significant as feared," Harker added.
"I'm very respectful of the way they've gone about their objections and we will be trying to maintain the very good working relationships we've already enjoyed with the residents."
