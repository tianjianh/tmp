The Galashiels branch of the Royal British Legion (RBL) has been fined Â£8,000 after a bar worker was seriously injured falling into a cellar.

Ann Cameron, 52, was in hospital for several days after stepping backwards and plunging through the hatch left open by a fellow member of staff.
The accident happened two years ago at the Park Street social club on the day of the town's Braw Lads celebrations.
The RBL branch admitted failing to ensure the safety of an employee.
The incident was captured on the club's CCTV and the footage was shown at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.
Several people were working behind the bar but moments after the hatch was opened, Ms Cameron stepped backwards without looking and fell down it.
The club's lawyer Zoe McDonnell said a verbal warning was given about the hatch being open but could not be heard because the club was so busy.
She added that a risk assessment was in place but was not sufficient in this case.
Ms McDonnell said the club had taken the matter very seriously.
She said: "It was one of the busiest days of the year.  She did not hear the verbal warning.
"The club has made significant efforts since the accident to protect employees.
"The case has served as a clear warning that they must provide a safe environment for employees."
Ms McDonnell explained the club was mainly run by volunteers and had operated at a loss for the past two years.
The club admitted failing to ensure the safety of an employee by leaving a cellar hatch open and having insufficient measures in place to prevent an accident in June 2013.
Sheriff Peter Paterson said it was an obvious breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act.
He commented: "It was an accident waiting to happen."
However, he took into account the club's guilty plea and responsible attitude in taking steps to prevent a repeat by reducing the fine from Â£12,000 to Â£8,000.
