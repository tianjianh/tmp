The 20-year-old, who scored nine goals in 27 appearances while on loan at League One Barnsley last season, has signed a four-year contract after his United deal expired.
"I think West Ham is a club with a lot of ambition," the England Under-20 International told West Ham's website.
"They are a club built on traditions of giving youngsters a run and hopefully I can get my chance as well."
