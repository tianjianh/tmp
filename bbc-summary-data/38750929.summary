These children are called young carers, and while many of them are happy looking after a disabled - or sick - relative they also face many difficulties.
Morgan's mum has a problem with her muscles which means she can't stand up or move around for long periods.
So, Morgan helps out around the house, cooking dinner, cleaning, walking the dog and other things that need doing.
He is one of around 700,000 young people in the UK who are caring for a family member.
Jenny went to meet him to find out a bit more about his day to day life.
