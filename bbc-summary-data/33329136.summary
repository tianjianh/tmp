County Championship: Mark Stoneman keeps Yorkshire at bay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Stoneman's battling century dashed Yorkshire's hopes of a three-day win over Durham at Chester-le-Street.

The visitors began the day strongly as they enforced the follow-on after bowling Durham out for 208.
Keaton Jennings (41) and Stoneman (116 not out) started the second innings well, making Durham's first century partnership of the season.
Durham however lost wickets at key moments, as they ended the day on 244-4, trailing Yorkshire by 105 runs.
Resuming their first innings on 140-5, Scott Borthwick (54) and Ryan Pringle (69 not out) both made half-centuries to steady Durham.
The batsmen were unable to keep Yorkshire's bowlers out for long, with John Hastings falling to Tim Bresnan (3-40) first-ball.
Jack Brooks (2-59) claimed two wickets in one over, as Durham ended their first innings trailing Yorkshire by 349 runs.
Asked to follow-on, Stoneman and Jennings played sensibly in the heat to put on 116 for the first wicket.
Jennings and Borthwick (11) fell in quick succession, before Adil Rashid (2-81) had captain Paul Collingwood (20) caught at slip.
Despite narrowly avoiding being caught on 99, Stoneman played patiently for his century but his batting partners were unable to emulate his innings.
Durham now enter the final day knowing they will probably have to bat for the majority of three sessions to secure their position at the top of the County Championship table over Yorkshire.
