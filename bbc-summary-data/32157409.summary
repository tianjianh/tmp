'£20m Pembroke-born King Henry VII bed' left in car park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 500-year-old bed left in a hotel car park once belonged to Welsh-born King Henry VII, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The four poster, which it is suggested could be worth £20m, was left outside a hotel in Chester during a renovation before being collected by auctioneers.
Ian Coulson bought the bed at auction for £2,200 after spotting it online.
He then contacted TV historian Dr Jonathan Foyle who, following DNA testing, confirmed that the bed once belonged to the Pembroke-born monarch.
Dr Foyle described the artefact as "a complete national treasure".
He said: "It is specifically the marriage bed for Henry and Elizabeth."
The ornately carved four poster is currently on display at Hever Castle in Kent.
