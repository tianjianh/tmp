[SN]TITLE[SN]
Adam Watt death: Three on trial accused of Hemel Hempstead murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man believed to have run off without paying for his drugs was murdered outside his home shortly afterwards, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Watt, 38, was stabbed in Evans Wharf, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in January.
Three people are on trial at St Albans Crown Court accused of his murder.
Nicholas Grant, 18, of Sunnyhill Road in Hemel, Joseph Zulu, 23, of no fixed address and Jacqueline Brewin, 47, of Sacombe Road, Hemel, all deny murder.
Opening the case on Tuesday, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said Mr Watts was a troubled man who proved "unable to rid himself of drink and drug dependency".
Ms Cottage told the jury Mr Zulu had called Mr Grant saying either Mr Watt had stolen money or run off with drugs without paying.
The pair were picked up by Ms Brewin in a Vauxhall Meriva and dropped off close to Mr Watt's home.
The two men confronted him outside his property, where he was stabbed with "severe force" in his upper chest, Ms Cottage said.
"We say they were all part of a joint enterprise," she said, "sharing an intention to kill or seriously injure Adam Watt. Each is equally responsible."
The court was told Mr Grant and Mr Zulu blamed each other for the fatal stabbing.
The case continues.
