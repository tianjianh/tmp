Helder Costa: Wolves sign Benfica winger on season-long loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves have signed winger Helder Costa from Portuguese giants Benfica on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Portugal Under-23 international, 22, spent last season on loan at Monaco and is the Championship club's first signing since Chinese investors Fosun International completed their takeover.
Wolves say they are also close to a deal for another Portuguese player - Atletico Madrid defender Silvio.
They also confirm the club's interest in another Benfica midfielder, Pele.
Wolves' only previous summer signing was goalkeeper Andy Lonergan from fellow Championship club Fulham on a two-year contract.
Wolves have also confirmed that striker Nouha Dicko will not be fit for the start of the season.
After having a staple removed from his knee at the start of July, the club now say it will take three or four more weeks before he is ready for first-team duty.
It means that Dicko will have missed an entire year since being injured in the 2-1 home win over Charlton in August 2015.
Costa spent last season on loan in France with Ligue 1 side Monaco, scoring three times in 25 appearances.
He came through the ranks at Benfica, starting his senior career in their 'B' team.
He was on loan in the Spanish top flight in 2015, making six appearances from the bench for Deportivo La Coruna.
