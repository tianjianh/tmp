Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson has hailed the impact of striker Nathan Blissett after the club's 1-0 win at Dagenham & Redbridge.

Blissett has been relegated to the substitutes' bench since the arrival of Kieffer Moore on loan.
But the target man came on to inspire the Gulls to just their second away victory of the season.
"When he came on, it turned the game around in our favour," Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
Blissett scored eight goals in 16 league starts for the Gulls last season, helping Torquay stave off relegation.
But this season he has struggled to repeat that form, while Moore has now scored five goals in four games since joining on loan from Forest Green.
"He set up two other great chances, if not three, he's worked and worked and worked and he's allowed Kieffer to get hold of it," added Nicholson.
"It's probably strange being the 6ft 4in usual target to then being the guy that's playing off the big man, so it's a change for him, but I thought he was fantastic when he came on."
