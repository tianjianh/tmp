[SN]TITLE[SN]
Student fined for George IV Bridge sandbag throw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student, who threw a 15kg sandbag over George IV Bridge in Edinburgh into the street below, has been fined £750.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harvey Stocks, 20, from Darlington, County Durham, pled guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to throwing the sandbag into Merchant Street on 13 March to the potential danger of pedestrians.
The incident was caught on CCTV at 03:25.
On the night he threw the sandbag, he had been out drinking with a group of friends.
Defence solicitor, Nigel Bruce, said his client was about to start his third year studying computer science at Edinburgh University.
Mr Bruce said Stocks' family were in court and said Stocks was "not really a drinker".
His client, he said, accepted he had acted in a reckless manner and it was a serious matter.
The solicitor said Stocks had been told by one of the group that there was no-one in the street.
Sheriff Kenneth McGowan told Stocks: "I know this area. There a number of doorways and someone could just have walked out and you could have killed them.
"That would have been a tragedy for that person and for you. It was reckless and crass stupidity. You had a lucky escape".
Stocks was allowed to pay the fine at £30 a month.
In a previous incident on George IV Bridge in 2006, Kate Flannery, 24, from Galway, sustained spinal injuries when a traffic cone was thrown from the bridge.
