[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old will also attend the traditional "drag" by students through Dundee in the university's carriage.
Mr Beaumont, from Perthshire, succeeds actor Brian Cox who was elected to the position in 2010 and served two terms.
He previously held the record for cycling around the world, completing the route in 194 days and 17 hours.
Mr Beaumont said: "I am delighted to be appointed the rector of the University of Dundee and I am looking forward, with some trepidation, to the drag around Dundee's finest establishments in a carriage.
"I am passionate about helping young people create careers that they are truly interested and driven by.
"I am looking forward to representing the student voice to the best of my ability."
The university's principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Pete Downes, said: "It is great to see the students coming together for this celebration, and I am sure Mark will be an excellent representative for our students and an ambassador for the university."
