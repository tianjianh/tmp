Arsenal led through Jodie Taylor's rebound from a spot-kick, but Millie Bright made it 1-1, and Chelsea's Drew Spence looked to have won it late on before Jordan Nobbs' 96th-minute flick.
Elsewhere, FA Cup Finalists Birmingham bounced back by beating Bristol City.
Reading won 1-0 at bottom club Yeovil.
Liverpool, who have played two games more than second-placed Chelsea and third-placed Manchester City, eased past visitors Sunderland, with a brace from Caroline Weir either side of Natasha Harding's goal before Casey Stoney's late fourth.
England striker Ellen White's double gave Birmingham a deserved win at home to the Vixens, while Mandy van den Berg's early goal was enough for Reading to inflict a fifth-straight league defeat on newly promoted Yeovil.
