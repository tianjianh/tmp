The on-loan Norwich player, 20, sustained the injury in a challenge with the Ton's Joe McKee near the end of the Bairns' 1-0 win.
The player wrote on Twitter: "Gutted to say I've suffered a double leg break.
"Can't thank everyone enough at the pitch and in the hospital for keeping me calm and helping me."
McGrandles was stretchered off with his right leg in a splint after lengthy treatment and taken to Inverclyde Hospital.
Bairns manager Peter Houston said after the match that he was "prepared for the worse".
Houston told BBC Scotland: "He said right away to his team-mate that it's broken and the doctor and physio thought the same thing when they went on the field."
Falkirk won their first match since 2 January thanks to John Baird's first-half strike.
"My thoughts are more with Conor than being delighted with any victory," added Houston.
"He's a young lad we've brought up from Norwich; a former Falkirk player. It's certainly put a huge dampener on what was a valuable three points for us."
