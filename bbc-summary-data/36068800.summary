Cooke took the lead following the first event - swimming - before dropping to second after the fencing and third after the riding.
However, in the combined run and shoot discipline he recorded the quickest time to beat Hungarian duo Adam Marosi and Bence Demeter into first.
Cooke's victory gave Great Britain a first World Cup medal of the season.
