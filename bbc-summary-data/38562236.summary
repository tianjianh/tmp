[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Chase Tate was found on the A1104 at Miles Cross Hill, Ulceby, in the early hours of Saturday.
Lincolnshire Police said it continued to be "open-minded" about what had happened with anyone with information asked to come forward.
Mr Tate was described as being unsteady on his feet and wearing dark clothing, officers said.
The 23-year-old, who lived locally, used the surname Tate but was formally known as Chase North.
Sgt Dave Mitchell of Lincolnshire Police said: "Probably more than one person knows what happened that has led to his death early on Saturday morning.
"I cannot believe anyone wants his death on their conscience."
