Millions of pounds are expected to be made available for the development of Brandywell stadium in Londonderry.

The money, which comes from Stormont, has been freed up by a deal agreed between Linfield and the Irish Football Association.
As far back as 2006 plans were drawn up for a 6,000 seater stadium, and more recently there have been calls for urgent funding to carry out essential safety works at Derry City's home ground.
It now looks as if a share of a pot of  Â£31 million will be made available, which will be directed towards the redevelopment of Brandywell and also a new stadium for Glentoran.
A significant sum has also been earmarked for a national academy.
The money was freed up through a new 51-year-deal between the IFA and Linfield over the use of Windsor Park.
The chairman of Derry City, Phil O'Doherty, dismissed concerns that the stadium should not benefit because the club doesn't play in the Irish League.
"We pay tax, we pay VAT so we should be entitled to the same facilities that would be in any Belfast football club," he said.
