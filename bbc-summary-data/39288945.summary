Well Ricky has been speaking to 12-year-old Junior who loves to dance, but it made him very unpopular with bullies.
He ignored them and has since gone on to become the UK's Freestyle Street Dance champion.
And even got a chance to dance with singer Justin Bieber.
Junior has been telling his story as a part of BBC's School Report News Day where young people get a chance to do just that and report with the BBC.
Hundreds of schools all over the UK are turning their classrooms into newsrooms for a day.
Take a look at Ricky's chat.
