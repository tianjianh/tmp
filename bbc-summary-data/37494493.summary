[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Apedelrazek Badran targeted the girls in Edmonton, north London, in January, Wood Green Crown Court heard.
He told the first girl he needed to arrest her and tried to take her to a van but she escaped. He said he needed to search the second girl and sexually assaulted her, police said.
Badran must serve a minimum of eight years and four months in prison.
The court heard he approached the first girl at about 16:30 GMT on 27 January.
After she escaped he waited an hour before approaching the second girl, telling her he was a security guard and she fitted the description of a shoplifter and needed to be searched.
He then told her he had a knife and sexually assaulted her.
Det Con Lee Ranson described Badran as "one of the most dangerous offenders I have ever prosecuted" who "posed a significant threat to young children".
The 33-year-old, of Hadrians Ride, Enfield, was found guilty of sexually assaulting a child under 13 and assaulting a child under 13 by penetration.
He was also found guilty of common assault with intent to commit a sexual offence, two counts of breaching a sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) by contacting a person under 16 and breaching an SHPO by carrying a tool in a public place.
The Metropolitan Police said it was possible Badran may have approached or attacked other children and anyone with information should contact them.
