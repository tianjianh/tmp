[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The influential musician Prince has died at his home in Minnesota at the age of 57.

Police were called to a medical emergency at his Paisley Park estate on Thursday, US media reported.
He sold more than 100 million records during his career, including the huge hit albums 1999, Purple Rain and Sign O' the Times.
Here, Prince fans who saw him perform recall his legendary live shows and react to the news of his death.
Prince is a legendary genius whose contributions to society will be greatly missed.
His Purple Rain concert was the first show I attended.
My dad took me because I was with him for the weekend.
I was about four years old. I was 21 the last time I attended one of his concerts in Columbia, SC, USA.
The lace, the purple, the stilettos, the mole, the dance moves, the incredible music.
I saw Prince on the first night of his 21-nights residency in London at the O2, on 21 August 2007.
It was an amazing gig, especially the double encore.
It was absolutely the best gig I've ever seen. Thank you for the music Prince.
Another great, gone too soon.
I'm saddened by the passing of Prince, a great musician and entertainer.
I was fortunate to see him in concert on 16 December, 2011 in Vancouver and didn't stop dancing the whole time he and his band were on.
It might have been wintry and cold outside but that guy made the arena hot inside.
I am so glad I got to see him live.
He was a genius. RIP Prince.
I saw Prince play three times in Chicago - in 1984 for the Purple Rain tour, 1988 for the Lovesexy tour and 2002 for the Musicology tour.
In 1984, I was on crutches from a car accident.
My older sister is also a big Prince fan and she actually saw him perform one of his legendary after hours shows in Chicago.
He would show up unannounced at a small club, after playing for several hours, and play for a couple of hours more.
She saw him jam with Maceo Parker from James Brown's band and soul singer Macy Gray.
I was privileged enough to see Prince perform on three occasions and he will always be my favourite artist.
I saw him twice in the 1990s in Manchester and again last year in Leeds.
I was near the front in Leeds and just for a split second, I made eye contact with him. I'll remember it for the rest of my life.
He's provided the soundtrack to my life since I was 15. I'm now 47 and I feel like I've lost one of my family members.
RIP Prince Rogers Nelson.
I am totally shocked and devastated at this sad news.
I have always been a huge fan but never saw him live in his heyday.
However, I feel so honoured that I managed to see him a few years back when the toured the UK, at the Manchester Arena.
For me, he is the best live performer I have ever seen or am probably likely to ever see again.
He was a true innovator, a creative genius, a pioneer. Rest in peace Prince.
I saw Prince, one of my all time musical heroes, at Earl's Court, when I was living and working in London in the 1980s.
It was one of the best periods of my life and seeing him in concert, with my best friend, was one of the absolute highlights of my whole life.
Such wonderful memories. I can remember the whole day so well.
And to top it off, we went to The Hippodrome after the concert and who was there? The man himself! Happy happy days.
I saw Prince perform at GM Place here in Vancouver in May 2013. It was by far one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.
He played on for hours and it was non-stop. His energy was astounding and to top it off he had a purple velvet grand piano. It was an experience I will never forget.
I can't believe I didn't take a photo. I was so enamoured with the concert, it never occurred to me.
I did wear an amazing velvet jacket in his honour though. We go to almost every major concert in town and this was easily in the top three.
His presence will definitely be missed.
Another sad loss of a musical genius.
Such a multi-talented writer and performer who contributed so much to the fame of many other artists through his writing prowess.
I had the pleasure of seeing him perform live at Wembley three times.
Another sad sad day for music.
As Don McLean said: "The day the music died."
