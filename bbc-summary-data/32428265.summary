An art based regeneration project in Dumfries is preparing to open its doors after four years of fundraising and building works.

The artist-led The Stove organisation says culture and art can boost the economy of a changing town centre which is competing against online retailers.
It is holding a series of events over five weeks to welcome the public through the doors.
It kicks off with the Dumfries Music Conference this Friday and Saturday.
Matt Baker from The Stove said it was about community ideas and involvement.
"We're starting out as we mean to go on with a really diverse programme of opening events," he said.
"We've got a vision for how the building is going to go but that doesn't mean that there isn't space in that for other people to add their ideas and their own energy.
"The open house event, as it sounds, is really about an invitation to bring people in to see what is possible, the kind of things we are working on and get them to think about ways that they could get involved and help change the town through being involved with The Stove."
