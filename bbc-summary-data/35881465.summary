The body of Roy Blackman, 73, was found inside the property on Headcorn Road, Biddenden, just before 09:00 GMT on Monday.
Post-mortem tests showed he had suffered severe blunt force injuries.
Police believe he was murdered sometime between 01:00 and 03:00 that morning. A safe was also missing from the home.
Det Insp Lee Whitehead said: "Mr Blackman was a well-known and well-liked member of the community.
"He ran businesses in the area for many years and had a family who are distraught at his murder."
He said he believed several suspects had targeted "a vulnerable man in his own home leaving a trail of devastation in their wake".
Detectives from Kent's serious crime unit are carrying out inquiries in the neighbourhood and seeking witnesses.
They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area of Headcorn Road between Weeks Lane and Frittenden Road from 19:30 GMT on Sunday into the early hours of Monday.
