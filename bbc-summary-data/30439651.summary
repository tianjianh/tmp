Three times as many people die from suicide than in road accidents in Wales every year, figures have shown.

Up to 350 people take their own life every year and a plan has been launched to reduce that.
The Talk to Me 2 scheme will focus on helping vulnerable groups, such as children, the homeless, prisoners, doctors, nurses and farmers.
The five-year strategy aims to give people "appropriate" responses to personal crises.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "Prevention of suicide and self-harm is a major challenge for us all."
Those considered to be high-risk include bullied children, rough sleepers, prisoners, doctors, nurses and farmers.
"Losing someone through suicide can be particularly traumatic and difficult to cope with; its impacts are psychological, spiritual and economic," Mr Drakeford added.
He said prevention was a major challenge, but no single organisation or government department could tackle the issue alone.
A consultation on the plan closes in March.
