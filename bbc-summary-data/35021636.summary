A taxi driver had his cheekbone and nose broken by a cyclist who attacked him after punching his passenger while stopped at a red light.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The driver, 30, had got out of his blue Skoda Octavia after the initial assault in Govanhill, Glasgow, between 14:15 and 14:45 on Tuesday 1 December.
He was punched by the cyclist who then made off from the scene on Eglinton Street on his blue and white bike.
The cyclist is described as white and wearing a cycling suit but no helmet.
Police, who have appealed for witnesses to the assault at the junction with Kilbirnie Street, said he was of slim build and had a local accent.
The rear seat passenger sustained minor injuries while another passenger was unhurt.
Det Con Kenny MacEwan said: "It would appear that the rear seat passenger and the cyclist had some sort of altercation as the car stopped at the lights and the cyclist assaulted him and then the taxi driver.
"I am sure there would have been other cars at the junction at the time of the incident so I would ask that they, or anyone who has information that will help our inquiry, contact the CID at Cathcart Police Office or Crimestoppers."
