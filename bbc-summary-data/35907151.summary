England's ability to navigate a tricky path to the World Twenty20 semi-finals shows they can handle the pressure they will experience against New Zealand, says head coach Trevor Bayliss.

After losing their opener against the West Indies, England completed a record run chase to beat South Africa and then overcame a scare against Afghanistan.
They then reached the last four with a tense 10-run win against Sri Lanka.
"We've been under pressure in a couple of the wins we've had," said Bayliss.
"Once you've been there and been able to get through tight games it gives you the belief that you are good enough to do it.
"The more times you're in the situation the better for the long-term benefit of the team."
England will be playing in Delhi for the third time in the tournament when they meet New Zealand in the city on Wednesday.
"Having played two games there already, the players will know what to expect from the wicket," added Bayliss.
"I wouldn't necessarily say it is an advantage. New Zealand are very adaptable and we are going to have to play some very good cricket to win this match but we will give it one hell of a go."

Meanwhile, England's Jason Roy and David Willey have been fined for breaching the ICC's code of conduct during the win over Sri Lanka in Delhi.
Roy was found to have "shown dissent at an umpire's decision" after being given out lbw for 42 in the 10-run victory that sealed England's place in the semi-finals.
Willey, meanwhile, was fined for giving Milinda Siriwardana a send-off.
Roy loses 30% of his match fee, with Willey losing 15% of his.
