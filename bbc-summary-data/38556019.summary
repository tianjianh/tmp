The 25-year-old netted after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2-1 friendly win against Saudi Arabian side Al-Batin in Doha, Qatar.
Oscar later won the free-kick from which Lu Wenjun struck the winner.
"I only trained for two days," he said. "This is the start of a new season - we have only one goal, which is to win."
Oscar added: "My team-mates played very well today. The Chinese guys tried to help us [to integrate]. It's difficult to have a good game in such a short time - they made it happen."
The Chinese Super League gets under way in March.
