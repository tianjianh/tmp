[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury in the trial of a man accused of causing the deaths of a shanty group singer and their promoter has visited the venue where they were killed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fisherman's Friends vocalist Trevor Grills, 54, and Paul McMullen, 44, died after a steel door collapsed at G Live in Guildford on 9 February 2013.
David Naylor, 57, director of Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd, denies two charges of manslaughter by gross negligence.
The jury also saw a similar door at a property in Bisley.
Mr Grills, from Port Isaac, Cornwall, and Mr McMullen, from Disley in Cheshire, were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group.
They were unloading music equipment from their van when the door, designed and manufactured by Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd, fell on them.
Mr McMullen, originally from Heanor in Derbyshire, died at the scene and Mr Grills in hospital a few days later.
Adrian Darbishire QC said Mr Naylor was "a man of integrity" who "had faith" in the doors he sold, believing they were a "safe design".
He told Guildford Crown Court that concerns raised by a customer in Bournemouth were "not ignored".
Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd denies a third charge of a breach of health and safety laws.
On the opening day of the trial, the jury was told doors manufactured by Mr Naylor's company had failed before.
The trial continues.
