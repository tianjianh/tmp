The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority is marking the day with events to highlight the contribution landscape, wildlife and biodiversity make to the local economy.
Guided walks and activities will also be held in Powys' Brecon Beacons.
This year's event will showcase the "business" of nature management.
Launched in 1999 by the Europarc Federation, the day is designed to highlight the importance of conservation and sustainable management of all national parks and protected landscapes.
Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority chief executive Tegryn Jones said: "This year's European Day of Parks is great opportunity to celebrate the value of our national parks and protected areas.
"They play such an important role in the economic and social well-being of our local communities, countries and the continent as a whole.
"The authority looks to promote education about conservation, wildlife and habitats at every opportunity, running a busy schedule of events that bring the public closer to nature in the national park."
The 2013 Valuing Wales' National Parks report found the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and the surrounding area attracts 4.2 million visitors a year and supports more than 7,000 jobs.
