[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-3 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City produced an impressive away display to win at Wolves thanks to three superbly-taken goals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Noone hit two stunning first-half strikes from range to put the away side in command, but Wolves pulled one back before half-time through Michal Zyro.
Joe Ralls' low, left-footed drive from outside the area secured Cardiff's first away win of 2016.
Defeat ended Wolves' run of four league wins in a row, leaving them eight points behind the top six.
Cardiff's win came less than 24 hours after they were placed under a transfer embargo for breaching Financial Fair Play rules while chairman Mehmet Dalman said the "jury was still out" over manager Russell Slade.
But Slade's side controlled the first half and almost went ahead when Stuart O'Keefe hit the crossbar, before Noone twice found the top left corner with his left foot to stun Wolves.
The hosts responded as Polish winger Zyro poked in from close range for his third goal in two games.
But Noone fed Ralls for his first goal of the season after half-time and Cardiff's victory rarely looked in doubt.
The result saw the Bluebirds complete a league double over Wolves, after their 2-0 win at the Cardiff City Stadium in August.

"We have defended a lot better than that and I am disappointed with the goals.
"While there was a good attitude and spirit about us to be competitive, you need to keep the goals against column down.
"We needed to stay in that game - that is the period of the season that it is. We didn't do that or recognise some very good strengths that Cardiff have."
Cardiff boss Russell Slade:
"The football club needed a response and that's exactly what we got.
"We were very strong in both boxes and that has won us a football match.
"It was a really good team effort today to get us over the line and a really welcome result."
