[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has pleaded not guilty to breaching the conditions of his current home detention by drinking alcohol.

He has been under house detention since being sentenced for drug possession and making threats to kill last month.
He was banned from consuming alcohol as part of his eight-month sentence.
On Monday, a New Zealand judge allowed him to stay at home while on bail awaiting a November hearing on the possible breach.
The 61-year-old could face further sanctions, including jail time, if the judge decides he did violate his conditions.
Asked after the hearing whether he was nervous about the possible consequences, Rudd told reporters: "No, the only thing I'm nervous about is I don't actually don't know what's going on."
Asked how he would spend time on bail, he replied: "Self-improvement."
Rudd was sentenced to house detention on 9 July for threatening to "take out" a former employee and possessing marijuana and methamphetamine.
Judge Thomas Ingram said home detention was the most appropriate punishment - but warned that he would be closely monitored and jail would be the next step if the drummer stepped out of line.
Following his latest arrest, Rudd must undergo drug and alcohol testing when required.
