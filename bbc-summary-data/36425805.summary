Minding has sealed a Classic double to give trainer Aidan O'Brien a sixth victory in the Oaks at Epsom.

The filly, ridden by Ryan Moore, was in trouble rounding the final turn, but picked up well to beat Frankie Dettori-ridden Architecture to the line.
Harlequeen, from the Mick Channon stable, was third.
Minding, the 10-11 odds-on favourite for Friday's race, is the first filly since Kazzia in 2002 to complete 1,000 Guineas-Oaks double.
Her Epsom victory represents a return to winning ways following the narrow defeat by Jet Setting in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh on 22 May, although connections did reveal she had suffered a minor head injury in the starting stalls prior to that race.
"To win the Guineas the way she did, then run at the Curragh on short notice, that didn't work, but she came out of it and she was incredible," said winning trainer O'Brien.
"She has speed, class, stamina, a great mind - everything. Ryan did brilliant to win on her after what she went through.
Part-owner Michael Tabor said: "I didn't actually see the trouble, but the way she won was spectacular.
"Her turn of foot was incredible. She's as good a filly we've seen for a long time."
Jockey Moore added: "I had a charmed run, initially, but then they boys all wanted to get moving and came in on top of me.
"Her class got her out of trouble but she'll be effective over shorter trips, for sure.
"She was much the best horse. She's a very good filly."
"The big question after that magnificent win by Minding is just how good would she have been had things had gone more smoothly.
"Not only had she had a preparation that Ryan Moore conceded was far from ideal with that head-bang in the stalls at the Curragh followed by a hard race just 12 days previously, but here she was - in Moore's words - "smashed up" in argy-bargy after Tattenham Corner when it looked as though her chances were probably scuppered.
"But just as quickly as she was in trouble she was out again. The winning distance could surely have been four times further with a better passage."
