Nearly 3,000 people have been caught speeding in Avon and Somerset in the first six weeks of cameras being switched back on.

Red light and speed cameras were switched off in 2011 after the safety camera partnership was dissolved.
Up to 29 static cameras were due to be reactivated but only two are working in Saltford and New Bristol Road, Worle.
Some 2,879 offences were detected between 11 February and 31 March - 1,912 in Worle and 967 in Saltford.
The police began the official switch on of cameras in February but the Worle camera has been working since last November.
Richard Corrigan, road safety lead at Avon and Somerset Police, said the force was "disappointed" that some drivers continued to ignore the relevant speed limits.
"It remains our commitment to target resources [including static sites and voluntary groups] in the most appropriate way to keep our roads as safe as possible," he said.
"It would be misleading to send the message to the public that only these two sites are active. This can and will change on a daily basis."
Mr Corrigan added the reactivation programme was "actively ongoing" and drivers should assume that cameras are working.
Of the 29 static cameras in the Avon and Somerset Police area, 17 are owned by the force and 12 remain the property of local councils.
The latest Freedom of Information figures show the fastest recorded speed detected by the camera in Worle was 73 miles per hour (mph), in a 30mph zone.
In Saltford it was 62mph, again in a 30mph area.
