The £400m dual carriageway on the A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven has been given the go ahead, but only if the money becomes available.

The scheme will also include a bypass around Dungiven.
The confirmation follows a lengthy public inquiry which has now concluded.
Northern Ireland's transport minister Michelle McIlveen said that up to £400m will be spent on the 18 mile stretch between Derry and Dungiven.
It is expected to be allocated during the budget period up to 2021.
There is no indication as to when the work will begin.
Ms McIlveen said on Wednesday that the announcement is good news for the north-west.
"The A6 is a key transport route and the construction of a new dual carriageway will help to reduce journey times and improve road safety," she said.
"There is no doubt that this scheme represents a significant investment in our economy and will create hundreds of jobs."
Sinn Féin MLA Cathal Ó hOisín said the announcement was a tremendous boost for the entire region.
"The campaign to have the A6 transformed into a dual carriageway and the creation of a bypass at Dungiven has taken many years but we are now seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
"It will be a major factor in improving the economic fortunes of the region and the bypass of Dungiven will have a major environmental impact on the town."
Last month, Ms McIlveen said work would start later this year on on dualling the section of the A6 between Randalstown and Castledawson.
