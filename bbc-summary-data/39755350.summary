The 2016 silver medallist from Scotland defeated Switzerland's sixth seed Sabrina Jaquet 22-20 21-10.
Olympic champion Marin, from Spain, will go for a third European title after beating Denmark's Mette Poulsen 21-17 21-12.
Marin holds a 5-1 head-to-head record against Gilmour.
"Marin obviously will be tough but I have a plan and will watch some videos of her matches as final preparation," said 23-year-old Gilmour.
In her semi-final, seventh seed Gilmour trailed for much of the opener but from 12-9 down she hit back for a 15-13 lead only for Jaquet to respond with five successive points to lead 18-15 and then 19-16.
Back came Gilmour with four points in a row. Jaquet saved the first set point but Gilmour took her second chance.
In the second, she moved into a 6-2 lead and did not look back.
"I had the momentum and felt more and more confident from winning the first set and as the second progressed but I never lost focus," added Gilmour.
"I know that no match is over until the final point is decided - not even at a 10-point lead.
"I am not really surprised over my level at this time. Four months after my [knee] operation I played my first tournament at the Scottish Nationals and have been on my steady way back ever since."
