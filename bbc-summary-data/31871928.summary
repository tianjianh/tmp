Pope Francis likes being Pope, but sometimes all he wants is a pizza

He drives a Popemobile and has a private army, but there are some things a Pope can't have.

He's told a Mexican broadcaster that he can no longer nip out for a quiet pizza - and it makes him sad.
"Do you like being Pope?" he was asked. "I do not mind! The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognized, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza."
Before becoming Pope in 2013, he says he was "a rover".
In an interview translated by Vatican Radio, he said: "I moved between parishes [in his home city of Buenos Aires] and certainly this habit has changed... it has been hard work to change. But you get used to it. You find a way to get around: on the phone, or in other ways ... "
Pope Francis isn't the only religious leader who finds it tricky to enjoy a pizza slice.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, reportedly has trouble getting pizzas delivered to his London home, Lambeth Palace.
The delivery drivers often get lost, he says.
"So they ring up and say, 'This Lambeth Palace, where is it?' And I say, where are you? 'I'm by Lambeth Bridge.' OK. Can you see a 60ft-tall red brick gatehouse? 'No.'"
The Archbishop - who leads the 85 million members of the Anglican communion - says he usually has to go outside to find the driver to collect the pizza himself.
