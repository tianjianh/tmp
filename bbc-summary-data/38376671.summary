Kevin Hicks went out to buy some eggs for a school project in Croydon in March 1986 and was never seen again.
The Met are offering a Â£20,000 reward for information that may help them discover what happened to him.
It follows a review of the case earlier this year.
Det Insp John McQuade, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: "Kevin simply disappeared that night and was never seen nor heard of again.
"We can only imagine what the intervening years must have been like for his family; years of worry and distress at not knowing what happened.
"Sadly, both his parents died without ever discovering the truth.
"Many enquiries have been carried out over the years, but Kevin's body has never been found. But there is no evidence he is still alive.
"We believe Kevin must have met someone that night, been assaulted and his body disposed of."
Described as a happy teenager with no problems at school, Kevin had spent a normal day with his family on 2 March 1986 in Addiscombe, Croydon.
At about 20:30 he told his mother he needed to buy some eggs for his O-level home economics exam the following day.
He headed off to Sperrings community shop, a couple of minutes' walk away, in Lower Addiscombe Road.
He was last seen at 22:00 in Shirley Road, walking in the general direction of home.
On 25 October 1996 someone anonymously called the Croydon Advertiser and said they knew where Kevin's body was.
Mr McQuade urged that person to come forward and contact the police.
