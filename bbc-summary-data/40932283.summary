[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough 3-0 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough cruised into round three of the EFL Cup as new signings Lewis Baker and Ashley Fletcher scored in a 3-0 win over Scunthorpe United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Championship side went ahead through Fabio, who headed in Adama Traore's cross for his first Boro goal.
England under-21 midfielder Baker - on loan from Chelsea - netted his maiden effort for the club from Grant Leadbitter's ball into the box.
Fletcher added the Teessiders' third to settle it in the second half.
League One side Scunthorpe arrived at the Riverside unbeaten this season but had failed to go beyond the second round of the competition in the past six seasons, and that record seldom looked likely to improve.
Their hopes were swiftly dashed by a strong Boro side named by Garry Monk, featuring Â£6.5m summer signing Fletcher, Baker and former Barcelona winger Traore.
Marcus Tavernier enjoyed a bright debut - laying on Fletcher's goal after a fine one-two - as one of two academy graduates to make their senior bow alongside Connor Roberts.
Boro dominated for much of the game, particularly once Fabio had opened the scoring and Scunthorpe's best effort fell to Devonte Redmond whose header was saved by goalkeeper Dimitrios Konstantopoulos.
