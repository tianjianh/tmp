[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 0-3 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Tollitt's brace helped Tranmere back to winning ways at Woking and moved them up to third in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers had lost their last two league matches and could have gone behind when Woking forward Gozie Ugwu had two great chances in the first half, but he was denied by visiting goalkeeper Scott Davies on both occasions.
Andy Cook was also close to getting on the scoresheet for Rovers in a goalless first half.
The deadlock was broken six minutes after the restart when a mazy run by James Wallace took him away from two defenders before his cross found Cook in the penalty area, and he steered home from close range.
Tollitt doubled the lead two minutes later with a powerful drive from 25 yards before the 22-year-old sealed victory with a fantastic individual goal, running from his own half before finding the bottom corner from the edge of the area.
