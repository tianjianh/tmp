Bedfordshire Police said a gross misconduct hearing will now be held.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) previously said four of the officers face allegations relating to their "honesty and integrity".
Now aged 23, Mr Cole was injured during an incident involving bouncers and police outside the former Elements nightclub on Mill Street in May 2013.
The talented athlete and footballer broke his neck and suffered a severe injury to his spinal cord.
He now needs 24-hour care and his mother Claudia spends hours by his bedside in a nursing care home.
The case was referred to the  Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by the IPCC.
A CPS spokesperson said: "CPS lawyers considered charges of misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice and breaches of health and safety law.
"They have now concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any of the officers and no further action will be taken."
Bedfordshire Police said the gross misconduct hearing will be held in due course.
One officer has retired and the others could be sacked if the disciplinary charges are proved.
Temporary Dep Ch Con Mike Colbourne said: "Our thoughts remain with Julian Cole's family and friends, who have had to wait almost four years for this decision.
"It is disappointing the investigation by the IPCC took such a long time to get to this point, which has put added strain on Mr Cole's family and the officers involved."
