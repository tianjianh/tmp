Det Ch Insp Leanne Pook also plans to help out at a rescue centre in Africa caring for girls saved from FGM and child marriage.
As part of her training Ms Pook, who is Avon and Somerset Police's lead on FGM, has climbed Snowdon twice in a day.
As part of the trip she will be tweeting pictures and video of her progress via @ASPEndFGM
Ms Pook said she would be visiting places where FGM is still practised to understand what barriers are still in place which prevent this "awful practice from being consigned to the past".
"We'll spend about a week climbing up and back down the mountain before volunteering at the centre for the next five days," she said.
"This centre is a haven for children who are orphaned or have been rescued from FGM and child marriage. This place doubtless saves the lives of some young girls and allows them to achieve their full potential. At the centre they're safe, receive an education and learn to be self-sufficient.
