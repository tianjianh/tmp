He joined Bristol City on Saturday, but Barnsley kept their focus to win a seventh successive league game, beating Bury 3-0 the following day.
The club had also made it to the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final three days before Johnson's departure.
"The players deserve the credit after what's been a tough week for them," Heckingbottom told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"It's been a hectic week, but it is better that way because you get everything over and done with within a few days.
"Now it's about moving forwards and carrying on as normal."
Johnson led Barnsley through a run of eight consecutive defeats earlier in the season, but the latest victory moved them up to 10th place in League One.
They have not lost a league game since 19 December and now have Heckingbottom and Tommy Wright in caretaker charge.
"We just want to carry on as normal," the former added. "We will keep going, keep getting the players organised and motivated when they're out on the pitch."
