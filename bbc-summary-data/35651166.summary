The activists have been banned from Heathrow and will have to do unpaid community work.
The barrister representing four of the activists earlier said the group had acted on "deeply-held beliefs".
They were found guilty last month of aggravated trespass and entering a security-restricted area.
During the trial the court heard the protesters' actions caused "astronomical" costs and disruption.

The demonstration took place last July when the defendants from the direct action group Plane Stupid cut through a fence at Heathrow Airport and chained themselves together on a runway.
They were told when they were found guilty they could expect to receive jail sentences.
Arguing against a prison sentence Kirsty Brimelow QC, speaking for four of the defendants, told Willesden Magistrates Court they believed they had been "acting in the public interest" and highlighted what she called a "hard-fought for" tradition of civil disobedience.

District Judge Deborah Wright said her understanding was that "immense" costs had been caused by the protest.
Prosecutor Robert Short said prosecution costs had reached about Â£14,000.
