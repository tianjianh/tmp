NHS Western Isles told to improve breast milk storage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Western Isles has been told to improve its handling and storage of expressed breast milk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Healthcare Environment Inspectorate (HEI) has made the request following an inspection of Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway in Lewis in September.
Inspectors said there was no record of what temperature breast milk was being stored at and no staff policy in place for handling and storing it.
However, HEI said the hospital was otherwise clean and meeting standards.
Inspectors only made the one requirement regards breast milk and no recommendations.
Jacqui Macrae, head of quality of care for HEI, said: "This was a good inspection in which we found that the ward environment and all patient equipment we inspected was clean.
"We also saw good staff compliance with standard infection control precautions."
NHS Western Isles chairman Dr Neil Galbraith said: "The board takes a close interest in maintaining the standards of cleanliness within our hospitals because of the high correlation with patient safety.
"The board welcomes the Inspection findings which largely corroborate the Western Isles Hospital's own self-assessment report and provide the external reassurance that our cleanliness and anti-infection regimes are being effective."
Dr Galbraith added: "The board notes the one requirement emerging from the inspection and will look to have the policy paper produced, and related practice brought into being, with immediate effect."
