TP Mazembe are aiming to repeat last season's feat of winning the Confederation Cup after demotion from the Champions League.

The Democratic Republic of Congo side will host Algerians JS Kabylie on Sunday in the first leg of the Confederation Cup play-offs.
Mazembe are involved in the second-tier competition after losing in the Champions League round-of-32 - as they did last year.
They went on to win the trophy with a 4-1 aggregate victory over Mouloudia Bejaia.
But they face a tough task this season, with 10 other winners of Confederation of African Football titles in contention - Kabylie can boast of six African triumphs.
While Mazembe were losing on away goals to minnows CAPS United of Zimbabwe last month, Kabylie scraped past Etoile of Congo Brazzaville in the Confederation Cup.
Mohamed Boulaouidet scored the only goal of the tie a minute from time for the Algerians, his third in the competition this season.
Mazembe lack a consistent scorer since the recent departure of Jonathan Bolingi, one of three Mazembe stars signed by Belgian outfit Standard Liege.
The loss to CAPS cost French coach Thierry Froger his job just a month after being hired and assistants David Mwakasu and Pamphile Mihayo have been promoted.
Also included are 15 other Champions League losers demoted to the Confederation Cup.
Among them are Rail Kadiogo of Burkina Faso, who will meet CS Sfaxien of Tunisia, winners of the Confederation Cup a record three times.
The match will be played behind closed doors in Ouagadougou, a disciplinary measure in place following bottle throwing and pitch invasions in a Champions League fixture last month.
Sfaxien are coached by Nestor Clausen, part of the 1986 Argentina World Cup-winning squad, and have an in-form goal poacher in Senegalese Waliou Ndoye.
Zesco United of Zambia were one of the surprise clubs of the 2016 season, reaching the Champions League semi-finals with a multi-national squad.
Foreigners continue to play key roles for them this year, with goals from Kenyans Jesse Were and David Owino helping secure a play-off slot.
Zesco are away to Enugu Rangers of Nigeria, whose lone Caf success came 40 years ago in the now defunct African Cup Winners Cup.
Club Africain's preparations for their tie with Association Sportive Port Louis in Mauritius were disrupted by their players delaying their departure by a day in protest over unpaid wages.
The only tie between clubs from the same country involves FUS Rabat and MAS Fes of Morocco, both former Confederation Cup title-holders.
Play-off winners advance to the group stage, starting next month.
