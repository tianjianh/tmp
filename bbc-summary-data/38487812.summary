Christopher Tester, 37, from Torquay, Devon, was wounded during a robbery at his parents' restaurant on the Caribbean island on Christmas Day.
He was being flown back to the UK by air ambulance after being taken out of an induced coma, friend Charlotte Williams said.
A crowd-funding campaign for his return has raised Â£103,000.
Mr Tester, who grew up in Brentwood, Essex, and went to Brentwood School, was spending three weeks with his parents at the restaurant.
Ms Williams said: "As far as I'm aware after talking with his family, the intruder had come in and his parents were in the process of handing over the cash.
"Chris interrupted the robbery and didn't realise the guy had a gun, and went to shield his mum. The gunman was caught unawares, and that's why Chris was shot."
Mr Tester was put in the induced coma after the shooting and taken to the neighbouring island of Guadeloupe for treatment. He remains heavily sedated and his father is understood to be accompanying him back.
He was en route "via the United States or Canada", Ms Williams said, and was due back at either Exeter or Southampton airport later on Monday.
Ms Williams, who is still in Antigua, said the flight was "unbelievably amazing news" after an "incredible shock".
The crowd-funding page was set up to pay for his return as Mr Tester did not have travel insurance. It initially aimed to raise Â£90,000.
Ms Williams added that a group of school friends had "done everything" to "keep pushing this appeal".
After he returned to the UK, the fund would also be used to pay for ongoing specialist care, Ms Williams said.
