The line-up has been announced on Instagram in a series of puzzle pieces which fitted together.
Other artists who appear include George The Poet, Slaves, Tame Impala, Roisin Murphy, Duke Dumont and David Rodigan.
Chemical Brothers will headline on Saturday 12 September with Underworld opening the event on Thursday night.
The festival says its theme this year is Summer of Love.
Bestival takes place at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight between 10-13 September.
Other acts appearing will be Jungle, Jurassic 5, Flying Lotus, Gorgon City and Little Dragon as well as DJ sets from Annie Mac, Lily Allen, Mike Skinner, Norman Jay and Benji B.
Organiser, and Radio 1 DJ, Rob da Bank, says: "We're taking it right back to our roots for the 12th annual Bestival.
"It's also the 20th birthday of the club where it all started - Sunday Best, and that club and our beloved Bestival were founded on some pretty simple aims - listen to amazing music, make new friends, have fun, and maybe stay up all night.
"Two decades later we're rigidly sticking to those principles, and this edition of Bestival, with its Summer of Love theme, is all about one huge musical, well, orgy...
"So, returning friends the Chemical Brothers rave alongside iconic pop stars Duran Duran and The Jacksons, and some of my favourite modern musical mavericks - Tame Impala, Flying Lotus and Jungle - jump in bed togetherâ€¦ and this is just the start of the partyâ€¦
"Watch this space and feel the love."
Tickets are on sale now and there's a weekly payment plan available.
