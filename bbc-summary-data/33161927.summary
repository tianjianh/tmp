The 22-year-old made his debut for Saints as a centre in March 2012, but has also played in the second row and loose forward.
He was part of the St Helens side which won the Grand Final last year, and will move to Exeter in November.
"We are looking at different types of players having different abilities in our team," said Chiefs boss Rob Baxter.
"We are aware that the switchover from league to union isn't going to be straightforward.
"He has taken a chance moving to union because he has a well-established league career. He knows there will be a bit of transition time and he'll probably have a period on loan somewhere, but he is very open to those ideas."
Jones has made 64 appearances for Saints and featured in their win over Wigan last week.
"I can't explain how excited I am about the move," he said. "It's a new challenge for me and my family, but it's one that we're all really looking forward to.
"Exeter are a great club, they've just come off the back of a fantastic season, and having watched them a few times on the TV, I like the style of rugby they play and the way they go about things.
"Hopefully I can go down there, add a bit to the squad using my experience from playing Super League and look to make my mark as quickly as possible."
