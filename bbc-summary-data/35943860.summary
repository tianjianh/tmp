The family of an 88-year-old woman who died in hospital have raised concerns about her care at a pre-inquest hearing.

Tegwen Roderick from Abercanaid, Merthyr Tydfil, suffered an "open wound" leg fracture at Ysbyty Cwm Cynon, Mountain Ash, and died six days later in May 2014.
The Aberdare hearing heard "no-one had admitted to causing the injury", while police will take no further action.
An inquest will take place in July.
Friday's pre-inquest hearing heard Mrs Roderick had been "bed-ridden and unable to move".
It is believed she sustained the leg injury overnight between 29 and 30 May 2014 but it was not reported until 10:00 BST the next day.
Coroner Sarah Richards said two pathologists reports had not provided "a definitive cause of death".
Her two nieces and nephew both attended the hearing and said they had concerns about her care, guidelines to lifting and handling, nutrition and hydration and "knowledge of dementia".
The coroner said she would look into concerns raised by her family at the inquest.
