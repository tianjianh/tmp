[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New Zealand-born Dale McIntosh, 47, of Pontypridd, admitted threatening behaviour at Llandudno Magistrates' Court.
The court heard he threw punches after being subjected to a "torrent of derogatory terms" while he was drinking in Rhyl on 4 February.
McIntosh apologised for his behaviour.
Diane Williams, prosecuting, said police outside a pub saw an "agitated" Merthyr RFC coach taking off his jacket before he cornered a man and allegedly struck him numerous times.
The former Cardiff Blues and Pontypridd RFC coach was arrested and told police he reacted after being taunted by a group.
Graham Parry, defending McIntosh, said it was a "very unfortunate incident" and his client was subject to a "considerable amount of very unpleasant provocation".
McIntosh apologised to the court for his actions, saying: "I'm not here to question it or make excuses for myself. I used physical force, I am a professional person and role model in my community.
"I extend my sincere apologies especially to the three arresting officers. Hopefully I will learn from this experience."
