The Eden Festival started on Thursday on the Raehills Estate near Beattock and runs until Sunday.
Ch Supt Gary Ritchie said organisers had made it clear there would be a "zero tolerance" approach to drugs.
"The message is quite clear: do not bring drugs to the Eden Festival," he added.
"Over the weekend we will continue to police the event fully in line with the festival's policy and anyone foolish enough to attempt to come onto the site with illegal drugs will be dealt with accordingly," he said.
