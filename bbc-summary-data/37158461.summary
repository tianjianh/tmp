Rig grounded on Lewis beach towed away by two tugs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transocean Winner, the rig that grounded on a west Lewis beach two weeks ago, has begun to be towed round the island by two tugs.

The 17,000-tonne structure was refloated on a high tide at 22:04.
The tugs Union Bear and Union Princess are towing the rig to the east side of Lewis.
The journey to Broad Bay covers about 54 miles (87km) and could take up to 21 hours to complete.
Once in Broad Bay, underwater inspections of the rig will be made to check for damage.
Transocean Winner could remain in the bay until mid-September to allow for repairs and a decision on its final destination.
The rig was being towed from Norway to Malta, from where it was to be moved to a yard in Turkey to be scrapped, when it broke free from a tug in a storm and was blown on to the shore at Dalmore, near Carloway.
It's the incongruity of it all.
The giant orange rig at a jaunty angle at the end of a typically gorgeous Hebridean beach, of course.
As you drive down to the scene there's an orange helicopter parked on a drive just outside one of the houses, branded with a company name from the Pyrenees.
Then there's the cluster of emergency services. Police. Ambulance. Coastguard.
The Salvation Army. Well, get so many people together working so hard, and they'll need support, teas and coffees.
And at sea, just a couple of hundred metres off the beach, the tugs and barges that should move the TransOcean Winner at high tide tonight. Zipping between them, a couple of fast RIBs.

Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, who is overseeing the salvage operation, said everything was done to prepare for a successful refloat.
He told BBC Alba that before being towed to Broad Bay, the rig would first be moved about five miles (8km) offshore from where it ran aground.
This would allow for checks to its buoyancy and stability before the longer towing operation.
Mr Shaw said eight anchors were to be used to hold Transocean Winner in Broad Bay in "any weather conditions".
