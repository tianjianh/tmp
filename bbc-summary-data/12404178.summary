Burton's Foods 'rules out' keeping Moreton site open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton's Foods appears to have ruled out any chance of saving its biscuit factory in Wirral, despite a plea from the council for the firm to reconsider.

The company said in January it was closing the Moreton site, with the loss of 342 jobs.
Wirral Council leader Councillor Jeff Green met Burton's boss Ben Clarke on Friday to ask if further council support would change the plans.
The firm said proposing to close the site was not an easy decision.
A spokesperson said: "The period of consultation with employee representatives at our Moreton site is ongoing during what we recognise is an extremely difficult time for Burton's Foods workers at the site, and their families too.
"Burton's Foods has maintained an open dialogue with unions and others in the local community since announcing its supply chain review.
"Especially given our long history at the site, the proposal to close Moreton was not made lightly and the review was extremely thorough."
The company, which makes Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels, has proposed phasing down production at Moreton from March before completing the closure later in 2011.
It also plans to consolidate its Knowlsey multi-site distribution operations in a single location.
It will, however, invest Â£7m at its manufacturing sites in Edinburgh and Llantarnam, South Wales.
