Jack Gudge, 17, was found unconscious on Wimborne Road, Winton, at 00:55 BST on Saturday.
Police, who said it was believed the teenager was injured during a fight close to a Tesco Express, arrested four people.
The family have asked people to stay calm "out of respect" for Jack.
Mr Gudge died at Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital.
All four of those arrested, aged 15, 23, 24 and 27 and all from the Bournemouth area, are on police bail pending further enquiries.
A post-mortem examination found a brain injury, but did not provide the exact cause of death. Further tests are due to take place.
Jack's mother Jolene Keenan paid tribute to her "wonderful, beautiful, funny son" and said she was releasing a photo of him in the hope it would encourage more witnesses to come forward.
Chief Insp Mike Claxton, of Bournemouth police, said: "This tragic incident has understandably shocked and upset the whole community and I send my condolences to the family and friends of Jack.
"Jack's family have asked that, out of respect for him, everyone remains calm and people do not take matters into their own hands."
He also warned that "inappropriate comments on social media could cause problems with the investigation".
He said: "This includes any comments that could be deemed threatening towards those on police bail or proved to be inaccurate that could prejudice the ongoing investigation."
Det Chief Insp Neil Devoto, of the major crime investigation team, said: "Jack's family has been updated with the developments of the investigation by specially-trained officers and our thoughts continue to be with them at this time."
