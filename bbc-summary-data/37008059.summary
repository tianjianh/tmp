Ms Dugdale told the Daily Record she was "utterly thrilled" after getting engaged during a trip to Mallorca.
The couple have been in a relationship since 2008 but Ms Dugdale, 34, only publicly revealed she was gay four months ago.
She said: "I'm utterly thrilled to be marrying the love of my life and we can't wait to start planning."
Ms Dugdale added: "We hope this news brings a smile to peoples' faces and we'll certainly be toasting all those campaigners and activists who made marriage equality possible."
