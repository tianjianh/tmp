It follows speculation that she could be involved in The Great British Bake Off when the hit programme moves from BBC One to Channel 4.
Hussain said she will now continue to make films for The One Show and develop "other exciting programme ideas".
The BBC said details of her new programmes would be announced "in the near future".
There have been reports that the BBC is planning a new show to rival Bake Off when it switches channels.
In September Hussain fronted the well-received two-part Chronicles of Nadiya on BBC One, while in August it was announced that she will judge a junior version of Bake Off on CBBC.
She recently said she had received "no offers" from Channel 4 to join their version of Bake Off when it moves in 2017 or 2018.
Fifteen million people tuned in to see Hussain crowned Bake Off winner in 2015.
In a statement, she said: "Since winning the Great British Bake Off I've been lucky to have had some amazing opportunities with the BBC.
"I believe that making it my home gives me the scope to work across such a unique range of diverse and interesting projects. I'm delighted to announce that I will continue making films for The One Show, as well as developing other exciting programme ideas.
"I never thought this would happen, but it is and I have to admit, I'm going to embrace it."
Charlotte Moore, director of BBC content, described Hussain as an "exciting new talent", adding that it had been "great watching her thrive creatively since she won Bake Off last year".
She continued: "She has a refreshingly authentic voice, great warmth and charisma and a natural ability to connect with audiences. I'm really looking forward to exploring new territories and perspectives with her."
The current series of Bake Off will be its final run on the BBC after its production company Love Productions signed a three-year deal with Channel 4.
Paul Hollywood will move with it to Channel 4, but fellow judge Mary Berry and hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins have opted to leave the show.
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said no one else had yet been approached about presenting or judging roles.
"As we have previously stated Channel 4 has not made any approaches about roles on the show," the spokeswoman said.
