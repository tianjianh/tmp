The second rower, 29, was placed on the transfer list by the Giants last month after an internal investigation.
He helped England to a Test series win over New Zealand in November.
"The Rhinos are a fantastic organisation and I am looking forward to being part of the squad next season," said Ferres.
"The last year has seen plenty of ups and downs for me, however this move gives me an opportunity to finally look forward to the future with confidence and be part of something special at the Rhinos."
