Non-senior staff numbers will fall from 1,800 to 1,200-1,300 by April 2017 and staff at three London offices will move to a single site in Westminster.
Most Whitehall budgets were cut in last November's spending review and the DoH is trying to make efficiency savings of 30% in the next five years.
The chancellor announced a cut in the budget of the Department of Health although NHS spending was protected.
A Department of Health spokesman said: "The priorities for the new Parliament are clear and the spending review has confirmed financial expectations. The Department of Health will begin a new programme of modernisation, starting now."
Permanent Secretary Una O'Brien said: "The Department of Health has an important role leading the health and care system in England to help people live better for longer.
"It is only right that the Department of Health should take its fair share of the efficiency savings."
