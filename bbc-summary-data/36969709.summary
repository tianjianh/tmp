Paul Pogba is worth the world-record fee Manchester United have paid to re-sign him from Juventus, says former team-mate Rio Ferdinand.

France midfielder Pogba, 23, has returned to Old Trafford for £89m.
"Paul is a huge talent and someone with the personality to handle that price tag," Ferdinand told BBC Sport.
"He can do everything. He is still working out the best way to use all of his weapons but, once he does, he will be an absolute monster of a player."

Pogba joined United in 2009 but made only seven substitute appearances before leaving for Italy in 2012 as a 19-year-old, with a tribunal ruling Juve had to pay £1.5m for him.
"Paul told me before he left that he wanted to be the best player in the world," added Ferdinand, who made 453 appearances for United after a British record £30m transfer from Leeds in 2002.
"He is on the right track to achieving that.
"He won a lot of trophies at Juventus and his mentality means he wants to keep on winning things. If he does that at United then he will be up there to contend for individual accolades as well.
"From training with him and playing with him I know all about his self-belief and work ethic, as well as his ability as a player. Those are the two big things you need to be a success at United.
"Paul's character means he will deal with being such a big investment - so that won't be a problem.
"As well as that, he will relish the responsibility on his shoulders of bringing medals and trophies to the club. That won't faze him at all."
Pogba helped France reach the final of Euro 2016 as hosts - where they were beaten by Portugal - but did not always live up to his billing as one of the biggest stars at the tournament.
"Paul started off a bit anxious and eager to please but he settled down in the knockout phase," said 37-year-old Ferdinand, a former England captain.
"He produced two excellent and really mature performances in the quarter-finals and semi-finals against Iceland and Germany.
"I said two years ago at the 2014 World Cup that I thought he would become the world's best midfielder. He is not there yet - but there is a lot more to come from him.
"What I like about him is that he has so much in his armoury. He still has to learn to do certain things at the right times in games - and in the right order - but that is just fine-tuning really."

Pogba's fee eclipses the £85m Real Madrid paid Tottenham for Wales forward Gareth Bale in 2013.
"It is a lot of money but United are getting a top player for the next five to 10 years for that price," said Ferdinand, who spent 12 years at Old Trafford.
"United are spending that money on someone who knows the club and knows the culture already, so it is less of a gamble than it would be on someone who has never been there before.
"It was a mistake to let him leave but bringing him back is a statement of intent. He is going to be a top player for years to come and he will make a big difference to United's title chances."
