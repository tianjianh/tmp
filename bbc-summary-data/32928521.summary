[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farieissia Martin, 22, had denied killing 21-year-old Kyle Farrell, who was knifed in the chest at the house in Charlecote Street, Dingle.
But a jury at Liverpool Crown Court found Martin guilty. She is due to be sentenced on 9 June.
Mr Farrell died in hospital after suffering a single stab wound early on 21 November 2014.
His family said he was a "devoted father and loving son" who will be missed by all his family and friends.
