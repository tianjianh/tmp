University of Lincoln: Legal bid to stop Riseholme Park homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government is set to take "unprecedented" legal action against the University of Lincoln in a row over housing plans, according to a local MP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The university plans to demolish part of the Riseholme Park Campus to build housing as part of a big redevelopment.
Gainsborough MP Edward Leigh said the land was protected by an "asset deed", with the legal bid aimed to protect it for "future generations of farmers".
The university said a meeting was booked with the MP to discuss concerns.
The dispute involves land which is owned by the university, but used by Riseholme Agricultural College.
Sir Edward, a Conservative MP, said in an "unprecedented step" the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) was "taking steps to commence legal proceedings" over the plans.
He said: "This is a hugely significant development and one which will hopefully protect the campus for future use by generations of Lincolnshire farmers and other workers."
The university said it was in ongoing discussions with the SFA and their advisors, with its vice chancellor due to meet with Sir Edward soon.
A university spokesperson said: "The university has leading expertise in agri-food technology and is working closely with partners across the sector to develop education and research to support the future of farming and the food industries."
A Skills Funding Agency (SFA) spokesperson said: "The Skills Funding Agency will consider what steps they will take in order to protect the assets at the Riseholme campus for the delivery of further education.
"There is an asset deed in place which protects facilities at the Riseholme Campus for further education delivery."
