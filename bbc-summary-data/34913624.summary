Her casket was borne up the city's Grand Canal in a black gondola to St Mark's Square.
Ms Solesin was among the 89 people killed at the Bataclan concert hall. She had been there with her boyfriend, who survived the attack.
Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders spoke at the service.
"I want to thank the religious figures... who are here together in this square as a symbol of our common humanity at a moment when fanatics try to turn a massacre into an honourable act by invoking a faith," Ms Solesin's father, Alberto, said during the service, according to Reuters.
As well as her family, friends and boyfriend, Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti attended the service.
Large crowds of Venice residents and tourists turned out in St Mark's Square to watch the service.
