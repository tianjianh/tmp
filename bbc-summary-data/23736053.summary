Witnesses said gunmen shot civilians and police in Damboa, about 85km (52 miles) from the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.
The area is a stronghold of the Boko Haram militant group.
The group was blamed for the deaths of 44 people in a mosque in the nearby town of Konduga last Sunday.
Local official Ayamu Lawan Gwasha said security forces repelled gunmen who attacked the police station and a military post in Damboa on Thursday night.
Farmer Mustapha Aji said other militants gunned down civilians and firebombed about 20 homes.
He told the Associated Press that residents had feared an attack following the deaths in Konduga and had asked for more security, but it hadn't yet arrived.
Another witness, student Adamu Isah, blamed the attack on Boko Haram fighters.
Correspondents say details of the attack have been slow to emerge because of a communications blackout imposed by the military.
In May, Nigeria declared an emergency in three north-eastern states in order to battle the militants.
On Wednesday the army said it had killed Boko Haram's second-in-command Momodu Bama, also known by his alias "Abu Saad".
However, there has been no independent confirmation of his death and Boko Haram has not commented on the statement.
Boko Haram is fighting to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north.
Thousands of people have died since it began its insurgency in 2009.
