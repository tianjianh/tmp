Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock says the form of striker Kenneth Zohore could change his January spending plans.

Speaking after Cardiff's dramatic 4-3 defeat against Barnsley, Warnock stated that he is 'ready to make changes.'
Warnock says he will sell to raise funds to improve his squad, but admits Zohore could change his January plans.
"If Ken can keep carrying on playing like this I will be delighted to have him on-board and we can spend the money elsewhere," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"He is what I have been looking for all along and he's just come out the woodwork.
"He's been a massive plus for us because I'm looking to spend decent money on a striker in January, and I can't buy anybody better than him at the minute.
"We are looking for someone like him, someone who can go beyond, can be strong, can flick it on here and there, has got an eye for goal.
"I wish some of our chances against Barnsley had fallen to him. He has come out the blue really."
Warnock had not selected Zohore before last week when he came on at half time in the win over Wolverhampton Wanderers, with his previous appearance for the Bluebirds coming on 1 October when Paul Trollope was still in charge.
Warnock explained: "If we hadn't have been so bad in the first half the other night [against Wolves] we probably wouldn't know about Kenneth. So I'm lucky aren't I?
"I can see light at the end of the tunnel in two or three positions now."
Warnock says Zohore has not been in his plans until impressing against Wolves, because he has been lazy in training.
"He'll get better when he gets fitter. He knows now that he can do that every week, and that's what you need from a striker," he said.
"I am so pleased with him. He's been a little bit lazy at times since I have been at the club.
"But he's showing what he can do and he will get fitter now. He's a big plus for us. But there are a few minuses I have to deal with as well in the next nine days."
