Holyrood 2016: UKIP manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has launched its manifesto ahead of the Holyrood election on 5 May. Here are some of the key points.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The front cover of the 30-page manifesto sets out in bold letters UKIP's promise to "shake up Holyrood" if the party manages to win seats in the Scottish Parliament for the first time.
Inside, the party's Scottish leader David Coburn contrasts UKIP with the "tired old establishment parties which spout the same old havers".
And of course, Mr Coburn sets out his commitment to leaving the "bankrupt, sclerotic, undemocratic European Union and bring its powers back to Holyrood and Westminster where they belong".
UKIP is fielding a total of 26 candidates across Scotland's eight regional lists, with the party hopeful that the debate over whether or not the UK should leave the EU will translate into enough electoral support for it to win its first seats at Holyrood.
UKIP says it will:
UKIP insists it is not "anti-Europe", but is firmly opposed to political integration within Europe.
It argues that the UK has lost its rights of self-government through the "stealth creation of a United States of Europe which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, vast civil service and fledgling military and police forces."
The manifesto says a UK exit from the EU is the only choice if the country is to make our own laws and control its own destiny.
And it argues that leaving the EU would allow the UK to regain control of its borders and implement an Australian-style points based system to determine who is able to migrate to the UK.
UKIP's approach to taxation revolves ensuring that taxes in Scotland are the same - or lower - than elsewhere in the UK.
The key manifesto pledges in this area include:

The party says it would:
UKIP argues that changes in the law have pushed people away from their local pub and into the supermarkets to buy cheap alcohol.
The party believes that the local pub is a cultural tradition which moderates drinking in a social environment, and that the smoking ban has had a "disastrous effect" on sections of the Scottish economy and society.
UKIP proposes:
UKIP describes itself as a "Unionist party which understands the benefits of local decision making" and would oppose a second referendum on Scottish independence.
It believes that:
UKIP is committed to keeping the NHS free at the point of delivery for UK citizens. It says it would:
UKIP believes that every Scottish child should receive the best possible education and training. It policies include:
UKIP believes in a "genuine rural economy that is both sustainable and viable". In order to achieve this, it wants to bring powers back from Brussels to Holyrood, making agriculture and forestry the preserve of the Scottish Parliament. It also wants to:
Again, UKIP wants to abolish "excessive and unnecessary" EU regulation and directives and to replace them with more appropriate controls administered at a national or local government level.
It would also:
UKIP wants to start the process of replenishing Scottish waters and restoring its fishing industry by leaving the EU and withdrawing from the Common Fisheries Policy.
It would also:
UKIP is committed to upholding the rights of the individual and protecting them from an "ever encroaching state". It would:
UKIP aims to make travelling about Scotland a "pleasure rather than a chore". It would:
