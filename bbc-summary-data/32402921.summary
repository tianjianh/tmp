[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for four years for attacking a woman in her 20s in the street in Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Adjei, 29, of Riversdale Road, Ramsgate, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit a sexual offence and battery.
Kent Police said he grabbed the woman, tried to cover her mouth with his hand, and forced her to the ground in the early hours in Church Lane.
Adjei fled the scene when the woman asked what he wanted.
Officers traced Adjei after his DNA was found on the victim's coat and were able to piece together his whereabouts on 14 June 2014, the night of the attack, based on his bank details and a train ticket to Canterbury.
Det Sgt Daniel Aylett said Adjei put the victim through a terrifying experience.
A warrant was issued for Adjei's arrest after he walked out of a Canterbury Crown Court hearing in August.
He was arrested the following month in the Thanet area.
Adjei was also ordered to spend two years on extended licence after his release from jail as part of his sentence.
