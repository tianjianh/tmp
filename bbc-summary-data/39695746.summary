Adama Traore: Middlesbrough winger beats Lionel Messi in dribbling list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is the age old question - who is better? Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Well, there is one player who outshines them both... Middlesbrough's Adama Traore.
According to the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES), the 21-year-old Spanish winger is the best player in Europe - when it comes dribbling.
By dividing the number of dribbles attempted by the percentage of successful ones the CIES has come up with a list of the top 100 dribblers in Europe's top five leagues.
Traore tops the rankings ahead of Chelsea's Eden Hazard, while Barcelona forward Messi comes in sixth, just behind Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha. Barcelona forward Neymar is fourth - but Real Madrid's Ronaldo doesn't even make the list.
However, Traore's dribbling skills haven't made much of a difference to Boro. He has no goals and just one assist for the side currently second from bottom in the Premier League.
