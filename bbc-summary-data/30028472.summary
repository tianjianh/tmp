Comet landing messages melt hearts on Twitter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The two spacecraft at the centre of the Rosetta comet landing managed to find time to have an interstellar conversation on Twitter.

Their exchanges have been grabbing attention because they have been using some fairly non-technical and human language.
@ESA_Rosetta's job was to take the landing device @Philae2014 to the comet known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
One of their most retweeted moments was the touchdown.
They've even decided to mark it in different languages for fans all over the world.
Some of the chat is a bit geeky and scientific but the bits getting the most retweets are the Wall-E moments, when the crafts appear human.
The pair also have a star-studded group of fans.
The actor William Shatner, who made his name as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, has been in regular contact with the crafts.
Here is Newsbeat's favourite exchange between the two crafts.
It came just after the two detached from each other.
And being best mates, @ESA_Rosetta did just that and the image proved popular with followers.
It's been retweeted 5,700 times.
He's not the only one connected with the mission who is causing a Twitter storm.
This scientist in the team behind it has become a bit of a star for his love of rock music, tattoos and out-there shirt.
Dr Matt Taylor has had the image of the craft added to his impressive collection of body art.
