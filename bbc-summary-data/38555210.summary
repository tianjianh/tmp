It follows news that a man charged in connection with the killing is missing.
David Black was shot dead as he drove along the M1 on his way to work at Maghaberry prison in November 2012.
Damien Joseph McLaughlin, 40, of Kilmascally Road near Ardboe, is due to stand trial next month on charges that include aiding and abetting his murder.
However, in court on Friday, police said that he had breached his bail conditions and had not been seen by them since November.
In a statement, Mr Black's son, Kyle, said the family felt "very let down, hurt and betrayed by the justice system".
"Not only is the justice system letting us down, but they are letting dad down, and that was a system of which he was a part," he said.
Damien McLaughlin had served just over two years in prison for possession of guns and ammunition.
He spent time in prison on remand on charges connected to Mr Black's killing, but was released on bail in May 2014. A series of conditions imposed were later varied, including the removal of a stipulation that he had to wear an electronic tag and a reduction in the number of days he had to report to police.
At Belfast Crown Court on Friday, a judge revoked McLaughlin's bail after being told that he had failed to sign with police in November and had not been seen by them since.
Kyle Black said the decision to relax the bail conditions was "laughable to say the least".
"What is even more farcical is that someone with previous terrorist convictions and who is charged with further terrorist-related offences cannot sign bail (which should be completed daily) for more than five weeks and takes until then before concerns are raised about his location," he said.
In response, PSNI Det Ch Super Raymond Murray said: "We can't begin to contemplate the distress that David Black's family are feeling following the disclosure of breach of bail conditions by the individual charged with offences in connection with his murder and we fully take on board the concerns they have.
"We contacted Mr Black's family last week, prior to the court proceedings taking place, to make them aware of the situation surrounding bail. We have also arranged a further meeting with them to discuss their concerns.
"While I would like to reassure Mr Black's family, and the public, that our priority is to locate Damien McLaughlin, we are limited in what we can comment on publicly due to the ongoing legal proceedings."
He said police were continuing to make "active enquiries" and were liaising with other police services, including Irish police.
