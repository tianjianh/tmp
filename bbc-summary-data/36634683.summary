The Toomebridge rider overcame slippery conditions on his Aspar Ducati to secure nine points in the Netherlands.
Laverty has moved up one place to 10th in the championship standings on 48 points.
He came in 22 seconds behind surprise winner Jack Miller, with the Australian a 750-1 outsider with the bookmakers before the race.
Laverty, whose best result of the season was fourth in Argentina in early April, has finished in the points in every round of the championship.
Honda rider Marc Marquez was second in Assen to extend his overall lead in the series, with Britain's Scott Redding claiming the final place on the podium for Ducati.
