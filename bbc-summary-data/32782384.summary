The BBC's Ruth Nesoba says dozens of youths barricaded roads during the protests in parts of the capital.
They were chanting for President Nkurunziza to drop his plans to seek a third term in elections due next month.
On Sunday, Kenya's president called his Burundian counterpart, urging him to delay the elections.
Some businesses were closed and activities stopped in the Nyakabiga, Musaga and Mutakura neighbourhoods of Bujumbura, says our reporter.
However, she says life carried on as normal in areas where the president is popular.

Several alleged leaders of the coup attempt have been arrested but Gen Godefroid Niyombare, who announced it on radio, remains on the run.
President Nkurunziza on Sunday made his first official appearance in front of international media since returning from Tanzania, where he was when the coup bid was launched.
The president said nothing about the coup plot or the current crisis in the country.
Instead he said Burundi faces a specific threat from the Somali Islamist movement al-Shabab.
Al-Shabab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamud Rage denied this, saying the statement was intended "to divert the world's attention from him".
Burundi has troops fighting al-Shabab, as part of the African Union mission in Somalia.
