The 21-year-old leaves IFK Norrkoping, and has agreed a three-year deal, with the option of a further 12 months.
"It began very statistically based and then, the more we saw him play, the more we liked what we saw," head coach Lee Johnson told the club website.
"We couldn't turn down this opportunity to sign him. He can be very special."
Meanwhile, BBC Radio Bristol report that Swedish striker Gustav Engvall is set to leave the Ashton Gate club for a second loan spell, rejoining Djurgardens.
Eliasson has been capped at various youth levels for Sweden, linking up with Engvall in the Under-21 European Championships in Poland this year.
