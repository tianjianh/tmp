It will go on the wall at the Paralympic wheelchair tennis venue. During the Olympics, Eton Manor will have aquatic training pools on site.
Ms Duffy was appointed the first female poet laureate in 2009.
In March, 2012 organisers Locog said a line from Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses would be engraved as an installation at the park to inspire athletes.
The line "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield" will be set in the centre of the village.
Alongside Ms Duffy, other poets who have been commissioned to write work for the park include Lemn Sissay, Jo Shapcott, Caroline Bird and John Burnside.

Ms Duffy said of the announcement, on National Poetry Day: "I'm delighted that poetry will be present in the Olympic Park and thrilled that my own contribution celebrates and remembers the history of this wonderful space."
After the Games, the plan is to turn Eton Manor into a sports centre for tennis, five-a-side football and hockey, and able to host elite hockey games for up to 15,000 spectators.
It is built on the site of a disused sports club. A war memorial there, to members who died in World Wars I and II, is being restored.
The Olympic Park poetry commissions are part of a nationwide programme, Winning Words.
