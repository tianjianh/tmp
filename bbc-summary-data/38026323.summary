India v England: Tourists batted like idiots on day two - Geoffrey Boycott

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England batted like "idiots" as India took control of the second Test, says former batsman Geoffrey Boycott.

The tourists closed day two on 103-5 in reply to India's 455 in Visakhapatnam.
Four wickets fell for 29 runs from 51-1 with the collapse sparked by the run out of teenage opener Haseeb Hameed.
"It's been poor, poor batting. The low scuttler hasn't got anybody out, I haven't seen the jumping ball and yet England are in trouble at five down," Boycott said on Test Match Special.
"It's pressure, pressure, pressure. It's a little bit about technique but it's a mental game. It's not a raging turner, let's be honest. There's been some sloppy, poor batting."
Joe Root looked the most comfortable English batsman in reaching 53 but perished when he tried to hit off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin over the top and miscued a simple catch to deep mid-off.
Ben Duckett was bowled by Ashwin for five while Moeen Ali was trapped lbw by Jayant Yadav for one after a successful India review.
Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow halted the slide as both reached 12 not out by the close but with the pitch expected to deteriorate further, England are struggling to save the game and avoid going one-nil down in the five-match series.
Former England opener Boycott felt captain Alastair Cook, who was bowled by Mohammed Shami for two, fell victim to "a really good ball" but said the other four wickets were self-inflicted.
Boycott believes "this game has gone" for England who trail India by 352 runs with three days still remaining.
"I was saying before England batted, you can't afford to give India a 100-run lead. Batting last it gets worse and don't pray for rain because this is not Manchester or Yorkshire," he said.
"I can see India batting again if England hang on a bit. The pitch is going to wear and tear a bit more. There are three days left - this could be over in four days without a problem."
England pace bowler Stuart Broad, who was limping on day one, has had a scan after experiencing discomfort in his right foot. The results are expected to be revealed on Saturday morning.

"The groundsman expected the ball to start spinning shortly after lunch and he got it about right. Not sharply, but enough to unsettle jittery batsmen and expose poor technique.
"Some balls are keeping low, so batting is difficult but not impossible. It's hard to see any obvious escape route for England."
