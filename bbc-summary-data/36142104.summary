Super League: Widnes Vikings 16-18 Wakefield Trinity Wildcats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield converted a late try to beat Widnes in a bad-tempered Super League game which saw three players sin-binned and both teams have a man sent off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had Patrick Ah Van sin-binned early on before Widnes' Aaron Heremaia and Wakefield's Scott Moore saw red.
Anthony Tupou crossed as Wakefield led at the break, but Charly Runciman and Eamon O'Carroll touched down to bring the Vikings level at 10-10.
Widnes led with Rhys Hanbury's try but Craig Hall's last-gasp score won it.
The victory was Wakefield's sixth in Super League this season and moved them up to seventh in the table, level on points with sixth-placed Widnes, who are winless in six league games.
In a tense opening 40 minutes, Ah Van was yellow-carded early on for a fierce tackle which dislocated the shoulder of Wakefield's Ashley Gibson.
Moore was sent off for a high tackle on Ah Van following his return to the field, while Heremaia was dismissed for his reaction in the brawl that followed.
Widnes also had Lloyd White sent to the sin bin, while Stefan Marsh saw yellow for a trip on Jacob Miller before Hall's match-winning score and Liam Finn's fifth successful kick at goal.
Widnes head coach Denis Betts: "It was the worst refereeing performance I've seen in 30 years. We had a legitimate try from Chris Houston from a bomb disallowed near the end and there was nothing wrong with it.
"We did enough to win the game because we were in control but I'm really disappointed for my players.
"I can understand Wakefield's elation but thought we deserved something out of the game."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "It was a crazy game and I've not been in one before like it with two sent off and three sin-binned.
"But we had a real never-say-die-attitude despite being shot to bits in terms of interchanges.
"It was a real back to the wall effort and we won it with a special play from Craig Hall in the end and a great conversion from Liam Finn. It was a fantastic performance by our guys."
