Analysts said lower growth meant the low interest rate environment was likely to continue, boosting equities.
Interest rates are not expected to rise until about a year's time.
The FTSE 100 rose 15.83 points to 6,949.63, having fallen nearly 1.4% in the previous session on worries over Greece and the bond market.

Barratt rose 3.39% after it said housing market conditions remained strong, and raised its forecast for the number of houses it expects to build this year. Rival housebuilder Persimmon also rose, gaining 4.12%.
Shares in catering group Compass fell 3.78% despite reporting a 4.5% rise in half-year pre-tax profits to Â£621m and saying it was on track to meet its full-year forecasts.
