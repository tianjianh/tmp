A vicar who made a YouTube video to tell her congregation she was HIV positive says she has been "humbled" by their reaction.

The Reverend Hayley Young, from Hayling Island Baptist Church near Portsmouth, made the video after her treatment started to cause hair loss.
She told Victoria Derbyshire she hopes it will counter misconceptions.
The video - which sees the 28-year-old tell her story through cardboard signs - has been viewed over 19,000 times.
Ms Young contracted HIV following a non-sexual attack in 2013 - for which she decided not to press charges - and prior to the video had only informed a handful of people close to her of the infection.
Among them, she explained, were some negative reactions, with one person referring to her as "dangerous". Her loss of hair was also causing rumours to spread in her church, with many people concerned over her health.
It was a result of these factors, she explained, that she "thought it was time that I informed my congregation".
"I knew telling them face to face was going to be quite difficult for myself and them so I thought about how I could do it creatively," she added. Her decision to choose a "cardboard testimony" was a result of having seen the popularity of such videos in the United States.
The video explains the symptoms Ms Young - who has been a minister at the church since January 2011 - has experienced since contracting HIV, but also looks to counter any misconceptions surrounding the infection.
"I think people were worried about me being around children, how they can contract it," she told Victoria Derbyshire. One individual thought HIV could be passed on through kissing. "People just don't know unfortunately," she added.
Since the video was posted on May 10, Ms Young says she has been overwhelmed by the reaction from church-goers.
"On the whole, the congregation have been amazing and [they're from] a variety of ages and a variety of backgrounds, so I've been humbled by their positivity."
She says she is glad many others have been "inspired and encouraged" by the video, but does not feel it is her role to become a spokesperson for those with HIV.
Ms Young also explained how she had been hurt by some of the abusive messages YouTube users had posted on the video, although she is now learning to come to terms with them.
"When you put your head above the parapet, it's going to happen, isn't it?" she said.
Ms Young is continuing to take her medication daily, but feels that her health "still isn't 100%". With the right treatment, she hopes to live a "happy and healthy life".
She says she is able to take peace and strength from her Christian faith.
