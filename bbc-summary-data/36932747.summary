Asbestos scare closes Prestwick beach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Council workers have closed off the beach at Prestwick in Ayrshire over concerns about asbestos contamination.

Officials are attempting to trace the source of the material.
It is understood they are working on the theory the asbestos was dumped on the beach rather than being washed ashore.
South Ayrshire Council said the beach would remain closed until a specialist contractor could remove the material and carry out decontamination works.
Prestwick would normally be a popular destination for tourists during the summer months.
Councillor John McDowall, sustainability and environment spokesman for the council, said: "We have moved swiftly to close the beach as a precaution as even a small amount of asbestos can be potentially harmful if it's disturbed.
"We don't take decisions like this lightly, but I'm sure members of the public and visitors would rather be safe than sorry. We simply won't take any chances and the beach will remain closed until the material is removed and the necessary checks have been carried out."
