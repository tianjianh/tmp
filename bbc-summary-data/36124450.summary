[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four fire engines and over 30 fire fighters attended the blaze at the property on Carlisle Road.
It is understood the kitchen was gutted in the incident.
The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said at this stage it is believed the fire was accidental.  It is understood the man sustained minor burns.
Area Commander Mark Deeney said the fire caused considerable damage to the building.
"When we arrived, the roof area was well alight," he said.
"Through the hard work of the crews we were able to contain the fire and stop it spreading beyond the building of origin.
"The cause is under investigation but our initial indicators would suggest that it was accidental."
