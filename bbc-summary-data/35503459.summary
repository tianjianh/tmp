The images were taken by archaeologists in surveys of sites across Scotland.
The sites include the remains of an ancient fort at Mither Tap on Bennachie in Aberdeenshire and Caisteal Grugaig, an Iron Age broch in the Highlands.
The exhibition, Echoes in Stone, will be running at the University of Stirling's art gallery.
It uses images taken during work done for Forestry Commission Scotland.
Matt Ritchie, Forestry Enterprise Scotland Archaeologist, said: "Whether at a landscape scale, recording stone-by-stone detail or achieving sub-millimetre accuracy, archaeological laser scanning can produce amazing images.
"We have really got to grips with the idea of 'creative archaeological visualisation' and have tried to combine these new archaeological survey techniques with an artistic ethos.
"This means we can produce detailed site records alongside innovative and spectacular illustrations that will really capture people's imaginations and hopefully help them get a fascinating new insight into life in Scotland in the distant past."
