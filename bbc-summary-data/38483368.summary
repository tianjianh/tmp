A Nobel Prize-winning scientist has started his term as chancellor of the University of Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geneticist and cell biologist Sir Paul Nurse succeeds Baroness Hale, who has held the role since 2004.
Sir Paul said it was "one of the UK's great universities" and he "felt very honoured to be asked".
The former President of the Royal Society will be installed as chancellor on 22 March, during a special ceremony.
Sir Paul was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2001 for his work on the discovery of molecules that regulate the cell cycle.
"It is one of the UK's great universities, both in terms of its world-leading research and also its teaching," he said.
"With the recent announcements about its new campus and ambitious plans outlined in its new strategy, it's an exciting time to be involved."
The University of Bristol is planning to build a new Â£300m campus in the city centre due to open in 2021-22.
Vice-chancellor Prof Hugh Brady said having Sir Paul as chancellor was a "huge honour" for the university.
"His appointment could not have come at a more opportune time, as we look forward to the next step in our University's development," he said.
Previous chancellors of Bristol University include Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Jeremy Morse, the inspiration for Inspector Morse.
