The game was part of the four-day European Champions Cup, a club competition being played in the eastern German town of Zwickau.
About 60 fans from the Istanbul-based clubs Besiktas and Galatasaray were involved.
They began attacking each other with knives and baseball bats.
Police in Saxony say none of the injuries sustained by the Turkish supporters were serious.
The match on Saturday at Zwickau's sports hall had to be cancelled.
There is a fierce rivalry between the Istanbul sports clubs Besiktas and Galatasaray, whose football teams are two of the most successful in Turkey.
It is not the first time that violence has broken out between supporters of their wheelchair basketball sides.
In 2012, 10 fans were arrested after a clash during a game in Istanbul when supporters sprayed fire extinguishers at each other - police had to use tear gas to break up the fighting.
CD Ilunion, a team based in the Spanish capital, Madrid, went on to win the European Champions Cup, beating German side RSV Lahn-Dill 71-45 in the final on Sunday.
