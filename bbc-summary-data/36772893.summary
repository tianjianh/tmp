[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham are in negotiations with AC Milan over the transfer of Colombia striker Carlos Bacca.

The 29-year-old, reported to be worth £26m, joined Milan from Sevilla for £21m last summer and scored 21 goals in his first season with the Italian side.
He scored twice as Colombia got to this summer's Copa America semi-finals.
The Hammers have already brought Sofiane Feghouli, Havard Nordtveit, Toni Martinez and, most recently, Gokhan Tore to the club this summer.
German-born Turkey winger Tore signed from Besiktas on Monday on a one-year loan deal that could become a permanent transfer.
