George Adam was speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme ahead of Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop being quizzed about the government money.
Earlier in the programme, Labour MSP Alex Rowley said there needed to be greater clarity on the matter.
Mr Adam responded by saying: "I listened to Alex Rowley's interview and I was quite disappointed because Alex is normally very reasonable.
"He has almost made it sound as if it is a witch hunt with the individuals that we are talking about here, making unfounded allegations."
