[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 1-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby continued to settle superbly into National League life as they beat Torquay 1-0 at Grange Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crucial moment came with 20 minutes remaining as Danny Clarke got on the end of a quick passing move and shot under Brendan Moore from 12 yards.
The Villagers put the south-coast club under pressure from the outset, while Danny Emerton caused concern with his corners - one was nearly headed home by Clarke and another almost went straight in.
In the second half, Brett Williams pounced on a poor back-pass for Torquay but home goalkeeper Rory Watson closed down his angle superbly.
Luke Young's late free-kick struck a post for the Gulls, who went home pointless.
