Council bosses have apologised for rush hour chaos at a new multimillion-pound road junction in Norwich.

Norfolk County Council announced immediate changes to its A47 Postwick junction scheme when traffic ground to a halt on Friday morning and evening.
Opening a new slip road sent traffic around the Postwick Hub access roads and meant flows at a crucial roundabout were worse than expected, it said.
The council apologised "to all those whose journeys were disrupted".
New traffic controls have been installed and they will be operated manually to allow for actual traffic flows.
Warning signs are also to go up to alert drivers of any potential delays.
A spokesman said: "The old bridge had been scheduled for a full closure for up to eight weeks for essential maintenance and upgrading.
"It will now remain open for use even when the new bridge opens on Saturday.
"Keeping the old bridge open will allow traffic from the Great Yarmouth direction to avoid the Postwick Hub access roads and will help to relieve any additional pressure on the Peachman Way roundabout at peak times."
