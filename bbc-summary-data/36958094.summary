Gueye joined Villa for Â£9m from French side Lille in July 2015 and made 35 Premier League appearances as they were relegated last season.
Villa were unable to retain him after the Toffees triggered a release clause in the 26-year-old's contract.
New Everton manager Ronald Koeman said: "Idrissa will provide quality in our squad in the midfield."
Koeman, who was appointed as Roberto Martinez's successor in June, added: "He was one of the players last season with the best record in interceptions and pressing in the midfield. We need this kind of quality and I'm happy to have him joining our club."
Gueye made made 134 appearances for Lille, having emerged from the Diambars Academy in Senegal, and helped them to the French title in 2011.
"My style is good for the Premier League," he said. "You have to fight every game. All the teams are strong and you have to concentrate all through the game.
"Goodison Park is a very good stadium and the fans are very good, too. They push their team forward and I am excited to play there."
