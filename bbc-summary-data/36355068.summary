Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill made her first competitive outing of the athletics season at the Loughborough International on Sunday.

The Sheffield athlete threw moderately in the javelin - 41.69m compared with a personal best of 48.33m - but appeared to be free of an Achilles injury that ruled her out of the indoor season.
There are 12 weeks to go before Ennis-Hill defends her Olympic title in Rio.
"My Achilles actually feels really good," she said.
"The work I've done with the medical team - and the rehab and just making sure we get it right - has really worked."
Ennis-Hill's hampered preparations have forced her to pull out of the high-profile heptathlon at the Hypo-Meeting in Gotzis next weekend. She has already qualified for Rio 2016.
Also at Loughborough, CJ Ujah beat Great Britain team-mate James Dasaolu to win the 100 metres A race in 10.06 seconds, inside the Olympic qualifying time.
