[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire opener Brett D'Oliveira missed out on a third straight century, but runs still flowed for the hosts as they enjoyed a good day against Sussex.

After putting on 113 for the first wicket with skipper Daryl Mitchell (43), D'Oliveira was out to a loose shot, cutting, after being stuck on 99.
But Joe Clarke continued the assault with 82 to help the hosts to 382-4.
Ross Whiteley (54*) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (43*) were there at the close, having so far put on a stand of 101.
D'Oliveira's effort followed scores of 128 against Essex and 202 not out against Glamorgan.
This time last year, D'Oliveira was batting number eight for the county second XI, before taking his chance over the second half of the season.
His current hot streak even spilled into Birmingham League cricket on Saturday, when the 24-year-old converted opener made 150 for his local club Ombersley.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes:
"It's a good wicket. We know that this one goes through a little bit so it came on quite nicely for the batters. They still needed to bat well, because there are balls in it that can get you out.
"I was really pleased with the team batting effort. Daryl Mitchell and Brett D'Oliveira put in a good foundation.
"Dolly again played wonderfully, as did all the players - Joe Clarke coming in as he did, Tom Kohler Cadmore's contribution and then Ross Whiteley at the end. It was just a general good team effort."
Sussex head coach Mark Davis:
"It's been their day. They batted well. That said, I think they have given us a couple of wickets as well and that kept us going.
"Steve Magoffin was outstanding with the ball and Luke Wells showed he's ever improving as a leg spinner.
"Stuart Whittingham ran in and bowled quick as well, so there are a lot of good things to take."
