About 45 NHS organisations were disrupted in the global attack that affected organisations in 100 countries on Friday.
NHS Wales Informatics Service said incoming emails would be automatically deleted as a precaution until Monday.
Outbound and internal emails are unaffected.
A Welsh Government spokesman said NHS Wales had not been affected by the cyber attack but it was "monitoring the situation closely".
He added: "We have recently invested in upgrading IT to protect potentially vulnerable front-line NHS Wales systems.
"We have also introduced a national standard for IT security for all GP surgeries in Wales."
In a tweet on Saturday, NHS Wales Informatics Service wrote: "Due to the NHS England cyber attack, we have blocked all inbound emails (external senders and NHS England) to NHS Wales. Will review Monday."
Another read: "Blocked emails will be dropped and deleted. Client services supported file shares have also been disabled until Monday as a precaution."
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on Saturday, the NHS "must learn" from the attack and upgrade its IT systems.
