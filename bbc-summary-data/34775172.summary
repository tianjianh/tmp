Rock star Prince is to tour Europe in less than a month, playing solo sets at the piano for the first time in his career.

The tour is expected to kick-off in Austria on 21 November, with four dates in the UK, according to reports.
In a statement, the star said: "Why do this now? For several reasons. For starters it is a challenge.
"I rarely get bad reviews because this is something that's been perfected for over 30 years.
"You have to try new things. With the piano it is more naked, more pure. You can see exactly what you get."
Prince has often incorporated solo piano segments into his shows - using them as an opportunity to flick through his back catalogue and play snippets of lesser-known songs.
He also released an entire album recorded at the piano, 2002's One Nite Alone, which included a cover of Joni Mitchell's A Case Of You.
Other piano-led songs in his repertoire include The Beautiful Ones, Sometimes It Snows In April, How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore and Starfish and Coffee.
Prince made headlines in 2013 with his Hit and Run tour, where venues were announced with less than 24 hours notice, and tickets sold for as little as Â£10.
He returned to the UK last year for a short series of gigs with his all-female band, 3rdEyeGirl.
The enigmatic musician - famed for his energetic live shows and incendiary guitar solos, has hinted the Piano and A Microphone tour will have a different setlist every night.
UK venues have yet to be confirmed - although dates are said to be planned in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and London.
The star - who rarely makes traditional, straightforward announcements on touring - apparently broke the news by inviting a small group of music writers from European newspapers to his Paisley Park estate in Minnesota.
He posted a photo to his Instagram account labelled "European Press" before a story appeared in Spain's El Pais newspaper.
