Derry firm fined £15,000 over workers' fall from crane

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shipping company has been fined £15,000 for breaching health and safety rules after three men were injured after falling from a crane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derry firm Burke Shipping Services admitted three counts of health and safety breaches in relation to an incident on 20 August last year.
The men, one of whom had only started work for the company on the morning of the incident, were unloading bags of cement powder from a ship when the incident occurred.
Derry Crown Court heard that the three men had been lowered into the ship's hold in a basket lifted by a crane when they should have used a ladder.
When they were being lifted out, the basket, which was not intended for personnel, tilted and the three workers fell about 12 ft onto the deck.
One of the employees sustained fractured vertebrae, another suffered a collapsed lung while the third suffered cracked ribs.
A defence barrister said it was accepted that the basket being used was not suitable for the task and was meant to be used in conjunction with a forklift truck.
The barrister said the company had since purchased a proper basket.
Burke Shipping Services was also ordered to pay £800 in costs.
