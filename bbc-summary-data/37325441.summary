[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge's dismal start to the League Two season continued as they surrendered the lead to lose 2-1 at home to Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's led at half-time through Piero Mingoia but the game was transformed by goals from Shrimps pair Jack Dunn and Paul Mullin in the space of three minutes after the hour.
Winger Mingoia opened the scoring nine minutes before the break, firing across Morecambe goalkeeper Barry Roche after the ball fell to him when Ben Williamson was unable to get a shot away.
The visitors levelled in the 62nd minute when Dunn converted from the penalty spot after being brought down by Luke Berry.
Dunn was involved again two minutes later, robbing Conor Newton and freeing Mullin down the middle, who rounded keeper Will Norris and fired beyond a man on the line.
Medy Elito and Berry both fired wide as the hosts failed to find an equaliser, leaving them without a win in their opening eight league fixtures.
Cambridge United manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"Until I'm told otherwise I'll be doing my job exactly the same as what I've been doing for the last 10 months.
"It's been a job that I'm very proud to have. I've enjoyed some wonderful times here and I expect to enjoy some future wonderful times.
"I'm a fighter. I feel like I'm in a little war at this moment in time, a war with myself as well as I hate seeing us at the bottom of the league. But I'm fighting."
