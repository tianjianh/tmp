His latest album, Views, has knocked Beyonce's Lemonade off the top, pushing it into second place.
Billy Ocean and Travis both have new entries in the top five.
Drake's One Dance remained top of the singles chart, while Calvin Harris and Rihanna's track This is What You Came For was a new entry at number two.
There were no other new entries in the whole of the top 40 singles chart.
Canadian rapper Drake's album is the second fastest seller of the year so far, according to the Official Charts Company, notching up sales of 78,000 and putting it just behind David Bowie's Blackstar for quick sales.
It is his fourth studio album - and fourth chart-topper.
Prince still has four albums in the top 40, with The Very Best Of... the highest placed, at number three.
Billy Ocean's return to the chart is a combination of a new album, Here You Are, and a bonus Best Off... featuring the likes of Caribbean Queen and When the Going Gets Tough.
Scottish band Travis have now released eight studio albums, with their latest, Everything at Once, landing in the chart at number five.
Other new album chart entries include Tremonti (16), Rob Zombie (25) and Brian Eno (28).
