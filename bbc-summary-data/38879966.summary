Scott Kashket's deflected goal was the difference at Adams Park as Pompey fell to a second successive League Two loss, slipping to seventh in the table.
"I told the players after the game that I couldn't have asked any more from them," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
"With 18 games to go, it's going to come down to single games in this league for promotion."
Wycombe's victory lifted them above Pompey, who are now seven points behind third-placed Carlisle with a game in hand.
"I feel if we play like that during the run-in, we'll have a lot more good days than bad," Cook added. "The bigger picture for me is, if we play like that, we'll go up.
"My job is to get this side promoted at the end of the season, and I'll move heaven and earth to get that done.
"We've just had a tough run and we're very disappointed with our results. But, performance-wise, I can't ask any more from the players."
