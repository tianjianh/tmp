[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday held on to their Championship play-off place as Fernando Forestieri's late goal beat Cardiff.

The hosts went closest in a goalless first half as Cardiff goalkeeper Allan McGregor pushed Ross Wallace's shot on to the post.
Substitute Forestieri made Wednesday's pressure count as he headed in after McGregor had saved from Jordan Rhodes.
Despite Fulham's win at Norwich, Carlos Carvalhal's side stay sixth in the table, while Cardiff remain 14th.
A slow start to the game saw both sides struggle to settle, and McGregor's save from Wallace was the only real chance before half-time.
Cardiff, with little to play for in mid-table, frustrated their opponents and showed a flicker of attacking intent as Joe Ralls had a shot comfortably saved by Keiren Westwood.
While the score remained goalless and Fulham took a 2-0 lead at Norwich, Wednesday found themselves outside of the play-off places.
That prompted Carvalhal to make changes, and two of his substitutions had a decisive impact.
Rhodes' powerful shot was saved by McGregor, but Forestieri followed up with a diving header to clinch a third successive league win for Wednesday.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal:
"I just want to say we did a fantastic performance against Newcastle, winning, and we did a fantastic victory against Cardiff, winning again.
"I think in the second half people were a little nervous, one period or another, but our fans were amazing again.
"Everybody understood that we must be patient in this moment and we achieve a goal and this is the most important."
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock told BBC Radio Wales:
"I'm disappointed. I've never felt more comfortable at Hillsborough. Other than the shot in the first half, I didn't think we were troubled.
"We had some good opportunities which we didn't take advantage of. Other than that, I was quite pleased - just disappointed with the goal.
"When they put Rhodes and Forestieri on, we haven't spent a penny. You look at the sort of money they've spent and they're sixth in the league, so it's got to give us a lot of confidence that we can improve in the summer.
"They're sixth in the league and I don't know how they've come away with a win."
