Scott McDonald's goal with 10 minutes left kept Dundee United's perfect start to the Scottish Championship intact with victory over struggling Brechin.

Scott Fraser's curling shot was saved by Brechin keeper Graeme Smith early on, while United captain Mark Durnan glanced a header wide.
The visitors hit the post before the break and Jordan Sinclair's shot was tipped over by keeper Harry Lewis.

They remain two points ahead of Dunfermline, who beat Falkirk 3-1, in second, while Brechin have just one point from their opening three games, the same tally as Falkirk and Inverness.
