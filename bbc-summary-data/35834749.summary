[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ombudsman 'should have more powers', group of AMs say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public services watchdog should have powers to start its own investigations, a group of AMs has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Finance Committee's report said a law was needed to strengthen the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales' powers, so he can start an investigation without first needing a complaint.
Ombudsman Nick Bennett said there was a chance for AMs to "hit the ground running" to help improve services.
He had called for the power to hold his own inquiries last year.
The AMs also recommended the ombudsman's jurisdiction should include private healthcare providers.
Committee chairwoman Jocelyn Davies said: "We sincerely hope this legislation is taken forward during the fifth assembly and that its implementation will enhance the role of the ombudsman and increase public confidence in Wales."
