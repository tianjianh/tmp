[SN]TITLE[SN]
BRFM presenter's gay jibe breached Ofcom rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A radio presenter who said midwives would become a thing of the past because of "everybody being bis and gays" breached the broadcasting code.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Regulator Ofcom launched an investigation after BRFM's Dai Haywood's on-air remarks in October.
It said the comments, coupled with others about blow-up dolls and sex toys, breached Ofcom rules.
BRFM expressed its "deepest apologies" and said it had permanently suspended Mr Haywood.
Ofcom said: "We considered that the presenter's statements about homosexual and bisexual people were likely to have been interpreted by listeners as offensive because they were derogatory and stereotypical."
Mr Haywood, who presented a weekly programme specialising in rock'n'roll music from the 1950s and 1960s, was talking about his granddaughter's career at the time.
He said: "Just been talking to Graham about the way, the way the world is going with everybody being bis and gays and, well they say, like Betty was saying; there won't be no midwives 20 years from now, midwives will be a thing of the past.
"Cause my granddaughter's hoping to become a midwife and funny I only said to her yesterday 'you'll be redundant by the time you're 40, with all the gay people around. There'll be no reproduction going on'."
BRFM, a community station based in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, said Mr Haywood had apologised "sincerely" for his remarks and there was "no excuse" for his comments.
An on-air apology was also made, Mr Haywood was suspended and the station said he would no longer be involved with it.
Ofcom said it took into account the right to freedom of expression but, combined with his remarks about sex toys and blow-up dolls, it "served to reinforce the presenter's derogatory comments by presenting a negative and stereotyped view on the sexual behaviour of homosexual and bisexual people".
The regulator said it "did not consider the broadcast of this material, which had the potential to cause offence, was justified by the context".
