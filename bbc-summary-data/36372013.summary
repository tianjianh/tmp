[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers half-back Ben Roberts will miss the rest of the season with a foot injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roberts, 30, injured his foot against St Helens in March, but made his return in Saturday's Magic Weekend game against Warrington.
However Roberts was forced to leave the field just before half-time.
"He's ruptured the tendons that attach some of the bones in his foot together," coach Daryl Powell told the club website.
"In some ways it will be less frustrating for him now, as he's been constantly trying to get himself back on the field."
The Tigers are currently seventh in the Super League table, having won seven of their 15 games so far this season.
