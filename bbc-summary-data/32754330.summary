Three former care workers have been convicted of historical indecent assaults against boys at a school for vulnerable children in Kent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colwyn Baker, 71, David Hennessy, 74, and Nigel Putman, 62, abused youngsters at the now closed Swaylands School, in Penshurst, between 1963 and 1979.
Jurors at Maidstone Crown Court returned partial verdicts against them.
Baker was convicted of five counts of indecent assault, Hennessy of two and Putman of one.
Baker was cleared of one charge of sexual assault and one indecent assault.
The jury is still considering 38 other charges.
Baker, of Craighouse Avenue, Morningside, Edinburgh, had denied 24 indecent assault and three serious sexual assault charges.
Hennessy, of Westfields, Narborough, King's Lynn, Norfolk, had denied 17 indecent assault charges, one of gross indecency with a child and one serious sexual assault.
Putman, 62, of Kings Road, Slough, Berkshire, had denied three indecent assaults.
Swaylands School, a residential facility for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties, closed in 1993.
The jury was later sent home for the weekend and will resume its deliberations on Monday.
