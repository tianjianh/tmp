2018 World Cup: Uganda hold firm against Ghana

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uganda held firm for a 0-0 draw in Ghana in the opening game of Group E in 2018 World Cup qualifying on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ghana dominated the game in Tamale and crated enough chances to feel they should have won.
Uganda's goalkeeper Denis Onyango, who plays for South African side Mamelodi Sundowns, had an outstanding game.
There was some confusion over whether Uganda's Nicholas Wadada had been booked twice and not sent off but Fifa confirmed he had been booked only once.
Ghana played without the injured duo of Andre 'Dede' Ayew and Kwadwo Asamoah but did welcome back veteran striker Asamoah Gyan, who was unable to inspire his side to a win.
The two sides also met in qualifying for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations with Uganda earning a 1-1 draw in Ghana on that occasion too before winning 1-0 at home in Kampala.
The other two teams in Group E are Congo and Egypt and they meet in Brazzaville on Sunday.
