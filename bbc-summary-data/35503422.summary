Paul Milburn, 43, from Surrey, died after being shot in his car in Noke Lane, St Albans, in Hertfordshire on 26 April 1993.
Last June, police appealed for information about the whereabouts of Justin Clarke, 59, who they believed could help with their enquiries.
Mr Clarke was arrested in Berlin on Thursday.
The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said he was arrested under a European Arrest Warrant and the extradition process had begun.
An 81-year-old woman from Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, was also arrested on Thursday on suspicion of assisting an offender. She has been released on bail.
