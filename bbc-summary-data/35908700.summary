Orkney murder case campaigners claim police 'lost evidence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group campaigning for the release of a man jailed for the murder of a waiter in Orkney in 1994 is claiming a vital piece of evidence was misplaced by police who investigated the case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Justice 4 Michael Ross group has launched a website which alleges police lost a diary belonging to the victim.
Michael Ross was convicted in 2008 of murdering Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood in a restaurant in Kirkwall.
Police Scotland declined to comment on the website's claims.
In 2014, Ross failed in a bid to have his conviction re-examined.
He was told by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission there was not enough evidence to support a miscarriage of justice claim.
Since his original conviction, Justice 4 Michael Ross has campaigned for the case to be overturned because of what it describes as a lack of evidence presented at his trial.
Ross was 15 when he shot Mr Mahmood, 26, in the head in Kirkwall's Mumataz restaurant in full view of a room full of diners, including families with children.
The former Black Watch sniper was jailed for a minimum of 25 years after being convicted of murder.
