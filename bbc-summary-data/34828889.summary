The show, which had been scheduled to air at 19:00 GMT, was expected to feature a "gunfight", according to the Radio Times.
An ITV spokesman said: "Tonight's episode of Jekyll and Hyde has been postponed in consideration of recent events in Paris."
Creator Charlie Higson described events in France's capital as "shocking".
Last month, Ofcom opened a probe into the programme after it received 459 complaints about an episode broadcast before the 21:00 watershed and deemed "too scary" by some viewers.
