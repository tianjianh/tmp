[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Jones-Bishop's treble made it four wins from five for Wakefield as they beat a Catalans Dragons side that have now lost their last four games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trinity won in Perpignan last season and never trailed as they backed up that result with a convincing win.
Jones-Bishop crossed twice, followed by Tom Johnstone's score as they led 16-0 at half-time, with Ben Garcia replying.
Catalans kept battling away, scoring two further tries, but Wakefield added four of their own to cap the win.
Despite a decent start, Catalans have faded since talismanic back-rower Greg Bird was injured in the defeat by Leeds at Headingley last month.
Even their home form has fallen away with this their third winless game at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in 2017.
Wakefield were aggressive and smart from the opening stages, frustrating Catalans and forcing errors that were compounded by breakaway scores from Jones-Bishop and Johnstone.
The playmaking triumvirate of Liam Finn, ex-Dracs player Sam Williams and off the bench Jacob Miller, playing behind a dominant pack, put Joe Arundel and Matty Ashurst through gaps with soft hands.
Krisnan Inu was a rare bright spot for Catalans, scoring a solo try, in addition to Garcia and Fouad Yaha touch-downs on the edges.
Wakefield Trinity head coach Chris Chester: "I'm really, really pleased, I thought we were very dominant today straight from the kick-off. I thought our forward pack was outstanding and we created a lot of opportunities.
"We were a little bit disappointed not to go in at half time with a few more tries under our belt - I think Tom Johnstone lost the ball twice in try-scoring opportunities but his try just before half-time gave him a bit of a leg up.
"In the second half we came out and were very, very good with the ball, we ran hard and I think defensively we were good in the second half. I'm a bit disappointed that we give them a bit of a leg up in the second half and a couple of poor penalties from us gave them some field position.
"That being said, I think we are deserving of the two points, we've won four from the last five now and this team is full of confidence."
