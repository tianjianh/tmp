Mary Logie murder trial: Paramedic felt hole in skull

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paramedic has told the Mary Logie murder trial of the moment he realised he could feel her brain through a hole in her skull when he was called to her home in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 82-year-old was found dead at her Leven home on 5 January.
Sandra Weir, 41, denies murder and has lodged a special defence of alibi claiming that around the time of the murder she was elsewhere in Leven.
Paramedic Alan McIntyre said Mrs Logie was on her side when he found her.
He said he was surprised at the amount of blood in the living room where Mrs Logie was lying because he thought he had been called to a fall.
When he felt her skull, he realised there was a soft area, and that he could feel her brain.
One ear had also been partially cut off. He was unable to save Mrs Logie, pronouncing "life extinguished" at 20:51.
Mr McIntyre also noticed a stain of blood on the carpet, and he thought attempts had been made to clean it.
He described it as looking a bit like a spillage of red wine which has been unsuccessfully cleaned. He also noticed a rolling pin on the sofa.
Pathologist Dr Ian Wilkinson told the court the cause of death was blunt force head trauma.
He said there were multiple fractures to her head, especially on the right side.
There were a total of 31 injuries to her head and neck and he said "some injuries suggested a curved blunt object might have been involved".
When shown an exhibit of a rolling pin, he said the "injuries could possibly fit with that".
Later, the pathologist agreed to a suggestion by prosecuting counsel Alex Prentice his findings would be consistent with Mary Logie being struck with a rolling pin and trying to defend herself.
Dr Wilkinson also said he couldn't exclude the possibility that Mrs Logie was attacked twice in one day, at different times.
However, equally, it could have been just one event that led to her death.
Jurors were also read a statement of evidence agreed between prosecutors and Ms Weir's solicitor advocate Murray Macara.
In the statement, jurors were told that a rolling pin was taken from Mrs Logie's house on 6 January 2016. A DNA swab was taken from the handle of the rolling pin.
Jurors were also told that DNA belonging to Mrs Logie, Ms Weir and another person was obtained from the swab which was taken from the rolling pin handle.
Jurors were also told a purse was recovered from Mrs Logie's house on 6 January. DNA swabs were taken from over the edges of the opening and the paper note section of the purse.
DNA belonging to Mrs Logie, her son Ronald, Sandra Weir, another person called Elvedina Salmond and another unknown individual were obtained from the swab.
Ms Weir, 41, also denies stealing money and jewellery from Mrs Logie, fraudulently using her bank card and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by cleaning up blood and disposing of clothing.
The trial at the High Court in Edinburgh continues.
