Storm Henry: Forth Road Bridge open to cars 'for now'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Forth Road Bridge has been opened temporarily to cars but it is expected to close completely at about 09:00 due to strong winds brought by Storm Henry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge had been shut for a time on Monday afternoon following gusts of 84mph.
Winds of more than 80mph make it too dangerous for vehicles to make the crossing between Fife and Edinburgh.
The Met Office issued an Amber weather warning for high winds from Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning.
