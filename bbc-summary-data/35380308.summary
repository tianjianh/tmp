[SN]TITLE[SN]
James Bond Aston Martin DB10 Spectre vehicle up for auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Martin will auction one of 10 DB10 cars made for last year's James Bond film Spectre along with 23 other Bond-related items for charity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The car, which was specially built for the film, will be put up on 18 February with a minimum price of Â£1m.
It forms part of "Spectre - The Auction", timed to coincide with the release of the 24th Bond film on DVD.
The car has a 4.7-litre V8 petrol engine and a top speed of 190 mph, but it cannot be driven on public roads.
Aston Martin has been associated with James Bond since the 1964 film Goldfinger, which featured a DB5.
Most of the DB10s were modified for use in the filming of Spectre, but the DB10 offered at Christie's auction house is one of only two "show" cars, which were left unmodified and used for display purposes.
The film is reported to have destroyed $36m worth of cars during shooting.
The car up for auction has been signed by James Bond actor Daniel Craig.
