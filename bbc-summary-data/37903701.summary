Everton midfielder James McCarthy is out of the Republic of Ireland's World Cup qualifier against Austria on Saturday because of a hamstring injury.

McCarthy has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the Republic's qualifier wins over Georgia and Moldova last month.
That angered Everton boss Ronald Koeman, who criticised Republic manager Martin O'Neill over the issue.
Stephen Ward, Stephen Quinn and Cyrus Christie will also miss the qualifier.
McCarthy, 25, played against Georgia and Moldova after recovering from groin surgery but then suffered a hamstring injury.
Dundalk pair Daryl Horgan and Andy Boyle have retained their place in the squad after it was whittled down from 35 to 28 for the journey to Vienna.
Defender Christie faces at least three months on the sidelines after breaking a bone in his foot in Derby's win over Wolves on Saturday, while Burnley full-back Ward and Reading midfielder Quinn have also been ruled out of the contest by injury.
Sunderland defender John O'Shea is another injury concern for O'Neill because of a hamstring injury but remains in the squad.
The Republic's main striker Shane Long has already been ruled out of the Austria game through injury, while Daryl Murphy, who headed the late equaliser against group leaders Serbia in September, will also miss Saturday's game (17:00 GMT).
The Irish are level on points with Serbia after their opening draw in Belgrade was followed by the wins over Georgia and Moldova.
