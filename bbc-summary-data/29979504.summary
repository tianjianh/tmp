Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald will perform 22 concerts across seven arenas, kicking off at the Hydro in Glasgow on 28 April.
The live shows will be four years after the group's last record-breaking stadium tour, Progress, and marks their first without Jason Orange, who quit the band in September.
Robbie Williams will also not be returning for the tour.
In a statement, Take That said: "We've always been very proud of our live shows and are very excited to be touring again next year.
"Playing live is something we love the most about what we do and we're looking forward to putting on the most amazing show we can.
"It will have been four years since our last tour so we're really keen to get back out on the road to play some of our biggest songs from the last 20 years alongside our new ones."
The tour will visit Glasgow, Belfast, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Sheffield before finishing in London in June.
After the announcement, Gary Barlow tweeted: "We can't wait to get back on the road and see you all, by far our favourite thing to do."
Former X Factor contestant Ella Henderson will be a special guest on the tour after the success of her debut single Ghost and album Chapter One.
Both reached number one in the UK charts.
Take That's seventh studio album III is coming out on 1 December, with the first single These Days due out on 23 November.
The three remaining members of Take That were criticised earlier this year when it emerged that Barlow, Donald and Owen and their manager Jonathan Wild had invested millions of pounds in tax avoidance schemes.
Barlow said in an interview that the tax situation was a "problem" but insisted his fans were "not interested" in his financial issues.
Tickets for Take That's tour go on sale on Thursday, 13 November at 9am.
The Take That tour dates are as follows:
Glasgow, SSE Hydro - 28, 30 April and 1 May
Belfast Odyssey - 4, 5
Birmingham, LG Arena - 14, 15, 16
Newcastle, Metro Radio Arena - 18, 19
