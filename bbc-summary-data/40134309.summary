Okojie scored 39 goals for the Isthmian League South side this season, helping them reach the play-off final.
Details of the length of the 21-year-old's contract at the Recreation Ground have not been disclosed.
"To get that amount of goals, at whatever level, you must have something," Shots manager Gary Waddock told the club website.
