The mural, called Slave Labour, disappeared from Wood Green in February and later appeared in a Miami auction.
After being withdrawn at the last minute, it has now been returned to the UK, where new bids are being accepted, with a starting price of Â£900,000.
Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports ahead of the UK auction.
