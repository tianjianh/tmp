Hughes, 19, was born on the British overseas territory of Anguilla, but has held a British passport since birth.
His training partner is Usain Bolt and he is already being compared with the Jamaican six-time Olympic champion.
"Bolt's a major motivation. He is always telling me to do this and that," Hughes told BBC Radio 5 live.
Hughes's fellow Anguillan Shara Proctor, the British long jump record-holder, switched allegiances in 2010 and competed for Team GB at London 2012.
Four other athletes have been ruled eligible for Great Britain. American Cindy Ofili (100m hurdler) has also held British nationality since birth, while compatriots Shante Little (400m hurdler) and Montene Speight (400m runner), plus Swedish-born high jumper Victoria Dronsfield, all hold British nationality.
In March 2014, Hughes broke Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake's 100m junior record with a time of 10.12 seconds and almost beat Bolt in the 200m on 13 June.
Hughes said he was "ecstatic" and "grateful" to represent Team GB.
"Training with Bolt is a phenomenal experience, it's been a dream come true for me," he added.
"I have been looking at videos and analysing these guys. I have always wanted to run against them."
On being compared to Bolt, Hughes added: "I want to make my name out there for myself."
Anguillans can compete at the Commonwealth Games and World Championships.
But athletes from the island are unable to enter the Olympics as Anguilla is not recognised by the International Olympic Committee.
While keen to represent Team GB in Rio, Hughes has other targets in mind, starting with the World Championships in Beijing between 22 and 30 August.
"The target is the Olympic Games for sure but right now I am focusing on the World Championships," said Hughes.
"Execution is key all the time for me. I want to get to the World Championship and get my times."
