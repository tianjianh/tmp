The 27-year-old has had spells at Championship side Bedford Blues, as well as Rosslyn Park and London Irish.
He joins Neil Briggs, Peter Stringer, Bryn Evans and Brian Mujati as new signings for this season.
"He came on trial for six weeks and he impressed in training and the two games," director of rugby Steve Diamond told BBC Sport.
"He's dynamic, he's got things with ball in hand that other players haven't got - he's got a lot to do, but he's impressed."
