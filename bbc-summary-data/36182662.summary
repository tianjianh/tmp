Colombian Quintana had led overall since winning Thursday's second stage.
Team Sky's Chris Froome, winner of Saturday's fourth stage, after losing 17 minutes in the second stage, trailed home in the peloton.
French rider Thibaut Pinot (FDJ), quickest in Friday's time trial, came second overall.
The closing stage was a 177.4km ride between Ollon-sur-Villars and Geneva.
Froome was part of a breakaway before the two-time Tour de France winner attacked on the final climb with 36km remaining.
He was was unable to gain a decisive lead, and instead it was a move from Verona that proved crucial. Swiss Albasini tracked it carefully and went on to claim the sixth Romandie stage win of his career.
The Tour de Romandie is regarded as a pointer to the Tour de France, with three of the previous five winners going on to win in Paris.
