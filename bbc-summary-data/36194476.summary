Rhyl Sun Centre demolition plans submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to demolish a landmark water park in Denbighshire in a bid to rejuvenate the area's promenade, has taken a step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhyl's Sun Centre shut in 2014 after the trust running it ran out of money.
Denbighshire council said the upkeep of the building would be better spent elsewhere and want to pull it down.
If demolition plans are backed, a new aquatic centre would be built and cash would also be used on improving the Pavilion theatre's exterior.
Funding of about Â£3.5m would come from the Welsh Government's Vibrant and Viable places scheme.
Rebecca Maxwell, the council's corporate director, said if the demolition and theatre revamp is approved, "will mark the next phase of regeneration in Rhyl" with work starting as early as July.
