[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough v Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gaston Ramirez is back in contention for Middlesbrough after missing the win over Sunderland because of suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Ayala is doubtful after twisting his ankle, while Victor Valdes and Grant Leadbitter could miss out again.
Manchester City will be without goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, whose season could be over after he suffered a calf injury in the Manchester derby.
There are concerns over the fitness of David Silva and John Stones, but Bacary Sagna returns after five weeks out.
Conor McNamara: "This week has already brought Middlesbrough's first league win of 2017.
"Their survival hopes remain slim but those three points against Sunderland should ramp up the atmosphere for this one. Boro are still in the fight.
"I interviewed Pep Guardiola after the Manchester derby on Thursday. He was very pleased with Gabriel Jesus' brief cameo after a two-and-a-half month absence.
"An offside flag correctly denied the Brazilian a late winner. He should get more game time at The Riverside.
"City rarely enjoy their league trips to Middlesbrough. Only once since 1977 have the visitors managed to win a game on Teesside."

Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "It's another all or nothing match, but we're used to that in recent weeks.
"I've admired Pep [Guardiola] for many years. His team pass the ball and are very good in possession, with lots of movement. They have talent all over the pitch and can score goals for fun.
"But when we went to the Etihad we came away with a point, and in the FA Cup game we worked hard and had chances on the day."
Boro are more ambitious going forward under Steve Agnew than they were when Aitor Karanka was in charge but they still don't have the players to hurt teams.
Manchester City do, and they will go to the Riverside Stadium and attack Middlesbrough. I think they will find a way through.
