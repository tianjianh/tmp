Cost-cutting measures helped publisher Johnston Press achieve a rise in adjusted pre-tax profit last year, despite falling sales.

The Edinburgh-based group said profit increased by 22.6% to £31.5m, while revenues were down 6.8%, to £242.3m.
However, total operating costs were cut by 6.7% to £191.7m.
The figures were released as Johnston confirmed that shareholders had overwhelmingly backed a deal to buy the i newspaper from ESI Media for £24m.
It said the acquisition would give the company "numerous revenue and cost synergy opportunities", contribute positively to earnings and "allow us to accelerate growth in digital, and help stabilise our circulation revenues".
In its annual results statement, the owner of The Scotsman and more than 200 other titles said "challenging trading conditions" in the second half of last year had continued into 2016.
Total revenues for the first eight weeks of this year were down 13% "against strong year-on-year comparatives" in the first quarter of 2015.
Other Johnston Press financial highlights for 2015:
In January the group revealed plans to cut editorial jobs across its operations in the UK, as part of a drive to cut costs following a decline in revenue.
Chief executive Ashley Highfield said: "We have reduced costs to maintain profitability, reset our portfolio and refocused on priority markets with attractive audiences that offer the best opportunity for growth.
"Success in driving our national display advertising business in 2015 and the rollout of our local display advertising sales force initiative gives me confidence for the future despite the fact that the market remains difficult."
The company stated that this year it would "focus on and invest in our primary brands, operating in growth markets with attractive audiences".
Johnston added: "We have identified a number of newsbrands that are now considered non-core and such will be either divested or run with less costs, reflecting the medium-term outlook for the identified assets that fall into this category.
"The company will run a formal process, with advisers, to market defined asset groups for sale during 2016. Interest by third parties, enquiring about assets, has been encouraging so far."
