[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray says he will face an opponent not afraid to take risks when he plays Lukas Rosol in the first round of the US Open.

Murray, 29, is due to play the 31-year-old Czech on Tuesday.
"He's a tough, tough opponent," said Murray. "He's a big strong guy, goes for his shots, takes a lot of risks.
"He's caused upsets in the Slams before. Everyone will probably remember him beating Rafa [Nadal] at Wimbledon a few years ago."
Murray, the second seed, repeated his stance that there is no ill feeling between him and Rosol after a dispute in Munich last year.
"First of all, he shoulder-barged me at the change of ends, which I wasn't happy with it and I let him know that the next point and that was it," Murray explained.
"We chatted after the match in the locker room and it was fine.
"I've always actually got on fine with him."
Having claimed a second successive Olympic gold medal at the Rio 2016 Games, Murray was straight back into competition at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Marin Cilic in the final last weekend.
"I didn't get to see loads [of the Olympics] because I was obviously playing in Cincinnati but for me seeing Andrew Butchart run so well [sixth in the 1500m] was really nice," he said.
"He's someone that my family knows well. I've had Christmas dinners with him. He did great and that was nice for me to watch."
