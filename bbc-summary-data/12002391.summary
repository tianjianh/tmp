[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a night out meant Lee Harris took the Tube to work with his girlfriend Samantha Badham on the morning of 7 July 2005.

The architect left his bike at home, mindful of a site meeting in Heathrow later that day and plans to meet up after work with his partner and four friends for dinner in London's Soho district.
Ms Badham left her car at home and the couple travelled together on the Underground that morning, from their home in Tottenham.
The Tube train exploded near Russell Square, leaving Mr Harris partially trapped under the train.
The 30-year-old was taken to the Royal Free Hospital with serious head injuries and was in a coma for eight days.
He died on 15 July 2005, a day before his girlfriend's body was recovered from the wreckage of the mangled train.
At the inquest five years on, medics recounted finding the couple lying next to each other on the tracks, in severe pain and with their legs twisted and entwined with each other.
Lee Harris grew up in Westfields, Hereford, and went to Holmer Primary School and Whitecross High School.
He followed Ms Badham to Hereford Sixth Form College, but he was about five years younger and they did not meet until 1991.
Their romance began at Hereford Lads' Club when he was preparing for his Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award and she was on the club's committee.
At the inquests into their deaths, his mother, Lynne Harris, said in a statement: "Lee and Sammy were always together.
"As far as their future was concerned, it was to be together and to get married and have children."
Ms Badham followed Mr Harris to London after he decided to take up a university place in the city. They shared a flat in Crouch Hill, north London.
She got a job as a web content designer for SPSS Limited, while Mr Harris studied first at the University of North London, then Bartlett University, where he continued his architecture studies.
The hard work paid off when he got his dream job at Reid Architecture, where he worked until his death.
Away from work, the couple loved to go walking in Wales and would spend time in Ms Badham's hometown of Ledbury, in Herefordshire, restoring a property she owned there.
Mr Harris, at 6ft 4in, would work on the plans, drawings and the heavy work. But Ms Badham, more than a foot shorter, would do just as much.
Tennis, squash, pool and cricket were all interests of Mr Harris's and he particularly liked food - Ms Badham was a great cook.
Mr Harris's parents, Lynne and Brian, said at the inquest: "As a family, our lights have gone out. We miss him so much it hurts.
"Our son and daughter have been taken away and to know how much they suffered is unbearable.
"But to have loved them so deeply, we know what they would say. They would say: 'You have to keep going.' So we do, but it is so very hard."
During evidence given at the inquest, Mrs Harris listened intently as her son's harrowing ordeal was described in court.
Later, she broke down in tears as she thanked paramedics for their work.
"To relive it now, what they did then, is just a nightmare for them. It's bad enough for us but for them, they've got it in their heads," she said.
A joint funeral service was held at St Michael's Church in Ledbury on 5 August 2005, with two hearses driven side-by-side to and from the church.
Their families made the trip to London to visit the site where the couple were last together. Relatives hugged each other as they bade a silent farewell in Russell Square.
A former schoolfriend, Lisa Merrick, 31, from Hereford, was on the same train as the couple, two carriages behind them, and survived.
