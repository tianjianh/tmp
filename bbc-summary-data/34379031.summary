[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said a number of pupils may have witnessed the man being shot as he collected a child from St Helen's Primary in Bishopbriggs on Thursday.
East Dunbartonshire Council said help would be provided to pupils who wanted it after they returned from the September weekend break on Tuesday.
A 33-year-old man was injured in the shooting. Police inquiries are ongoing.
Armed officers were called to the scene of the shooting, which happened in Dornoch Place at about 15:10, as pupils were leaving at the end of the school day.
Police said the gunman approached the victim, shot him and then ran off towards Ronaldsay Drive.
The suspect was holding a silver-coloured gun and wearing a high-visibility reflective yellow jacket with the hood pulled up.
He was described as being in his mid-40s, between 5ft 10in and 6ft tall and of heavy build.
Detectives said they were following a number of lines of inquiry.
They were keen to hear from anyone with information about a burnt-out grey Volkswagen Golf - registration FR12 PYB - found nearby in Wood Lane which is believed to have been involved in the incident. It was reported stolen in March.
