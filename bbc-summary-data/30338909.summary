[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's former champion jump jockey Davy Russell and fellow rider Philip Enright have been given five-day bans after a whip incident at Clonmel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Russell lost his whip in the Powerstown Handicap Hurdle and took Enright's stick before the final straight.
The stewards found that both riders had breached Rule 272, which is related to bringing racing into disrepute.
"I never set out to do this, it wasn't premeditated. The suspension has come as a bit of a shock," said Russell.
Russell was riding favourite Leave At Dawn, with Enright on Backinyourbox. Both horses finished well down the field.
The pair will are banned from racing on 20 and 21 December, as well as the action from 26-28 December, which includes big festive meetings.
