Pakistan are set to host top-level cricket for the first time since the 2009 gun attack on the Sri Lanka team bus, with Zimbabwe lined up to tour.

Since the militant attack, which killed six policeman and a driver, Pakistan have played most of their 'home' matches in the United Arab Emirates.
Pakistan Cricket Board president Shaharyar Khan expects Zimbabwe to play in Lahore and Karachi in mid-May.
He added that Zimbabwe will assess security before confirming the matches.
Khan said his Zimbabwe counterpart, Wilson Manase, had explained the plans during a meeting of the International Cricket Council in Dubai last week.
"He told me they are coming with their full team, but for a week," said Khan.
If the tour goes ahead, Zimbabwe will be the first Test-playing nation to return to Pakistan, although Afghanistan and Kenya - neither of whom have Test status - have toured the country since the attack on low-profile series.
