A candlelit vigil is to be held for a girl who was fatally injured when a bouncy castle blew away as she played on it.

Summer Grant, seven, from Norwich, died in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March.
Her family said the messages of support they received had been "overwhelming" and thanked the public for donations.
On Saturday, a two-minute silence will be held at the gates of Harlow Town Park, where Summer was injured, and her favourite song will be played.

It is believed a strong gust of wind swept the dome-shaped inflatable she was playing on 150m (492ft) across the park, on 26 March.
Paramedics were called but Summer later died in hospital after suffering multiple injuries.
Two people, a 24-year-old woman and a man, 27, were later arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence and bailed until May, Essex Police said.
Dozens of teddy bears, flowers and other tributes to Summer have been left at the gates of the park.
An event is also taking place at 13:00 BST at the Harvey Centre in Harlow, to raise money for a bench and plaque in Summer's memory.
A crowdfunding page set up the day after her death has so far raised almost Â£8,800.
A comment thought to be left by Summer's father, Lee Grant, said the money raised on the page would be used to "give my beautiful daughter the send off she deserves".
The vigil will take place on Saturday from 20:00 BST.
