[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman's dying wish to see art gallery granted by Dutch charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman with terminal cancer has been given the chance to visit a museum in Amsterdam for the final time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed patient was taken to the Rijksmuseum in the Netherland's capital, where she visited an exhibition on Rembrandt.
Stichting Ambulance Wens, the charity which helped her, shared an image on Twitter of her in a bed in front of a self-portrait of the artist.
That day a total of four people were helped to fulfil their final wishes.
Two others also wanted to see the Rembrandt exhibition, while one wanted to go sailing.
Stichting Ambulance Wens [Amsterdam Wish Foundation] says it has helped nearly 6,000 people since it was launched in 2007.
It typically helps people who have become immobile because of their illness.
Wim Pijbes, director general of the Rijksmuseum, said: "Ever since its opening in 2013 The Rijksmuseum has welcomed and accommodated the Last Wish Foundation.
"We give our full support to this extraordinary initiative, and have great admiration for everyone concerned in these very special moments."
Opened in February by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, the Late Rembrandt exhibition includes more than 100 works painted by the artist between 1651 and his death in 1669.
The picture the woman is shown looking at is called Self-Portrait with Two Circles and was painted in around 1660.
It is generally considered to be a masterpiece of Rembrandt's later years.
