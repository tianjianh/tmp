[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Enver-Marum made it two goals in as many games for The Stones in the 11th minute, despite the hosts making a strong start.
The visitors' hopes of hanging on were dealt a blow just before the break when Jack Evans saw red after bundling Reece Thompson over just outside the box.
But Alex Flisher eased fears of a collapse with a smart finish four minutes after the interval and Jay Saunders' side held firm to see out the win.
North Ferriby have now lost four on the bounce.
