West Dunbartonshire teachers' strike planned for January

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Secondary school teachers in West Dunbartonshire are to hold a one-day strike early in the new year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is over plans to cut the number of principal teachers in schools. The strike is scheduled for 12 January.
If it goes ahead, this will be just the second time teachers in the EIS have gone on strike since the 1980s.
West Dunbartonshire Council plans to cut the number of principal teachers at some schools and replace them with so-called faculty heads.
It said principal teachers who do not get one of the new jobs will have their salaries protected for three years.
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said members had concerns about the faculty system itself and about what it could mean for their workload.
He said: "Members see this largely as a cost cutting exercise rather than something that will benefit educational delivery."
Around 9 out of 10 members who took part in the ballot backed action.
Under the proposed system, one "faculty head" could lead the teachers of a number of different subjects - for example a head of humanities might look after English and History.
The council said the system it is moving to is similar to the one that already exists in many other areas.
A spokesman for the council said: "We respect the ballot result and will continue to work with our teachers and their trade union representatives to reach a resolution.
"We are committed to protecting teacher numbers in West Dunbartonshire and will support our staff in every way possible with the national issue around workload.
"We know that our teachers care just as much as we do about providing a first-class education to the young people of this area. We remain hopeful that our on-going discussions can reassure teaching staff and find a solution that avoids industrial action and its impact on young people."
