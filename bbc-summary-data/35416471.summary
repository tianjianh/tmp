Alternative 'Southern Horizon' flag tops Australia poll

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 64% of Australians surveyed in a new poll want the nation's flag changed.

Participants in the poll were shown six options to replace the current flag and favoured one dubbed "Southern Horizon".
Western Sydney University's Benjamin Jones said New Zealand's flag referendum inspired the study.
He said both the Southern Horizon flag and New Zealand's winning design retained elements of the existing flags, but removed the Union Jack.
The poll comes amid renewed debate over whether Australia should be a republic.
"Several Australian politicians have stated their support for an Australian republic," Mr Jones.
"But certainly no prominent politician is tying their reputation to changing the flag."
All but one of of Australia's state and territory leaders signed a document in support of dropping the Queen as head of state.
Critics said republicans were yet to propose a viable alternative to Australia's current system of constitutional monarchy.
