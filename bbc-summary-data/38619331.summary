[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cian Bolger's last-gasp goal gave Fleetwood victory at League One's bottom club Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender powered home a bullet header from a corner with just a minute of normal time left to seal a victory which lifts Fleetwood up to fourth in the table.
Struggling Coventry could have few complaints as they were outplayed for most of the game.
Ashley Hunter could well have put the visitors in front in only the seventh minute when he pulled a fine save out of goalkeeper Lee Burge with a low, angled shot.
Bobby Grant also saw a first-half effort deflected just wide as it seemed to be heading goalwards, while Coventry's best chance of the opening 45 minutes came when Andy Rose's mishit cross threatened to creep in under the crossbar.
Coventry had the best chance of the game in the 50th minute when Callum Reilly's header from a Ryan Haynes cross hit the post with keeper Alex Cairns beaten.
Fleetwood boss Uwe Rosler rang the changes as a win looked to be slipping from their grasp - but Bolger helped keep up their promotion push at the death.
