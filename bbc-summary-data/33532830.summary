[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stowaway believed to have clung to a plane before falling to his death remains unidentified almost a month later, the Met has said.

Believed to have hidden on a British Airways flight from Johannesburg to Heathrow, he was found on the roof of notonthehighstreet.com's headquarters on Kew Road, Richmond, on 18 June.
Police said a post-mortem examination found he died from multiple injuries.
A second stowaway found on the plane remains in a "critical condition".
Scotland Yard said efforts to identify the deceased were "ongoing", while it was waiting to speak to the second man, a 24-year-old, found in the undercarriage of the plane.
It said it was yet to determine whether the two cases were linked.
British Airways has said it was working with the authorities to "establish the facts surrounding this very rare case".
The 5,600-mile journey (9,012km) from Johannesburg to the UK usually takes about 11 hours.
There have been other cases where stowaways have fallen to their deaths after smuggling themselves onto planes and hiding in landing gear.
In September 2012, Jose Matada, 26, was found dead after falling from the undercarriage of a flight from Angola to Heathrow on to a street in Mortlake, west London.
An inquest heard he may have survived freezing temperatures of up to minus 60C (-76F) for most of the 12-hour flight, but it was believed he was "dead or nearly dead" by the time he hit the ground.
