A second snake has been at the side of a country lane - 24 hours after a boa constrictor was captured in the same area.

Police said the Burmese python was found by a member of the public at about 18:20 BST in the middle of Wilton Lane, Guisborough, Teesside.
About 8ft (2.4m) long, it is believed it was abandoned by its owner. The snake was collected by vets.
Officers said there is no suggestion any more snakes are loose.
But Cleveland Police said if any are found they should not be disturbed.
On Thursday, the boa constrictor was taken in by experts at an endangered species centre near Redcar.
