NI students call for halt to higher education cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Students in Northern Ireland are calling on the government to put an end to higher and further education cuts.

Members of the National Union of Students (NUS-USI) are holding their annual conference in Templepatrick, County Antrim, on Tuesday.
Ahead of the conference, the NUS president Rebecca Hall said continued budget cuts would create a "lost generation" of students in the future.
She also called on the government to lower the voting age to 16.
The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), which is responsible for higher education funding in Northern Ireland, is facing cuts of Â£82m or 10.8% from its annual spending.
"This is arguably the first generation that could have worse prospects than their parents," Ms Hall said.
"They could have less education opportunities, they have worse job prospects, lower pay and higher living costs than their parents.
"Many in this generation also feel they have to leave Northern Ireland. They could become a lost generation if government does not act to address these deeply damaging issues."
In 2012, the Stormont assembly backed a motion calling on the voting age to be reduced to 16.
However, electoral policy is not devolved and remains the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office (NIO).
Ms Hall said students aged 16 and 17 deserved a chance to vote on issues affecting further education.
"Many further education students cannot have a say on the cuts that will have such a massive impact on their educational lives," she said.
"Sixteen-year-olds pay tax to the government so why should they not have a say on how their taxes are spent?"
