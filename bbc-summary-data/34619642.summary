[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barcelona 3-1 Eibar

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick as 10-man Barcelona came from behind to beat Eibar and keep pace with Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Borja Baston gave the visitors a shock early lead with Eibar's first ever goal against Barca.
Suarez headed the hosts level before half-time and fired them ahead early in the second half.
Javier Mascherano was sent off for dissent but Suarez scored again to put Barca level with leaders Real.
Barca made the worst possible start, as the injured Lionel Messi watched from the stands.
Their defence was easily sliced open, and although Keko was denied by Claudio Bravo, the loose ball ran to Baston to fire home in the 10th minute.
It is the seventh consecutive La Liga game where they have failed to keep a clean sheet.
Suarez levelled 11 minutes later with his side's first effort on target, the Uruguayan heading home unchallenged from close range after Neymar and Sandro combined.
Eibar held out until the break, but the pressure told two minutes after the restart as Barca took the lead.
Moments after the visitors missed a chance to go back in front, Suarez drilled home a shot from just inside the area after Neymar's pass.
Mascherano's straight red card offered Eibar late hope.
But Suarez claimed a sublime third to put the result beyond doubt, controlling with his chest to bring the ball down and drill home from just inside the area.
Barcelona boss Luis Enrique: "We know the importance of Luis. What he gives you is invaluable, non-negotiable. If he then finishes in the area, that's great. He's essential and irreplaceable.
On Javier Mascherano's red card: "It would be terrible to lose him for several games, but they should look at whether these expressions are spoken into air or with eye contact."
