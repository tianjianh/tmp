The 30-year-old has not been selected by Vern Cotter since Irish were relegated from the Premiership in May.
"I love playing for Scotland. It's one of my proudest moments and I want to continue," the former Cornish Pirates man told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"The way I feel at the moment I can definitely see a few more of my top years in front of me."
New Zealand-born Cowan has won 17 caps for Scotland, for whom he qualifies to play through his Argyll-born mother.
Cowan, who last played for Scotland as a replacement against Wales in the Six Nations in February, says he feels reborn under London Irish's new coaching team led by Brendan Venter and Nick Kennedy.
"At the end of the season my body was really struggling," added Cowan, whose career in England began with the Pirates in 2009
"You start asking yourself questions about where you are career-wise and where you want to head.
"But the new staff we have in charge have done an excellent job in rejuvenating the likes of myself, getting my body exactly where I want it to be and I'm really enjoying my rugby."
