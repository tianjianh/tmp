[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leaders of the Republic of Ireland's two main political parties for taoiseach have been rejected for the third time.

Acting taoiseach, Fine Gael's Enda Kenny, was rejected with 52 voting for and 77  against.
His rival, Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin, was defeated with 43 votes in favour and 91 against.
It is the third time TDs (members of the Irish parliament) have voted for a new leader.
Following February's election, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
But no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have failed to elect a leader on two previous occasions.
Following the second vote, Fianna Fáil, rejected an offer of a partnership government with its rivals, Fine Gael.
Caretaker Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said Fianna Fáil's refusal of the offer was a "serious mistake".
The Fine Gael leader claimed the rejection was "driven by narrow party interests rather than the national interest".
However, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told a press conference "the best interests of the Irish people are not served by a government made up of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael".
Sinn Féin is the third largest party with 23 seats, the Labour Party has seven TDs while smaller parties and independents make up the other 34 seats.
