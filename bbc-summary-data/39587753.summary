Nixon, 38, took over as interim boss in December following the departure of Niall Currie and has steered the club to safety in the Irish Premiership.
Ards have lost just one of their last six league games and are up to eighth place, one point behind Dungannon.
"My aim is to stabilise Ards status as a Premiership club," he told BBC Sport NI.
"I want to thank the chairman and board of directors for showing faith in me."
Nixon made a record 792 appearances for Glentoran and is a Uefa A Licence holder.
He was appointed as Ards' Academy head coach in 2015 and was manager of Harland & Wolff Welders U20s before replacing Currie at Ards.
Nixon's in-form side is away to struggling Carrick Rangers on Saturday.
"Since arriving at the club Colin has really impressed the board with his training sessions, fitness work, preparations, eye for detail and his interest in our Academy and Under 20s team," said Ards chairman Brian Adams.
"The board were, therefore, unanimous in their decision to make Colin's position permanent.
"I am delighted that Colin has agreed to take the job and I am hopeful he can take us forward.
"We're an ambitious club and Colin is an ambitious manager, so it's a perfect fit."
