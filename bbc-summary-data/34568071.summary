Organisers of the Indian Premier League are inviting bids for new teams following the suspension of Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for the next two editions.

Both teams were found guilty in an illegal betting and match-fixing probe in July, leaving just six franchises in the world's richest Twenty20 league.
Meanwhile, organisers also revealed a new title sponsor for the IPL.
Chinese phone manufacturer Vivo Mobiles will replace PepsiCo.
England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan has previously played in the IPL, which attracts the best players in the world and is usually played in April and May each year since its inception in 2008.
However, it has been mired in controversy in recent years with Royals co-owner Raj Kundra and Gurunath Meiyappan of Super Kings suspended from all cricket-related activities for life over the summer.
Chennai Super Kings were led by India skipper MS Dhoni, while the Royals were led by the Australian captain Steve Smith.
Chennai have reached four finals, winning in 2010 and 2011. The Royals won the inaugural tournament in 2008.
