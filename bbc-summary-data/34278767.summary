The event is tied in with a new film about the achievements under Brian Clough and his assistant Peter Taylor.
Staged at Nottingham Contemporary gallery, City of Miracles: Stories from the Crowd explores the impact the victories had on fans and the city.
Players' shirts, medals and other memorabilia as well as supporters' own pictures, have gone on display.
Clough's son Nigel, who played for his father at Forest, said: "He would have been extremely pleased that the achievements were being recognised [at the gallery].
"He would have probably wanted to have been in it a bit more, apart from that he would have liked it."
Wendy Dickinson, daughter of Taylor, said: "I was speaking to Nigel and Simon Clough [Brian's eldest son] and I was saying to them when are we going to stop talking about Dad and Brian?
"And all of us said 'hopefully never'."
The gallery has been projecting more than 150 fans' photos of their journeys to watch Forest in the European Cup final victories in Munich and Madrid.
Footage showing life in Nottingham in the 1970s will also be screened showing scenes from the Goose Fair, the city's factories and trade union marches.
Forest fan Andy Hallam, who has helped to compile the exhibits, said: "It's been like reliving and replaying our lives.
"It's been absolutely fantastic the things that we got [for the exhibition] everything from handkerchiefs to a beautiful hip flask."
The film I Believe in Miracles, made by Jonny Owen, will be premiered at the City Ground in October.
The Nottingham Contemporary exhibition is on until Monday.
