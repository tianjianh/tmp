[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Murali Vijay struck an impressive century as India put themselves in a commanding position on day one of the second Test against Australia.

The 30-year-old batsman scored 144 as India reached 311-4 at stumps after winning the toss at the Gabba.
Australia endured a difficult day in Steve Smith's first Test as stand-in captain for the injured Michael Clarke.
In stifling heat Smith used eight bowlers as injury and fatigue took its toll on the Australia attack.
Mitchell Marsh pulled up with a hamstring injury, Mitchell Starc and debutant Josh Hazlewood left the field with exhaustion and Mitchell Johnson bowled through a hip problem.
Opener Vijay's hundred continued his fine start to the four-match series, with scores of 53 and 99 in India's 48-run defeat in the first Test.
Vijay was put down by Shaun Marsh on 36 and 102, both off left-arm pace bowler Johnson, before he was caught behind off spinner Nathan Lyon late in the day.
Mitchell Marsh struck first when he removed opener Shikhar Dhawan, his maiden Test wicket.
Hazlewood, the pick of the Australia attack, had Cheteshwar Pujara controversially caught off the grille of his helmet, then found Virat Kohli's edge as he tried to cut, leaving India 137-3.
But Vijay dominated a weary attack as he and Ajinkya Rahane shared a 124-run stand for the fourth wicket.
Rahane and Rohit Sharma will resume on day two on 75 and 26 respectively.
