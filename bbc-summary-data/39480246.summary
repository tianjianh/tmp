Wigan man stabbed wife 'after affair revealed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man stabbed his wife to death the day after discovering she was having an affair with a friend, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Gallear, 51, told police he "lost it" and attacked his 42-year-old wife Mandy with a kitchen knife at their home in Hindley, Wigan on 6 October 2016.
She was found on the kitchen floor with three deep wounds to her chest, Manchester Crown Court was told.
Mr Gallear has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder.
Alaric Bassano, prosecuting, said Mrs Gallear became romantically involved with Mark Prescott in 2015 and told a work colleague she wanted to leave her husband but felt unable to do so because of the children.
On 5 October Mr Prescott's stepson told Mr Gallear about the affair.
The next day the 51-year-old told police he walked home and talked "amicably" with his wife.
He told detectives his wife said to him: "Anyway, it's sorted now. We are separating. I love him more than you." He said his memory of what happened next was "blurred".
Mr Bassano told the jury Mr Gallear had "recalled lunging at Mandy, grabbing her by the throat, grabbing the knife from the drawer, pushing her back towards the sink and stabbing her two or three times with the knife."
However, the court heard he "just snapped out of it" when his wife protested saying "What are you doing? I still love you".
In the 999 call played to the jury, Mr Gallear tells the operator: "I have just stabbed my wife. We have had a break-up and I have just lost it."
A post-mortem examination revealed one of the stab wounds was 19cm deep and cut through her sternum.
Mr Bassano said: "The defendant claims he stabbed his wife through a loss of self-control.
"Even if that is true, the Crown rejects any suggestion that the defendant's killing of his wife was anything other than an act of murder."
The trial continues.
