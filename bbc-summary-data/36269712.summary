Belfast: Planners give go-ahead for student housing schemes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planners have recommended that another two student housing schemes in Belfast should be given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are a 317-unit development in the Athletic Stores building on Queen Street and an 11-storey, 380-unit development on Little Patrick Street.
The Athletic Stores scheme will involve retaining the building's facade and demolishing and rebuilding behind it.
The Ulster Architectural and Heritage Society had objected to the scheme.
It said a facade retention approach should only be used as a "last resort".
However, the planners said that "on balance" the approach was appropriate and would not cause harm to the area's overall character or appearance.
Belfast City Council's planning committee is due to make a decision on the applications at a meeting on Tuesday.
A series of major student schemes, mainly close to Ulster University's Belfast campus, have been given planning consent in recent months.
