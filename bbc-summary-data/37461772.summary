Portadown manager Pat McGibbon has informed striker Mark McAllister and midfielder Sean Mackle that they are no longer part of his first-team plans.

Both players are set to be made available to other clubs in the January transfer window.
The move to drop two of the club's more experienced players is understood to have been made with the full backing of the Shamrock Park directors.
McAllister and Mackle will both become free agents in the summer.
Mackle is one of the longest-serving players on the books at Portadown, having joined the club in 2009.
"Both have been told they are no longer in my first-team plans and the club will listen to offers for Mark and Sean ahead of the January window," McGibbon told the News Letter.
"I do not want to get into specifics but a decision had to be made. I have made the call for what I consider the best interests of the team and club."
Portadown started the Irish Premiership season with a 12-point deduction imposed by the Irish Football Association and have won just two of their opening seven fixtures ahead of Saturday's visit of Cliftonville.
The club's appeal against their points penalty and a suspension from all football-related activity is scheduled to be heard on Monday 3 October.
