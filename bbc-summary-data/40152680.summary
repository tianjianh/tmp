Yusuf Sonko, from Toxteth, was found on Tagus Street, Toxteth, at about 20:30 BST on Friday.
He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination found he died from a single gunshot wound to the head.
His family said "his cheeky smile and charisma could light up any room".
They said Yusuf was "kind, loving, and intelligent. His memory will live on in our hearts forever."
Det Ch Supt Paul Richardson said detectives are "out to establish any potential motive".
Det Ch Supt Paul Richardson said CCTV footage from the area will be examined but "someone somewhere knows who has done this and I ask them to search their conscience and do the right thing and give us the information".
The shooting follows two gun attacks in Seaforth and Fazakerley where two men were hurt in "linked" attacks in their homes.
Mr Richardson said the attacks "clearly show that organised criminals still have ready access to firearms despite extensive work undertaken by Merseyside Police".
