St Andrews student poisons fellow American's drink

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A St Andrews University student left a man temporarily blind after poisoning his drink with a solvent used in paint and anti-freeze, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Hilton, now 24, admitted spiking a bottle of wine with methanol and encouraged fellow US student Robert Forbes to drink it on the night of a ball at the university on 5 March 2011.
Mr Forbes, also 24, later experienced extreme lethargy, headaches, confusion and temporary loss of vision.
Hilton will be sentenced on 17 July.
He admitted a charge of assaulting Mr Forbes to his severe injury, permanent impairment and to the danger of his life.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that without treatment, the poison in Mr Forbes' system would have had "life-threatening consequences".
The court heard how the victim was given whisky in hospital to help counter the effects of the toxin.
Hilton appeared in court after being extradited from the US on 7 May.
Judge Lord Burns told him his crime was one of the "utmost seriousness" as he deferred sentencing.
The court heard that Hilton was in his second year studying economics and computing at St Andrews at the time of the incident.
Mr Forbes, described as a "sociable young man", was a year below, studying economics, history and philosophy.
They were both part of the same large social group, living at the university's New Hall halls of residence.
Hilton, from Princeton, near Boston in Massachusetts, left St Andrews and the country shortly after the incident.
The court heard that the night of the ball, Mr Forbes began the evening having drinks with his friends in his room and was later joined by Hilton.
Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC told the court: "The accused brought two bottles of red wine with him. He handed one of the bottles of wine to Robert Forbes, stating that it was a gift.
"The accused had mixed the wine in this bottle with methanol. At this time, Robert Forbes noticed that the bottle of wine was full, but that the seal on the screw top was broken as if it had already been opened.
"During the time that the friends were within Robert Forbes' room, the accused kept encouraging Robert Forbes to consume the bottle of wine that he had handed him."
The court heard that everyone else in the room noted how "keen" Hilton was for Mr Forbes to drink the wine.
Mr Forbes took two large gulps of the drink and found it had a bitter taste. He later drank more but continued to comment on how "foul tasting" it was.
He then started feeling unwell and sick and fell asleep on the bus to the function. The court heard that his recollection of the rest of the night is "very hazy".
The victim slept for much of the following day, eventually waking on Sunday evening with a severe headache, joint pain and blurred vision. Two days on from that, his sight "deteriorated significantly and he was struggling to see".
Mr Forbes was admitted to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee on 8 March where tests showed he was suffering from the effects of methanol poisoning.
Mr Prentice told the court: "He was then admitted to the renal ward of Ninewells Hospital and was placed under the care of a consultant neurologist. He was then given haemodialysis alcohol treatment in the form of whisky, which stops the methanol being metabolised into its toxic state.
"Robert Forbes required to remain within Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, as an inpatient for another full week in order to receive the necessary treatment."
