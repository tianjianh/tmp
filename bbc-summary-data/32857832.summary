Bride Anita Morrissey-Booth and her groom Alex Morrissey were serenaded during their wedding reception at Knowsley Hall in Liverpool on Friday.
The star said in January he would sing at the weddings of three fans in 2015 - and received thousands of requests.
Mrs Morrissey-Booth, from Hyde in Greater Manchester, said on Twitter that "dreams do come true".
"In 2015 I want to sing at 3 weddings," the singer posted to his 3.7m followers on the social media site earlier this year.
Barlow received thousands of requests after saying he would only pick "huge fans" who "stalk" him on the social networking site.
He performed Take That's 1992 hit "A Million Love Songs" at the latest wedding reception.
