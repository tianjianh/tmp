Daniel McBride, 44, of St Denys Road, Southampton, denies the murder of Majella Lynch, 51.
She was taken to hospital in "terrible pain" on 18 April last year.
She died two days after a full 400ml shampoo bottle was removed from her abdomen.
William Mousley QC, prosecuting at Winchester Crown Court, said the death of Ms Lynch, of St Mary's Road, Southampton, was the result of a "perverted sexual assault" which was impossible for her to cause to herself.
Giving evidence Mr McBride said he argued with his girlfriend on 17 April. She threw Viagra at him as he left and went for a night out with friends.
Under prosecution questioning he admitted he left for Yates's pub in Above Bar Street in Southampton with cocaine, the Viagra and about Â£40 in his pocket.
He said he met a woman who turned down the offer of going back to his home, and he left his friends who went on to another club after 03:30 BST.
When questioned by his defence barrister, Oba Nsugbe QC, he said he woke up at Ms Lynch's flat at about 06:00 having "crashed out".
It was light and he could hear music and voices in the room Majella was in, which he thought was her "mumbling to herself".
He described her as upset, and worried people would come to steal from her, but he left with three cans of Special Brew lager she said he could have.
When later arrested, Mr McBride denied any knowledge of Ms Lynch and said he was not at her flat that night.
"I didn't know what was going on - I knew that I never physically hurt her or touched her," he told the court.
"I was probably the last person to see her alive and I panicked. That's why I lied for a day and a half."
William Mousley QC said: "You lied, and lied, and lied again."
Mr McBride also denied he was a "predator" who was interested in sex with "vulnerable" people.
A list of searches on his mobile phone was read out by the prosecution. The word "brutal" was typed into search engines to access sexual material.
"This is normal pornography on normal pornography sites," Mr McBride said in response. "This isn't illegal porn or violent porn, this is browsing on sites."
He added: "I am a bloke, I look at porn on my phone."
The trial continues.
