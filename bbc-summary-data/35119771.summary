The 32-year-old, who made the last of his 20 international appearances in a one-day international against Sri Lanka in 2013, was the Division Two side's players' player of the year in 2015.
He was Northants' leading Championship wicket-taker with 57 at an average of 27.14, while scoring 391 runs.
Kleinveldt also helped the county finish runners-up in the T20 Blast.
Northants head coach David Ripley told the club website: "Rory will play an important role next season.
"He is respected by the rest of the squad and helped push us over the line in a few games this year and was our leading wicket-taker.
"He was voted as our County Championship player of the year and players' player too which shows just how popular he is in the changing room. We are looking forward to having him back."
