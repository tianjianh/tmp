"Scores" of security staff and cleaners are set to disrupt London's Docklands Light Railway (DLR) service in a 48-hour strike over pay and conditions.

Members of the RMT union, from service company Interserve, will walk out at 05:30 BST on Wednesday for 48 hours.
The RMT said: "It involves safety-critical staff, so we expect to have an impact which will affect the running of the DLR."
Interserve said it had a contingency plan but was "disappointed".
A spokesman for the company said the strike had been called "without exhausting dispute resolution procedures".
The company said: "We will continue to work with the union to try and reach an agreement that is acceptable to everyone and have requested a meeting with the RMT and Acas to try and resolve matters.
"However, the RMT has, so far, failed to respond to our request."
The RMT (Rail, Maritime and Transport union) said it had held "numerous meetings with the company but they continue to duck the key issue" which was centred on its members not receiving pay increases which "maintain the differentials between grades".
General secretary of the union, Mick Cash, said: "It is about time that Interserve woke up and took note. The union will not sit back while core issues on pay and working conditions are left unresolved."
Transport for London is yet to respond to requests for a comment about the planned walk-out.
