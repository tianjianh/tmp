It follows an effort to get people not covered by existing commercial networks access to internet speeds greater than 24mbps (megabits per second).
The UK-wide scheme has passed three million homes and businesses at a rate of 40,000 per week.
Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns said: "The UK government will continue to do all it can to support the rollout."
