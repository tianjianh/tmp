Lancashire tap water: Restrictions lifted in more areas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Advice to boil tap water before drinking it has been lifted in 26,000 more homes in Lancashire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents have had to boil water for more than three weeks after a parasite was discovered at a treatment works.
Customers in North Blackpool, Cleveleys and Fleetwood are the latest to be given the all clear from water firm United Utilities.
Some 300,000 homes were initially affected, two thirds of which can now use water as normal.
Action was taken after the microbial parasite cryptosporidium was found near Preston on 6 August.
The water firm said it hoped to lift restrictions for the majority of remaining customers by the end of the week.
Customers can check which areas have had restrictions lifted by visiting the United Utilities website or calling 0800 912 7241.
Water has been treated with ultra violet (UV) light to kill the parasite, which can cause diarrhoea and cramps.
