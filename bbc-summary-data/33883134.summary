[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norman Cornish's home to be rebuilt at Beamish Museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former home of "Pitman painter" Norman Cornish is set to be rebuilt at a County Durham museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The artist, known for his paintings of the industrial North East, lived at the house at 33 Bishop's Close Street, Spennymoor, both as a child and later with his wife and children.
Now the 1950s house is to be replicated at Beamish Museum's new Â£17m 1950s town and farm, along with Cornish's studio.
The museum said it was "honoured" to be recreating pieces of history.
Cornish started working in the mines when he was 14, but he was also sketching and painting and attended the Pitman's Academy for artists at the Spennymoor Settlement.
He left the pits in 1966 due to a back condition and became a full-time artist.
The Cornish family lived in Bishop's Close Street until 1967 when they moved to Whitworth Terrace in Spennymoor where they lived for the rest of their lives.
The museum said the replica building would tell the story of the painter and his family, as well as life in the town and the Spennymoor Settlement.
The settlement was set up in 1930, giving mining families access to the arts and Cornish was one of its most famous students.
It became known as the Pitman's Academy because its clubs nurtured the talents of people such as writer Sid Chaplin and artist Tom McGuinness.
Before his death at the age of 94 in August 2014, Cornish arranged for the contents of his studio, including some unfinished work, and some furniture from his home to be donated to the museum.
The collection includes almost 100 unfinished paintings, dozens of sketches and Mr Cornish's chair and paint-stained carpet.
Remaking Beamish project officer Lisa Peacock, said: "We're delighted to be sharing the story of Norman Cornish and the Spennymoor Settlement in our planned 1950s Town.
"We're honoured to have received these amazing pieces of history from the studio and home of Norman, who so skilfully captured everyday life in the North East."
