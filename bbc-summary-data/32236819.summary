The show's creator, Ryan Murphy, tweeted the announcement saying: "Kathy Bates is running the Hotel. â€ª#AHSSeason5."
It's unclear exactly what her job will be, but it sounds like she'll be in charge of the hotel.
The 66-year-old actress played lead roles in previous seasons American Horror Story: Coven and American Horror Show: Freak Show.
Chloe Sevigny, Lady Gaga, Wes Bentley, Matt Bomer and Cheyenne Jackson all have parts in the fifth series.
Kathy Bates played a bearded lady, Ethel Darling in Freak Show and won an Emmy for her role in Coven playing Madame Delphine Lalaurie.
The actress is arguably best known for her role as a psychopathic nurse in Misery in 1990 for which she won the best actress Academy Award and a Golden Globe.
She later received two more Oscar nominations for 1998's Primary Colors and 2002's About Schmidt.
Filming for AHS: Hotel is expected to begin in the next few months with the premiere in October.
