Lex Autolease is shutting down its retail sites in Old Church Road, Coventry and Churchbridge in Oldbury, Sandwell.
This puts 98 jobs at the showrooms at risk. Another 29 jobs are being transferred to British Car Auctions.
The company said the move is in line with its expansion plans.
Lex Autolease was created in 2009 when Lex Vehicle Leasing, owned by HBOS, merged with Lloyds TSB Autolease.
A spokesperson from the company said: "We have taken the decision to close our retail sites in Coventry and Oldbury, and to outsource the remaining elements of our vehicle remarketing operation within Lex Autolease to BCA.
"This follows extensive work to consider future options for our vehicle remarketing activities, and supports our strategic aim to focus on growing our vehicle leasing business."
