Dropping Elis-Thomas would be 'party decision', says Wood

Leanne Wood has said dropping Dafydd Elis-Thomas as a Plaid Cymru candidate is a decision for the party, not her.

The party's leader confirmed talks were underway about how to respond to criticism he made of Plaid's general election campaign.
He said Plaid spent too much time talking about Scotland and failed to convince voters to switch from Labour.
Ms Wood said Plaid needed a "united front" if it was going to be successful at next year's assembly elections.
She told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme: "I would expect, and all of those candidates would expect, none of our number would undermined that collective work.
"So there's discussions on going about this, but certainly if we are to be successful in presenting ourselves as a successful government in waiting ahead of next year's election then we need to present ourselves as a united front."
Asked whether he would be de-selected, she added: "I am not judge and juror and executioner. I'm the party leader and these matters are for the party."
It was "no secret" that she and Lord Elis-Thomas had disagreed, but Plaid members had "plenty of opportunity" to debate the party's policies and strategy, she said.
Lord Elis-Thomas - the AM for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and former leader - is understood to have angered some in his party with his comments.
