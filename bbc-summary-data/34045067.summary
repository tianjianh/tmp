Teens on trial over Bathgate double murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers have gone on trial charged with carrying out a double murder in West Lothian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Erskine and Andrew Moran, both 19, are alleged to have killed 65-year-old Harry Reekie in Lothian Street, Bathgate, on 16 September last year.
They are also accused of murdering Steven Mitchell, 31, in the town's Marmion Road on either 16 or 17 September.
They both denied the charges at the High Court in Glasgow.
The trial heard that Mr Reekie's upstairs neighbour George Campbell had called the emergency services after being woken by shouts for help.
Mr Campbell said Mr Reekie had previously told him he had stomach problems so he initially thought that was what was wrong.
When he went to help, Mr Campbell said he could not open Mr Reekie's door but saw the kitchen window was wide open, which he thought was strange.
Mr Campbell said he could see Mr Reekie sitting in a chair facing towards the television. He was holding his body and neck and his top and shorts were "saturated in blood".
The witness said: "I was shocked when he said he was stabbed."
Asked to describe how Mr Reekie was, he said: "Very weak, if he had stood up he would have collapsed because he had lost so much blood."
The court heard that Mr Reekie was saying "hurry up" and groaning as they waited for paramedics to arrive.
Mr Reekie was taken to hospital, where he remained until he died in January.
Shortly after being admitted to hospital he was visited by Mr Campbell, who said he had given him some more information about the incident.
Mr Campbell told the jury: "He didn't say who did it, he just said there was a thin one and a heavy built guy. He said he could have taken the thin guy on but he couldn't have taken the heavy guy, but no names were mentioned."
Paramedic Kenneth Bonner told the court Mr Reekie said "two young laddies" carried out an attack on him.
He said that he saw three stab wounds on Mr Reekie's torso and further wounds on his groin and his left arm.
The paramedic also said that there was "gaffa tape" tight round his neck that Mr Reekie asked him to take off of him, and tape around his right wrist.
Paul Erskine's 46-year-old father, also Paul Erskine, denies attempting to defeat the ends of justice by concealing blood stained clothes and a knife that's claimed to have been used.
The trial continues.
