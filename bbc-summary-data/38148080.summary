[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top police officer mocked a colleague's boob job during an "inappropriate and hurtful" drunken tirade, a disciplinary panel has heard.

Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe branded temporary Supt Sarah Jackson "silly, vain and frivolous" for going under the knife.
The pair, of Greater Manchester Police, were attending a Senior Women In Policing conference at the time.
Ms Sutcliffe admits misconduct but denies gross misconduct.
During an hour-long outburst at Manchester's Hilton Hotel, the misconduct hearing was told, Ms Sutcliffe brought up the subject of Ms Jackson's recent breast enhancement surgery.
She said she "used to respect her but no longer did since she had the boob job".
Ms Sutcliffe went on to say that Ms Jackson was "a laughing stock" among the force's chief officer team and was judged on the size of her breasts, the panel sitting at the force's headquarters heard.
Fiona Barton QC, opening the case for Greater Manchester Police, said Ms Sutcliffe told Ms Jackson she was "unlikely" to be promoted because her "credibility was zero and nobody took her seriously".
"It does not matter how hard you work now because you will always just be known as the girl who had the tit job," she is alleged to have said.
Miss Barton said Ms Sutcliffe pulled her own dress down, exposed her left breast and said: "These are the breasts of someone who has had three children.
"They are ugly but I don't feel the need to pump myself full of silicone to get self-esteem".
The panel heard Ms Sutcliffe made repeated attempts to apologise to Ms Jackson the following day and told her she "deeply regretted" it.
She later said she was "frazzled" and had been drinking too much to cope with stress in her personal and professional life.
John Beggs QC, representing Ms Sutcliffe, said it was "stupid" his client allowed herself to drink too much and had behaved "unkindly" towards Ms Jackson
He read out a statement from Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of GMP, who said: "I have the highest regard for Rebekah's professional abilities.
"She is a gifted individual who has overcome a number of professional challenges ... with a strong principle of social justice and care of victims."
He added, though, that "with every strong leader, she had her weak points and human frailties".
Ms Sutcliffe, who is currently suspended, is accused of discreditable conduct and failing to treat Ms Jackson with respect or courtesy and abusing her position and authority.
Ms Jackson, who has since transferred to Cumbria Constabulary, was not at the hearing.
The hearing continues.
