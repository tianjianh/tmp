[SN]TITLE[SN]
Harry Potter chair sold at auction in the US

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chair that Harry Potter author JK Rowling sat on while writing the first two books has sold in the US for around Â£280,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She had picked up the chair for free in Edinburgh before the books were published, and then had hand-painted them.
The chair has messages written from JK Rowling, including: "O, you may not find me pretty but don't judge on what you see" and "I wrote Harry Potter while sitting on this chair".
The chair also comes with a letter written by the author, saying that the chair hurt her back.
It reads: "I was given four mismatched dining room chairs in 1995 and this was the comfiest one, which is why it ended up stationed permanently in front of my typewriter, supporting me while I typed out Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. My nostalgic side is quite sad to see it go, but my back isn't."
