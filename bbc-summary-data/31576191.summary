[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denbighshire police firearms centre decision reversed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision not to allow North Wales Police to hire out its firearms training centre to gun clubs and government organisations has been reversed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denbighshire councillors previously rejected the application for the range at Craig Y Ddywart quarry at Rhewl.
The decision was based on concerns about site supervision and gun crime.
Councillors agreed it could result in a cost award if its reasons for refusal were found invalid on appeal.
North Wales Police had urged the councillors to reconsider the matter.
A report by officers to the planning committee said: "In defending any appeal against a refusal, it would be necessary to provide a clear evidence that there is a reasonable likelihood of there being an increase in crime in the locality or nationally as a result of the grant of the variation.
"Officers do not consider that there is such evidence to support a refusal."
