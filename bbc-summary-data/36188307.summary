Police in Honduras have arrested four people in connection with the murder of leading indigenous and environmental campaigner Berta Caceres.

Two are said to be linked to the Honduran military.
Ms Caceres was killed in March by gunmen who broke into her house in her home town of La Esperanza.
Her death sparked international condemnation and led to mass protests in Honduras, a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world.
The four suspects have been named as Douglas Bustillo, Mariano Chavez, Sergio Ramon Orellana and Edilson Duarte Meza.
Mr Chavez is a member of the Honduran Armed Forces and Mr Duarte Meza is a former military man, La Prensa newspaper reported.
The four men are "the presumed perpetrators of the crime," says the Prosecutor's Office in a note.
The arrest warrants were issued "based on scientific evidence that support the allegation presented," it adds.
Ms Caceres was killed on 3 March, on the eve of her 45th birthday.
A member of the Lenca indigenous group, she was one of the founders in 1993 of the National Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH).
She successfully campaigned against the construction of a hydroelectric dam that would have flooded large areas where the Lenca lived.
It would also have cut off the supply of water, food and medicine for hundreds of Lenca people.
In 2015, she was awarded the Goldman Prize, one of the most prestigious awards for grassroots environmentalism.
Police initially said that she could have been killed in a robbery that went wrong.
