A suspected suicide bomb attack in the Indonesian capital Jakarta has killed at least three police officers and injured 10 people, police say.

There were two blasts about five minutes apart at about 21:00 local time (14:00 GMT) near a bus station in Kampung Melayu in the east of the city.
Two suspected attackers also died.
Indonesia has seen a series of low-level attacks since last January, when four attackers killed four people in a gun and bomb attack in central Jakarta.
The so-called Islamic State (IS) militant group said they carried out the attack last January, its first in South East Asia.
More recent incidents have also been linked to the group.
However, many of the plots have been botched or foiled, with analysts saying that many of the country's militants lack the capacity to launch large-scale attacks.
