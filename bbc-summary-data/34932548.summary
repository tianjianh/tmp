The outgoing chief inspector of prisons has said there is "no doubt" jails have deteriorated in the five years he has been in the role.

Nick Hardwick said they were "more dangerous" for staff and prisoners and  "less effective" at preparing people for release so they do not reoffend.
He also said he had seen prisoners who were "out of it" from taking legal highs.
The Ministry of Justice said it was investing in and reforming prisons.
Mr Hardwick told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: "The deterioration isn't just bad for prisoners, it's bad for the communities into which they'll return because not enough has been done to stop them committing more crime."
He said the deterioration was due to a combination of issues and the reasons had changed during his time in the role.
"You've got too many prisoners, not enough staff, the men who are there now are more likely to be there for more violent offences, serving longer [sentences].
"And particularly in the past year or two there's been a surge in the availability of drugs, particularly so-called legal highs and that then leads to bullying and debt, and that's created much worse conditions."
He said there were lots of ways the drugs got into prisons, over walls, from prisoners, during visits, or through corrupt staff.
"I was in a prison the other day, and this was quite unusual, there were so many prisoners under the influence that the worst - and it is dangerous, it kills people - they were taking to the hospital, the health centre, but the guys who were less badly affected they were leaving other prisoners to mind and look after," he said.
"I walked round and saw these guys who were obviously out of it."
Mr Hardwick said sometimes there were "simply not enough staff".
"Sometimes I will go on to a wing and want to talk to someone about it and you can't find a member of staff to talk to."
Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Michael Gove announced that Victorian prisons would be closed and replaced with nine new establishments in England and Wales by 2020. Chancellor George Osborne confirmed the closure of Holloway women's prison in London in the Spending Review on Wednesday.
Mr Hardwick said he was encouraged that the government was "finally listening to what we are saying," but that they "had to deliver".
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said prisons needed reform.
"It is only through more effective rehabilitation that we will reduce reoffending, cut crime and improve public safety.
"That is why we are investing in a modern prison estate, where governors are empowered to run prisons in the way they think best, and prisoners are given a chance to work or learn."
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
