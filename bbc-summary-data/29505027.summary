Non-league side Cheadle Town were beaten 22-0 by Russia U19s at the weekend.
So their keeper Stephen Piggott was left with more grazes than usual.
"We thought they'd be a good team. Because Russia is such a big country, obviously it's the best of the best of that age group," he says.
"You could see the quality they had, well organised, fit. They had loads of coaches with them as well so you know they're being well trained.
"We only train twice a week, once a week if we've got a game."
The club tweeted all of the action, including when they won a corner.
"Just to be up the other end of the field I think was a good thing for us, to keep it away from our goal for a bit."
Despite picking the ball out of the net 22 times, Stephen still hopes he impressed.
"I'd like to think I made seven, eight, or nine great saves on Sunday. Hopefully the manager would have seen that and I can get back into the first team.
"Twenty-one out of the 22 goals were pretty much tap-ins for them.
Stephen says the half-time team talk was still positive, despite being 9-0 down.
"Just keep your heads up and keep trying to play football," he says they were told. "We knew they were going to be good and it was just nice to play in a game like that.
"I don't think it was humiliating, I think the side they had out would have given some championship sides a game. I think one of their lads played for Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League."
