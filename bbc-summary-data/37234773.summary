A former police officer who was believed to have been one of the first to arrive at the scene of the murder of two colleagues has been found dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-PC Andrew Summerscales, 46, was found in Cheetham Park, Stalybridge.
PC Nicola Hughes, 23, and PC Fiona Bone, 32, were killed in a gun and grenade attack after being lured to a house in Mottram in September 2012.
Police said there were "no suspicious circumstances" surrounding Mr Summerscales' death on Tuesday.
Mr Summerscales had left Greater Manchester Police's Tameside division last November after 15 years' service.
Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said: "I know that many of his former colleagues hold very fond memories of him."
GMP Neighbourhood Inspector for Radcliffe East, Jim Jones, tweeted: "Words can't describe what PC Andy Summerscales and his colleagues witnessed four years ago and images he's had to live with. RIP #policefamily."
Dale Cregan lured PC Hughes and PC Bone with a bogus call before killing them in a gun and grenade attack in Hattersley. Cregan, who was also convicted of two other murders, was jailed for life without parole in June 2013.
A memorial stone for PC Hughes and PC Bone was unveiled last month at The Hub in Stockport Road, less than a mile away from the scene of the attack.
