Bingham, who won the World Championship in 2015, reached the semi-finals of the 2016 event before being knocked out by eventual winner Ronnie O'Sullivan.
The 39-year-old told BBC Essex he would play in this year's tournament if his wife gives birth before his first-round game against Joe Perry on Monday.
"The only question I'd ask myself is if she actually went on the day," he said.
"Obviously it could happen and even now I still haven't got an answer to that question. I'd have to talk it over with my wife and see where we go."
Bingham, the current world number two, said his wife has been supportive in wanting him to play at the tournament, which gets under way on Sunday.
He continued: "She's had two previous babies and she's been in labour for 10 hours, so obviously if that's the case then I've got a bit of time to 'pot some balls and hurry up' sort of thing.
"As I say, we need to talk the next day or two because we thought it'd be out by now.
"But being the stubborn Little Miss Bingham it's going to be, I think she's a bit too comfortable in my missus' belly."
