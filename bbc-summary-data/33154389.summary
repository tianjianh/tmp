Samantha Jenkins, 19, from Llanelli, fell into a coma and died in 2011.
Her inquest heard she had low mineral levels, which may have been the result of malabsorption caused by chewing gum.
Maria Morgan told BBC's Jason Mohammad programme: "It's something that happens over a period of time - eight or 10 months."
After her death, Mrs Morgan said she found receipts showing Miss Jenkins had been buying chewing gum almost every day.
"The pathologist said it was going down a road he doesn't know enough about, but he said there was enough evidence there to say it was a huge thing that it could be."
Her husband, Wayne Morgan, said they believed Miss Jenkins's death could be linked to sweeteners used in chewing gum.
Colin Phillips, acting senior coroner for Swansea, said the cause of death was a shortage of oxygen to her brain, resulting from a convulsion caused by an imbalance of minerals in her body.
"The chewing gum inside her system did not end her life, but it's a possibility the over consumption of sorbitol and aspartame was the result of all her salts going low and that's what ended her life," said Mrs Morgan.
