David Bowie and Prince are new entries in the latest list of top-earning dead celebrities to be compiled by Forbes.

Prince's pre-tax income from 1 October 2015 to 1 October 2016 is estimated at $25m (£20.5m) by the business magazine, putting him fifth in the list.
Bowie, meanwhile, is ranked at 11th for an estimated income of $10.5m (£8.5m).
Both, however, are dwarfed by pop star Michael Jackson, who tops the list once again with a record-breaking estimated income of $825m (£672.8m).
The figure, said Forbes, was "the most any celebrity has ever earned in a single year" - a result of his half of a music publishing catalogue being sold for $750m (£611m).
Jackson held a 50% stake in Sony ATV Music Publishing - famous for its library of Beatles tunes - as part of a business partnership that began in 1995.
Peanuts creator Charles M Schulz climbs one place on last year's list to second place with estimated 2015-2016 earnings of $48m (£39m).
US golfer Arnold Palmer, who died last month aged 87, enters the chart at three with estimated earnings of $40m (£32.6m).
Bowie died of cancer in January at the age of 69, while Prince was found dead on 21 April at the age of 57.
