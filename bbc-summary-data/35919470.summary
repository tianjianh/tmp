The 34-year-old avoided serious injury after colliding with the Haas of Esteban Gutierrez in Melbourne.
Honda say the power unit was recovered but the engine and surrounding parts were too badly damaged to be salvaged.
McLaren have also confirmed Alonso's seat was damaged in the accident and will be replaced for Bahrain.
Speaking to Motorsport.com, a McLaren spokesman said the Spaniard's seat was "cracked but not broken" in the accident that occurred under braking for Turn Three on lap 17.
Alonso, a three-time winner in Bahrain, is hopeful the switch to the spare chassis will not hinder his chances at the second race of the season.
"We're still pushing to bring upgrades to each race, so providing we can get everything to the car in time we'll be aiming to get as much track time as possible with the new chassis from the start of free practice," said Alonso.
Drivers are allowed five power units over the course of the 21-race season and receive penalties if they exceed that allocation.
