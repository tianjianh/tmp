North Wales Police said it was alerted to the incident at the Pontcysyllte aqueduct near Llangollen just after 01:00 BST on Tuesday.
The force said an 18-year-old man had died and his family had been informed.
Officers asked anyone with information to get in contact but said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.
Details have been passed to the North East Wales coroner John Gittins and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out before an inquest is opened.
Wendy Capelle, waterway manager at the Canal & River Trust, said the charity were carrying out an internal investigation into the tragedy.
She added: "I am deeply upset to learn of this tragic accident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man that fell."
The towpath has now been reopened.
