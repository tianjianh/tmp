The 29-year-old, from Cornwall, started his career at Penryn and has played for Exeter Chiefs and Rotherham, as well as spending time playing in Spain.
"He's impressed us - he is renowned for his work-rate, physicality and passion," said coach Gavin Cattle.
Alex O'Meara and Alex Day have agreed new one-year contracts, with hooker Tom Channon signing for two more seasons.
Wing O'Meara, 24, has spent two years at the Mennaye, while scrum-half Day has played 52 games in his time at the club.
Channon joined from Bristol in 2013 and is three games short of making 100 appearances.
Pirates are sixth in the Championship with two games to go, and now have 19 players confirmed for next term.
