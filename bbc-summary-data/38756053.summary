[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was phoned in his Eyemouth home on Monday by someone claiming to be a police officer.
The caller told him there was a problem with his bank account and that someone would come to his home the following day to collect his bank card.
The pensioner was then visited at 14:15 on Tuesday and his card taken. All his savings were later removed.
The man who went to his door has been described as being in his early 40s, about 5ft 9in with a medium build, clean shaven face and olive-skinned complexion.
He was wearing a black tammy hat, black trousers and spoke with a Scottish accent.
Det Con Barry Mercer said: "The victim has been left devastated at the theft of his savings and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry to identify the culprits.
"If you recognise the description of the male who attended at the man's home, or if you have any information relevant to this investigation then please get in touch.
"While the caller may have sounded extremely convincing I would like to remind the public that neither police, nor banks will contact you by phone to request you hand over your bank card or account details."
He advised anyone receiving a similar call to hang up and contact the police immediately.
