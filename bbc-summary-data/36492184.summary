The parents, aged 24 and 28, from Stoke-on-Trent, were arrested on Tuesday after their son, one, was left in the "stifling" car at Wolstanton Retail Park for more than 30 minutes.
Officers forced the door open as temperatures reached 25C (77F).
The pair have been given conditional cautions for causing harm to the child in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Although the windows of the car were slightly open, the "visibly distressed" boy was taken to hospital with heatstroke and dehydration after being rescued, police said.
A spokesman added: "Conditions of the cautions include both parties agreeing not to commit a further offence, paying a fine and agreeing to co-operate and engage fully with family services and any interventions they deem necessary."
