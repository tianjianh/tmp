[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The world's largest indoor ice climbing facility has been reopened to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ice Factor Kinlochleven has been shut since 29 July last year when an accidental fire broke out in the sauna area of the building.
Nobody was hurt in the incident and the structure of the 120-year-old former Victorian smelter survived.
The clean up has involved melting and removing walls of ice and cleaning thousands of individual handholds.
Jamie Smith, of Ice Factor International, said staff had made a "huge effort" to reopen the site.
Ice Factor Kinlochleven first opened in 2003.
Ice Factor International also owns Snow Factor Braehead on the outskirts of Glasgow.
