Keaton Jennings says England Test failures made him 'better player'

England opener Keaton Jennings believes he is a "better player" following a disappointing series against South Africa which cost him his Test place.

He made only 127 runs in eight innings, at an average of 15.87 and with a best score of 48, as England won 3-1.
His poor form led to the selectors calling up Mark Stoneman to replace him for the first Test against West Indies.
"It was a really good learning experience for me," 25-year-old Jennings told BBC Newcastle.
"It was a tough series, you've got three of the top 12 or 13 bowlers in the world on some pretty tough surfaces.
"I've moved away, I think, a more knowledgeable and better player and I'll definitely be in the nets grafting on my game to try to move myself forward."
Jennings made a promising start to his Test career with a debut century against India in Mumbai in December 2016.
But his technique came under scrutiny during the South Africa series and ex-Proteas captain Graeme Smith said: "If I was a selector I'd be thinking it was time to make a change with the West Indies and then the Ashes coming up."
Left-hander Jennings now faces the task of trying to re-establish himself before the winter tour to Australia, while former Durham team-mate Stoneman, who joined Surrey at the start of the summer, tries to take his opportunity as Alastair Cook's opening partner.
"Mark is a fantastic cricketer so all the best to him and I really hope he does well," said Jennings. "It's an amazing environment to be involved in. He's taught me loads and hopefully he'll really get stuck in.
"Score runs - that's the currency we deal in and that's what I have to do. Durham have got four first-class games remaining and I've got to adjust certain things in myself and score runs. That's a simple fact."
