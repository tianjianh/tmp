Huddersfield beat Reading 4-3 on penalties after a 0-0 draw at Wembley Stadium in Monday's Championship play-off final.
It is the first time the Terriers have been in the top division since 1972.
The parade is due to leave the John Smith's Stadium at 17:40 BST and arrive in St George's Square by 18:20.
Some roads are to be closed in the town from 12:00.

David Wagner and the first team squad are to travel from the stadium via Northumberland Street.
In St George's Square the team are to be presented on a stage to the assembled crowd.
Success in the play-off game will be worth a minimum of £170m to the club and there will be other benefits to the town.
Steven Leigh, of the Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce said: "The cash injection into the football club and the economic benefit to the local economy to the tune of £50m to £60m per annum will be tremendous for local business.
"The global exposure is a unique opportunity for the town to attract inward investment on an extraordinary scale."
Dean Hoyle, Huddersfield Town chairman, said: "When I took over in 2009, it has got harder and harder. Every year we are competing with some real big boys.
"But with an open mind it can be achieved, though I never thought it would be possible. It proves dreams can come true."
The 2017-18 Premier League season - complete with Huddersfield Town - starts on 12 August.
There will be coverage of the victory parade on BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Look North.
