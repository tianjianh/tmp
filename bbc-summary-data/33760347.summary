The last of Glasgow's Red Road flats will be blown up by controlled explosion later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The six remaining high-rise blocks will be brought down in a one-off demolition.
Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) said a single blowdown would be less disruptive to local residents.
An earlier plan to demolish five of the buildings as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in 2014 was abandoned following criticism.
Built in the mid-1960s to tackle the city's housing crisis, the flats were once the tallest residential structures in Europe, providing accommodation for almost 5,000 people.
Initially they were regarded as the answer to Glasgow's housing problem but in later years became rundown and vandalised.
The demolition programme, which changes the city's skyline, is part of GHA's renewal plan.
Two previous demolitions have taken place, in 2012 and 2013.
David Fletcher, director of regeneration for GHA, said: "We're working very closely with our contractor and partners on plans to bring down all six remaining blocks in a single demolition later this year.
"Our contractor is preparing the blocks for demolition with work carried out to stringent health and safety regulations.
"We'll continue to work with members of the local community about arrangements for the day.
"We'd like to thank all of the residents again for their patience and understanding during this important part of the community regeneration project."
GHA said the decision to take all six blocks down in a single demolition was taken following feedback from local residents.
It said development options for the site once it has been cleared were at an early stage and a consultation would be held over the summer.
