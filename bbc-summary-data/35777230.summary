Christian Willoughby posted several pictures from inside the cell after being locked up for what he described as a "misdemeanour".
He said it was the "ideal place for winding down after a hard day" and said he would "definitely come back".
Humberside Police said it was treating the incident as a serious breach of security.
Mr Willoughby's message said: "I've given this place 4 stars. It's the all day breakfast that lets it down really. Apart from that the staff are pleasant enough."
He posted a number of images including pictures of the toilet, window and a meal.
Asked how he had taken the photos he said he used an iPad.
He added: "Room was nice, the minimalistic idea was a nice touch. It was secure and safe. Quadruple glazing and security door. Ideal place for winding down after a hard day. I'd definitely come back."
The force said it was aware of the pictures "apparently of the Grimsby Custody Suite", saying they "appear to have been taken by a prisoner while in custody on Wednesday, 9 March".
Ch Insp James Glansfield said: "We take any such breach of security and detainee safety extremely seriously and will be carrying out a review of our detainee management to identify any lessons learned and prevent further reoccurrences in the future.
"The force's Professional Standards Branch are investigating the circumstances of the incident."
