The British number one, 26, won 6-4 6-1 in only an hour and 14 minutes to reach the quarter-finals in her first grass-court tournament of the year.
Konta, who is ranked eighth in the world, will play 21-year-old Australian Ashleigh Barty in the last eight.
She will be the first home top-10 female player at Wimbledon since 1984.
Konta and Belgium's world number 81 Wickmayer won together in the second round of the doubles on Tuesday, before facing each other in the singles on Wednesday.
Top seed Konta raced into a 4-0 lead in the opening set, Wickmayer pulling one break of serve back before the Briton served out.
Konta also dominated the start of the second set, leading 5-0 before Wickmayer broke her serve, going on to wrap up a comfortable win.
Meanwhile, British number three Naomi Broady moved into the last eight of the Aegon Trophy on her home court in Manchester.
The 27-year-old from Stockport, who is currently ranked 115th in the world, won 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (9-7) against American Maria Sanchez.
She will play top seed Kai-Chen Chang of Chinese Taipei in the quarter-finals.
However, world number two Simona Halep - who lost in Saturday's French Open final to unseeded Latvian Jelena Ostapenko - has pulled out of next week's Aegon Classic in Birmingham with an ankle injury.
It means Broady and fellow Briton Heather Watson will join Konta in the Birmingham draw after being given wildcards.
World number one Angelique Kerber, 2016 French Open winner Garbine Muguruza and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova are also competing at the event which starts on Monday.
