What to do when you're trick or treating

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's almost Halloween and some of you might be heading out to do some trick or treating!

The tradition dates back to the Celtic times, when people thought ghosts and spirits came back to the human world on Samhaim - the old name for Halloween.
By wearing masks and costumes when they left their house, people thought the ghosts wouldn't recognise them.
Nowadays people still dress up in spooky costumes and visit neighbours houses, asking for a "Trick or a Treat".
Here at Newsround we've put together some top tips and advice to help you stay safe and enjoy the spooky tradition!
Make sure a responsible adult or guardian goes with you - it could be an older brother or sister if they're over 16.
Also staying together in a small group is a good idea.
Plan your trick or treat route before you leave the house, and make sure someone else knows where you are going before you leave.
Stay close to home and if possible only visit the houses of people you know - you should NEVER go into a stranger's home alone.
Carry a torch and wear reflective or light-coloured clothing, so you can be seen in the dark.
It is almost November so it is pretty chilly outside, make sure you wrap up warm, and if it is raining, wear waterproof clothing and shoes.
If you are wearing a mask, or a costume that covers your face, make sure you can see where you are going when you are moving to the next house.
Not everyone loves Halloween, if some people don't answer their door, or do not have any sweets, don't worry about it, just give them a smile and try the next house!
Also if you are eating your treats as you go, try to pop things like wrappers in your pocket or a bin.
