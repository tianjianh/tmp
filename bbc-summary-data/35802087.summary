Insp Michael White said the incident began when a driver failed to stop for officers on Belfast's Shankill Road at about 13:00 GMT on Monday.
He said the car was then "pursued by a trained PSNI pursuit driver" before it collided with a police landrover and another vehicle in Salisbury Avenue.
The officers sustained minor injuries.
The injured - two policemen and a policewoman - were in the landrover when the crash happened.
A 35-year-old man who was driving the car was arrested.
