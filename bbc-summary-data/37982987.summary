[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 2-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool benefited from controversial refereeing as goals from Nicky Deverdics and Lewis Alessandra earned them a win over Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools were given a shock penalty, with Mark Hughes subsequently sent off, after an hour with Deverdics scoring the follow-up after Elliot Parish saved Padraig Amond's spot-kick.
And Alessandra added a second in injury time to secure the points.
Accrington dominated the opening period, Billy Kee spurning three golden chances either side of Alessandra forcing a smart stop from Parish.
But the game turned when referee Richard Clark intervened, apparently adjudging Hughes to have pulled back Amond amid Toto Nsiala seeing a header brilliantly saved.
Amond missed the spot-kick but, after Accrington denied two subsequent efforts in a scramble, the ball set up for Deverdics to unfurl a sublime bicycle kick.
Parish then made two fine saves to keep Accrington afloat, and they almost levelled as Paddy Lacey saw a header cleared off the line before Trevor Carson brilliantly denied Romuald Boco.
Stanley's misery was compounded when Alessandra slotted home Amond's fine cross in injury time.
