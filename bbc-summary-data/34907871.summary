The victim was found with fatal injuries in Yoke Close, off North Road, Holloway, at about 20:50 GMT on Monday.
The Met Police said he was declared dead about 30 minutes later. The force said they know his identity and his next of kin have been informed.
In an unconnected stabbing, a 16-year-old boy sustained a leg injury earlier, close to Havering College in Romford.
His injuries are not life threatening.
A man, aged 18, has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and remains in custody.
Police said they were keeping an open mind as to the possible motive for the fatal stabbing and have yet to make an arrest.
The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said the death shows the need for more stop-and-searches to tackle knife crime.
"It's got to be done sensitively, it's got to be done in accordance with the law, but we've got to take knives off the streets," he said.
According to the Met, the number of stop-and-searches in London has fallen by 66% this year.
A spokeswoman said almost one in three of all searches result in the discovery of an illegal object or the detection of a relevant crime.
Home Secretary Theresa May said last year the technique was being misused so frequently that it was damaging relations between the public and police.
George Kinsella's 16-year-old son Ben was stabbed to death in North Road in 2008, close to last night's incident.
"The kids that want to carry knives know that there is a possibility they won't be stopped and searched now, so therefore it is easier to move and carry knives about," Mr Kinsella told BBC Radio London.
Ben Kinsella's sister Brooke tweeted: "Another life lost to knife crime in Islington last night. Someone else's son, someone else's brother. Hard to have hope sometimes."
The Met's spokeswoman said there was "no robust evidence that proves or disproves that the level of stop and search is a factor" in the rise in fatal stabbings.
"However, some communities understandably feel that the fall in stop and search may have reduced the deterrent to carrying knives. We remain fully committed to doing all we can to reduce knife crime, to tackle London's gangs and take more knives and weapons off our streets and this includes use of legal powers such as stop and search. "
Updates on this and more from around London
The families of murder victims marched through central London on Sunday in a protest against knife crime.
Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, said every school in London needed to adopt a programme to teach pupils about the dangers of carrying knives.
"Some schools don't want to engage with a knife crime programme. They think there's a stigma," she said.
A 15-year-old boy has been charged with attempted murder after two pupils were stabbed at a school in Dulwich last week.
