SNH accused of 'vandalism' on Inchtavannach Island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A heritage organisation has been accused of carrying out "wanton vandalism" on an island in Loch Lomond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Natural Heritage is said to have poisoned hundreds of beech trees on Inchtavannach Island.
Luss Estates, which owns the island, said SNH had created a "dead canopy" which would take generations to restore.
SNH admitted it had not appreciated the impact that its programme would have on the landscape of the island.
Luss Estates said SNH had entered into an agreement with the tenant of Inchtavannach to remove rhododendron from the island in 2013.
The agreement also provided for the mature beech trees to be felled gradually over a five year period.
But it said SNH had decided to ring-bark and poison hundreds of the trees, some of which were 300 years old.
Luss said it now feared that the dead trees would shed branches which would be a danger to the many visitors who come to Inchtavannach each year.
Sir Malcolm Colquhoun, the owner of Luss Estates, said he had written a "very strongly worded letter" to the chief executive of SNH calling for an immediate explanation of its actions.
He said: "I am outraged and shocked at this act of wanton vandalism, and the resulting blight on the landscape of Inchtavannach Island.
"It will take years and indeed generations for the canopy to recover and this beautiful view to be restored.
"I simply cannot understand why the supposed guardian of our natural heritage has killed off these wonderful trees for no apparent reason."
Luss Estates has asked SNH to explain why it did not comply with the management agreement to fell the mature beech trees.
It has also asked SNH if it had a felling licence to kill the mature trees from Forestry Commission Scotland, and if not whether the decision to poison them was taken in order to get around the need for a felling licence.
Local community council chairman, Ian MacEachern, said: "To say we are annoyed is an understatement. The mature beech trees on Inchtavannach added greatly to the visual impact of Loch Lomond, for residents and visitors, particularly in the autumn. This act of vandalism is a travesty and tragically cannot be restored in our lifetime."
A spokeswoman for SNH said Inchtavannach was internationally important for its oak woodland, but the condition of the woodland has been affected by a lack of regeneration, a lack of dead wood and the spread of non-native plants.
She added: "We have worked with Luss Estates and the tenant over a number of years to improve the condition of the woodland and our latest five year management agreement with the tenant in August 2013 included measures to remove non-native beech and rhododendron from the island.
"We consulted the estate about this agreement. As this work progressed, we agreed with the tenant and contractor that it would be more cost effective to control the beech by injecting the stems rather than felling.
"We didn't appreciate the impact that this would have on the landscape of the island and we are now in discussion with the estate and tenant regarding felling of the dead trees to reduce this impact."
