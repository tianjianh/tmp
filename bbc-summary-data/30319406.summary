British dance-rock act The Prodigy and US rock duo The Black Keys will co-headline the Friday night of the event.
The news follows the announcement earlier this week that Fleetwood Mac would be closing the festival on Sunday 14 June.
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kings of Leon and Biffy Clyro headlined this year's festival.
Pharrell's track Happy was recently announced as the most-played song on Spotify of 2014.
His recent number one album Girl was named as the second most-played release in the UK on the streaming service.
Speaking to Newsbeat ahead of the announcement of Fleetwood Mac's headline slot, Isle of Wight organiser John Giddings said that the rest of the line-up would include up-and-coming acts.
"It's an eclectic mix of past, present and future bands," he said.
Giddings said he classed The Black Keys as "incredible" and agreed that younger bands have the ability to sell festival tickets as well as older bands.
He said: "I think younger bands of course can do it as well, but the golden age of rock and roll is past."
The organiser said Saturday's headliner would be announced soon.
Tickets for Isle of Wight Festival 2015 go on sale on Friday 5 December at 09:00 GMT
