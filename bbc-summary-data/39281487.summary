Middlesbrough are confident they can retain their Premier League status this season despite dropping into the bottom three, says midfielder Adam Clayton.

Boro lost 2-0 at Stoke City in their last league fixture, their 10th in a row without a win, and were also beaten in the FA Cup by Manchester City.
The Teessiders, who are three points behind Crystal Palace in the table, are at home to Manchester United on Sunday.
"We'll never give up," 28-year-old Clayton told BBC Tees.
"We've been under the cosh a bit recently, from all angles, we'll come out fighting and we need to show that every week now from the end of the season."
Clayton has been a regular in Aitor Karanka's side this season, making 28 appearances.
Speculation surrounding head coach Karanka and his future at the Riverside prompted an upbeat response from the Spaniard about his job security.
And Clayton believes remaining positive is a priority for the players if they are to arrest their slump.
"The flipside of that we have to turn it round, be upbeat, positive, smiley, jokey and get ball the rolling," Clayton added.
"It is tough when you're losing games, but training has been good. If we can keep the confidence up, we can keep the belief and keep going."
