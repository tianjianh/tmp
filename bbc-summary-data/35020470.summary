Ms Black, 21, won the Paisley and Renfrewshire West seat for the SNP in May's general election before completing her MA Hons degree in Politics and Public Affairs.
The youngest MP since the 1832 Reform Act said the award was "a huge honour".
Previous winners include the BBC's Martin Patience, singer Emeli Sande and biologist Karina Atkinson.
Ms Black received the award from the Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, Sir Kenneth Calman, at a Christmas Dinner at Bute Hall.
She said: "Just a few months ago I was in the same position as every other student, frantically trying to pull together my dissertation and make sure I was ready for my last exam.
"So to be receiving an award from my very own university is a huge honour and allows me to reflect on just how much my life has changed in the last few months."
The university's principal and vice-chancellor, Professor Anton Muscatelli, said Ms Black had been "a true ambassador for the University of Glasgow, demonstrating huge commitment to her final year studies at the same time as canvassing for election".
He added: "Students and staff at the University of Glasgow have shown they can change the world - I am certain that Mhairi will make a difference to the lives of others as she strives to combat poverty in her role as an MP.
"I am also sure that she will be an inspirational role model for other young people to engage in the democratic process."
