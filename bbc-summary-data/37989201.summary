The Glassboys, who play at seventh-tier level in the Northern Premier League, put out National League South Whitehawk 3-0 in Monday's first-round replay.
"It's an amazing achievement," long-serving Hackett, 54, told BBC WM.
"We're the most successful club in the country at the level we compete at."
Former Shrewsbury, Aberdeen, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion, Peterborough and Chester winger Hackett has been in charge of his home-town club since 2004.
Stourbridge had never got beyond the qualifying rounds until 2009 and it was a record that Hackett, who made the fifth round as a Shrewsbury player in 1984, was keen to put right.
They have now got to at least the first round five times in eight seasons.
"You don't get lucky," he said. "We've got good players who can handle the big occasion. We really love the FA Cup and the players keep responding.
"We comprehensively deserved to beat Whitehawk. We didn't get lucky. It was an amazing night, a packed house and we've turned up and performed.
"The travelling support we took to Brighton for the first game was tremendous too."
Now they face Northampton Town, whose manager Rob Page was in the crowd at The War Memorial Athletic Ground to watch the meeting of his side's potential second-round opponents.
"They're flying high in League One," added Hackett. "Although we caused an upset on Monday, we know we're going to have to cause an even bigger upset to beat them.
"But anything can happen in the FA Cup. We've got a boxer's chance of landing a big slug."
