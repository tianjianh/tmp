Soldier re-armed: Enniskillen statue returned to former glory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two stone soldiers have stood watch over Enniskillen for more than 110 years from the clock tower of the town hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One is an Inniskilling Fusilier and the other, an Inniskilling Dragoon.
The statues represent the important military history of Enniskillen in County Fermanagh.
It is the only town to have its name carried by two British Army regiments, raised to defend the town in 1689.
But during a spell of bad weather in January 2015, one of the soldiers let down his guard and his arm and sword broke off and fell to the street below.
Specialist stone masons were brought in as part of a Â£50,000 project to restore the exterior of the building which was designed by William Scott and opened in 1901.
They took measurements from the 7ft 6in tall statue and carved a new arm from Portland stone before re-attaching the stainless steel sword.
The statue was the gift of Francis William Bracken, a soldier who had returned to Enniskillen from South Africa when the town hall was being built.
Mark Scott from the Inniskilling Regimental Museum at Enniskillen Castle said: "I'm delighted that sword didn't skewer some unfortunate person down below when it came off but now it is replaced, it's looking very good."
