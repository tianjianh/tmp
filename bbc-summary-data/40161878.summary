Tagive, 26, has made two appearances since joining 18 months ago and as part of his new deal he will play for Currie Chieftains in the BT Premiership when not involved with Glasgow next season.
McDonald, 22, played for Warriors against Canada 'A' last summer.
However, he moved south and spent the season playing for Hull.
Both players have joined up with the Warriors squad for pre-season training.
"I'm excited to be staying on and continuing to learn under the new coaching staff," Australian-born Tagive told Warriors TV.
"Dave Rennie's coaching record speaks for itself, so it's phenomenal to be able to learn from someone like that.
"I'm really enjoying it here and I'm grateful to have the chance to stay next season."
McDonald, standing at 6ft 8in, will provide depth in the second row.
He said: "It's an honour to come back here. I've never stopped following Glasgow - it's my home, and I've never stopped pushing to try and get back up the road."
