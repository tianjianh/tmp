[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peter Robinson: NI First Minister to attend meeting of British Irish Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Peter Robinson is expected to be in Dublin later for a meeting of the British Irish Council (BIC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His public appearances have been limited since suffering a heart attack last month.
Mr Robinson will be joined at Dublin Castle by the deputy first minister Martin McGuinness.
Mr McGuinness is having a separate meeting with the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon.
When the North South Ministerial Council met in Dublin earlier this month, the first minister was not present.
Since then, his work schedule has been curtailed as he recuperates after his recent illness.
Much of the interest surrounding this meeting of the British Irish Council will centre on Ms Sturgeon, following the Scottish National Party's stunning result in the UK general election.
She is meeting with Mr McGuinness who has called for the three devolved institutions to work together to fight austerity.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny will be at the BIC meeting, as will the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.
The BIC meeting is expected to concentrate on economic matters.
But the media will look for tensions over the budget crisis at Stormont as well as recent claims over collusion.
