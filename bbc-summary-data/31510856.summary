Durham University students: Police are blaming us for river deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Students in Durham say they are angry at plans being brought in by the local police, council and university to make the river safer.

They've told Newsbeat they are being blamed for drinking too much but say that not enough is being done to make the River Wear safer.
They want more fences to stop people falling in.
Police say that students need to take more responsibility for themselves when they go out drinking.
The warning comes after three student deaths in the River Wear in the past year and a half.
Sope Peters drowned in October 2013, Luke Pearce in May 2014, and Euan Coulthard died in January of this year.
Toby Dickinson, a 19-year-old first year student, is unhappy with the way the measures are being brought in.
"I think what's going on here is victim blaming, you died and it's your fault because you drank," he said.
Plans include breathalysing people at clubs if bouncers think they've had too much to drink.
An area where drunk people can be taken to sober up before being sent on their way home is also being suggested. They will be looked after in these areas by volunteers.
Newsbeat saw a number of people being helped by "street angels" after being kicked out of the clubs and bars.
A lot of the students we spoke to said tackling drunks was the wrong approach and ignores the real problem.
"There are no lights by the river and the fences don't cover the whole path," says Lauren Maine, a third-year student.
"The path does go to some colleges on the hill so if you were heading that way you would have to get to a bit where there isn't any fence."
She is not alone in being angry with the plans.
A lot of the students Newsbeat spoke to were unhappy, felt they were being targeted and that local residents weren't facing the same treatment.
The local police say that they aren't singling out students and point out that locals aren't dying in the river.
They say in the past 15 months four students went into the water after drinking too much and three of those died.
Chief Superintendent Ivan Wood is working with the council and university to try to stop more accidents happening.
"There have been three tragic accidents in the past 14 months, all involving students, all on a Wednesday night, all having consumed alcohol," he said.
"What we're saying is take responsibility for your own actions."
The fear of another death in the city is very high at the moment.
When Newsbeat was speaking to students outside the main club there was a moment of panic when a friend of one of the above group went missing after drinking too much.
He turned up after a few frantic phone calls and there was a collective sigh of relief.
One of those trying to track down the missing student was Ivan Jones, 21, who said: "It highlights a point, after these things happen then everyone is worried and you'd expect that."
The council, police and university have told students to "look after your friends and stick together walking home".
This is a message that Jackie Roberts wants people to take on. Her daughter Megan died in another university city, York, which is also dominated by a river running through it.
Megan fell into the River Ouse after a night out drinking with friends.
Jackie told Newsbeat that she has relived what could have happened to her in the water over and over in her head and doesn't want anyone else to go through what she has.
"I'm never going to preach to anyone and say don't go out and have a drink and don't have fun, but just realise there is this huge danger if you're not careful," she said.
She also agreed with the students Newsbeat has spoken to who say more needs to be done to physically stop people falling in.
Some changes are being made and since meeting with Newsbeat, Jackie has been in touch to say that York Council will receive a gate in March to install over the steps where Megan died.
"Good news in that it helps prevent the same tragedy in that area and it is also a mark of respect to Megan," said Jackie.
