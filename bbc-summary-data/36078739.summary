The 24-year-old made his return against Newcastle Under-21s earlier this month after breaking his fibula in August.
Before Monday, his last goals were for his country as Roy Hodgson's side beat Slovenia 3-2 in June.
Wilshere featured in five of England's first six qualifying fixtures for this summer's European Championship.
