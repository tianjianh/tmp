The 24-year-old, who played stormtrooper Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, was a member of Theatre Peckham's company from age nine to 14.
He said he admired the theatre was "inspiring young people like myself to be the change we want to see in the industry".
Boyega is currently filming the eighth instalment of the Star Wars franchise.
"I admire Theatre Peckham's continued mission to increase diversity in the creative industries," he said.
"As a graduate of the company, I am honoured to be in a position to give back."
The theatre's founder and artistic director, Teresa Early, said Boyega's role as patron "will be a huge boost for our young members", adding: "Now there's an act for them to follow."
The theatre's other patrons include actors Sir Ian McKellen, Jenny Agutter and David Harewood, and theatre director Paulette Randall.
Boyega is due to return to the stage in The Old Vic's production of Woyzeck in February 2017.
