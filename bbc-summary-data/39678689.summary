An exhibition of plans for cable car in Bath has been cancelled because of a protest planned by opponents.

Organisers Curo were seeking feedback on the scheme, which proposes a cable car between its housing development Mulberry Park and Bath Spa station.
It apologised for the cancellation saying the decision was made by the venue, Southgate Shopping Centre.
Campaigners say the area, which is at the top of a steep hill, is already accessible for bikes and walkers.
When the exhibition was scrapped opponents gathered in Widcombe to protest against the project.
No formal planning permission has yet been sought by Curo, who claim the cable car would help people with mobility problems get around the city more easily.
It claims the cable car could "celebrate" Bath's World Heritage status, as other Unesco World Heritage cities have them, such as Porto, Barcelona and Dubrovnik.
Chief Executive Victor da Cunha said: "For many people the typography of Bath is very difficult for cycling and walking, equally it's very congested.
"So any solutions that involve adding to the road network will further congest it, so a cable car overall is seen to be reducing congestion overall, it removes several thousand car journeys a year."
After the event was cancelled Curo has said any feedback can be given online. It has also planned a number of other open days over the next few months.
Chairman of Widcombe Association, Jeremy Boss, said: "This is not a pretty cable car, it's a mass transport system, the cable car would be the size of a single decker bus, we're told, holding from 80 to 100 people.
"You don't want that going over your house, I would defy anyone who says that would be an improvement in their daily lives, privacy and homes."
He added that the cable car would also threaten the beauty of the city.
The Curo housing groups says it hopes to put in planning permission next August.
