Plans have been submitted for a new hotel and residential care homes to be built at a site previously at the centre of a row over a bid to build a supermarket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developer Quantum Group bought the former Sherborne Hotel site, in Dorset, and demolished the building last year.
A public consultation on the proposals runs until 2 Dec.
Previous plans to build a Tesco on the site prompted protests led by former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton.
Quantum Group wants to build a 24-bed "boutique" hotel, 82 care apartments and 38 care houses.
The 5.4-acre (2.1-hectare) site on Horsecastles Lane is also expected to include landscaped gardens and courtyards.
A spokeswoman for the group said more than 400 people attended a public exhibition on the proposals in July.
Of 281 received feedback forms, she added 75% of respondents "agreed with our proposals".
Further exhibitions on the plans, which have been submitted to West Dorset District Council for consideration, will be held in the Sherborne on 15, 16 and 17 December.
