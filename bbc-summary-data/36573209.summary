Global markets were hit last week by nervousness ahead of Britain's June 23 vote on whether to leave the EU.
However markets rebounded on Monday, with the Nikkei 225 closing 2.3%, higher at 15,965.30. Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 1.7% higher at 20,510.20 points.
Fresh data from the Japanese government showed that exports in May fell 11.3% compared with a year earlier.
The main factor expected to dominate trading sentiment in the coming days remains the British EU referendum.
"More volatility is likely this week," wrote Margaret Yang, analyst with CMC markets in Singapore.
"The entire market is now focused on the UK's EU referendum result."
Other stock markets in the region also saw strong gains at the start of trading on Monday.
South Korea's Kospi finished 1.2% higher at 1,981.12 while Australia's ASX 200 was 1.8% higher at 5,256.80.
On the Chinese mainland, the Shanghai Composite edged higher to 2,888.81.
