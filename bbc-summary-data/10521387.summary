Ceredigion cabinet supports 'super-school' in Tregaron

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for an "all-through" super-school for pupils aged three to 19 to replace eight schools in the Tregaron area have been backed "in principle".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion council's cabinet has supported  the idea after already agreeing a similar scheme in Llandysul.
A report said secondary schools were not up to standard, and cost per pupil figures in the catchment areas were among the highest in Wales.
But there has been some opposition to the plans.
The Welsh medium super-school would be based on the Finnish "all-through" education system.
The council said all seven primary schools in the Tregaron area have fewer than 90 pupils and have 102 surplus spaces - 25% of the total capacity.
It said Tregaron Secondary School was in a poor state of repair.
The plans would involve closing Tregaron Secondary School and Tregaron, Lledrod, Bronnant, Llangeitho, Penwuch, Pontrhydfendiagaid and Llanddewi Brefi primary schools.
The new multi-site school would include a focal point at Tregaron and a 3-11 federal school at Pontrhydfendiagaid and another 3-11 federal school to the west of Tregaron.
The new builds at Tregaron and Llandysul would cost almost Â£66m.
