[SN]TITLE[SN]
Togo replace coach Tom Saintfiet with Claude LeRoy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Togo have appointed Claude LeRoy as their new national team coach to replace Tom Saintfiet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frenchman LeRoy, 68, has worked on the continent for almost 30 years and has coached at a record eight Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.
He has signed a three-year contract and is tasked with trying to qualify Togo for the 2017 Nations Cup in Gabon.
Togo are third in their qualifying group, two points behind leaders Liberia, who they play away in June.
LeRoy admitted: "We need a miracle to qualify for the 2017 Nations Cup, perhaps as the best second-placed team."
However, Le Roy has the pedigree to turn around Togo's fortunes.
He guided Cameroon to the 1988 Nations Cup title and has only failed to reach the quarter-finals once.
Among the other countries he has coached at the continental championship are Senegal, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
