Scottish referendum: Iain Gray to join powers commission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray will join the body set up to agree more powers for the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Gray, along with a Scottish Labour MP, will represent the party on the commission being chaired by Lord Smith.
The Greens put forward their co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Maggie Chapman, to the commission at the weekend.
Prime Minister David Cameron announced details of the body after Scotland voted against independence.
Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and SNP MSP Linda Fabiani are representing their party on the commission, alongside former Scottish Conservative leader, Baroness Goldie and Prof Adam Tomkins, for the Tories.
Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent
It is a high-powered line up.
It includes a serving Scottish cabinet minister (John Swinney) and a former UK cabinet minister (Michael Moore).
A further three former Scottish Executive/Government ministers (Iain Gray, Tavish Scott and Linda Fabiani).
And no fewer than six former or current Scottish party leaders (Goldie, Harvie, Chapman, Gray, Scott and Swinney).
They are among the ten people nominated by the five Holyrood parties to serve on Lord Smith's commission on further devolution.
He will have a wealth of talent and experience at the table when he convenes the commission's first full meeting in mid-October.
But the three pro-union parties have contrasting blueprints for the extra powers Holyrood should have.
And the SNP and the Greens want to maximise further devolution having advocated a 'Yes' vote in the independence referendum.
Getting all sides to find an agreed way forward by St Andrews Day will not be easy, as Lord Smith himself has acknowledged.
The Liberal Democrats are being represented by former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore and Tavish Scott, the party's previous Scottish leader.
The Smith Commission aims to get agreement between the Holyrood parties by 30 November.
A "command paper", setting out the issues, is also due to be published by 31 October, with draft legislation on new powers for Scotland due to be unveiled by 25 January.
