The County Tyrone motorcycle racer, 40, was involved in a high-speed accident during the opening Supertwins race of the meeting on Thursday night.
The Belfast Trust had initially described Farquhar as "seriously ill".
The five-time winner suffered chest and pelvic injuries in the crash.
The Dungannon rider, who resumed road racing in 2014 after retiring in 2012, and Dan Cooper, came off their bikes on the the Black Hill section of the course.
English rider Malachi Mitchell-Thomas was killed in a crash at the same part of the course on Saturday.
Cooper was taken to the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine with shoulder injuries but was later discharged.
Farquhar was airlifted by police helicopter from the track after the accident and taken to hospital.
A well-known figure in motorcycling, he has won five races at the North West.
He retired from the sport in 2012 following the death of his uncle Trevor Ferguson at that year's Manx Grand Prix in the Isle of Man.
However, Farquhar resumed his road racing career in 2014, saying that his family backed his decision to return.
Castledawson rider Nico Mawhinney is stable in hospital after crashing at the Mill Road roundabout during a practice session on Thursday, with Paul Gartland also stable after his accident in a Superstock race.
