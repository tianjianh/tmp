[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jo Cox MP death: Thomas Mair appears at Old Bailey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man charged with murdering Labour MP Jo Cox has appeared before a judge at the Old Bailey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Mair, 52, was remanded in custody by Mr Justice Sweeney after appearing by videolink.
He is also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
The Batley and Spen MP, 41, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on Thursday.
She was attacked shortly before she was due to hold a constituency surgery.
When asked by the judge to confirm he was Thomas Mair, he replied: "Yes, I am."
There was no application for bail at the hearing, which lasted about eight minutes.
He is due to appear at the same court for a preliminary hearing on Thursday.
At an initial hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday he refused to give his name, instead saying he was called "Death to traitors, freedom for Britain".
