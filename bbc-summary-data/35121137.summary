The 24-year-old left-armer only made one County Championship appearance for the Lord's outfit in 2015 and spent time on loan at Essex.
"Ravi had a difficult season but he remains one of the most exciting young spinners in the country," managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"He continues to develop, but the route to the top is rarely straightforward."
