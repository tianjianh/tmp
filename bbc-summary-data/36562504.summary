Royal Ascot 2016: Qemah wins Coronation Stakes at Ascot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Qemah scored a victory for France by landing the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot for trainer Jean-Claude Rouget.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jockey Gregory Benoist won on the 6-1 chance from Nemoralia and Alice Springs.
Earlier, former jump jockey Dougie Costello delivered Quiet Reflection perfectly to win the Commonwealth Cup for trainer Karl Burke.
Frankie Dettori claimed his fourth winner of the week, on Across The Stars in the King Edward VII Stakes.
And there was a 577-1 double for champion Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien with two of his outsiders  winning.
Brave Anna (16-1) took the Albany Stakes under Seamie Heffernan, while 33-1 shot Sword Fighter gave Colm O'Donoghue his first Royal Ascot win in the concluding Queen's Vase.
Heffernan was given a nine-day ban over his use of the whip, while Fran Berry was given a seven-day suspension for careless riding although his mount Kinema kept the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes after a stewards' inquiry.
A former jump jockey claimed a Group One race for the second year running at the big flat race meeting as Costello won on Quiet Reflection.
Last year, Graham Lee triumphed in the Gold Cup aboard Trip To Paris.
Costello, who rode Countrywide Flame to win the Triumph Hurdle at the 2012 Cheltenham Festival, said: "I owe Karl Burke a lot and I'm so lucky.
"Anybody would have won on her today, and the last day."
"There aren't too many fairytales in the big business world of Flat racing, but Quiet Reflection's success provided one.
"Winning trainer Karl Burke was a little-known jump jockey who turned to training, not unsuccessfully, but a brush with authority led to a ban; however, to his credit, he's rebuilt his reputation, and this was his most significant win to date.
"Jockey Dougie Costello spent many years on the jumps circuit (he was at Uttoxeter a year ago today), but decided better chances lay on the flat. He's had to work hard to make it, and a trophy at Royal Ascot, no less, is a deserved reward."
Rouget was masterminding a second straight victory in the Group One contest, following his success last year with Ervedya.
"To do the double is a childhood dream," said Roget, who holds the European record for winners trained with over 6,000  to his credit.
His joy was in sharp contrast to that of Ryan Moore on the fancied Aidan O'Brien runner Alice Springs.
Moore, not for the first time in recent weeks, met trouble and flashed home for third.
He was also luckless in the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes, finishing third on King's Fete behind the Ralph Beckett-trained winner Kinema, who survived a stewards' inquiry after veering to his right in the closing stages.
