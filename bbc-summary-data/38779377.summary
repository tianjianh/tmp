[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Heed made a bright start but were made to wait until the 27th minute for a breakthrough, with Jordan Burrow nudging the ball over the line after James Bolton's initial effort was blocked.
The opener may have been scrappy, but George Smith's fine strike from 25 yards made it 2-0 just before half-time as he notched his first goal for Gateshead.
Danny Johnson put the result beyond doubt just after the hour after picking up Wes York's through ball to finish between Magnus Norman's legs.
