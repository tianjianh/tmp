Tory MPs offered concessions on EU poll date and campaign rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has moved to try and head off rebellions by Conservative MPs over the timing of an EU referendum and the rules for a future campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ministers have conceded the poll will not be held on 5 May 2016, the same day as elections to devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
They will also amend planned changes to "purdah" rules, which limit government announcements in the run-up to polls.
Ministers said voters must be assured the referendum would be a "fair fight".
The concessions came ahead of the first day of detailed debate on the EU Referendum Bill, which will authorise an in-out referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017.
While the bill is backed by the overwhelming majority of MPs, the government is facing opposition within its own ranks and more widely in Parliament over a number of issues, including the date of the referendum and the conduct of the campaign preceding it.
Although he has yet to name a date for the poll, David Cameron had not ruled out holding it next May, at the same time as national and local elections in Scotland and Wales, elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, English council elections and London's mayoral election.
But in an e-mail to Tory MPs, Europe minister David Lidington said the bill would be amended to explicitly rule this out.
"The bill sets out a requirement to hold the referendum by the end of 2017 at the latest and the prime minister has always been clear that if we can hold it earlier then we will," he wrote.
"This has led to a great deal of speculation that the government intends to hold the referendum in May 2016 in combination with elections to Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies. I can confirm that this is not the case."
Conservative backbenchers are also angry that existing rules governing the conduct of elections and referendums could be relaxed in a way which they say would allow the government to use its resources to influence the outcome of the vote.
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 sets out a 28-day period ahead of a referendum, during which ministers, government departments and local authorities are banned from publishing material relating to the issue in question.
Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed suspending these rules, arguing the government will not be "neutral" when it comes to the referendum and they would mean ministers were barred from speaking about European court decisions and the EU budget.
In his letter, Mr Lidington defended the move, saying the rules as they stood could prevent ministers conducting day-to-day business.
But he said the government had no intention of spending public money to deliver mailshots to households in the last four weeks of the campaign and would offer amendments in other areas to "command the widest possible support".
The BBC's deputy political editor James Landale said this was designed to assure MPs that the government would not be able to use public funds to back a Yes vote to stay within the EU.
"We will work with colleagues over the next few months to understand their specific areas of concern and.... put beyond any doubt that the campaign will be conducted throughout in a manner that all sides will see as fair," Mr Lidington wrote.
"Working out a system that will reassure colleagues and voters that the referendum is a fair fight, yet will preserve the government's ability to act in the national interest is not straightforward. It is important that it is legally clear and robust."
Ministers are considering issuing a code of conduct aimed at reassuring rebels that they would not abuse the power of the Whitehall machine during the campaign.
The European Union Referendum Bill was unveiled. This is the UK legislation required to allow the referendum to take place. It is currently being debated by MPs before moving to the House of Lords. It is expected to become law in the Autumn.
The first EU summit after the UK general election takes place. David Cameron has pledged to meet every other EU leader before this date, to try to win support for his proposed reforms.
This was regarded as the first possible date for the referendum but it has now been ruled out by ministers. due to opposition to holding it on the same day as other elections, including for London's mayor, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies.
The UK's first referendum on EU membership, in 1975, was held in early June but this date may come too soon. Mr Cameron has said the timescale should be determined by the renegotiation process.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond says he wants to wrap up EU negotiations by the summer of 2016 if possible, and, if not, by the end of 2016. In the context of the EU this is a very tight deadline, particularly if treaty change is triggered by Mr Cameron's demands. Treaty change requires unanimity of all member states and national parliaments - which took 10 years to complete last time around.
A date in late September would avoid a clash with other elections and meant the poll was held when the weather was still good, which would boost turnout. However, it would clash with the party conference season.
A new US president will be elected. The US has made clear that it hopes the UK will remain within the European Union.
This would be an obvious choice but is complicated by the fact that French presidential elections are due to take place then. With French President Hollande focusing on getting re-elected, the government will be keen to have its negotiations wrapped up by now.
This is getting tight now, with David Cameron having pledged to hold the poll by the end of 2017. There are also German parliamentary elections taking place this month.
The referendum must be held by the end of 2017. Should there be a No vote, the UK will not leave the EU immediately. There will be a transitional period, potentially lasting several years, during which the terms of exit will be negotiated.
But Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said ministers should simply accept an amendment being tabled on Monday stating that the purdah rules should be reinstated in full.
"Why don't they cut themselves some slack by accepting the amendment and conceding that there needs to be purdah in this referendum," he told the BBC. "Put that in the Bill now and that would give reassurance.
"That is an issue of principle which they could put in the Bill now and amend at a later date if they need to."
The existing rules, he added, had been applied to every referendum staged in the past 15 years and had been endorsed by both the Electoral Commission and the Committee on Standards in Public Life.
And former Conservative defence secretary Liam Fox said to change the rules on purdah for the government's benefit was "unseemly" and unless there was a rethink, he could vote against his party in a whipped division for the first time in 23 years.
Labour said there were "not in the same position" as Tory rebels over the issue but did want "clarity" about how the government would operate during the referendum period. The opposition has also welcomed the decision to rule out the May 2016 date.
Last week, MPs overwhelmingly backed plans for a referendum, allowing the legislation to move to the next stage of its progress through Parliament. It still has several more stages to pass through, however.
