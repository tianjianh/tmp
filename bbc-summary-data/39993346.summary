The report, Mapping the Social Business Sector in Wales, identified 1,698 organisations operating in the social business sector in Wales.
This includes co-operatives, mutuals, social enterprises and employee-owned businesses.
It is based on a survey of 810 organisations - 48% of the sector.
Other key findings of the report were:
Glenn Bowen, director of enterprise at the Wales Co-operative Centre, said the report suggested there had been "real growth" in the sector in the last two years.
He said: "Social businesses are often formed as a result of issues identified at a grassroots level by a local community.
"They plug gaps in provision and, in some cases, grow through innovative delivery and defining services in direct response to their community's needs."
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the Welsh Government was "committed to working closely with social businesses to help them to thrive and grow".
The research was commissioned by Social Business Wales and conducted by Wavehill Ltd.
