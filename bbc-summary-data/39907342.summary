Spray-painted political slogans, including some targeting Ms Rudd, have appeared in eight places in Hastings.
The messages daubed on walls, bridge supports and a Grade II-listed building include one near St Mary-in-the-Castle demanding "Evict Amber Rudd".
Police are treating it as "politically-motivated criminal damage".
A spokesman said: "The graffiti was reported by Hastings Borough Council and affected council property, locations administered by East Sussex County Council and Highways England and one private dwelling."
Ms Rudd is aiming to retain the Hastings and Rye seat which she won with a majority of more than 4,700 in 2015.
However, she faces a challenge from Labour after the Green Party formed an alliance with them and stood down its candidate.
