They were all treated for mild hypothermia after two canoes capsized due to weather conditions.
It happened on the river between Magheramason in County Tyrone and Carrigans in County Donegal.
Foyle Search and Rescue said it was the biggest operation they were ever involved in.
Two canoes were taking part in a "married versus singles" race when one of them capsized at about 14:00 BST on Saturday during a fundraising event for the YMCA.
William Lamrock from the YMCA said all 26 people ended up in the water, some for about 20 minutes. All were wearing life jackets.
Bill Minky, from north America, told BBC Radio Foyle: "We were on a canoe from Strabane to Culmore and we were in the lead canoe and all of a sudden we didn't see the rear canoe.
"We decided to go back and they had taken on some water. The canoe then sunk.
"Some of them got into our canoe then ours tipped.
"The emergency services then came and plucked everyone out.
"The youngest was probably in his 20s and the eldest was 62.
"We were having a good time and then the swell came over.
"We had life jackets on, so we were prepared for something like this happening.
"I take my hat off to the emergency services. They did a terrific job.
"I'm here on holiday and it's not one I was expecting."
The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, the PSNI and the Irish coastguard were all involved in the rescue.
Six people were airlifted to Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital and were treated for mild hypothermia.
Another 12 were taken by ambulance and the rest were treated at the scene.
Ian Faulkner, who lives in Magheramason, watched events as they unfolded with his telescope.
"I came home from work and noticed that the weather was awful. At the corner of my eye I could see people in the very centre of the water.
"Some of them were on their own in the water. My wife then called the police."
Stephen Twells, from Foyle Search and Rescue, said: "Without Mr Faulkner's quick reaction we could've had a tragedy.
"The water would've been extremely cold.
"The weather was  pretty unpredictable on Saturday but the group was being led by experienced leaders.
"It was a difficult for us due to the weather and also due to the number of people involved."
