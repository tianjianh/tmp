[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The accountancy firm EY has said 35 of the 55 people that work at its Inverness office could lose their jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Formerly known as Ernst and Young, it has proposed ending the provision of audit and account, compliance and reporting services at the office.
EY has begun a consultation process with the 35 workers who have been placed at risk of redundancy. Some staff could be redeployed, it said.
The company added that its tax team in Inverness was unaffected.
In a statement, the firm said: "EY can confirm that it is proposing to cease the provision of audit and account, compliance and reporting services from the Inverness office, with the intention to continue to deliver this service to our clients from other locations in Scotland and Newcastle.
"As a result, it is with regret that 35 people have been placed at risk of redundancy and a consultation process has begun.
"We do, of course, hope to explore other opportunities for individuals within EY, if skills are transferable.
"EY remain committed to the Inverness market and our assurance business in Scotland as a whole."
