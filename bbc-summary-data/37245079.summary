A £1bn expansion of the MediaCityUK has been approved by councillors in Salford.

The site is set to "double in size" by 2026 with ten new buildings including two tower blocks, 1,400 properties and a multi-storey car park.
More than 7,000 people, including about 3,000 BBC and 900 ITV staff, are employed at the £650m site which first opened in 2011.
MPs in Salford called for the expansion to include more jobs for local people.
Salford Council said plans to expand MediaCityUK formed the second phase of a 20-year plan to transform the former docklands.
A spokesman said the 10-year build would create hundreds of new jobs for the area.
Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour MP for Salford and Eccles, called for firms in MediaCityUK to make "real investment in quality apprenticeships for local people".
"I would like to see companies in MediaCity agree to aim for a minimum percentage of apprentices who live locally."
Her Labour colleague Barbara Keeley, the MP for Worsley and Eccles South, also said: "The way that MediaCity was established it probably didn't generate enough new opportunities for local people to get jobs and that is something that needs to happen.
"I know the BBC has got a great apprenticeship scheme and I think the more organisations that advertise their opportunities locally that take on young people, and develop relationships with schools and academies locally the more that will help," she added.
Former Salford MP Hazel Blears complained in 2012 that only 26 of 680 new BBC jobs created in Salford had gone to local residents although the BBC said it had to recruit on skills and experience "not postcode".
In 2006, the 200-acre site was chosen by the BBC to relocate some of its departments to the North of England and the Salford Quays site was developed in a partnership with Salford City Council, developer Peel Holdings and development bodies.
The first phase of MediaCityUK, which is now complete, includes office and studio space for BBC departments, the relocation of ITV Granada and the Coronation Street set, along with 250 digital firms and the University of Salford journalism department.
