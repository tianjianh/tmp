Gogol Bordello, Alice Russell and Alabama 3 will feature at the festival which runs from 8 to 11 June.
Last month organisers reaffirmed their commitment to their south of Scotland venue after announcing a "sister" event in Croatia.
Further act announcements for the festival, first held in 2009, are scheduled in the weeks to come.
