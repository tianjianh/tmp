[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are investigating a hate crime targeted at a mosque in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An object was thrown at the Central Mosque in Potterrow at about 02:10 on Sunday which caused minor fire damage to a door.
No-one was hurt. A small bush in the garden area was also damaged.
Officers have described it as a "despicable and reckless act" and urged anyone who saw anything suspicious around the mosque or in the Potterrow area to get in touch.
Det Insp John Kavanagh, from Police Scotland, said: "Fortunately no-one was injured as a result of this incident, but the consequences could have been far worse had the fire taken hold and spread."
Police are looking for a man believed to be in his early 30s with very short hair, wearing a short-sleeved black top with a white emblem on the front and dark trousers.
It is believed the man spoke to a group of females in George Square, near the junction with the Meadows, before the incident happened.
Foysol Choudhury, chairman of the Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council, said: "ELREC strongly condemns this crime as an attack against our freedom of religion and expression.
"Edinburgh cannot tolerate any action that aims to spread hate and division within its society.
"ELREC would like to uphold Police Scotland's request for everyone who has any information to contact them and wishes to offer support to anyone who feels more insecure after this attack."
