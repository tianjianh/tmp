Up to 100 jobs could be created at a turbine assembly plant in Wales for the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project.

Three potential sites in south-west Wales have been shortlisted for the 100,000 sq ft facility by project developers Tidal Lagoon Power.
General Electric and Andritz Hydro have been appointed as preferred bidders if the Â£1bn project goes ahead.
The companies have committed to supply 16 turbines to the tidal lagoon and to the operation of the assembly plant.
Initially employing 100 people, the plant will be able to ship one 7.35m diameter runner turbine a month.
It then hopes to scale up its operations, shipping at least one turbine a week by 2018 as the UK moves to moves to construct more full-scale tidal lagoons.
