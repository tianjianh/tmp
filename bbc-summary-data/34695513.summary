Carter, who also won in 2005 and 2012, joins team-mate and All Blacks captain Richie McCaw as the only triple winners of the award, which was first given in 2001.
The five other nominees for the award were All Blacks team-mate Julian Savea, Australia flanker Michael Hooper and number eight David Pocock, Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones and Scotland scrum-half Greig Laidlaw.
Carter is joining French club Racing Metro, where he will become the sport's highest-paid player.
The World Rugby Awards winners were selected by an independent panel of judges, chaired by Australia's 1999 World Cup-winning captain John Eales and made up of former internationals, media and the teams who took part in the World Cup.
