Edmund, 22, claimed his first Wimbledon win on Tuesday and meets Monfils on Centre Court at 13:00 BST.
Edmund will hope to become the fifth British player to reach the last 32 following wins for Andy Murray, Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Aljaz Bedene.
Former champions Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic plus women's top seed Angelique Kerber also play on Thursday.
Seven-time winner Federer plays Serbia's Dusan Lajovic third on Centre Court at about 17:00, while two-time champion Djokovic will open play on Court One against Czech Adam Pavlasek.
They will be followed by Austrian eighth seed Dominic Thiem and France's Gilles Simon, before women's top seed Kerber of Germany takes on Belgian Kirsten Flipkens.
Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova faces a tough test against in-form Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, who has a 14-1 record on grass this year, in the second match on Centre Court.
Former semi-finalist Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, the 29th seed, plays Latvia's Ernests Gulbis on court three, with the winner potentially facing Djokovic in round three.
Edmund, ranked 50th, will hope his fortunes are on the up after arriving at Wimbledon without a coach or a grass-court win in 2017, and having lost all four previous matches at the All England Club.

His first-round win over British qualifier Alex Ward set up the chance to take on Monfils, the extrovert Frenchman widely regard as the best athlete in the sport.
The 30-year-old won junior Wimbledon in 2004 but his professional record on grass has been modest, with the third round his best effort in eight previous trips to Wimbledon.
"He's obviously a very good athlete, moves well, makes a lot of balls," said Edmund.
"He has very, very easy power when he wants to hit it. Sometimes I think he likes to put more balls in play, maybe use his movement to win points.
"But it will be tough. He's obviously made the final last week [at Eastbourne], playing well. He's got good confidence."
Pat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion
"Monfils is a bit nuts, he's super-talented, and he's got all the shots. He's an unbelievable athlete. All the players in the locker room are just glued to the TV when he plays, wondering what's going to happen next - sliding, splits, diving all over the court.
"Kyle has got to use his forehand well. They play quite similarly in that they both take big swings, and Kyle's got some real power on his forehand. He's got to play a great game and get in and be aggressive, take it to Gael.
"It's a tough match but I don't see it as an impossible task for Kyle."
Martina Navratilova, nine-time Wimbledon champion
"On grass, Gael stays too far behind the baseline and has a really big loopy swing on his forehand, so just not enough time to hit the forehand and recover. He covers the court so well but he just runs out of space and time here. But I'd say he's got much more focused - he seems to be more serious about his game."
