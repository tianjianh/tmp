Chris Froome has been given the all-clear to continue the defence of his Tour de France title after a crash in the fourth stage.

The British Team Sky lead rider was sent for an X-ray following a fall just five kilometres into the 163.5km stage.
Froome, 29, quickly got back on his bike and rejoined the peloton after receiving medical attention.
Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford said: "Chris is a fighter, he's not someone who gives up just like that."
Froome later tweeted: "Took quite a tumble today but I'll definitely be starting tomorrow with no serious damage. It'll be a tough one for everyone on the cobbles!"
"Chris Froome's team-mates will really need to look after him after he went down.
"The next stage, with 15km of cobbles, has the potential to play havoc with his wrist."
Brailsford added: "We've done the tests and we're relieved. He will start tomorrow and I hope it will be a great day.
"We took precautions, you're always concerned when you see your leader on the ground but that's part of sport.
"I think we've had quite a few crashes, so it's normal to be worried but we're going on."
Froome suffered a grazed left hip and sore wrist in the fall, and the road rash on his upper left leg was clearly visible through his shredded shorts when he rejoined the race.
He is in seventh place overall, two seconds behind race leader Vincenzo Nibali, after stage four was won by Marcel Kittel.
The Briton, who suffered cuts to his left shoulder and elbow in the Criterium du Dauphine last month, faces a major test on Wednesday's stage five.
It is a 155.5km route from Ypres to Arenberg Porte du Hinaut, which features nine cobbled sections totalling more than 15km.
Immediately following the crash, Brailsford had said: "It's racing. These things happen.
"We would have preferred if Chris hadn't crashed but he felt fine in the final [part of the stage]."
