Campaigners opposed to the closure of the lifeboat station at St Abbs have taken their fight to the RNLI headquarters at Poole in Dorset.

A delegation handed over a petition containing around 13,000 signatures calling for its boat to be retained.
The RNLI plans to shut the site on 8 September with cover provided with an additional boat at nearby Eyemouth.
Campaign co-ordinator Euan Gibson said the level of support for keeping St Abbs open was overwhelming.
"I have never seen such support for anything," he said.
"The Scottish Sub Aqua Club came out very quickly and voiced their opposition to this plan.
"The British Sub Aqua Club - which is the largest diving organisation in Britain - they were being badgered by all their members and they have come out in support as well."
Mr Gibson said the National Trust for Scotland had also voiced "deep concern" about the move.
"St Abbs Head is a very highly visited National Trust headland with about 45,000 to 50,000 visitors every year," he said.
"So there is opposition to this right across the spectrum."
The RNLI has said it was a "difficult decision" to shut the site but that sufficient cover could be provided from Eyemouth which is "only two nautical miles away".
A spokesman said: "We will receive the petitions, however our decision to close the lifeboat station remains unchanged.
"The closure date is Tuesday 8 September and we are finalising the details for the closure of the lifeboat station on that day."
