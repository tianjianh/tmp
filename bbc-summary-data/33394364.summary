The fierce electrical storm was accompanied by heavy downpours that swept north across the country.
The Met Office has issued a yellow "be aware" severe weather warning for parts of southern and western Scotland.
It warned of possible "localised surface water flooding" caused by the torrential rain.
Many parts of the country also saw a thunder storm in the early hours of Thursday morning, with forecasters saying there had been 15,273 lightning strikes in Scotland alone.
They have said that further thundery showers are possible on Sunday.
