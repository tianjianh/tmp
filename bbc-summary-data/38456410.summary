President-elect Donald Trump may have ruffled feathers in Beijing with criticism on trade and Taiwan, but he seems to have struck a chord with the Chinese public.

With the Year of the Rooster approaching, a Trump-inspired sculpture is on display at a shopping centre in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.
The designer told Chinese media he was inspired by both his iconic hairstyle and hand gestures.
The Lunar New Year falls on 28 January.
It is not the first time a resemblance has been spotted between the future leader of the free world and a bird in China.
A golden pheasant in a zoo in Hangzhou achieved brief internet fame in November after a visitor noticed that its swept-back blond hair and piercing blue eyes looked somewhat like Mr Trump's.
Beijing has grown increasingly critical of Mr Trump, who has appointed a fierce China critic to a senior trade post; spoken directly with Taiwan's president, in violation of the US's longstanding "One China" policy; and accused China of stealing an American underwater drone.
According to the Chinese zodiac, Donald Trump is a "dog", characterised as loyal, honest and suited to politics, though stubborn and prone to seeing the world as hostile.
