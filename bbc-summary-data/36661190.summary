Concern as fireworks threaten nature reserve wildlife

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Visitors to nature reserves are being asked not to start fires or set off fireworks as they threaten wildlife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said there have been isolated incidents at reserves across Wales recently.
Two bags of used and discarded fireworks were collected from the Dyfi Ynyslas nature reserve beach, near Aberystwyth.
NRW said noise from a firework can cause stress to wild animals, forcing them to abandon nests or their young.
Rubbish left behind can also contain chemicals which, if eaten by animals, can be fatal.
Ceredigion assistant reserve manager, Ali Chedgy said: "Having a camp fire or letting off fireworks at a nature reserve might seem like fun but it is a risk to wildlife, the habitats they call home, and people living nearby."
