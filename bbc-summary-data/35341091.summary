Social media and the press are bursting with "inspirational" images and stories of fitness for us to aspire to.
But do these posts and articles really inspired you? Or can they sometimes promote extremes which are largely unattainable for the average healthy person?
To get away from any such unrealistic fitness targets, Get Inspired has asked some familiar Scottish faces to lift the lid on their exercise habits.
These are real-life stories of fitness, and this is your chance to see how much of their week they are willing or able to devote to exercise.
Below is a selection of the videos we've had so far.
Whether you are looking for some ideas on how to get active or you are just nosey, go to the Get Inspired Facebook page to watch, post and talk openly about fitness.
