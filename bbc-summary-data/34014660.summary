[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Union leaders are set to decide on Monday if next week's double London Underground strike will go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of three unions will stage two 24-hour walkouts starting on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, in the dispute over plans for a new all-night service.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and Unite unions are in dispute over work-life balance and job cuts.
The Night Tube service is due to launch on 12 September.
Station staff will strike from 18:30 each day and drivers from 21:00 in the protest, which follows two earlier strikes, on 8 July and 6 August.
Disruption is likely to be felt from Tuesday evening until Friday night, owing to the knock-on impact of each strike to the service.
The train drivers' union Aslef is yet to decide on the action it will take.
"The Tube strike will go ahead," said RMT assistant general secretary Mick Lynch on Radio 4's Today programme.
But he added: "There's always a deal to be done. We will review our position on Monday."
Talks aimed at resolving the dispute have been taking place all week and will resume on Friday.
