Health bosses in York have again been given the green light to provide fertility treatment on the NHS.

The NHS Vale of York Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is currently the only area in England not to support IVF treatment.
The U-turn comes after the CCG scrapped plans in August to offer the treatment, over claims it could not afford it.
The CCG's governing body will now give immediate access to one cycle of IVF for people meeting certain criteria.
Dr Emma Broughton, of the group, said: "I'm so proud to be part of the team at the CCG that has championed the provision of local IVF services and helped to change, for the first time in several years, the commissioning position for the Vale of York."
Funding for IVF in the Vale of York was suspended in 2010 by the former primary care trust, in a bid to save money.
Plans to fund the treatment for couples in the city were agreed in principle in June, but shelved again in August.
York resident Karen Boardman has already paid for IVF treatment in Leeds but welcomed the news.
She said: "It gives me hope. If I'm not successful in this cycle, and the first doesn't always work, then I've got an extra chance,"
According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), eligible women aged under 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF treatment on the NHS.
One cycle costs the NHS Â£3,600, with additional drug charges.
