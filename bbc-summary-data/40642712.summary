The 22-year-old winger came through the Canaries' youth ranks and scored 10 goals in 41 appearances last season including two against Newcastle.
Murphy, a boyhood Newcastle fan, has joined up with the Magpies at their training camp in Ireland.
"It was my childhood dream to represent Newcastle and now the opportunity is here I can't wait to start," he said.
Murphy has made 122 senior career appearances, including those during his six loans away from Norwich.
Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez added: "He's a young and talented player and hopefully he can develop even more here.
"We hope he can show us the passion, commitment and ability that he showed in the Championship last season."
