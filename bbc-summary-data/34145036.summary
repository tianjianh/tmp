Parliament's president Martin Schulz is to issue the invite - and report back next week with the PM's answer.
The leader of the Liberal group in the parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said he hoped the PM would seize the chance - "there is nothing to be afraid of".
Mr Cameron wants to get changes to the UK's terms of membership before holding an in/out referendum before 2018.
Mr Verhofstadt said: "I am delighted the British prime minister will now be invited to a special session of the European Parliament.
"I hope David Cameron seizes this opportunity and will  transparently outline his demands for a renegotiation of the UK's membership, in what is Europe's democratically elected chamber.
"This renegotiation is an issue not only of concern to the UK citizens, who will have a vote in a forthcoming referendum, but an issue that concerns the establishment of a new relationship between the Union and one of its members. This is of concern to all the Union's citizens."
The leader of the UK Independence Party - and Member of the European Parliament - Nigel Farage said in a tweet he was "happy" that the invitation was being issue.
