[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Fife moved up to third in Scottish League One with a 2-0 win over Albion Rovers while Airdireonians lost 2-1 at home to Stranraer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Relegation-threatened Stenhousemuir picked up three points with a 3-1 victory over Peterhead.
League leaders Livingston dropped points as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Queen's Park at Hampden Park.
The fixture between Brechin City and Alloa Athletic was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.
East Fife bounced back from last week's defeat to Alloa Athletic by beating Albion Rovers at the Bayview Stadium. Two second-half goals from Chris Duggan was the difference between the sides.
Stranraer picked up three points away to Airdrieonians thanks to second-half goals from Craig Malcolm and Ryan Thomson. The Blues were reduced to 10 men as Morgyn Neil was shown a red card but Iain Russell missed the resulting penalty. Andy Ryan scored a late consolation for Airdrieonians.
Bottom club Stenhousemuir took a step towards safety with a defeat of 10-man Peterhead at Ochilview Park. Rory McAllister saw red for abusing referee David Munro after first-half goals from Alan Cook and Mason Robertson had put the strugglers in front. Jordan Brown pulled one back for Peterhead after the restart, but Colin McMenamin restored the Warriors' two-goal cushion shortly after the hour mark.
Livingston extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points with a draw at Queen's Park. Scott Pittman put the leaders ahead early on before Dario Zanatta equalised for the hosts.
