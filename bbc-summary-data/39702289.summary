The Scots, who were among the second seeds, have avoided top ranked sides Germany, England and Sweden.
The Swiss are currently 16th in the Fifa standings, while Scotland are 21st, with both nations competing at this summer's Euro 2017.
Belarus and Albania make up Group 2, with only the winners guaranteed progress to the finals in France.
The four best runners-up will compete in a play-off for the final European spot, while the hosts qualify automatically.
The group matches will be played from 11 September 2017 to 4 September 2018.
Poland, not at Euro 2017, have a world ranking of 31, with Belarus 49 and Albania 71.
Shelley Kerr, who will succeed Anna Signeul after the Euro 2017 finals, said they were keen to avoid Germany, England and Sweden.
"There are some tough groups when you look at the draw but overall we're happy with it," she told the SFA website.
"We're not taken anything for granted as Switzerland are a great side, as are Poland who we played in the last World Cup qualification campaign.
"Only one team qualifies automatically which makes the format very tough and it's not a given that we will qualify.
"We've been drawn with teams which will require a lot of travel but I'll be working with a group of players who are very professional and prepare well.
"The logistics will be important in terms of the professional and we'll do that to the best of our ability.
"There's a lot of hard work to be done and the focus at the moment should be on the Euros as it will give the players a lot of experience and help them when they turn their focus to the World Cup qualifiers."
"It's a really good draw," said Hibs defender Joelle Murray. "We could have had worse teams in pot A.
"Switzerland are a good team but certainly a team we a very familiar with. The format of the group makes it tough to start with but overall it's good and one we're looking forward to."
Glasgow City midfielder Leanne Ross added: "We've got a good chance. Switzerland are a very good team with very good individual players. We had a look at them in the Cyprus Cup recently, which they won, so it'll be a tough one but definitely one we feel we can do well in."
England have been drawn in the same group as Wales, while Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are also together.
The United States are the World Cup holders, winning the event for a third time in Canada in 2015.
