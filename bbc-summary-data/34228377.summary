[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesex completed a stunning comeback to inflict a first defeat of the season on county champions Yorkshire.

The home side were dismissed for 106 on day one at Lord's as the White Rose county wrapped up the title, and trailed by 193 on first innings.
But they declared on their overnight 573-8 to set Yorkshire 381 to win.
And Toby Roland-Jones followed up his second-innings century by taking 5-27 as Yorkshire were dismissed for only 134, despite 62 from opener Alex Lees.
At one stage it appeared as if Yorkshire might win themselves within two days when Middlesex began their second innings a long way behind.
But 149 from Nick Compton and a maiden Championship ton from Roland-Jones enabled Middlesex to fight back and set Yorkshire a challenging target.
They were up against it from the moment James Harris had England duo Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance both caught behind in the space of three balls.
Lees and captain Andrew Gale held up Middlesex with a third-wicket stand of 64, but after Neil Dexter trapped Gale leg before, Roland-Jones then ripped through the Yorkshire line-up as they slumped from 92-2 to 117-9.
It was left to Tim Murtagh to complete victory when he bowled Steven Patterson, leaving Middlesex 24 points clear of Nottinghamshire in the race for second place.
