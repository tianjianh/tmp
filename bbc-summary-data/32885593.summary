Drugs with a total street value of £2m were seized in raids at two homes in Clement Royds Street, Rochdale.
Officers also recovered £53,000 in cash in the operation on 23 March, a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said.
Detectives are now trying to trace Imran Hussain, 32, and Shazana Kauser, 24, in connection with the operation.
They are known to have links with the Rochdale and Leeds areas, police said.
A spokesman said officers made "initial inquiries" at one of the properties before finding a large proportion of the drugs in two bags after returning to their van.
Sadir Hussain, 61, Inayat Bibi, 60, Rehana Kausar, 25, and Rezwan Hussain, 26, all of Rochdale, have previously been charged with drugs supply in connection with the discovery.
Det Insp Andrew Butterworth said: "This was an excellent result and an example of how police are determined to come out on top when it comes to drugs within the community.
"Thanks to the hard work of our officers we have managed to keep these drugs off the streets and stop them from causing harm to the local community."
