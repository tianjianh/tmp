Ghana forward Andre Ayew has joined Swansea City on a free transfer, signing a four-year contract at the Premier League club.

Ayew, 25, has been at Marseille since 2006 but his deal with the Ligue 1 side expired this month.
The former BBC African Footballer of the Year scored 52 goals in 181 appearances for the French club and has 62 caps for his country.
"I felt this was the right place for me," Ayew said.
"I felt that my desire to play in the Premier League and wanting to grow as a player meant that Swansea was the best solution for me in every way.
"Seeing the honesty and desire of the club made me feel that they really wanted me to come. They have proved that in all ways."
Swansea sold striker Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in January.
The Ivory Coast international's short-term replacement, Nelson Oliveira, has returned to Benfica following his loan spell at the Liberty Stadium.
Ayew's departure from Marseille brings to an end his family's 28-year association with the club.
His father, Abedi Pele, signed in 1987 and was part of their Champions League-winning team in 1993.
Younger brother Jordan also started his career at the State Velodrome, before joining Lorient.
Ayew had held talks with QPR, who were relegated from the top flight, in January.
In May the Ghanaian said he was weighing up options to join clubs in England, Italy and Germany and admitted the Premier League was attractive to him.
