Taylor beat Van Gerwen in the opening contest, but Lewis then struggled in losing to Van Barneveld, before the Dutch won the pairs.
But Taylor's defeat of Van Barneveld forced a decider, in which Lewis beat Van Gerwen 4-1.
Victory in Frankfurt gave England their fourth World Cup of Darts crown.
After losing both of his matches in the final, world number one Van Gerwen seemed to take exception to Lewis' celebrations on sealing the trophy.
"MVG got the the hump with me because I gave it large, but I said to him that he does that every week, so he has to expect some back," said Lewis.
Taylor and Lewis, both from Stoke-on-Trent, had earlier defeated Northern Ireland duo Brendan Dolan and Daryl Gurney in the semi-finals.
Scotland, represented by world champion Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton, lost in the quarter-finals to Belgium.
