Two Hilti drills were reported stolen from a building site on Fetter Lane, in the City of London.
Scotland Yard said they were not the tools recovered from the crime scene.
The contents of at least 56 safety deposit boxes were taken from the vault in a raid on the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd on 2 April.
Yesterday, The Sun reported the owner of a separate firm in south London claimed the thieves used drills stolen from him last November.
It is unclear at present whether there is a link with this company.
Police said they were still in the process of identifying and contacting the owners of 56 boxes that were broken into during the heist and could not yet put a value on the amount stolen.
A review is ongoing into why police did not respond when an intruder alarm went off at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company on Good Friday.
