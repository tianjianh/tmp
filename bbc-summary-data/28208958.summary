Prince Charles last visited Muchelney in February to meet people directly affected by the winter floods.
He returned earlier to acknowledge the perseverance of the community and to see how the village is striving to get back to normal.
The Prince's Countryside Fund has donated Â£50,000 to help the area.
The visit was part of a series of engagements in the county, which includes an effort to help promote tourism in the region hit by the effect of the floods.
He attended a reception of 100 guests at Almonry Barn, where owner of the previously flooded venue - Louise Wilson-Ward - spoke positively about the future.
"The message today is to not keep harping on about the floods, otherwise our economy is really going to suffer," she said.
"If you put the word 'Somerset' in Google, what comes up is pictures of the floods and people are avoiding the whole area but we are open for business again."
Farmer Jane Pine, 59, who lost 200-acres but still managed to milk her 400 cows three times each day, said Prince Charles had achieved more in his February visit than in 10 years of local campaigning.
"I told Prince Charles and he said 'Well I had to do something, it's runs in the family, it's in my blood.' And he is, he is just like his dad - he says it like it is.
"He said 'At least I have done some good.' He really does know what he is talking about, he is a farmer himself and he knows what is going on at this time of year.
"He pushed all the politicians into doing something. We have all been pushing for years and they have done nothing."
After visiting Muchelney, Prince Charles was driven to Castle Cary railway station and he also attended a reception held in Glastonbury with festival founder Michael Eavis.
