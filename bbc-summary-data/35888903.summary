The Manannan vessel hit Victoria Pier at about 22:40 GMT on Wednesday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said.
The injured passengers were taken to hospital, said the company, adding early indications suggested a "systems control failure" led to the crash.
Sailings between Douglas and Liverpool are disrupted.
After leaving Liverpool at 19:05 on Wednesday, the Manannan catamaran sailed to Douglas and on arrival hit the pier while attempting to dock.
Mark Woodward, chief executive of the Steam Packet Company, said the cause of the "systems control failure... is unclear."
"At this stage, it is looking likely that over the peak Easter days we will not be able to accommodate all passengers.
"MV Arrow will be arriving tomorrow, allowing us to dedicate Ben-my-Chree to passengers."
The 15:00 and 19:15 sailings to and from Liverpool are cancelled.
Mr Woodward said five passengers were initially treated on board the vessel for "what are believed to be minor injuries" but ambulances were called as a precaution.
"We apologise for any disruption caused to passengers... safety is absolutely paramount to the Steam Packet Company," he said.
The disruption will affect people travelling to the Isle of Man for the Easter Festival of Running, which starts on Good Friday.
Sea debris caused more than Â£100,000 damage to the Manannan ferry last year, putting the vessel out of action over the Easter period.
