Britain's Peter Kennaugh retained the leader's yellow jersey in the penultimate stage of the Herald Sun Tour in Australia.

His Team Sky team-mate and fellow Brit Chris Froome is second, 13 seconds behind, heading into the final stage.
American sprinter John Murphy won the 146.2km stage three from Traralgon to Inverloch in a photo-finish.
Sunday's final stage ends with a climb to the summit of the 314m Arthurs Seat on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria.
And Froome believes his compatriot can hold onto the lead. He said: "I'm pretty sure he'll be all right. He's in good nick and he's feeling good.
"It would be massive. It would be a great win for him, a great win for the team so that's the plan."
Kennaugh, though, said he was well aware of the threat posed by the riders just behind him - not least, Froome.
"If Froome's feeling super-good he'll be up for anything," said the 26-year-old.
"He can have an attack, he can do what he wants but I'm sure we'll have a strategy by tomorrow and take it from there."
