Pentland Hills park expansion plan 'not backed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Holyrood committee is recommending a bill to extend the boundaries of the Pentland Hills regional park is rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, Christine Grahame, wants to increase the size of the park.
The park currently covers just 45% of the Pentland hills range.
The committee said there was little demand for the move and changing the boundaries would lead to an increased financial burden on councils.
James Dornan, Scottish Parliament's Pentland Hills Regional Park Boundary Bill Committee convener, said: "There is no doubt Christine Grahame is passionate about protecting the landscape of the Pentland hills for future generations.
"However, we are not convinced extending the Regional Park would give this protection.
"It was clear from the evidence given by local authorities that, far from being a simple line on a map, they were concerned the extension could place a very real financial burden on those local authorities involved in the maintenance of the Regional Park, which could see funding spread even more thinly.
"For a park which plays such an important role in the lives of many people, to do so would have a damaging impact.
"That is why we have decided that we cannot support the general principles of the bill."
Ms Grahame said: "I am of course very disappointed that the Pentland Hills Regional Park Boundary Bill Committee came to the conclusion that it did not support the general principles of my bill.
"There is a need to protect the whole of the Pentland Hills range and I had hoped that the committee would agree with me that this was a role for us, as politicians.
"I am pleased that the committee recognises the difficulties that local authorities will face in meeting the aims of the Pentland Hills Regional Park in the coming years and the acknowledgement that the introduction of this bill has created a focus on those difficulties."
