Ospreys face uncertainty over European Challenge Cup quarter-final venue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys may be forced to take their home European Challenge Cup quarter-final against Stade Francais to an alternative venue.

The region are due to face the French club on Sunday 2 April at 17:45 GMT.
But that kick-off time could clash with Swansea City's Premier League match with Middlesbrough at the Liberty Stadium.
That Swans match is due to take place on Saturday 1 April, but could be moved to Sunday by broadcasters.
That would force Ospreys, who qualified as top seeds for the knock-out stages of Europe's second-tier competition, to stage the game elsewhere.
Tournament organisers European Professional Club Rugby have confirmed the dates and times of all eight quarter-finals in the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup.
Cardiff Blues will face Gloucester at Kingsholm, also in the Challenge Cup, on Saturday 1 April at 20:05 GMT.
Ospreys have already started looking at contingency plans away from the Liberty Stadium in case of a clash.
Cardiff's Principality Stadium and the Cardiff City Stadium are both being considered, though Ospreys are understood to be reluctant to move the potentially lucrative match to the closer venue of Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli.
A decision on whether Swansea City's fixture against Middlesbrough will be televised live has yet to be made and could be as late as 27 February.
Swansea also face Tottenham in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday, 4 April at 19:45 GMT.
The Swans have primacy of tenancy at the venue so Ospreys would need permission from the stadium management board to stage a match if it falls within a 72-hour window of a home Swans fixture.
The rugby side have never been denied permission before now.
