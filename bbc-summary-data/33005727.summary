The CMA is concerned that the games, which it has not named, may encourage children to make in-game purchases.
The topic is high on government agendas after a series of cases where children spent thousands of pounds on online or app-based games.
The European Commission had also asked Apple and Google to address the issue.
Both agreed to strengthen payment authorisation and stop manufacturers describing games as "free" if they contain in-game or in-app purchases.
The CMA's senior director, Nisha Arora, said she wanted the ASA to consider whether the games breached advertising codes.
She said: "75% of 10- to 15-year-olds in the UK play video games every day, so it's clear that they are a significant part of children's lives.

"However, we are concerned that some games may directly encourage children to buy extra features during the game."
The ASA said it welcomed the referral.
