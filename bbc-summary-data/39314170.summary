Despite getting pelted with boiling rocks and steam thankfully everyone got off the mountain safely with no serious injuries.
Rachel Price who was filming at the time for the BBC managed to capture the moment the volcano erupted on camera.
She said it was scary but she is ok, despite a hot rock burning a hole in her jacket.
She's sent us this video telling us about her experience.
