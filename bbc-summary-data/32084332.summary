Election 2015: Lib Dems promise Wales 'stronger economy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats offer the best chance of building a strong Welsh and UK economy, Nick Clegg has said.

Launching his party's Welsh general election campaign, the deputy prime minister warned of the risks of "lurching to the left or right".
Mr Clegg warned Labour would borrow too much and the Conservatives would cut public spending by more than necessary.
Touring a Panasonic factory in Cardiff, he highlighted his party's commitment to the EU and apprenticeships.
The plant is in Cardiff Central, a Liberal Democrat seat being targeted by Labour.
Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems offered voters a "sensible way forward" and would "balance the books", allowing spending on the NHS across the UK to be increased in the "latter part of the next parliament".
He defended the Liberal Democrats role in coalition at Westminster, insisting he had no regrets about going into government with the Conservatives.
Reflecting on what he saw as the administration's achievements, Mr Clegg added: "No-one would have predicted that by now Britain would have one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world and I don't want to squander that."
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Clegg told BBC Radio Wales it was vital the next UK government remained "anchored in the centre ground".
The Lib Dems will be hoping to hold onto their three Westminster seats and are aiming to regain Montgomeryshire, which they lost to the Tories in 2010.
