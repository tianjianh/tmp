On the day Scottish Labour published its manifesto, she told the BBC: "There is no doubt the polls are challenging, but we are going to work every single day to win over people who have yet to make up their minds.
"Why? Because Labour councillors are the last thing between the people and the cuts.
"With Labour you can vote against an independence referendum, but you can also vote for high quality public services."
