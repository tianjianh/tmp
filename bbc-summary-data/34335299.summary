[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janet McKay, who has dementia, was last seen by neighbours in Dykebar Avenue, in the Knightswood area of Glasgow, at about 12:00 on 16 September.
Police said Ms McKay's family were very distressed at her disappearance and there were concerns for her safety.
Officers will return to the Knightswood area at noon on Wednesday to speak to pedestrians and motorists.
Police have also issued images of a light cream jacket and brown handbag Ms McKay had when she went missing.
She is also believed to have been wearing dark trousers, dark maroon boots and could possibly have a pink jacket with her.
Ms McKay is described as white, 4ft 10in tall, with a slight build and short grey/white hair.
Ch Insp John McBride said: "Her family are devastated and very distressed at her disappearance, and just want to get her home safe and well as soon as possible.
"We've been co-ordinating a number of searches in areas that Janet may be or have travelled to, but unfortunately these have proved unsuccessful.
"The support we've received from the local community and beyond has been a great help, and thousands of people have shared her image online along with the appeal."
He said police had been working with bus companies as Ms McKay was known to travel around the city centre as well as around Knightswood, Scotstoun and Govan, and further afield to the Largs and Helensburgh areas.
Ch Insp McBride reiterated an appeal for bus users to keep an eye out for her.
"We've also circulated Janet's image and description to the charity Missing People, who have been able to issue this image to Royal Mail delivery staff via their handheld personal digital assistants and they are arranging for her image to be displayed in their digi-boards in train stations," he added.
"I would like to strongly reiterate our appeal to the public, please help us by sharing Janet's image online. If you live in the areas that Janet was last seen or in an area she may have travelled to, please check any outbuildings or sheds you might have as she may have taken refuge in there.
"Please look at the image of the jacket and the bag - do they ring a bell with you? Have you seen a lady matching Janet's description wearing any of these items?
"Please contact police immediately on 101, as you may have vital information which could help us."
