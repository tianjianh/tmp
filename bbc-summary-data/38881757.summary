Laurence May converted a 78th-minute penalty try to secure a 25-24 victory.
"We looked pretty sluggish. The areas we normally get energy - the tackling and the kick chase - just weren't quite there," Paver told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I'm super-pleased we sneaked it in the end, but I felt we shouldn't have been in that position."
The Pirates were struggling before tries from Alex Cheesman and Toby May set up a nail-biting finale.
"All credit to Scottish. They came out there and gave us a good arm-wrestle," said Paver.
"A couple of the guys will have some serious conversations. I want to know where our physicality went. It's something I demand.
"All that said, the character to come back [was there]. I'm disappointed with the performance, but the result has put a cherry on the top."
