The world number two will now face Canadian fourth seed Milos Raonic, who he beat in the Wimbledon final in July.
The Scot, who served 10 aces, will attempt to stretch his career-best winning streak to 22 matches.
"I knew that coming straight from the Olympics I was going to be tired but I've still managed to win," he said.
"I played the big points well and that was the difference. That comes from winning big matches and making better decisions."
In the other semi-final Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic will face unseeded Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov.
