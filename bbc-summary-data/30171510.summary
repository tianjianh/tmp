Rosberg's hopes ended in the season finale in Abu Dhabi as he suffered car problems while trailing Hamilton in second place and came home 14th.
"I'm very disappointed but all in all Lewis deserved to win the championship. That's clear," said the 29 year-old German driver.
"All in all he just did a better job than me, especially in the races."
Rosberg won five races this year, compared to Hamilton's 11.

Needing to win in Abu Dhabi and hope that Hamilton finished lower than second, Rosberg lost the lead at the start of the race and was unable to challenge the Briton even before his car hit trouble with a failed hybrid system.
"What happened to me had no impact on (the championship)," Rosberg said. "He was out there winning the race."
Rosberg said he would take confidence into 2015 from the fact that he had out-qualified Hamilton 11 times to seven this season, winning him the new pole position trophy.
"The positive is that I have been the better qualifier over the two years," Rosberg said.
"His level is massively high. He was the best on the grid this year. I was up against him. I came very close. It didn't work out but I'm proud to be here.
"It has been an incredible year and to be able to battle it out with Lewis has been great, although very intense sometimes.

"It was an intense battle but a great battle. It has been a great challenge for me. Sometimes it was not enjoyable - but all in all, a great year."
The two drivers' relationship has been tested this year by some controversial moments but Rosberg went up to the pre-podium room to congratulate Hamilton and embrace him.
"Nico put on an incredible fight throughout the year," Hamilton said. "He was an incredible competitor.
"I'm sad to know his car wasn't quick enough so he couldn't fight but he came up to congratulate me just now.
"He came into the room, very professional, and I just said: 'Fantastic.' He said: 'You drove really well.' Same for him all year, especially in qualifying."

Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, asked if the best man had won the title, said: "Yes. He won 11 races this year - an outstanding performance.
"Nico did the perfect race again today. I'm really upset about what happened.
"We need to check the issue, which can happen but that it had to happen today, with one winning and one losing, is a bit tough."
