[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rabat will become the first African city to host a Diamond League meeting later this year, but New York has been dropped from the calendar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Moroccan capital will host this season's third meeting on 22 May.
IAAF president Lord Coe said in a statement: "We are pleased to be able to take our premier athletics series into a new continental area."
The New York organisers said they would look to produce a new event, with a "street meet" under consideration.
The United States retains one Diamond League meeting in Eugene, Oregon.
Morocco has previously hosted other IAAF events, including the 2014 Intercontinental Cup in Marrakech.
