The 22-year-old joined the Glovers from Leicester City on a one-year contract last summer and made 11 appearances in all competitions in 2016-17.
"Jonny is a good young keeper with huge potential," boss Darren Way told the club website.
"He was thrown in and had to play a major contribution. He's a fantastic character, works extremely hard and I'm sure he has a bright future."
