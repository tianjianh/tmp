BBC Three has commissioned a sequel to the documentary My Brother The Islamist, after the film's subject was jailed for plotting terror attacks.

Muslim convert Richard Dart was jailed in April after pleading guilty to terrorism charges.
His extremist beliefs were laid bare in the 2011 programme, which was made by his step-brother, Robb Leech.
My Brother the Terrorist, will examine how British extremists become disconnected with society.
Producer Ray Tostevin of Grace Productions, said it is "a very timely film", given the world's political climate.
"Since Robb made the original film, he has even more reason to find out what causes people to go from having radical beliefs to doing certain things that have irrevocable consequences," added Tostevin.
Tostevin said Leech has had to overcome concerns from his family to make another film, following Dart's imprisonment in April and the subsequent events in Woolwich, south-east London when Drummer Lee Rigby was killed by two men who were subsequently shot by police.
Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, east London, and Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, south-east London, are accused of murder.
"Within a matter of weeks of his step-brother going to jail, Woolwich happened and Robb felt compelled to make another film," said Tostevin.
"There are lots of questions around how we deal with people who have become disconnected with society and radicalised. Robb is able to examine the issues in a way no one else can do," he added.
My Brother the Terrorist will contain footage obtained during the making of the original documentary.
Leech also hopes to speak to the radical cleric, Anjem Choudary, who refused to condemn the attack on Drummer Lee Rigby during an interview on BBC Newsnight, days after the attack.
His journey also includes meeting some of Dart's friends, including people who have been radicalised as well as those who have become de-radicalised.
BBC Three controller Zai Bennett said: "In My Brother The Islamist, first-time film-maker Robb Leech delivered an incredible insight into his step-brother's radicalisation.
"Richard Dart has since been imprisoned for preparing acts of terrorism and I feel it's fitting for Robb to bring BBC Three an update on this extraordinary story."
Dart, who has changed his name to Salahuddin al Britani, was jailed along with two other men for six years in April for engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism.
His wife, Ayan Hadi, 31 and from West Acton, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence in July, for failing to give police information about her husband.
My Brother the Terrorist is expected to air on BBC Three in 2014.
