Joe Leach: Worcestershire must rise to occasion in One-Day Cup semi-final

Worcestershire captain Joe Leach has called on his side to "show how good they are" in the One-Day Cup semi-final against Surrey at New Road on Saturday.

Victory for Worcestershire would see the county reach a first Lord's final since 2004.
Leach's side have endured a difficult fortnight with the departure of batsman Tom Kohler-Cadmore and successive defeats in the County Championship.
"I want our guys to be vibrant and rise to the occasion," said Leach.
Worcestershire began the season with four Championship victories and topped the North Group of the One-Day Cup, losing only one of their eight matches.
After Kohler-Cadmore announced he was leaving New Road to join Yorkshire, Worcestershire slipped to a heavy defeat at Sussex and also lost to Glamorgan after letting slip a strong position.
"It's a big game, there's no getting away from that, but if we can rise to the occasion and really show off how good we are at the format then we'll have absolutely no problem," Leach, 26, told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"My message is very much one of confidence. We topped that North Group and played some very good cricket in that month of one-day cricket.
"We've got Surrey coming here to what I hope will be a packed New Road. It's our ground, it's our turf and our support and we fully expect to put in a good performance and win the game."
Moeen Ali, Jason Roy, Jake Ball and Alex Hales have all been made available to play for their counties following England's Champions Trophy exit on Wednesday.
Worcestershire all-rounder Moeen and Surrey opener Roy are expected to take part at New Road, while Nottinghamshire pair Hales and Ball could feature in Friday's semi-final against Essex at Chelmsford on Friday.
Playing in their first home semi-final in 14 years, Worcestershire are looking to reach a first Lord's final since the second of their two successive Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy final losses to Gloucestershire in 2004.
The only member of that cup run still playing, Gareth Batty, will be captaining Surrey, although two of the hosts' current coaching team, director of cricket Steve Rhodes and his assistant Matt Mason were part of that Worcestershire side.
