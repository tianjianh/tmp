AFC Wimbledon will investigate an incident between a club volunteer and Charlton boss Karl Robinson at the end of Saturday's 1-1 draw.

Robinson was confronted as the teams left the pitch, and had to be restrained.
"This does not reflect well on anyone," said chief executive Erik Samuelson.
"Any abusive remark by a volunteer towards an opposition employee is completely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated."
Robinson previously spent six years in charge of MK Dons, the club which resulted from Wimbledon FC's relocation from south London to Milton Keynes in September 2003.
AFC Wimbledon was formed in 2002 after permission was granted for Wimbledon FC to move, and worked their way up the non-league pyramid before reaching the Football League in 2011.
The Addicks boss, 36, told BBC Radio London the comment directed towards him "breaks all boundaries of football".
"We were very aware that the presence at the game of Mr Robinson represented a risk, because many of our fans feel he was very disrespectful of our club in his time [at Milton Keynes]," Samuelson added in a statement on the club website.
"For that reason we went out of our way to avoid any incidents. We will complete our investigation before reaching a final conclusion."
Meanwhile, Wimbledon are also set to investigate a coin-throwing incident from the Charlton supporters' area, which resulted in an assistant referee being hit on the back of the head.
Samuelson said the League One club are studying CCTV footage, to identify who committed what he described as a "reckless act".
