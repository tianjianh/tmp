Incinerator legal action 'only option left', says council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A newly-launched legal challenge to plans for a £500m incinerator near Gloucester was the "only option" left open, Stroud District Council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The action will challenge the government's decision to approve the plans which had previously been refused by Stroud and Gloucestershire councils.
District and county councillor Steve Lydon said: "It's a sad move but we have no other alternative."
Developer Balfour Beatty wants to build the waste plant at Javelin Park.
Mr Lydon said the council was in the process of issuing legal proceedings which he said would "cost up to £25,000" but had a good chance of success.
Last month, the government approved the proposals despite opposition from Gloucestershire County and Stroud District councils.
The deputy leader of Gloucestershire County Council, Ray Theodoulou, said: "Any judicial review would have to be about the way the secretary of state reached his decision, not about the merits of the scheme itself.
"We understand that one of the reasons the decision was delayed was because the Department for Communities and Local Government were keen to ensure it was robust, and not at significant risk of legal challenge."
The legal challenge has been welcomed by campaigners at Glos Vain, as it will temporarily halt any building work.
Campaigners say the incinerator will create toxic emissions and ruin the local landscape.
Balfour Beatty has said it is "disappointed" with the legal action but will co-operate fully with the process.
