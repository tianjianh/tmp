[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman accused of neglecting young son in Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been accused of wilfully neglecting and ill-treating her two-year-old son who died in February 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda Hardie was living in Inverness at the time of the alleged offences. She now lives in East Kilbride.
Between January 2012 and February 2014, Ms Hardie, 30, was alleged to have left her son Clyde for prolonged periods unattended.
She has also been accused of failing to provide him with adequate food and fluids. She denies the accusations.
Other allegations Ms Hardie faces include causing Clyde to be exposed to electrical fire and chemical hazards and allowing their home to become dirty and strewn with domestic, human and animal waste.
The charges also allege that she failed to bathe and clothe him adequately and allowed his clothing to become dirty and malodorous, and failing to change his nappy so it became excessively filled with urine and faeces.
Appearing at Inverness Sheriff Court, Ms Hardie denied the charges. Trial was fixed for 21 March.
