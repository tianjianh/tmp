Prof Naveed Sattar on his desire to correct medical practice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prof Naveed Sattar's research into metabolic medicine has had an impact and influence around the world but his desire to correct errors in clinical practice is not always well received.

When he was a young boy, the man who would become a University of Glasgow professor and a leading expert in diabetes and cardio-vascular disease research says his "highly competitive nature" led to tantrums if he did not win at whatever he was doing.
Prof Sattar told Stark Talk he was still competitive but he hoped that he was managing to channel it better.
He says: "In research the competitiveness is still there and you have to be competitive because there are big teams from Oxford and Cambridge and Boston who will just roll over you."
The world of medical research is a tough fight for funding and influence but Prof Sattar says he aims for more than that.
"What I am keen to do is write papers that correct people's clinical knowledge in a way that improves practice," he says.
Medical experts are not always keen on being corrected, especially in public, but he says he does not mind upsetting people.
"I care more about them doing the right thing for their patients," he says.
"If it happens to upset certain people, well I think that's their problem."
There are numerous examples of Prof Sattar standing up in front of the medical experts and using his research to correct them.
He cites the example of the clinical use "metabolic syndrome" to simultaneously predict the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
"Eventually a light struck in my head and I thought 'this is completely wrong'," he says.
"I thought 'they are putting together a criteria that is trying to predict two diseases in one. That doesn't work'."
Prof Sattar addressed a room full of experts from major charities and eminent professors and said: "I'm sorry gentlemen and ladies but this is complete nonsense."
"At the very end of it, the chairman, who is very eminent and I won't say his name, said 'Naveed, shut up and sit down'."
Of course, he did not leave it there. He phoned medical journal The Lancet and said "if you want to kill this thing I have the data".
They looked into his claims, got more data and published it.
Prof Sattar says: "It has been heavily cited and it has helped among other things to wipe this thing out of the clinical scenario. I felt good about that."
Prof Sattar was born in Wales to Pakistani parents but grew up in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire.
He studied medicine in Glasgow, and despite his work being highly valued and sought after across the world, he has chosen to stay in the city he loves.
However, his relationship with medicine almost ended before it began.
After he finished studying medicine and did his initial one year of training he left the profession and became an accountant.
"But after 12 weeks of doing accountancy I realised that medicine wasn't so bad after all," he says.
The problem, Prof Sattar says, was with the clinical side of medicine.
No-one in his family had a medical background and he found himself lacking confidence when carrying out procedures.
He says: "I was fine for the first two years of study which were the scientific aspects but as soon as we got to the clinical I was a lost soul, I didn't think I could do it."
He grew in confidence when he worked in cardiology at Edinburgh Royal but it was a job with Professor James Shepherd, a world-leading pioneer in the investigation of the causes, prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, that gave him his true calling.
"In the first few months of doing that I discovered something new called research," he says.
"Everything up until then had been learning facts and patterns of disease but here was a new phenomenon called research in which we did not know the answer to specific questions.
"We had to define experiments to improve our knowledge in a specific area and as a result maybe improve patient management, and that I found incredibly refreshing."
Prof Sattar's time in Edinburgh might not have given him the career path he wished for but he did meet his wife Lindsay while he was there.
His parents had wanted him to have an arranged marriage so he kept his wedding to a woman from outside their culture, and even the birth of his first child, secret from them.
"I feel really bad about this. My poor mother and my sisters first knew that I was married when I presented at their door with my nine-month-old son," he says.
"Once this had come out, my parents quickly adjusted their mindsets."
Prof Sattar says he has always been "more Westernised" than most of his siblings but there is one aspect of his heritage his work has forced him to confront.
He is hoping to write a "definitive review" of the mechanisms of why South Asians in the UK are more likely to get diabetes than European whites.
He says: "I realised I had to improve my diet because we did a research study and of all the respondents in that study I had the highest level of blood insulin which meant my pancreas was working really hard to keep my sugar down. That is because I had too much fat in the wrong places.
"I then realised my mother had diabetes, my two uncles had developed diabetes in their 30s and I thought 'I'm on the fast-track to diabetes'."
He cut out chips and sugary drinks and "redeveloped a taste for more fruit and veg".
However, he says he was in a "very privileged position" that as a doctor who lived in a nice environment he could afford to make the changes.
He says: "If you put me back in Blantyre, in some of the communities I grew up in, there is an abundance of fast food, they haven't been given the potential to develop taste buds and palate for the good foods because they have never been exposed to them.
"Their palates are programmed for sugary drinks, fatty foods and that's what their body cries out for.
"What we have to break is changing the food environment. More healthy foods at cheaper prices and making unhealthy foods much more expensive.
"That's a tough ask and I don't think the government are ready to make those changes."
