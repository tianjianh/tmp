The body was found in Highgate Road, Brierley Hill, on Thursday.
Maxine Jarrousse-Jones, prosecuting, said: "The wardrobe was opened and a young female was found inside, deceased, and had been there a considerable amount of time - at least a couple of weeks."
Megan's family said they were "devastated by the loss".
In a statement released by police, Megan's family said: "Whilst nothing can fill the huge gap in our family life that Megan's passing has left, we trust that in time we will have answers that will help us understand why this dreadful event has occurred."
Formal identification has yet to take place, West Midlands Police said.
