The hosts led 5-0 at the break as Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott, Jane Ross, Jen Beattie and Kosovare Asllani scored.
England striker Toni Duggan added a sixth from close range late on.
Nick Cushing's side, who have not conceded in their first five league games of 2016, have played two games more than second-placed Chelsea.
Doncaster, meanwhile, remain without a point from three WSL 1 games.

Manchester City and England defender Lucy Bronze: "It was good to score and get the game rolling.
"In a lot of other games we've not really capitalised on our early chances and that's left us digging ourselves out of a hole in order to get the result.
"Chelsea have two games in hand on us but our next game is against Chelsea and if we can beat them away, who's to say we can't keep that lead at the top?
"We know they are beatable and we know we can score against them and if we can tighten up at the back who's to say we can't stop them?"
Doncaster Rovers Belles midfielder Kasia Lipka: "We're still learning and obviously you can't afford to make mistakes at this level.
"Last season we could have a bad first half and just pick it up in the second half but you can't do that against these players.
"There is a massive jump in standard and obviously a lot of us have gone full time which is a big step up as well and we're still getting used to it.
"We've played Chelsea, Manchester City and have Arsenal coming up so it's a hard start but we'll learn from it."
