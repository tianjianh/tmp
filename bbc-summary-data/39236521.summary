Celtic Dragons team manager Sarah Roberts says her side are capable of securing their first win of the season when they face Manchester Thunder.

The Dragons have lost all three of their Super League games so far this season and remain bottom of the table.
"It might not be the start we wanted but we know what we are capable of," Roberts told BBC Wales Sport.
"Saturday is our opportunity to perform for the full 60 minutes and hopefully come away with that win."
She continued: "What we do differently in the Dragons is that we have got young players coming through and we are developing future players for Wales. It's not all about the results every season."
Manchester Thunder are former Superleague champions but have won only one of their three games this season.
"They are not a team to take lightly. We know Manchester Thunder are a strong team. We know from their past history what they are capable of," Roberts added.
"Neither of us have had the starts we have wanted to the season so it will be a big game for both teams."
The Superleague has introduced three new teams this season; Scottish Sirens, Severn Stars and Coventry-based Wasps making ten franchises in total.
The Dragons played against the Sirens in a new Super Ten event in February where all ten franchises competed in the same venue on one day.
'Super Ten was a fantastic event. All ten teams playing in one venue in Birmingham in front of a huge crowd. The players in the league would never have played in front of such a big capacity before."
"It is fantastic to see there is so much interest in netball at the moment. New clubs are developing everyday. The more coverage we can get for women and girls in sport, not just netball, the better."
