[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Bradshaw struck a neat, late equaliser as Walsall came from behind to sneak a draw against League One promotion rivals Coventry City.

Defender Chris Stokes headed City in front on 34 minutes when he met Adam Armstrong's aerial flick-on from Joe Cole's free-kick on the left.
But Bradshaw got on the end of Rico Henry's left-wing near-post cross to steer home left-footed on the volley.
Walsall were earlier indebted to a string of saves from Neil Etheridge.
But, after Bradshaw's 81st-minute leveller, his 13th goal of the season, it was the home side who were left desperately hanging on in injury time.
Walsall stay third, within two points of top spot, a point ahead of fourth-placed City, who now host leaders Burton at the Ricoh this Saturday.
In a well contested, but largely uninspiring first half, City led at the break after Walsall paid a heavy price for on-loan Manchester City midfielder George Evans' unnecessary free-kick, for a foul on Jacob Murphy.
From Cole's well-floated dead-ball delivery, Armstrong flicked for Stokes to steal in at the far post among a pile of bodies and bravely head home.
City midfielder Jim O'Brien was just wide either side of the break before visiting keeper Etheridge turned away a James Maddison free-kick, then came up with an even better save to deny League One top scorer Armstrong. But, in a superb final 20 minutes, Walsall found enough in the tank to earn a share of the spoils.
City's gate of 15, 671 was their second highest of the season at the Ricoh Arena, bettered only by the Boxing Day game against Port Vale.
It was also higher than the gates for six of the 11 Championship games taking place on Tuesday night.
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"For an hour, we've controlled the game. It seemed the team pressing for the goals was us and we had several chances to put the game to bed. If they go in, we take the points I'm sure.
"I think I'm right in saying they've scored with their first shot on target so it's hugely frustrating when we've had numerous chances at the other end. The dressing room is hugely disappointed.
"Give credit to Walsall though. They're a good side who play football really well. And, with the goal they scored, they've showed why they're at the top end of the league."
Walsall manager Sean O'Driscoll told BBC WM 95.6:
"We thoroughly deserved a draw. We showed great character to come back after going in one down at half time. We played fantastically second half, both defensively and with our attacking play.
"It was a well worked goal that got us level. That sort of ball into the box on a wet night is always tough to deal with.
"And our keeper was terrific. He goes under the radar sometimes but he's performed fantastically. There might be times when people say he's made a mistake because he's come for something that he shouldn't have. But, overall, people would prefer that. He's developing into a fine keeper."
