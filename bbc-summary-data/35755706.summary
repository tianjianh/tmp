The mystery identity of Swansea's own secret Santa has finally been revealed by his family, after the 92-year-old died this week.

For almost 60 years Tom Bravin dressed up as Father Christmas to distribute presents to over 4,500 underprivileged children around the city.
The former RAF communications worker shunned praise and kept his identity a secret, calling himself Mr X.
Friends and family have vowed to carry on Mr Bravin's work in his memory.
When the strain of personally delivering so many gifts became too much for him, Mr Bravin recruited "Santa's Little Helpers", who in turn were sworn to secrecy.
Mr Bravin's son Terry said: "What a legacy he's left us - I am really proud of him.
"We have got a team of people to make sure his appeal is still going."
Neighbour Kat Thomas added: "What a kind heart. He brought so much joy to so many children and I will continue to support this cause as long as it is running."
