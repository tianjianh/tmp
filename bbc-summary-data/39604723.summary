Andy Lonergan is likely to stay in goal in place of Carl Ikeme (hamstring).
Blackburn's battle against the drop is bolstered by having five players back.
Keeper Jason Steele and defenders Darragh Lenihan and Gordon Greer are back in training along with two former Wolves players, the versatile Charlie Mulgrew and striker Danny Graham.
Wolves secured their Championship status with their Easter Monday win at Leeds but 22nd-placed Blackburn are in trouble, a point behind Nottingham Forest, who entertain Reading, and three behind Birmingham City, who do not play until Sunday.
Following Walter Zenga's sacking three days earlier, Wolves were still under the caretaker management of Rob Edwards when they drew 1-1 at Ewood Park in late October, with Paul Lambert appointed as head coach a week later.

Four points out of six over Easter have given Rovers more cause for optimism than perhaps they had before.
A defeat this weekend, might not be the end for Rovers' survival hopes, but it's accepted by Tony Mowbray that they are reliant on other clubs to slip up.
The potential returns of Charlie Mulgrew, Darragh Lenihan and Danny Graham are enormous boosts, when it had looked like, particularly the defenders wouldn't play again this season.
With Birmingham not playing until Sunday, Rovers know a win will see them climb out of the bottom three, maybe for less than twenty-four hours.  But, psychologically it could be huge for a squad who've spent so much of the season below the dotted line.
