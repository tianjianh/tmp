Kneen, 28, will race for the team at the North West 200, Isle of Man TT and Ulster Grand Prix meetings.
"I just wish it was the beginning of the season now. The bikes are definitely good enough for the job," said the Manx man.
Kneen's career to date has included a victory at the 2014 Ulster Grand Prix at Dundrod.
The 2014 campaign also saw him winning the Irish Superbike Championship while he has achieved a dozen top-10 finishes at the Isle of Man TT.
"He has won at the Ulster Grand, he lapped the TT at 130mph last year and was running top sixes before mechanical issues at the North West 200 so he is perfectly capable of challenging for International honours with us," said Mar-Train team boss Tim Martin.
"He fits in well with our team structure and I am looking forward to getting out testing and working with him."
Kneen, who raced the Padgett's Honda team this year, burst onto the road racing scene in 2008 when he became the first newcomer to win three races in a week at the Manx Grand Prix.
