Lawro's opening weekend Premier League predictions v Blossoms

Blossoms singer and guitarist Tom is a former Manchester City season ticket holder, who grew up idolising former striker Paul Dickov.
"I wrote his name on the back of my City shirt in black marker," Ogden told BBC Sport. My mum wasn't too happy about that.
"I don't miss those days when we were struggling, though. You want to be winning the league, don't you? Dickov is still my hero because he was playing for us when I first got into football but Sergio Aguero is the man.
"Obviously there is a charm in being everyone's second favourite team when you are in Division One but I much prefer to be where we are now, with Pep Guardiola as manager and having won the title twice in the past four years."
Bass player Charlie supports his home town team despite County's drop into non-league football, but also follows Liverpool.
"I'm biased but I'd love to see us win the league," he explained. "That's not just because I am a fan but for Jurgen Klopp's sake - I think he is such a character, he is good for the game."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
