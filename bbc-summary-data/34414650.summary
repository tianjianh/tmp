An original tape of The Beatles performing at The Cavern Club in Liverpool in 1962 has been found after 50 years languishing in a desk drawer.

It features the Fab Four playing Some Other Guy in September 1962, four weeks before their debut single came out.
It was recorded after the group were filmed for Granada TV's Know The North, but was never broadcast.
The tape was kept by TV producer Johnnie Hamp, who will auction it for charity in Liverpool on 4 November.

The recording was done because the sound quality on the TV footage was so bad. Granada sent a sound engineer back to the Cavern just to record audio, which was to be dubbed onto the film.
But due to legal issues with other acts on the show, the programme was not screened.
However, The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein was so impressed with the recording that he asked for five acetate discs to be pressed from the tape to use as promotion.
The whereabouts of four of the acetates are unknown, but the fifth was sold at auction in 1993 for Â£16,000 to Apple Records, the label set up by The Beatles in 1968.
The tape kept by Johnnie Hamp will be sold by auctioneer Adam Partridge.
