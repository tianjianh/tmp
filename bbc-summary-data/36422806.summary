Manager Chris Coleman says Bale could face Sweden but dismissed injury fears.
The 26-year-old suffered with cramp late on in Real's win over Atletico Madrid.
"We'll see how the trip to Stockholm is physically and mentally before we decide whether he starts or comes on," he said.
Coleman continued: "In the Champions League he went down with a bit of cramp and we were going 'oh here we go' but thankfully he was OK.
"We haven't had Gareth since the Andorra game [in October] which seems like a long time now."
Bale nor Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey took part in  in full training on Wednesday.
Joe Ledley, Joe Allen and Hal Robson-Kanu all have injuries and did not take part in full training although midfielders Ledley and Allen trained on their own.
The trio will miss Sunday's friendly againts Sweden in Stockholm, with Emyr Huws and Wes Burns now travelling to France to provide cover to the trio.
Coleman is monitoring midfielders Ledley, who suffered a fractured leg in Crystal Palace's 2-1 win against Stoke City on 7 May, and Allen as well as forward Robson-Kanu with the trio now fighting to be fit for Wales' opening game against Slovakia on 11 June.
Wales also face England on 16 June and Russia on 20 June in their Group B fixtures.
"If we needed to really push the players we could, but we don't need to do that," Coleman told BBC Wales Sport.
"Hal and Joe won't play in Sweden. We know what we are getting prepared for. The injured players' rehab will be lined up to get them training with us the week leading up to Slovakia."
Coleman, who recently signed a new deal to stay as Wales boss, says Ledley is ahead of schedule in terms of his rehabilitation after including him in his 23 man squad and even thinks he could be fit for Wales' opening game.
"At the moment he is looking very good," Coleman added, "He's a little bit further ahead than where we expected and physically he is looking fantastic, probably the best I have seen him.
"It is a credit to Joe that he is ahead of the curve for this type of injury.
"We have between now and Slovakia and let's hope we see an improvement and he keeps going the way he has been going and he will be available for us.
"It would be an incredible credit to him and the medical team for getting him ready."
