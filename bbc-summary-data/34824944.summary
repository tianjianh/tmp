Bobby Zamora put the visitors in front from close range on 58 seconds after Tomer Hemed's shot hit the bar.
Andre Gray equalised from the penalty spot three minutes later, his 11th goal of the season, after Lewis Dunk pulled Michael Keane's shirt.
Both sides had chances to win it, with Burnley's Chris Long poking the best opportunity wide in injury time.
Chris Hughton's Brighton, who have now drawn eight of their league matches this season, remain second but are level on points with leaders Hull, while the Clarets stay fifth.
Burnley, forced into their first change in five games with Rouwen Hennings coming in for the injured Sam Vokes, had barely touched the ball when they fell behind.
The Clarets' defence failed to clear, which left Zamora the simplest of tap-ins for the 178th goal of his career.
After Gray's composed penalty levelled matters, the game flowed from end to end inside the opening 20 minutes as Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale pulled off two fine saves and Hemed smashed over.
Things eventually settled down either side of the break but came to life again in the closing stages as both sides went in search of a winner.
Burnley's Scott Arfield dragged a shot inches past the post while unmarked before substitute Long stabbed off target when he should have done better.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"Brighton are a good side and they've made a mark for themselves this season by being unbeaten.
"We've opened up enough chances to win the game. But it was a very close game between two even sides I feel.
"The good thing I like about this group is they don't take knocks to heart. They come and react immediately and I thought they did. I thought we were on the front foot for a lot of the game against a good side."
Brighton boss Chris Hughton:

"I thought it was a fair result actually. After two very early goals, I suppose a lot of people might have thought it was going to be that type of game.
"But you've got two teams here that are both motivated and want to try and win and certainly don't want to lose.
"I think on the balance of play it was a fair result, particularly with us being the away team and Burnley being a very good team."
