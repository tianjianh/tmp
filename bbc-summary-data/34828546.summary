Flights, trains and ferries into and out of France are all running a normal service, but have warned passengers to allow extra time for border controls.
French financial markets will also open as usual on Monday, stock exchange operator Euronext has confirmed.
However, some major tourist attractions, including the Eiffel Tower and Disneyland Paris, remain closed.
The Eiffel Tower is closed until further notice, as a security precaution, while Disneyland Paris is expected to reopen on Wednesday.
The theme park said the decision had been taken "in support of our community and the victims of these horrendous attacks".
Department store Galeries Lafayette briefly opened its three stores in the capital on Saturday to show "its will to resist in the face of terror", but later closed them, saying it was difficult to provide a good service for customers.
However, it plans to reopen them as normal on Monday.
Smaller businesses have also continued to operate.
Mihaela Iordache, who manages the 10 Belles coffee shop, just around the corner from the attacks in the 11th arrondissement, said she planned to donate all of Sunday's profit to the Red Cross for the work it does with immigrants.
She said Saturday was very quiet, but people "went crazy" at home and had come out on Sunday. "They're queuing out on to the street from the cafe", she told the BBC.
The Euro 2016 football finals in France are expected to go ahead as planned next summer.
The tournament final is due to be held on 10 July at the Stade de France, outside where three suicide bombs were detonated on Friday.
Cancelling the finals would be "playing the game of the terrorists", tournament organiser Jacques Lambert told French radio station RTL.
Despite initial appearances, some have warned that both tourist and business visits to Paris will inevitably suffer in the aftermath of the attacks.
"Companies have to continue to do business, but for some period of time they'll give employees a lot of leeway about travelling to Europe and Paris in particular," said Kevin Mitchell, who runs US advocacy group the Business Travel Coalition.
Tourist visits to Paris had already been affected by three days of attacks in early January, when Islamist gunmen murdered 18 people after attacking satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a Jewish supermarket and a policewoman on patrol.
The Paris tourist office said the number of hotel stays had fallen 3.3% in the first three months of the year as a result.
