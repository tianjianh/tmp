Hundreds of motorcyclists, many wearing Santa Claus suits, took to the streets of Cambridge earlier to deliver gifts to sick children in a city hospital.

The Cambridge Bikers' Christmas Toy Run was organised by Peter Vasey, from Ely.
About 250 motorbikes made the 45-minute trip from Harlton to Addenbrooke's Hospital carrying donated toys.
"We're talking about a large number of toys and if that can bring a smile to someone, well that's great," Mr Vasey said.
It is the second time the group has organised a "Santa run", and Mr Vasey said it had been "incredibly popular".
Many of the participants brought their own toys along for the nine-mile trip, but others were donated to the group by businesses and individuals.
Mr Vasey worked closely with staff at Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust, who will help to give out the toys, to organise this year's event.
