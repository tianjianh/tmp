[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harrad and 20-year-old Evans have signed deals until January having spent pre-season training with the National League side.
Ex-Notts County player Harrad was a free agent after finishing the 2015-16 season at Torquay, who were keen to re-sign the 31-year-old.
Evans had been on trial following his release from Championship club Fulham.
The Dragons are also finalising a deal to sign Nottingham Forest striker Gerry McDonagh on a month's loan.
McDonagh, 18, has appeared once for Forest's first team, coming on as a substitute against Cardiff City in August 2015.
