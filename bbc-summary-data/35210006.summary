The 29-year-old man was held at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam at about 09:00 GMT, the airport confirmed.
People in one check-in line were evacuated from Terminal 3 during the incident for a "maximum of half an hour, if that", a spokeswoman added.
Pictures on social media showed a man lying on the floor as officers pointed rifles at him.
The airport spokeswoman said the security control area remained open throughout the incident and people in other queues were not affected.
