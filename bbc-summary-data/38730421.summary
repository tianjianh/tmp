Taunton £21m road delays could cost an extra £10m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Delays to a major road in Taunton will cost £10m more to complete with a row over who will pay the extra cost.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Inner Distributor Road (NIDR), which links the east and west of the town, is two years behind schedule and should have cost £21m.
Somerset County Council said the delays are disgraceful and the contractor it appointed is "failing to deliver".
The contractors, Carillion, said it will continue to work closely with the council to complete the project.
Both sides blame each other for the delays which is understood to be partly over technical problems with a bridge.
The BBC understands it will cost at least £10m on top of the original £21m but now both sides are in a legal battle over who will pay the extra.
County council leader, Conservative John Osman, said he could not comment on the legal row but added he "would not give any ground" to Carillion.
"I have a duty to protect the taxpayers' pounds and I will do my best to protect that.
"They [Carillion] want extra money. I'm not a charitable person, I'm not prepared to give it," Mr Osman said.
A spokesman for Carillion said: "We continue to work closely with the council to complete the NIDR and to resolve our differences with Somerset County Council."
The scheme is linked to the planned regeneration of the Firepool area in Taunton, which relies on the new road for better access.
