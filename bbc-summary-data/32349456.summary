The daughter of a man murdered in Cambridgeshire 25 years ago said she "can't understand why anyone would want to hurt him".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Bedford, 27, from Huntingdon, was last seen at 18:20 BST on Friday 28 September 1990 at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte, Ramsey.
Police believe he was shot dead that evening. His body has not been found.
Daughter Lesley Bedford, 29, and sister Linda Adley, 45, have appealed for information about his death.
Ms Adley, from Ramsey, said: "Until there is a body or any kind of remains I cannot and will not believe Andrew is dead."
She said the family needed to know what had happened to Mr Bedford "to let us lay him to rest and say our goodbyes properly".
The investigation into Mr Bedford's disappearance was relaunched as a murder inquiry a week ago.
On Tuesday officers investigating the cold case murder started digging an area near to where he was last seen alive.
"New intelligence" led them to "pinpoint" Stocking Fen Road in Ramsey to look for "evidence of how Andrew was killed or where his remains are", Det Sgt Gordon Blair said.
Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car.
He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in (1.72m), medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.
The prime suspect for the shooting is now dead, "but others who were involved have never been brought to justice", a police spokesman said.
Three people were arrested at the time but no-one was charged.
