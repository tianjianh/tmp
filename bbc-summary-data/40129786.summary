Golden State led 60-52 after the first two quarters and went on a 10-0 run at the start of the second half en route to victory.
"A little gun shy with our shots. Our defence allowed us to create momentum until we got our flow," said Curry.
The Cavaliers had 20 turnovers, a joint NBA record for a play-off or Finals game.
The Warriors committed just four, level with the record for the fewest in a Finals game.
Golden State beat Cleveland in the 2015 Finals but let a 3-1 lead slip last year against LeBron James' Cavaliers, who won their first NBA title.
The teams will meet again in Oakland on Sunday for game two of the best-of-seven series.
