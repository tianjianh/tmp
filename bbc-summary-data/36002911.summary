[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 0-2 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nahki Wells' volley and a Matt Kilgallon own goal helped Huddersfield earn a comfortable win at Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blackburn defender Shane Duffy misjudged a header back to his own keeper to allow Wells to fire the Terriers ahead before half-time.
The visitors extended their lead after the break, Kilgallon turning in Harry Bunn's cross under pressure from Wells.
Danny Graham headed wide from 12 yards out for Blackburn, who have now not won in four games.
Paul Lambert's side dropped to 18th in the table - nine points clear of the relegation zone - while Huddersfield climbed to sixth courtesy of a first win at Ewood Park since 1986.
Simeon Jackson fired over early on for Rovers, who continued to create chances after falling two goals behind.
However, they rarely tested goalkeeper Jed Steer as Huddersfield recorded a third successive clean sheet away from home.
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert:
"The thing was we were the architects of our own downfall today. The first goal was a catalyst.
"One thing about the game of football, you've got to play with enthusiasm and be ready for matches and their two goals summed up our afternoon.
"I thought there was a lack of energy today."
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"Of course the first goal was a mistake but Nahki Wells showed a good nose that he smelled something could happen and he was there, so all in all I think it was a good performance.
"I'm very proud, happy and satisfied with what we showed today and the result. I think we deserved it.
"As important that Nahki scores again today, is that, like in the past, he's our first defender.
"Nahki helps the team massively with his work in the defence and the team try to help him get chances and score."
