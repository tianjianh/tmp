Tube announcements will be halted and buses brought to a standstill during a minute's silence to mark the 10th anniversary of the 7 July bombings.

The national silence will take place at 11:30 BST during a service at St Paul's Cathedral, and will be observed across the capital's public transport network.
Fifty-two people died and hundreds were injured when bombs exploded on three Tubes and a bus in 2005.
The Duke of York will attend the service with survivors of the attack.
Relatives of those who died, members of the emergency services and the London Mayor will also be present at the cathedral.
Transport for London (TfL) said Tube services would run normally but passengers would be asked to observe the silence and platform announcements would be halted for the duration.
Bus drivers will also be asked to bring vehicles to a stop if they can do so safely.
Details of the memorial events were released by City Hall, these include a wreath laying ceremony at the permanent Hyde Park memorial to the victims.
A second service will take place later in the day at the 7/7 memorial. It will feature music, a series of readings and the laying of flowers.
The memorial, which has 52 stainless steel pillars to represent each of the victims, was vandalised shortly before last year's anniversary.
Twenty-six died in the bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line, six died in the bombing at Edgware Road on the Circle Line, seven died in the bombing at Aldgate on the Circle Line and 13 died in the bombing on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square.
