[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Tanner scored the opener for Plymouth in the 16th minute before Craig Slater's superb free-kick made it 1-1 in the 31st minute.
There was a 10-minute delay in the closing stages after referee Johnson collided with Plymouth's Jimmy Spencer.
It took until the 87th minute for the match to be decided when Ryan Donaldson's instinctive charge-down looped over keeper Sam Walker.
Plymouth held on through 16 minutes of added time for their 11th win in those 13 unbeaten matches.
Both clubs' physios treated Johnson on the field before he was taken to nearby Derriford Hospital.
"We don't have any major concerns about him," Plymouth Argyle club doctor Paul Giles told the club website after the match.
"There was a rumour that he had a fit - there were no fits. He was alert and talking right throughout the whole incident.
"There was an accidental collision and he was struck in the back and had a hyper-extension injury to his neck, and heard a click. He was alert; he was orientated; he didn't lose consciousness."
