League Two Clyde, the lowest-placed club left in the competition, took the lead when David Gormley swept home from 10 yards.
Sean Higgins' low effort almost put the Bully Wee 2-0 ahead, but it came back off the post.
Ayr, who also hit the woodwork in the first half, levelled when Cairney's strike found the bottom corner.
The replay will be at Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld on Tuesday.
That Clyde have another chance owes much to their teenage goalkeeper Connor Quinn.
The 18-year-old former Livingston player was only signed midweek as a stand-in for the suspended John Gibson and, within two minutes, was pushing a Gary Harkins effort wide of the post.
Quinn went on to repel good shots from Craig McGuffie and Declan McDaid before watching Nicky Devlin's strike hit the inside of the post, bounce along the line and away off the other post.
After the break, former Ayr forward Gormley followed up his hat-trick in the previous round with his 10th goal of the season.
The ball broke to the former Auchinleck Talbot man just inside the box and his right-footed finish went beyond Greg Fleming and into the back of the net.
Higgins' 20-yard drive cannoned back off the post as the forward - one of four former Ayr players in the starting line-up - went close again before the hosts levelled.
Brian Gilmour's corner was only half-cleared and Cairney pounced at the edge of the box to chest down and score.
Visiting goalkeeper Quinn then prevent Cairney from curling his second into the top-right corner.
Ayr manager Ian McCall: "We had a lot of chances in the first half and their young goalie did very well.
"Clyde got their goal and we showed a bit of courage to come back from that.
"After that, we had a couple of great chances to win the game - Darryl Meggatt knows he should have scored and Paul Cairney shouldn't have allowed the goalie the chance to save it.
"It's a missed opportunity for us, but we're still in the cup.
"We could have done without the game this Tuesday because we play Dumbarton a week today - which is a pretty big game for us."
Clyde manager Barry Ferguson: "Obviously we're delighted still to be in the hat, but we're just disappointed we didn't win the game.
"But we'll look forward to the replay on Tuesday. I would rather play games than train, but I'm not going to see the guys until six o'clock on Tuesday.
"Ayr have got a lot of good players and they're in the Championship. We came here to win the game and we were close to winning it.
"I'm delighted for Connor Quinn. It's never easy for a young boy.
"I like his attitude and he's desperate to try and learn. I was happy with his performance.
"He's got a good appetite to learn and that's something you don't always see these days."
