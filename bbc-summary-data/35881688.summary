The former deputy chairman of the UK Independence Party, Suzanne Evans, has been suspended by the party.

The suspension was confirmed by leader Nigel Farage, who denied to the BBC it was revenge for her criticism of him.
"Sometimes people fall out with their own party and sometimes say and do things that perhaps they shouldn't," he said.
Ms Evans, on the party's list for the London Assembly elections, is fighting the decision in the High Court.
She recently joined the board of Vote Leave, a group campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union. Mr Farage has backed rival anti-EU group Grassroots Out.
In an interview with the BBC's Norman Smith, Mr Farage said: "She (Ms Evans) has been suspended this morning. There is possibly going to be a legal challenge to that.
"It's unfortunate. She is someone who appeared front-facing for the party and gave UKIP a good look in many ways. Sometimes people fall out with their own party and sometimes say and do things that perhaps they shouldn't."
Last year Ms Evans was demoted after saying in June "Nigel is a very divisive character in terms of the way he is perceived... he is not divisive as a person, but the way he is perceived in having strong views that divide people".
As deputy chairman she was in charge of writing UKIP's manifesto in the general election and was a prominent figure during the campaign.
When Mr Farage said he was resigning as leader after he failed to become an MP he anointed her as his successor, saying she had "emerged as an absolute tower of strength".
However, she was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed when Mr Farage changed his mind and stayed in the post of leader. Last month she lost her role as co-deputy chairman and welfare spokesperson.
But she remains one of the party's most prominent figures, and appeared earlier on Wednesday on Radio 4's Woman's Hour to make the case for improved women's rights outside the European Union.
One party member criticised the suspension and questioned whether UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) had sanctioned it.
"How has she breached party rules? Nobody in the NEC is aware and nobody has taken a vote," said Amanda Sanders, chair of the Kenilworth and Southam branch of the party in the West Midlands.
"Suzanne Evans is very likeable and she would bring in the female voters and she needs support. I will resign over this and I think quite a few of my fellow chairmen are prepared to, as well."
