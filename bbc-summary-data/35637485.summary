Ollie Watkins bagged a dramatic late equaliser as Exeter dented Portsmouth's promotion hopes at St James' Park.

Jayden Stockley, on loan at Pompey earlier in the season, twice went close with early headers for the home side.
Portsmouth's Conor Chaplin opened the scoring when he capitalised on a mistake by Troy Brown and side-footed into the bottom corner from 18 yards.
Stockley hooked wide as City pushed for a leveller before Watkins did equalise after a one-two with Clinton Morrison.
