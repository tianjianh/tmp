[SN]TITLE[SN]
Monaco 2-2 Reims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monaco dropped points at home to Reims on Friday to leave Paris St-Germain one win away from winning a fourth straight Ligue 1 title.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brazilian striker Vagner Love fired Monaco ahead, before Gaetan Charbonnier turned in a cross to equalise.
Love restored Monaco's lead when he pounced on an error but Diego's late finish earned Reims a point.
PSG, who are 22 points ahead of second-place Monaco, are at bottom-club Troyes on Sunday.
If Laurent Blanc's side win they will move 25 points clear with just 24 left to play for in the remaining eight games.
