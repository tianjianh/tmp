[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blacksmith Owen Mort proves he is king of the castles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He describes it as a passion not a job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owen Mort, 28, spends 40 hours a week fashioning intricate metalwork for heritage projects.
He was always interested in working with metal - but having trained as a mechanical engineer he ended up working as a shipyard welder in Belfast.
Owen from Clogher, County Tyrone, had finished a 24 hour shift welding wind farms when he saw an advertisement that would change his life.
Thanks to a Â£15,000 heritage lottery fund grant, he was able to retrain as a blacksmith.
Now his work graces heritage projects around Northern Ireland.
They include Dunluce and Carrickfergus castle as well as Scrabo Tower in Newtownards.
He also made handrails for the Bellaghy Bawn - the area that was home to poet Seamus Heaney who composed a famous poem about a forge.
"I love the thought of bringing metal alive," Owen said.
"You're taking a raw material and turning it into something functional or beautiful."
He uses modern equipment like an electric fan instead of bellows, but the techniques are the same as those used hundreds of years ago.
Owen also sports a beard as a health and safety precaution.
If the molten metal hits his face it singes the beard and drops off rather than sticking to his face.
He is now one of the few blacksmiths in Northern Ireland qualified to do heritage work.
