Mark Davies, 47, was arrested by officers last week and has been released on police bail.
Mr Davies works at Cyrenians Cymru, which offers a range of services to homeless and disadvantaged adults.
A South Wales Police spokesman said the force's economic crime unit was carrying out the investigation.
Cyrenians Cymru said in a statement that Mr Davies no longer worked for charity and added it was "actively pursuing recovery of all losses".
A spokesperson for the Charity Commission said it received a serious incident report from Cyrenians Cymru.
"We have contacted the charity to explain that we will be asking for more information, and an update on the developing situation," they added.
