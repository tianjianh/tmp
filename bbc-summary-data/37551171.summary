A new survey has showed that many young girls in the UK don't feel happy with the way they look.
The Girls' Attitudes Survey 2016 carried out by Girlguiding found that more than one in six girls aged between seven and 10 years old quite often feel embarrassed or ashamed about how they look.
Newsround asked a group of girls what advice they would give to a friend who was feeling down about the way they looked.
