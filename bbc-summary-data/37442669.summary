Newcastle-under-Lyme Taser death: CPS considers case against police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are being asked to consider possible charges against three police officers after the death of a man from Staffordshire who had been Tasered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has referred the case of Adrian McDonald's death in 2014 to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Mr McDonald, 34, died after being arrested at a flat in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the IPCC said.
Staffordshire Police said "all those involved have been updated".

The IPCC said it had made a referral to the CPS to consider charges over the actions of three officers at the scene.
It said a referral to the CPS "is made when the IPCC investigation indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed" and it "does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow".
The commission said previously that during an incident at a flat a police officer discharged a Taser at Mr McDonald.
Mr McDonald, who is originally from Huddersfield, was arrested and taken to a police van and then became "unresponsive". He died at the scene.
Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker said it was aware of the complaints body's actions and its "thoughts remain with Mr McDonald's family".
Staffordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Ellis said: "The work of police officers is often dangerous and the incidents they attend can be chaotic.
"It is the job of the IPCC to provide independent investigation into the circumstances here and the CPS will decide if there is any criminal case to answer."
