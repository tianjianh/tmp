Nico Rosberg held off the Red Bulls to top final practice at the Hungarian Grand Prix, as Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton appeared to struggle.

Hamilton, who missed most of Friday's second after a crash, was off the German's pace throughout and ended up fourth, half a second off the pace.
The Briton unusually took a second set of new tyres late in the session but made the latest in a series of errors.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was second - just 0.002 seconds slower than Rosberg.
The Dutchman's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo was third ahead of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel.
Ricciardo was 0.463secs slower than Verstappen but did not do a qualifying simulation run late in the session.
Hamilton will be spending the break before qualifying at 13:00 BST working with his engineers on improving the car, on a track at which he has excelled since the start of his F1 career.
The world champion has won at the Hungaroring four times - sharing the record with Michael Schumacher - and came into the weekend determined to take Mercedes' first win here in the hybrid era after difficult races in 2014 and 2015.
Hamilton is one point behind Rosberg in the championship and wants to go into the summer break after next weekend's German Grand Prix with a lead.
But the crash on Friday afternoon appears to have set him back this weekend.
He felt on Friday afternoon that he would be able to recover from the accident, which happened after only 10 minutes of the second session and forced him to sit out the rest of it.
But he did not look comfortable out on track on Saturday morning, making a series of mistakes.
Hamilton was nearly a second off Rosberg after the set-up work of the first 40 minutes was completed, after which he complained of overheating in the cockpit.
His seat was changed before Hamilton headed out for the qualifying simulation laps in the final minutes of the session but he ended up 0.508secs behind Rosberg.
At that point, he returned to the pits for a second new set of tyres, presumably to try the car again to see if he could improve, but ran off the track at the fast, blind-entry Turn Four and failed to improve.
Fernando Alonso was an impressive seventh for McLaren, narrowly ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas, Force India's Sergio Perez  and a strong performance from Jolyon Palmer in the Renault.
The Englishman was two places and 0.054secs ahead of team-mate Kevin Magnussen.
