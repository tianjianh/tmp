SDLP leader Colum Eastwood not concerned about party being squeezed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said he is not concerned about his party being squeezed between the DUP and Sinn Féin as they battle to provide the next first minister.

Mr Eastwood was speaking at his party's annual conference in Londonderry.
He became leader four months ago.
With the Assembly election only two months away, Colum Eastwood has insisted his party  will not lose out as Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness vie for the top job at Stormont.
"No one person has more power than the other so this nonsense that people want to put out there that it's a battle between Martin and Arlene about who is going to be the first minister, it undermines the fact that we want to move politics forward," he said.
"We want politics to be about policy, about ideas and about delivery, not about whose name plate is above which office."
Under Stormont rules, the largest party of the largest designation - unionist or nationalist - provides the first minister.
But the positions of first and deputy first minister are effectively equal.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said a small swing in votes would hand the role to Sinn Féin.
She suggested unionist voters should support the DUP to prevent Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin from becoming first minister.
But the SDLP leader said focusing on that contest cheapens politics.
The SDLP deputy leader Ferghal McKinney used his speech to attack what he called the failure of successive DUP ministers to tackle the problems in the health service, adding that stagnation at Stormont is no longer an option.
