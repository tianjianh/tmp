Fruean, 28, will arrive from Hawke's Bay next month, following the end of the Mitre 10 Cup in New Zealand.
Wellington-born Fruean can also play on the wing and has represented the Chiefs and the Hurricanes in Super Rugby.
Meanwhile, former Gloucester tighthead Knight, 26, arrives on a loan deal until the end of the season from Newport Gwent Dragons.
Knight made more than 20 appearances for Newport in the Pro12 last season.
"We are really excited that Robbie has agreed to join us here at Bath," director of rugby Todd Blackadder said.
First-team coach Toby Booth added: "Shaun is a very strong scrummager, and we're excited to see how he continues to develop now that he's with us."
