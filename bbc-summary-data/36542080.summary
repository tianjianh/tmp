A giant aluminium beehive that uses real bee activity to give visitors an "experiential insight" into the life of a colony has been installed in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

The Hive, a 55ft (17m) high and 40 tonne work which incorporates lights and music, was originally created for the 2015 Milan Expo.
The lattice installation, which is made up of 170,000 parts, was designed by Nottingham artist Wolfgang Buttress.
It opens to the public on Saturday.
The designer said the piece was "a multi-sensory experience that integrates art, science and landscape architecture".
A Kew spokesman said the work was "inspired by scientific research into the health of honeybee and has become a visual symbol of the challenges facing bees today".
Buttress's daughter Camille worked with the bands Spiritualized and Amiina and sounds from nature, such queen bees buzzing and ducks quaking, to create a soundscape for the installation, while the light and sound intensity is controlled by instruments measuring the activity of bees in one of Kew's real hives.
The work will stand in the London gardens until the end of 2017.
