[SN]TITLE[SN]
Drug dealer to appeal 'miscarriage of justice'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drug dealer caught with Â£870 worth of ecstasy at T in the Park will have his appeal against the length of his prison term heard at the High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conor McAteer was jailed for 28 months in February, with co-accused Paul McGee receiving a 20 month sentence.
McAteer says he has suffered a miscarriage of justice in terms of comparative sentencing after McGee's term was cut to eight months on appeal.
McAteer also claims the length of his sentence was excessive.
The two men were caught with the class A drug at the festival at Balado in 2013.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has now referred the case to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.
The independent body was established in 1999 to review alleged miscarriages of justice in Scottish convictions and sentences.
