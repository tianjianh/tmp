Parking charges at Denbighshire hospital scrapped

Patients, staff and visitors at a north Wales hospital will enjoy free parking from this week.

Parking charges at Glan Clwyd Hospital at Bodelwyddan have been scrapped after an external contract came to an end.
It follows a Welsh Assembly Government pledge that users would be able to park free at almost every NHS hospital in Wales by the end of 2011.
Hospitals where parking is run by private companies were forced to reduce costs until contracts expired.
At Glan Clywd, the changes accompany a new parking system to make it easier for patients and visitors to park.
Their parking will remain in the front of the hospital, close to the main public entrances, with additional parking available in the car park on the right hand side of the access road.
Designated parking areas for the renal, cancer and maternity units will continue with no time limits or charges.
Arrangements for accessible parking for the disabled will not be affected by the changes.
New signs are being put up to direct the public to the designated parking areas.
The remainder of parking spaces on the site will be available for staff.
A spokesperson for the hospital said: "We appreciate that the new system will take time to fully develop and bed-in.
"In the meantime our immediate priority is to ensure that disruption to patients and visitors is minimised while the new arrangements are being implemented."
