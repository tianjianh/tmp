Fleming has scored seven tries in 19 first-team appearances since making his debut in April 2015.
The 21-year-old is in contention for a place in the Centurions' squad at the Magic Weekend at St. James Park in Newcastle.
Head coach Neil Jukes' side play Salford Red Devils on Sunday, 21 May (15:15 BST).
"It is important to us that he is coming at a busy period and will thicken up the squad," said Jukes.
"It was important that we got a genuine centre in our ranks to help get consistency in other areas and get more competition for places - something we have not had for a number of weeks."
Fleming began his career in rugby union with Sale Sharks' academy before switching codes to turn professional with St Helens.
