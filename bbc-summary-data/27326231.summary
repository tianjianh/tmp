[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repairs to a hole in Guernsey's west coast sea wall caused by storms could start in July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wall was breached on 4 March and a temporary fix was carried out the same day. Tenders for the permanent repairs are currently being sought.
Environment Minister Roger Domaille said discussions about funding all the repairs were ongoing with the treasury.
He said the three biggest repairs at Vazon, Fermain and L'Ancresse were expected to cost about £1.4m.
The department announced last month it had already spent its £77,000 annual budget for coastal defence maintenance.
Deputy Domaille said this had been spent on 20 repair projects.
He said: "They ranged in costs from £5,000 to £20,000, they've been things like surfacing the Herm jetty, some work at Saints Bay, some temporary work at Vazon."
As a result, the budget for maintenance for this year has been increased to £250,000.
Having previously spoken of his frustration the work was being delayed while funding discussions were carried out he said: "I'm happy enough with the progress.
"I always want to do things quicker, but I do accept that we have to carry out proper surveys and make sure we do a proper job."
