Lee Selby not fighting often enough, says promoter Eddie Hearn

World champion Lee Selby is not fighting often enough, according to his UK promoter Eddie Hearn.

Welshman Selby's last bout was his win over Eric Hunter in April to defend his IBF featherweight title.
"Lee Selby went to make his move in America and it has not worked out at all," Hearn told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I feel he has lost a lot of momentum.
He's boxed twice in 17 months when he should have boxed five times."
While Selby is promoted by Hearn in the UK, the 29-year-old signed a deal with Al Haymon last year to arrange his fights in the United States.
That move saw Selby beat Mexican Fernando Montiel in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2015 to retain his IBF featherweight belt.
However, Hearn believes the Barry boxer would be better off fighting in front of a home crowd.
"After he won the world title against [Evgeny] Gradovich, he should have been boxing back in Wales with that hero's welcome," Hearn added.
"We went to Barry on an open-top bus and the reception was incredible. As a promoter, it just screamed out 'home defence'.
"He's not got a fight scheduled at the moment. It's not really my job to schedule that unfortunately but we want to see Lee box in Wales.
"He should be boxing every three or four months in Wales."
Hearn has one fight remaining with Selby as part of their promotional agreement.
The St Joseph's trained boxer has been linked to a fight with domestic rival Josh Warrington, and a unification bout with Carl Frampton.
