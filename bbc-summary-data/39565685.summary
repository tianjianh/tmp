Jewish people all over the world are celebrating the festival of Passover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pesach is Passover in Hebrew, which is spoken in Israel and in many Jewish communities around the world
It is one of the most important dates in the Jewish calendar.
This year, it began at sunset on Monday 10 April and will end in the evening on Tuesday 18 April.
At Passover, Jewish people remember a story from a very long time ago.
You can read about the story in the Book of Exodus, Chapter 12 in the Hebrew Bible called the Torah.
Over 3,000 years ago, a group of Jewish people called the Israelites were being kept in slavery by the ruler of Egypt called Pharaoh.
A man called Moses went to see Pharaoh many times to ask him to let them go, but Pharaoh refused.
Moses told him that if he did not release them, God would make terrible things called plagues happen to the Egyptians.
But Pharaoh did not listen, so the plagues came.
These ten plagues included the River Nile turning to blood, frogs covering the land, insect infestations, animals dying, Egyptians getting skin diseases, the sun stopping shining and the first-born child in Egyptian families being killed by an angel.
God is said to have told Moses to tell the Israelites to paint lamb's blood on their doorposts. This way, the angel would know that Jewish people lived there. It would pass over that house and not kill the first-born child.
This is where the name Passover comes from.
For the last plague, even Pharaoh's own son was killed. He summoned Moses and told him to take the Israelites out of Egypt immediately.
Finally, after 200 years of slavery, the Jewish people were free.
The Passover celebrations last for several days.
People clean their houses very carefully, to make sure they get rid of any crumbs of chametz. These are crumbs from food that has been allowed to rise, like normal bread.
Jewish people aren't allowed to eat this during Passover. This is because the Israelites had to leave Egypt so quickly that they did not have time to let their bread rise, so food products that have risen are forbidden during Passover.
At the beginning of Passover in the evening, family and friends will get together for a meal and a special service called a Seder.
There is a special Seder plate which has certain things on it:
Special food is eaten to remember the story.
As Jewish people cannot eat bread that has risen, they eat a special type of flat bread which hasn't risen (known as unleavened bread) called Matzah.
During the meal, the door is also left open for the prophet Elijah, who is an important religious person, as it is believed he will come to announce the coming of the Messiah.
Families also read the Haggadah - a book that tells the Passover story - with songs and blessings. Children will ask questions and everyone will discuss the story.
For Jewish people, Passover is a big celebration of freedom and life.
