[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth v Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth are without striker Benik Afobe, who is ruled out with a hamstring problem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dan Gosling, Jack Wilshere, Andrew Surman, Callum Wilson, Adam Federici and Rhoys Wiggins remain injured.
Stoke will assess forwards Saido Berahino and Jonathan Walters before naming their starting line-up.
Walters has missed the last two games with a knee problem, while Berahino has been suffering from illness in the build-up to Saturday's game.
John Roder: "This week I have had several people suggest to me that this is a meaningless end-of-season fixture.
"I would disagree vehemently. Both Bournemouth and Stoke are chasing a top-10 finish.
"Mark Hughes will be desperate to halt Stoke's poor run as they try to record a fourth successive top-half position.
"As for Bournemouth, it must be remembered that it was only eight years ago that they overcame a 17-point penalty to avoid relegation from the Football League.
"After last week's victory at Sunderland they are almost mathematically assured of a third season in the Premier League - a magnificent achievement."

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "There is very little between teams in the league. We nicked a big win [last weekend] and I think the target has to be to finish as high as possible.
"We are not mathematically safe yet but we are going to enjoy our last three games and look to get as high up the table as possible.
"There is no magic formula to success. It is down to hard work and graft on the training ground and having a good attitude. I think they are the hallmarks of our success."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We've just not been able, for whatever reason, to convert the chances we have created in recent weeks.
"Obviously if we had scored against West Ham United last weekend it would have been easier for us because it would have made them come out rather than playing on the counter attack.
"There would be more concern if we weren't creating chances, but clearly we are, we just need to have a run of luck and something fly in off someone's shin to let the goals flow."
Both teams are safe but I wouldn't say they have nothing to play for - they could finish as high as eighth, or as low as 16th.
The Potters are still short of a bit of firepower but, while Wilfried Bony's loan deal did not work out, I think Saido Berahino will come good.
