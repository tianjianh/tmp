Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery made headlines around the world after being diagnosed with terminal Neuroblastoma.
Cleveland Police said the 24-year-old woman from Hartlepool was arrested on suspicion of offences under the Malicious Communications Act.
She is also being quizzed in connection with abstracting electricity.
Bradley, from Blackhall Colliery near Hartlepool, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013.
Last week his mother Gemma revealed his cancer had grown and treatment would only give him more time.
A Christmas card campaign was started on Bradley's behalf and more than 200,000 cards and gifts from well-wishers have been sent to his home over the past few weeks.
And last week he was invited to the Stadium of Light to be a mascot for Sunderland and scored a penalty during the warm up before the Black Cats' match against Chelsea.
A Twitter hashtag #BradleyLoweryForGoaloftheMonth has been set up by fans calling for him to be given the Premier League goal of the month award.
A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said the woman had been bailed until the end of January pending further inquiries.
