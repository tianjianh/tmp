The 23-year-old is one of six Scots featuring in a 31-strong British Athletics team heading to Belgrade.
Muir will be joined in her races by Eilish McColgan, while Olympians Eilidh Doyle and Steph Twell will also feature on the track in Serbia.
Also competing will be 800m runner Guy Learmonth and high jumper Allan Smith.
Last weekend, Muir shaved a second off Dame Kelly Holmes' British indoor 1,000m mark, also setting a new European record with the second fastest run of all time.
That followed her European 3,000m indoor record and the British 5,000m indoor record, after beating Holmes' British outdoor 1500m mark last summer.
British Athletics performance director Neil Black is pleased with the "blend" of the team.
