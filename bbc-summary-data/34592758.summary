[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ulster University to appeal decision to build homes at Jordanstown campus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ulster University has said it will appeal the decision to prevent it building 600 homes on the site of its Jordanstown campus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The university is moving much of the Jordanstown operation to Belfast and wants to redevelop the site.
In August, Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council rejected an outline application saying the scheme did not demonstrate "a quality housing layout".
The university has now lodged a case with the Planning Appeals Commission.
A date for an appeal hearing is yet to be set.
Some councillors were critical of the university's consultation with local residents.
