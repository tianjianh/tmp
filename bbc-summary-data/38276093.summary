The game will take place at the Olympic Stadium in Rades on 4 January, according to the French side.
The 1991 African champions and the six-time French Ligue 1 winners will contest the Trophée Ooredoo des Champions at the ground which hosted the 2004 African Cup of Nations final.
PSG are expected to field a strong squad, including star names such as Edinson Cavani, Thiago Silva, Serge Aurier and Angel Di Maria.
The match is to be bankrolled by Ooredoo, the premier private telephone operator in Tunisia.
"I'm very happy that the players and the staff will have the chance to come and experience the Tunisians' fervour for football," PSG managing director Frédéric Longuépée said.
"Paris Saint-German is very popular in Tunisia, with more social media fans numbering over 575,000 and growing everyday.
"This tour will be a great chance for us to come and meet them. Thanks to their support, we'll be playing in a fantastic atmosphere," Longuépée added.
Paris Saint-Germain have played five matches in Tunisia. The last two of those matches were held at the Olympic Stadium in Rades.
Over the last two years, Paris Saint-Germain have also had a presence in Tunisia thanks to the Paris Saint-Germain Academy programme, in partnership with Ooredoo.
Sessions were held in Tunis in 2015 and Sousse in March 2016.
