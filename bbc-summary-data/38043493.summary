Openers Haseeb Hameed and Alastair Cook shared 75 in 50 overs but both fell late on day four to leave England 87-2 in their chase of an unlikely 405 to win in Visakhapatnam.
"We're coming into tomorrow with a lot of batting left," Broad told BBC Sport.
"They showed that you can bat on this pitch if you stick to your gameplan and you are mentally strong."
With the tourists needing to bat out five sessions, Hameed and Cook shared England's slowest opening half-century stand since 1998 before Hameed was trapped lbw by Ravichandran Ashwin for 25.
Cook looked set to reach the close in the company of Joe Root, but the captain fell leg before to Ravi Jadeja for 54 from the second ball of the final over.
"It's disappointing any time you lose a wicket in the last over," said Broad. "But I think we would have taken losing two wickets in 60 overs on this pitch.
"If we can start as nicely and calmly as the openers did we've got a great chance."
For 19-year-old Hameed, a 144-ball stay at the crease further underlined his promise after he made 82 on debut in the drawn first Test.
"He's got a calm character about him," added Broad. "Today he showed a huge toughness. He got hit quite nastily on the hand and he battled through that. He showed a bit of old-school Test match character."
Broad, 30, claimed four wickets in India's second innings, despite suffering from a strained tendon in his left foot.
"The problem is with my tendon in between the first and second toe," he said. "It feels like I'm constantly stepping on a plug every time I plant my foot. It's extremely painful to play on.
"I need to find out a bit more detail on the injury before I can think about the next Test. It will be a case of resting it as much as possible and letting the bleeding go down.
"Hopefully in the next couple of days I can get my feet up and rest - and not be needed to bat."
