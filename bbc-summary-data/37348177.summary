Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed's Open Market Committee, said that there was no rush to raise interest rates.
Earlier comments from other Fed members had been seen as raising the likelihood of a US rate increase this month.
Having fallen by more than 1% on Monday, the FTSE 100 index was up 2.25 points at 6,703.15.
Shares in Associated British Foods fell a further 3%. Its shares had sunk 11% on Monday after it disclosed a £200m pension deficit and said sales at its Primark chain had been affected by unseasonable weather.
In the FTSE 250, JD Sports shares rose 3.8% after it reported a 73% jump in half-year profits to £77.4m.
Ocado shares dived 10% after the online grocer said its profit margins had been hit by the intense competition in the sector.
"As the market remains very competitive, we are seeing sustained and continuing margin pressure and there is nothing to suggest that this will change in the short term," said chief executive Tim Steiner.
