More than 1,000 ticket prices at 223 clubs were analysed in the biggest study of its kind in Europe.
The average cost of the cheapest season ticket - at £137 - is lower than all divisions in England and Scotland, despite a 10% rise year-on-year.
Matchday prices remain the same, with the league setting a £10 admission fee.
Seven out of the 12 clubs in the Premiership provided data to the BBC.
Prices from Ballinamallard United, Coleraine, Glenavon, Linfield and Portadown were obtained from their club websites.
The Price of Football, now in its sixth year, analyses the cost of the cheapest and most expensive matchday, season and away tickets, as well as the cost of a pie, programme, cup of tea and adult and junior replica shirts.
In England's Premier League, two thirds of tickets were frozen or reduced in price, with the average cost of the cheapest adult home matchday ticket falling to £29.05.
The Premier League's cheapest season tickets cost on average £480.
The Welsh Premier League came out as the cheapest league to watch men's football in the UK, with the average cost of a matchday ticket at £6.91 and the average cost of the cheapest season ticket at £81.70.
