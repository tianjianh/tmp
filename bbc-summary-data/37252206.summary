Jamie Jones-Buchanan went over, but Salford replied through George Griffin and went ahead with a penalty.
Salford's Gareth O'Brien was sin-binned and Kallum Watkins gave Rhinos a half-time lead, before the hosts scored 20 second-half points without reply.
James Segeyaro, Carl Ablett and Adam Cuthbertson's tries left the visitors with only one win in four Qualifiers.
Salford remain sixth, level on points with fifth-placed London Broncos as they chase a place in the Million Pound Game and a chance to return to Super League, with only three matches left to play.
