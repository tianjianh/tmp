Mourinho's agent, Jorge Mendes, met United officials on Tuesday but a deal has not yet been announced.
Dutchman Louis van Gaal, 64, was sacked as United boss on Monday, two days after winning the FA Cup at Wembley.
He led United to fifth place in the Premier League but failed to get them past the Champions League group stages.
The former Netherlands boss was also criticised for his lack of attacking football, with United only scoring 49 goals in the top flight.
Mourinho's appointment has been backed by some former United players.
Ex-goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel says the Portuguese "could save" the club, while Hull City boss Steve Bruce believes the opportunity to bring in the three-time Premier League champion was "just too good to miss".
Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told BBC Sport Mourinho would be a "fantastic signing", adding United had "lost its identity this last year".
But Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona said his former club should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead, saying he "loved" Mourinho but that his style of play is "not Manchester United".
Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Mourinho was a "workaholic" like Van Gaal, "prepares perfectly" and "knows how to grind out wins".
The future of assistant boss Ryan Giggs remains uncertain, with the 42-year-old unhappy at the way Van Gaal was dismissed.
He is weighing up an offer to extend his 29-year association with the club, having been passed over for the manager's job for the second time.
Schmeichel believes Giggs should leave and "learn the trade" of management at another club, while former United assistant Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live the Welshman had the attributes to be a "very good manager".
Mourinho, who has won league titles in four countries as well as two Champions League trophies, is one of the game's most successful coaches.
His first signing could be 34-year-old Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is leaving French champions Paris St-Germain.
