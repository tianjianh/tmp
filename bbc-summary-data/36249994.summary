Duff joined the Clarets for from Cheltenham for Â£30,000 in 2004 and made 383 appearances, scoring eight goals.
The centre-back has helped Burnley win promotion to the Premier League three times and played 25 times this season as they won the Championship title.
"It's been an honour to represent this football club," the Northern Ireland international told the club website.
"To do it with this group of lads this season as champions has been unbelievable.
"[Manager] Sean Dyche rested me earlier in the season and since then we've gone 23 unbeaten so you can't argue with that.
"He also said I could go and play elsewhere or continue working here in the academy and it's an opportunity I couldn't turn down."
Duff spent eight years at Cheltenham where he won FA Trophy, National League and the League Two play-offs, and amassed 24 international caps during his career.
