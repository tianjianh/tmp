That represents a rise of 2.5% on the previous year's figure, according to the charity, Employers for Childcare, who interviewed almost 4,500 parents.
It found the average cost of placing a child full-time with a childminder  was £167 per week.
That compares to £156 per week to place a child in a nursery.
The organisation warned that about half of the parents they surveyed were reducing their hours at work to reduce childcare costs.
Employers for Childcare is a charity that supports parents in work and they have been publishing annual surveys on childcare costs for a number of years.
This year's survey found some variation in childcare prices across Northern Ireland.
The research suggested that the highest childminding cost was £173 a week for one child and the lowest was £136 a week.
The highest weekly cost for a day nursery place was £163 a week, and the lowest was £136 a week.
