The Stove Network will use the money to develop creative talent in the Lochside and Lincluden areas.
The Our Place award will see the project recruit a team of volunteers as well as a full-time development worker.
Matt Baker, of the Stove Network, said everyone involved was delighted to receive the "vote of confidence" of the funding award.
"Creative Futures Lincluden and Lochside is all about local people using our heritage and culture to improve quality of life for everyone and making opportunities for developing new skills and jobs," he said.
"It is also a means for north west Dumfries to draw in resources from the wider area, and already people are coming forward to discuss great new partnerships for the future."
Maureen McGinn, who chairs Big Lottery Fund Scotland, said it was an "important milestone" for the area.
"Our Place gives local people a say on how lottery money should be spent in their area, so the ideas and inspiration for the Creative Futures project come directly from people living in and around the local area," she said.
"And key to the success to this project will be the involvement of local volunteers who will benefit from new skills and improved confidence."
A number of local people known as "community connectors" have been heavily involved in the scheme.
One of them, Carole McCann, said she was "delighted" with the success.
"Our area boasts extensive green spaces, abundant wildlife and has an important historic site on our doorstep," she said.
"It is a great place to live and with this injection of funding, determination and hard work I am certain it will be an even better one in the future."
Our Place is currently working with seven communities across Scotland, one of which is Lochside and Lincluden in north west Dumfries.
