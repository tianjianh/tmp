[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cerberus takes control of loan to Mick Wallace TD

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Cerberus investment fund has taken control of a loan made to the independent Irish TD Mick Wallace.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Wallace has made allegations about Cerberus' deal to buy Nama's entire Northern Ireland loan portfolio.
His loan is part of a different portfolio that Cerberus bought from Ulster Bank in December 2014.
He told the Sunday Independent that the fund has control of the loan behind La Taverna Di Bacco, a Dublin restaurant.
In July, Mr Wallace claimed that as a result of the Nama deal, a Northern Ireland politician was to receive a Â£7m payment.
Cerberus has said that "no improper or illegal fees" were paid by it or on its behalf.
Nama says the loan sale process was "robust, competitive and secured the best outcome for the Irish taxpayer".
