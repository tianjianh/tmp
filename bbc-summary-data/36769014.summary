[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old from Finland, who has one international cap, has agreed a two-year contract with the Royals.
Jaakkola, who stands 6ft 5ins tall, had a spell in Scottish football with Kilmarnock from 2011-13.
He then moved to South Africa and last year kept a clean sheet as Ajax Cape Town lifted the MTN8 cup after a 1-0 win over Kaizer Chiefs in the final.
Jaakkola is Reading's third signing since the appointment of manager Jaap Stam, following the arrival of forward Joseph Mendes and midfielder Joey van den Berg.
