Health bosses 'delay' Shrewsbury and Telford NHS plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to change some NHS services in Shropshire have been put back for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals to build a new hospital or switch services between those in Telford and Shrewsbury were delayed by the election.
But now they are being delayed further to wait for government funding plans and to ensure options being discussed are realistic, health bosses said.
Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) expected a 10-week delay.
Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals Trust has previously said it was unrealistic to keep two A&Es.
The emergency departments at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal have struggled to hit waiting time targets over recent years.
