The Judge said Ashley Latty "never stood a chance" when he was attacked by a gang in a street in east London.
Nicholas Terrelonge 28, and Tyler Burton, 28, were both jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years.
Kestrel Dyer, 25, and Jerome Joseph, 28, were cleared of murder but found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
They were jailed for six-and-a-half years and six years respectively.
Nana Oppong, 34, was found not guilty of murder but was jailed for four years after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
The attackers were all from east London. Judge Stephen Gullick said their victim, a 25-year-old father, "never stood a chance when faced by such a group of attackers".
The court heard Terrelonge had rounded up the group of men at a ticketed birthday party after he recognised Mr Latty as someone who had stolen from him in the past.
Mr Latty, from Leyton, died after he was kicked, punched and stabbed five times outside the Beaver Centre in Dagenham, at 05:30 BST on 18 May last year.
When onlookers tried to intervene they were also attacked by the men.
Prosecutor Simon Denison QC had told the court: "The defendants didn't care who at the party saw them. And they were careless enough to attack him as they did in the line of sight of CCTV cameras that recorded what they did.
"He didn't stand a chance. It was sudden, sustained, utterly brutal and without mercy."
In evidence at the trial, Oppong denied knowing any of the other defendants and said, when he was told Mr Latty had robbed Terrelonge of a necklace, he was "flattered" to be asked to get involved.
