A "very small" number of potential witnesses have come forward to police investigating the suspected drowning of a five-year-old boy in a lake.

Charlie Dunn died in hospital after being found submerged at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July.
Officers said more than 500 vehicles had visited on that day, but only a handful of people had contacted them.
A couple, believed to be Charlie's mother Lynsey Dunn and stepfather Paul Smith, are currently on bail.
The couple were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence.
Det Sgt Nikki McLatchie said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who saw Charlie at the park. Did you see him in the water? Did you see him playing? You may only have a small recollection but it could really help with our investigation.
"We know Charlie was carried out of the water by other park users. Did you see him in the water prior to this? If you took any footage from the area around the Blue Lagoon that afternoon please get in touch with us."
