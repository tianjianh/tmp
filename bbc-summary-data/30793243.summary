[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland Empire Theatre's wind-toppled muse taken down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A statue on the dome of Sunderland Empire theatre, which toppled toppled over on to its side during high winds, has been brought down to the ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The metal figure of Terpischore, the muse of dancing and choral music, had been hanging from its base 90ft (27m) above the ground since Saturday.
Part of High Street West and Garden Place had to be cordoned off and shows at the theatre were cancelled.
A crane has been brought to the site and the statue taken down.
Sunderland City Council had said removal could not take place until the wind had died down.
It apologised for the inconvenience the street closure had caused to local businesses and residents but said the prime concern was safety.
The theatre said the weekend's shows had been rescheduled.
