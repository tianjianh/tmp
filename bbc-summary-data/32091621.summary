Welsh language campaigners and small businesses have accused Twitter of discrimination because it does not offer promoted tweets in Welsh.

Promoted tweets are purchased by advertisers and are posted above conversations about relevant brands.
Welsh Language Commissioner Meri Huws confirmed she had received complaints.
On its website, Twitter says it offers promoted tweets in ten European languages and the service will be available in other languages over time.
Craig Edwards, who owns Jonah's Fishmarket in Aberystwyth, said social media was vital to his business and he tweets in English and Welsh every day.
"A lot of our customers come in saying that they have seen our tweets about what is on offer," he said.
"We are trading in Wales so we should be able to advertise in the Welsh language."
Meri Huws said she had contacted TwitterAds to raise the issue and was waiting for a response.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We want to see big technology companies using and facilitating Welsh, including advertising in Welsh.
"We've engaged with a number of these companies and would be happy to discuss this issue with Twitter."
