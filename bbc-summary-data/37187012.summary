The 25-year-old midfielder has agreed a two-year contract and moves on after just a year with Burton, who signed him from Dundee United.
Butcher told Millwall's website: "I'm very excited. This is a massive club. As soon as the opportunity arose it was something I couldn't turn down.
"I know what it takes to get out of this league and hopefully that is something I bring to the squad."
Butcher was on Tottenham's books as a youngster.
Has was part of the Burton squad which won promotion from League One to the Championship last season.
