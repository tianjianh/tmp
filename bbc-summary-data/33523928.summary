Lucia Baratta and John Sessions flew to the islands on Monday for their ceremony but their luggage, including the wedding dress, was lost in transit.
The owners of the Kirkwall Hotel in Kirkwall posted an appeal for help on social media.
Responses to the plea included offers of a total of 12 wedding dresses in the right size.
Ms Baratta was also supplied with petticoats, veils, tiaras and shoes along with makeup and flowers.
The couple tied the knot in a ceremony on Tuesday afternoon and the bride was full of praise for all the help she had received.
She told BBC Radio Orkney: "We came to Orkney in a surprise elopement only to find our luggage was lost.
"We had no bags and no wedding dress.
"The outpouring from the community has been incredible."
