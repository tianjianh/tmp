The 26-year-old Wales international has been with the Lady Glovers since returning in 2014.
The former Bristol Academy and Chelsea player also represented Bristol Rovers after starting her career with Yeovil.
"I never thought I would be in WSL 1 with my hometown club, so it is fantastic," she told the club website.
On 8 March, Yeovil defender Nicola Cousins also extended her stay with the newly-promoted side.
