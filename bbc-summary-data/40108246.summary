The 27-year-old former England Under-21 international made 119 appearances for the Canaries after joining them from Peterborough in 2012.
Bennett also had talks with promoted Sheffield United, but has chosen to move to Molineux instead.
He has agreed a three-year contract to become Wolves' first summer signing and will join officially on 1 July.
"It was just a case of me picking which club had the most ambition within what I want to do," Bennett told Wolves' website.
Wolves parted company with head coach Paul Lambert, who signed Bennett during his time at Carrow Road, on Tuesday.
Former Porto boss Nuno Espirito Santo was appointed as Lambert's replacement on Wednesday.
While the club had no manager in place, sporting director Kevin Thelwell has been looking after transfers.
