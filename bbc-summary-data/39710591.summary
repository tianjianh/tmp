The 29-year-old, from Cardiff, was collecting the MBE she was awarded in the New Year Honours list.
Mills won gold at the Rio 2016 games with Saskia Clark in the women's 470 class.
She said Princess Anne asked her "if I had had any luck finding a new partner" following her crewmate's retirement.
Cyclists Laura and Jason Kenny and showjumping champion Nick Skelton were among the other sports stars to collect their accolades.
Mills said the ceremony was "nerve-wracking" but she got a warm reception.
Since Rio, she has changed boats and said: "This year is about learning as much as we possibly can - so for me a new boat is exciting, it means I'm upping my skill level - whatever boat I end up sailing I'll be a better sailor for it.
"It's just a new challenge and I'm loving it, and I think this first year if you can still be loving your sport and enjoying the training and excited to get fit and everything again then it's a good place to be because it's a long cycle - you can't expect everything to happen in year one."
