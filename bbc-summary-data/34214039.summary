She won a Sony Radio Award in 2012 along with co-presenter Betty Smith and the show's presenter and producer David Reeves.
Smith, who died last year aged 93, and Renwick were the oldest winners of the prestigious radio industry award.
BBC Radio Humberside's managing editor Simon Pattern described her as "a delightful and very caring Hull woman".
Her family said she had died peacefully earlier this week and had lived for her broadcasting days.
They added she was very proud of the fame she had gained for being one half of the "Dynamic Duo" with Betty Smith.
Born in 1926, Renwick worked as a conductor on Hull's trolley buses and as an assistant in a department store, before meeting Smith at a lunch club in 1999.
The friends first went on air in 2006 after meeting Reeves during a tour of the station.
The weekly, hour-long show was a mix of music and chat and ran for six years.
After picking up the best entertainment show award, they became celebrities, appearing on the BBC's One Show, and featured in newspapers and on radio stations around the world.
Co-star Reeves said she would be "sorely missed".
"Beryl was a wonderful storyteller and a great friend," he said.
"During our six years on air together she evolved into a skilled broadcaster, mastering the art to perform, entertain and shock on the radio but most importantly just to be herself.
"The Beryl and Betty Show enriched her life as much as it did the audience that tuned in every week to soak up yet more wisdom from a life well lived."
