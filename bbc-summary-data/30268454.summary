West Midlands Search & Rescue (WMSAR), which is run by volunteers, was on the River Severn in Shrewsbury after Daniel Hodgin, 20, went missing last weekend.
He failed to return home after a night out with friends at The Buttermarket nightclub in the town.
The damage on Saturday was believed to have been caused by submerged debris, WMSAR said.
Nobody was hurt in this weekend's incident and the crew was rescued by another of its boats nearby, it said.
A spokesman said: "We are a small charity, run wholly by specialist volunteers and funded by donations.
"The loss of a boat will have a significant financial impact and we desperately need help to replace the boat and get the team back up to full operational capacity."
WMSAR provides support to the emergency services in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
West Mercia Police said it believed Mr Hodgin, from Madeley, left the club at about 03:30 GMT on 23 November.
Dozens of people assembled at the nightclub on Saturday to search for him.
Mr Hodgin, described as about 5ft 9ins (1.75m) tall with short spiked brown hair and stubble, was wearing a grey Police polo shirt with dark blue jeans and black boots.
