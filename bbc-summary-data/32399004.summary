Andrew Picton, 66, of Eastcroft Close, Blagdon, Bristol, abused the girls in Slough between the ages of six and 16.
He was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual abuse, including two counts of rape, at Reading Crown Court in February.
The offences took place between March 1984 and February 1995 and were reported to police in 2012.
Det Con Francesca Worley, from Thames Valley Police, said: "These victims have waited a long time to see justice done for the abuse they suffered.
"I would like to thank them for their bravery and patience during what was a lengthy, detailed and complex investigation.
"I hope that this brings this chapter of their life to a close."
