Dale Gordon, known as Deezy, was involved in a fight with two men in Manchester at about 22:15 GMT on 15 November 2014, police said.
The 20-year-old died from head injuries in hospital the following day.
His mother Lynn Meecham said: "I have lost a young, talented, loving son and I hope in my heart there is someone out there who can assist the police."
"It only seems like yesterday as the pain has not gone away," she added.
A Â£25,000 reward is still on offer for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
The two other men in the fight were described as both being mixed race, between 5ft 8in (1.7m) and 6ft (1.8m) tall and in their mid to late 20s.
One man was said to be of average to athletic build, wearing a hooded grey top with a darker hoodie over the top, and possibly something red underneath.
The other man wore a dark top, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
They were seen leaving the scene in a grey or silver hatchback car.
Three men, aged 24, 28 and 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder but have been since released with no further action.
Det Ch Insp Paul Parker, from GMP, said police had made "good progress" with the investigation but "need that key witness to come forward".
He added: "Gorton is a very strong community and I am sure there is somebody out there who can provide that key piece of evidence that brings the offenders to justice.
"I understand that people can feel scared about providing information to the police... and I can reassure you we will treat the information you supply with the strictest of confidence."
