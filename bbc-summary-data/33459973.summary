The Royal Pier Waterfront development, includes 730 apartments, restaurants, up to 50 shops and a 250-bed hotel.
It will also incorporate a casino, which has been granted a licence by the government for up to 150 slot machines and 30 blackjack and poker tables.
If it goes ahead, construction could start on the first buildings in 2017 with the development completed by 2032.
The plans could see the park space at Mayflower Park made bigger with a Spitfire sculpture in the city where the plane was first built.
The 131ft (40m) sculpture will be one-and-a-half times the size of the actual plane.
The council said the scheme would "transform the landscape of Southampton's waterfront", create better public access to the shoreline, and provide an improved site for the annual international boat show.
Following the development, Isle of Wight ferry operator Red Funnel would be moved to a new ferry terminal in Trafalgar Dock at berth 50.
Detailed plans for the development go on show at Kuti's Gate House, Town Quay, from 14:00 to 18:00 on Friday and 11:00 to 15:00 on Saturday.
Following the public exhibition a planning application will be submitted by developer, the Lucent Group.
