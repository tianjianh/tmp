England v India: Steven Finn 'turns corner' with one-day best figures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Finn says he wants "to look forward, not back" after delivering a man-of-the-match performance that helped England to victory over India.

The win came almost 12 months to the day of the fast bowler being declared "not selectable" for his country.
Finn's career-best one-day figures of 5-33 against India came at the Gabba in Brisbane - the city he was sent home from after England's last Ashes tour.
"That corner's been turned," said Finn. "All that stuff's in the past now."
He added: "There are a few bad memories knocking around in the places we're travelling to but this will help relax me. I'm happy with where I'm at."
Last year, the Middlesex man was struggling with his confidence and his action to the extent then-coach Ashley Giles said he needed to leave the tour "for his own good".
Finn was deemed surplus to requirements for the one-day games that followed England's 5-0 Ashes whitewash.
"Obviously a lot has happened in the last 12 months and it is pretty much a year to the day that I went home from that tour of Australia," Finn said.

Finn's five-wicket haul, supported by 4-18 from James Anderson, saw India bowled out for 153 in the tri-series game.
And it helped England bounce back from an opening tri-series defeat by Australia, who they meet again in Hobart on Friday.
Ian Bell and James Taylor, who both fell for ducks against Australia, made unbeaten scores of 88 and 56 respectively to get England to victory with more than 22 overs to spare.
"To take five wickets was obviously very pleasing after the work I've put in, but I don't want to look back now, just forward," said Finn.
England captain Eoin Morgan praised his side's "outstanding performance" in the nine-wicket win over India in Brisbane, with special praise for his reinvigorated bowler.
"The pinnacle of it was Steven Finn," said Morgan. "It's great to see him performing like he does for Middlesex.
"If we keep producing individual performances like that, it builds belief in the squad."
The defeat by Australia on Sunday was England's 17th in 25 one-day internationals against Test-playing nations, but victory over world champions India comes less a month before the World Cup begins.
"It makes us quietly confident and boosts our underdog status," said Morgan, who replaced Alastair Cook as one-day captain in December.
"Bouncing back in the way they did is exactly what we want," Morgan told Test Match Special. "It's a testament to their character.
"Being ruthless, chasing a score one wicket down is exactly what we want to do."
