Stoke City assistant manager Mark Bowen has confirmed the Potters are interested in signing former Manchester United winger Nani.

The 29-year-old Portugal forward is set to play in Wednesday's Euro 2016 semi-final against Wales in Lyon.
He left Old Trafford in July 2015 for Turkish side Fenerbahce for Â£4.25m on a three-year deal, but now has a chance to return to England.
"He probably left the Premier League too early," Bowen told BBC Radio Stoke.
"He's still a real talent, as we've seen. He's got the attributes any Premier League team, I would have thought, would be interested in, especially given the form he's in at the moment.
"He had good times at Man United. He was a Champions League winner there."
Nani scored 40 goals in 229 appearances for United following his 2007 move from Sporting Lisbon, helping them to win four Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League.
Valencia are also thought to be keen on the winger, who was sold by Louis van Gaal a year ago after spending the 2014-15 season on loan with Sporting Lisbon as part of the deal that took Marcos Rojo to Old Trafford.
Mark Hughes' Stoke, who begin the new season with a trip to promoted Middlesbrough on 13 August, finished ninth last season for the third campaign running.
