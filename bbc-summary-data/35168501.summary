North Down Museum showcases Christmas memories from years gone by

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many families have their own collection of Christmas mementos.

Whether it is photo albums or special decorations handed down through generations, this is a period of making memories.
In keeping with this tradition, the North Down Museum in Bangor has gathered a collection of items from Christmases past.
Here, we take a look at some of the most special objects in the collection and what they mean to local people.
Among the finds in the collection is this rare Boer War tin, sent to the troops by Queen Victoria at Christmas 1899.
The tin was branded as Cadbury's and contained a bar of chocolate.
However, because all three of the chocolate-making families of the time were pacifist Quakers, the chocolate inside would have been made by either Cadbury, Fry's or Rowntree's.
The tin was received by Private Moyes, who ate his chocolate on the front line in South Africa.
He survived the Boer War and joined the Veterinary Corps on his return but died in 1918, while serving in World War One.
This collection of postcards are from Hugh Hull, who writes about his anxiety to get home for Christmas 1912.
He had been working in Bavaria and, as these postcards show, he was not enjoying it. Fortunately, Mr Hull finally made it home for a visit in January 1913.
Postcards were the easiest and cheapest way to keep in touch at the time. They were treasured by families at home and by those serving or living abroad.
This anonymous card was never sent, but it is believed the man who wrote it survived World War One.
Sister Lucy Sinton Kelly served in France during WW1.
She encouraged the men under her care to write in a logbook that she kept - one young man, pining for Christmas, drew this sketch of a classic English rural scene, complete with copperplate writing.
As the 20th Century wore on, Christmas shop window displays became popular.
The window display at Neill's Coal Shop was renowned in North Down and featured these teddy bears in different costumes.
One of the bears even had a daring Torvill and Dean Bolero costume. Unfortunately, the ice skates are too big for her.
For North Down Museum manager Heather McGuicken, these baubles are a little piece of home - literally.
Her family made these tree decorations, complete with sand from their local beach.
