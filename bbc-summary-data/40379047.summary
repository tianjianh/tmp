He lives in Dallas Zoo in America and his keepers decided to treat him to new toy, to help him enjoy life and keep active.
We think it's safe to say that Zola is a pretty big fan of the pool - judging by the serious dance shapes he's been pulling!
We added the music, but we like to think this is what Zola might have been imagining when he was having a boogie...
