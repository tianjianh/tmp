Guernsey FC lose 3-1 at Whitstable Town to end season in 13th place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey FC ended the season with a ninth successive away defeat as they went down 3-1 at Whitstable Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Rihoy gave Guernsey, who had a squad of just 12, a 30th minute lead against the Isthmian League Division One South's bottom-of-the-table club.
But Whitstable levelled six minutes before the break before going in front two minutes after the restart.
The hosts got a third 15 minutes later before Ross Allen saw a free-kick hit the bar for Guernsey with 10 to go.
The loss means Guernsey end their third season in the fourth tier of English non-league football in 13th place.
