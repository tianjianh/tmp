[SN]TITLE[SN]
Finland country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Finland's broadcasting sector is dynamic. Public YLE, funded by licence fees, operates radio and TV networks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New stations compete in a market once dominated by YLE and established private broadcaster MTV. Pay-TV is provided by pan-Nordic operator Canal+.
Finnish law gives every citizen the right to publish printed material, and guarantees the right of reply. Newspapers are privately owned and reflect a range of political views. Finland came first in the 2013 Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index.
More than 4.7 million Finns were online by June 2012, a penetration rate of more than 89% (Internetworldstats.com). Finland has made broadband access a legal right for every citizen.
