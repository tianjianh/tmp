[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rupert Murdoch, Jerry Hall and other power couples

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rupert Murdoch is the kind of man who regularly tops lists of the most influential men in the world.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's the sort of influence that means that whoever enters a relationship with him automatically becomes a member of a power couple.
But in Jerry Hall, the former model and one-time partner of Mick Jagger to whom he is now happily engaged, he has ended up with someone with a significant public profile of her own.
While he and his family have an estimated worth of $11.2bn (Â£7.7bn), according to Forbes, the value of her fortune is less clear, but thought to be in the many millions of dollars.
With this in mind, we've put together a guide to where they rank in the league table of the world's most high-profile power couples - and some pointers as to what may await them.
Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall to marry
The only way to establish this is to make rudimentary comparisons with other power couples. This can be best measured in Brangelinas.
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt
The original Brangelina.
On one side, Angelina Jolie was named the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. On the other, her husband, Brad Pitt, earned an estimated $16m for his roles last year - the 28th highest figure for an actor in the world.
These numbers don't make any sense when combined, so let's say this couple is worth two Brangelinas.
Bill and Hillary Clinton
One is a former US president, the other is a possible future holder of the title. Say the surname to most people and they'll know who you're talking about.
While Angelina Jolie is well-known for her charity work, and her name can open almost any door, having two leaders of the free world under one roof still trumps her. Value: four Brangelinas
Beyonce and Jay-Z
If power was judged by album sales alone, which of course it isn't, this couple would be heads and shoulders above everyone else.
Beyonce has sold 16m albums in the US alone, her husband some 55m worldwide.
But how powerful are they, really? In truth, your granny might know who Beyonce is, but would she know who Jay-Z is? Value: three Brangelinas
Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall
Between them, this couple will own media empires in the UK, the US and Australia. Their wedding could attract world leaders. Their engagement alone has made headlines around the world. Value: four Brangelinas
This will be Mr Murdoch's fourth marriage. He has six children, and while Miss Hall has not married before, she has four children with Mr Jagger.
This brings extra complications: how to refer to the extended family.
Among those distantly tied to the couple is Bianca Jagger, who will become Mr Murdoch's wife's former partner's ex-wife.
Politics
Miss Hall has not made her views on the 2016 US presidential election clear, but in 2008, she seemed to back the Democrats. She voiced her support for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama, "because I want to see Bill as First Lady".
Mr Murdoch, on the other hand, has repeatedly tweeted in support of 2016 Republican nominee Ben Carson, writing in September that the former surgeon was "maybe the one to beat" (although he has since plummeted in the polls).
Climate change
Miss Hall has long campaigned to highlight climate change, and in 2009, wrote an editorial in the Daily Mail calling it the biggest threat the world has ever seen.
Mr Murdoch does not agree. He has called himself a "climate change sceptic" but not a denier - but also criticised "alarmist nonsense" on the subject.
Steer clear of these subjects, and you should be just fine.
