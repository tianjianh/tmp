Police and zoo staff spent the night searching for Flaviu who had arrived at the zoo from Kent on Wednesday.
Park staff set 25 humane traps baited with meat after a sighting on farm land outside the boundary of the park in Sparkwell near Plymouth.
Dartmoor Zoo owner Ben Mee said the animal had "disturbed those traps".
Mr Mee said: "The good news overnight is he has been disturbing those traps. I'm sure eventually he will venture into one of them.
"We're in the process of fabricating more traps which are much bigger and easier to disguise."
Devon and Cornwall Police used thermal imaging cameras to assist with the search.
The zoo took delivery of the two-year-old animal on Wednesday from Port Lympne wildlife park in Kent and settled him into his new house at 19:30 BST.
Police said Flaviu is the size of a large domesticated cat and could be dangerous if cornered.
