[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Boyd scored a late equaliser for injury-hit Burnley to deny Newcastle caretaker-manager John Carver victory.

Carver, in charge ahead of Alan Pardew's departure, saw Steven Taylor head Newcastle in front before a Paul Dummett own goal made it 1-1.
Jack Colback fired Newcastle back ahead after 26 minutes with Burnley then losing a third player before half-time.
Danny Ings made it 2-2 and after Moussa Sissoko had put United in front for a third time, Boyd grabbed a point.

Having fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Manchester City last time out, when Boyd also scored, this was another remarkable comeback from the Clarets to take the edge off Carver's big day.
In Carver's previous experience as caretaker-manager at St James' Park, when he stood in following the dismissal of Sir Bobby Robson in August 2004, he oversaw a 3-0 win over Blackburn Rovers.
The appointment of Graeme Souness as manager heralded Carver's departure the following month but the 49-year-old, who returned as Pardew's assistant in January 2011, hopes to stay around longer this time.
With Steve Stone and Peter Beardsley alongside him in the dug-out, United's management team had a strong Geordie feel.
And with the scorers of the first three goals all Tynesiders, the game appeared to be following a script to please the home fans - despite the blip of Dummett heading past his own goalkeeper.
Burnley, though, have often made light of their relatively small budget this season and did it again on their first visit to St James' Park for a league game since November 1982.
Their cause wasn't helped by losing captain Jason Shackell to injury after just 15 minutes and his misfortune set the tone for an incident-packed first half.

Shackell's replacement, Kevin Long, lasted just 20 minutes before being stretchered off and Burnley also lost key midfielder Dean Marney to illness.
Having picked the same side for six successive games, Burnley manager Sean Dyche was now having to patch his team up and totally re-shape his back four.
But Newcastle failed to take advantage and after ending a run of three successive league defeats against Everton last Sunday, the home side must view the game against Burnley as a missed opportunity.
Colback's excellent strike from 25 yards had restored their lead after Dummett had gifted Burnley the first of their three equalisers.
But rather than kick on, Newcastle found themselves outplayed by the visitors after half time. Ings, Ashley Barnes, for a second time, and Ben Mee all hit the woodwork before the former glanced in his fifth goal of the season from a Michael Kightly cross.
It looked as if Sissoko had nicked the win for United, but Burnley thoroughly deserved the point they gained by virtue of Boyd's fourth goal of the season - a low shot fired into the bottom corner.
Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver:
"I don't think I have been involved in such a game of, to use the old cliche, two halves.
"We controlled the game and played really good football in the first half but the second half was pretty awful.
"I thought we had got out of jail (with Cissoko's goal) but they should have won the game. They were the better team over 90 minutes. They caused us more problems than we did them.
"We think Steve Taylor has snapped his Achilles tendon, which is disappointing."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"We had to make three changes and it was all going off in that first half.
"We had to deal with it and after that I thought we were outstanding, right to the death when we were still looking to score.
"The belief was still there and I thought some of the quality of our play was exceptional.
"Going into Christmas people said we might not win a game but we have taken five points from five teams in the top 10 and two in the top four. We still need get more points but we are going in the right direction and the performance levels are very high."
