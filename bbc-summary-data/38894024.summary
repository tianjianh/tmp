[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The United Automobile Workers union negotiated a profit sharing deal in 2011.
It is worth up to $1,000 per $1bn of profit the company makes in the continent.
However, net profit for the whole of GM dropped 2.7% last year to $9.43bn after foreign exchange losses.
A jump in sales in mid-size pick-up trucks and SUVs aided sales in the US. Chevrolet was the fastest growing US GM brand in 2016, increasing its share of the US retail market by 0.5 percentage points.
A year earlier, payments of up to $11,000 were awarded to union workers after $11bn of North American profits were posted. The award is based on working more than an average of 35 hours per week during the year.
In Europe, the company reported a narrower loss of $257m, compared with $813m in 2015, as sales rose.
GM sold a record 10 million vehicles in 2016, up 1.2% from 2015, with 3.04 million vehicles sold in the US.
In China, deliveries rose 7.1% to a record 3.87 million vehicles and in Europe, its Opel and Vauxhall marques posted a 4% sales increase.
GM said fourth-quarter net profit fell partly because of $500m in currency losses, mostly from the decline of the pound.
The carmaker forecast profit per share in 2017 would be the same or slightly better than last year.
