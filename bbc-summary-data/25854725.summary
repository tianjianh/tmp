The tie ended 3-3 on aggregate after both sides scored in extra time, but Sunderland won a penalty shoot-out 2-1.
A save by Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone sent the Wearside club to the 2 March final against Manchester City.

"It's been a difficult season, they deserve that," said Poyet. "Let's see if we can go one more and win it."
Sunderland, who were bottom of the Premier League when Poyet was named as manager in October following the sacking of Paolo Di Canio, are currently one place better off.
"The things that happened today, it's incredible, but the players have been outstanding. Credit to them," said Uruguayan Poyet.
Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, Manchester United levelled the tie in the first half when Jonny Evans turned in.
However, Sunderland stood less than two minutes from Wembley when United keeper David De Gea hopelessly fumbled Phil Bardsley's shot in the dying moments of extra-time.
But the Black Cats could not hold out and Javier Hernandez's goal seconds from the end sent the match to penalties.
"It's been a remarkable achievement from the lads," said Sunderland's ex-United defender Bardsley. "They've dug in the last three months, worked their socks off and we're getting the rewards."
