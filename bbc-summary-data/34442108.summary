The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry were treated like everybody else on the BBC One show DIY SOS when the resident electrician called them "sausage".

The princes were in Manchester last week to help with a project to turn a derelict street into homes for ex-service personnel.
Presenter Nick Knowles revealed they asked to be called "William and Harry" rather than "Your Royal Highness".
But the show's Billy Byrne referred to them in his usual way - "sausage".
Prince Harry replied: "If you're going to call me sausage, it's going to be a very long day."
Byrne, who learnt his trade as an electrician in the 1960s, is one of the original members of the DIY SOS squad and known as the team clown.
