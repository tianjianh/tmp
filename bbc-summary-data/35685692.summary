It will take the number of employees at Celtic Way-based Essentra to 330.
The new roles, supported by Â£400,000 of Welsh government cash, come following the creation of 70 last November.
In announcing the jobs, economy minister Edwina Hart said Wales has a "notable strength" in the pharmaceuticals services sector.
