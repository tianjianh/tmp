Mystery man tracked down by beach love note

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When the man of her dreams passed her on the sand, a tourist decided to write him a note and leave it on the beach.

Four days later, Sarah returned to the same spot in New Zealand, hoping to find the "boy with the star tattoos".
She wasn't expecting to see crowds and TV crews. After a tense half hour... William Chalmers showed up.
"I ended up being really nervous and it got in the way. Made everything a bit more anxious," Sarah told Newsbeat.
The shirtless man with a Labradoodle caught Sarah's eye at Picton on New Zealand's South Island, but she was kicking herself when she didn't respond to his smile.
"I didn't wave when I should have waved, so I wrote him a note," the Scottish traveller told Newsbeat.
"We have these moments of thinking and then we don't act on them so it was like, why not? We live in fear too much, so why not?"
She left the note on Saturday, before leaving the area for four days.
"On the off-chance you are single, remember who I am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk, I'll be sitting on the grass..." her note read.
The note went viral. Local newspapers and radio stations carried the story.
Sarah was there, as promised, on Tuesday and William immediately suggested they get away from the cheering crowds and go for a drink.
He told Newsbeat a friend had first seen the note after a night out and came home to wake him up straight away. They went to the beach at 3.30am. "Oh my God, this is me and it's crazy," he thought.
He said he remembered Sarah because he'd smiled at her - and "I don't just smile at every girl" - but he was also feeling confused and nervous. "It was like being back in high school, at the time when you find a note in your locker. Instead of the teacher taking the note off you, the world is watching you."
Newsbeat called the couple during their first date. "It's going really well," said William. "She's really cool."
