Rosco, an eight-month-old Border Terrier, was taken from outside "devastated" 82-year-old owner Leonard Ormond's Napier Drive home on Monday.
Police have issued an appeal to trace two men in a grey Ford Transit van.
A Help Find Rosco Facebook page has now been set up in a bid to trace the stolen dog.
Mr Ormond's son Gordon said: "My dad was sitting in the living room and he saw a grey van pull up.
"Two guys got out and my dad thought it was some sort of charity van.
"Before he even got up, the two guys are in the gate, picked the dog up, back in the van and gone.
"He's devastated and is blaming himself."
Mr Ormond said the response on social media to help find Rosco, who is microchipped, had been "incredible".
A Tayside Division spokeswoman said: "Police Scotland is making enquiries following a report that a brown-coloured male Border Terrier dog was stolen from an address in Napier Drive, Dundee between 09:00 and 09:30 on Monday.
"Officers are keen to trace a grey Ford Transit van with a blue or possibly brown logo that was seen in the area at the time.
"The man driving the van was wearing a wearing high visibility vest and was accompanied by another man."
