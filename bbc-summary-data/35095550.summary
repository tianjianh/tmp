Suarez put Barca ahead after Guangzhou keeper Li Shuai parried Ivan Rakitic's long-range shot.
The former Liverpool striker doubled the lead with a sublime angled volley following Andres Iniesta's lofted pass.
Suarez completed his hat-trick with a penalty after Munir El Haddadi was fouled by Huang Bowen.
Barcelona will face Argentina's River Plate in the final and victory for Luis Enrique's side will ensure they end 2015 with a fifth trophy.
Having won La Liga and the Champions League, Barcelona have also added the Copa del Rey and Uefa Super Cup.
Argentina international Messi is facing a battle to make Sunday's final in Yokohama.
He was expected to play against Guangzhou but was diagnosed Thursday morning with renal colic, a type of abdominal pain commonly attributed to kidney stones.
His availability for the final will "depend on the outcome of further medical tests," a Barcelona statement said.
Fellow forward Neymar missed the semi-final in Yokohama due to a groin problem but is hoping to play on Sunday.
Barcelona boss Luis Enrique on Luis Suarez: "Luis is a penalty area assassin, a killer, capable of resolving any situation that crops up in the area.
"If we also consider the pressure he puts on defenders by closing them down and the way he encourages the others, then he is indispensable."
On whether Messi or Neymar could play on Sunday: "I really don't know if they will be available but the important thing is we have the resources [to break down the defence].
"We took this very seriously, we were very efficient and made almost no mistakes."
