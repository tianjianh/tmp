[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a three-year-old boy who was killed by a trailer that came loose from a Land Rover have reacted angrily at the driver's sentence.

At Bristol Crown Court, Tony Davies, 37, from Hallen, was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service for causing Freddie Hussey's death through careless driving.
He was also disqualified from driving for six months.
Freddie's parents called the sentence a "joke" and described Davies as "scum".
Scott and Donna Hussey's outburst came in the courtroom after Judge Geoffrey Mercer handed down Davies's sentence.
Mr Hussey swore at Davies, and Mrs Hussey called the sentence "disgusting" and "no justice at all".
She also shouted at Davies: "I hope you rot in hell. You are scum. He was a beautiful little boy".
The trailer Davies was towing became detached and mounted a kerb on Parson Street in Bedminster, Bristol, on 27 January.
It struck a wall, then hit Freddie, who was walking along the pavement behind his mother.
He suffered head injuries and died in hospital.
Passing sentence, Judge Mercer said there was "no suggestion" that Davies was driving "anything but entirely properly".
"The carelessness lies between the coupling of the Land Rover and the trailer," he added.
In a prepared statement, Freddie's family said: "No sentence will ever reflect the enormous loss and devastation we as a family have suffered.
"We have to find a way to live with this, but we're relieved the court process is now over."
Davies had admitted causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing.
Avon and Somerset Police called it a "tragic case" and urged drivers to take care when securing trailers.
