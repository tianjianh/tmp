[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julie Webster, 40, was arrested by police on Monday after a lengthy investigation into the Greater Maryhill Foodbank, which closed in March.
She has been charged with fraudulent activity involving a four-figure sum of money.
Last year, the foodbank received Â£15,000 in donations after money collected to help a girl injured in a hit-and-run incident was stolen.
The donations included Â£5,000 each from comedian Frankie Boyle and the Scottish government.
Glasgow City Council and the Scottish government later withdrew funding for the foodbank after investigations into its activities were launched, with schools in the city told not to support it.
A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed: "On 16 August 2016, a 40-year-old woman was charged in connection with alleged fraud offences. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
