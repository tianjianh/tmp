Northern Ireland football: Sporting identity is a game of two halves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Take two politicians - one from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), one from Sinn Féin, and ask them about the Northern Ireland football team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The result? A game of two halves.
The DUP member is Nelson McCausland, chair of the culture, arts and leisure committee which scrutinises the work of the Sports Minister Carál Ní Chuilín.
Cathal Ó hOisín is the Sinn Féin MLA - he also sits on the same committee.
On Thursday night, Northern Ireland qualified for the 2016 European Championships with a 3-1 victory over Greece.
Shortly before the match, the BBC One NI programme The View thought it was time to ask if the recent success, together with efforts to clean up the image of the match-day experience at Windsor Park football stadium, made it more likely the entire community could get behind the team.
Mr McCausland claimed that was already happening.
"I know many people from the Roman Catholic community who are regular attenders at international matches and enjoy it and feel very comfortable there, and that's something that needs to be encouraged and welcomed," he said.
"We want to see a Northern Ireland team that has the support of the entire Northern Ireland community."
Mr Ó hOisín said: "I would know some people [Catholics] as well that support the northern team, yes.
"But I do think in terms of sporting development here, the best examples of sport on this island are done on a national basis - on a 32-county basis.
"We look at rugby and we look at GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) and there are other sports. Cricket as well, even."
But what about the playing of God Save the Queen before games, said to be a major turn-off factor for Catholics?
Mr McCausland said: "I think it is the anthem of Northern Ireland.
"We're a part of the United Kingdom; it's recognised as being the anthem since 1921 and the formation of Northern Ireland.
"I don't see any particular reason to change that."
Mr Ó hOisín said: "History has left us in a position whereby we look at what the past was.
"The sectarian chanting and the playing of the British national anthem and all the rest of it - it's not something that terribly appeals to me.
"I won't call myself a supporter but I won't call myself a detractor either.
"I would have a passing interest in it but that would be about the height of it. It's not on my radar."
So, did the Sinn Féin member hope the Northern Ireland team would win?
"Personally, probably yes, yeah."
Owen Fenton, a PhD student who has researched the Irish Football Association's Football For All campaign and the impact it has had on potential Catholic supporters, said it is had a positive effect.
"The Football For All campaign definitely had an effect," he said.
"In terms of how people approached the Northern Ireland football team - what they saw from the match day experiences - was that sectarianism had been eliminated from the game.
"It was a much more inclusive atmosphere at matches.
"I think nationalists are now in a position where they can support Northern Ireland without judgement and its more a case of their own choice, and especially with what's happening on the pitch with how well the team is doing people are more attracted to supporting them."
And that change has been reflected in coverage in the main nationalist daily newspaper, the Irish News.
According to Noel Doran, its editor, identity goes to the crux of where we are as a society.
"Some people suggest to us: 'Why don't you concentrate on your own team in the area where you're based', but obviously life's a bit more complicated than that," he said.
"Soccer is the people's game and arouses strong passions, and Windsor Park has a particularly history down the years.
"But even the very name Windsor Park may not obviously be there if what we're led to believe is true."
He was referring to media speculation that the Northern Ireland team's home stadium could be renamed under a corporate sponsorship deal.
"The image of the team has been changing over a period of time. I suppose if you went to places like Derry city you'd get a different perception as well," Mr Doran added.
"Young people there just don't identify with Northern Ireland at all and some of the players of course have been switching to play for the Republic [of Ireland], but in other nationalist areas that's not the case."
Ahead of Thursday's game against Greece, Stormont's culture, arts and leisure committee unanimously sent best wishes to the team.
For good measure, it then did the same for the Republic of Ireland and even Scotland who are in the same qualifying group. A score draw.
The game of political football is alive and well, even if sectarianism on the terraces is increasingly on the defence.
The View will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:25 BST on Thursday, 8 October.
