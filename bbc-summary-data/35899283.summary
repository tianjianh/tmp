The Briton continues his Olympic build-up in Cardiff against several athletes he will face in Rio this summer.
Kenyan Geoffrey Kamworor is seeking to defend the title he won in 2014.
"A world medal would be amazing," said Farah, 33. "It's going to be like a mini Olympics because you have all the guys who'll be competing in Rio."
Kamworor leads a strong Kenyan contingent in Wales that is likely to provide the stiffest test to Farah this weekend.
"The field is really strong. You have the Kenyan team I'm going to be competing against in Rio. It doesn't get much tougher than this," added Farah.
"After a good block of training it's important you race and test yourself. In my heart I wouldn't be turning up if I didn't want to win."
Farah held off Kamworor's challenge at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing last year as he successfully defended his 10,000m title.
However, the British athlete believes his opponent - and his compatriot Bedan Karoki - have the pressure of being the favourites over the half-marathon distance.
"It was a close race in Beijing and Geoffrey will go out there and push all the way - but that's what I need," he said.
"He's the favourite along with Bedan Karoki - which is nice as there's a little bit of pressure off for a change."
Kamworor, 23, is also the world cross country champion while Karoki, 25, won his last half marathon.
Farah has twice won the Great North Run over the half-marathon distance and has increased his training mileage from around 100 to 120 miles a week as he looks ahead to a future away from the track.
"I'd like to see how Rio goes. I really want to do the 5,000m and 10,000m double again, then come back to the World Athletics Championships in London in 2017," Farah said.
"I'm not sure what I could do after that but when I finish on the track I'd like to see what I can do on the road."
