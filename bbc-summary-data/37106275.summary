Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy was "fuming" after Daryl Murphy had a goal disallowed in the 0-0 draw at Wolves.

Murphy's first-half header was ruled out for offside on Tuesday.
"I'm delighted (with the performance) and fuming at the same time because I think we've been denied a really good goal," McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk.
"Freddie Sears is (called for offside) in front of the goalkeeper, but it flies past him. Neither of them have a chance of getting it."
McCarthy continued: "I'm not even convinced he's in an offside position. I think there's a defender that's level.
"But even if he's not level, I saw a goal recently where there was somebody stood in front of the goalkeeper and it was a goal. They're the rules now, unless you motion towards it."
Ipswich have taken four points from their opening three Championship matches, but lost in the EFL Cup to Stevenage.
On Sunday, McCarthy's side face Norwich in first the East Anglian derby since the 2014-15 play-off semi-finals.
"Everybody's looking forward to Norwich and not looking forward to it," said McCarthy. "I'm looking forward to it, but they're all scared of losing.
"You've got to play the game, be prepared to win and to be brave to win the game and that's what we'll be attempting to do on Sunday."
