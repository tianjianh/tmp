[SN]TITLE[SN]
How a nightclub stranger became my stalker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hounded out of her home, terrified and beaten. This is a story of how one woman's world was turned upside down by a stranger she met in a club - and how she came out the other side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following the UK government's announcement of measures it hopes will help protect victims of stalking, she contacted the BBC with her experiences.
After seven years of terror, harassment and assault, the stalking ended. But the memories are fresh, and she has asked to remain anonymous. We're calling her Sally to protect her identity.
Before the violence, before the abuse, before the threats, there was a man in a nightclub.  Chatty, interested in music and apparently a regular, he had been talking to her friends. She assumed he was a pal of theirs.
So far, so normal.
But the next day there was a knock on the door.
It was him. Sally, who was 23 at the time, hadn't told him her address or exchanged phone numbers.
"He told me that he'd gone from house to house knocking on doors until he found mine," Sally told us.
"My housemate let him in.  I was concerned by that initial behaviour but nobody around me seemed to view it as odd so I just carried on chatting and being friendly."
Persistent and intense, he spent a lot of time at the house over the next three weeks. By then, Sally had had enough.
"This is when the dangerous behaviour began," she said.
He continued to turn up at the house, his behaviour increasingly erratic.
"One morning my housemate discovered photographs of me. He must have stolen them from my house. They were torn and stuck on to our front door with some dead carnations. It was like a gravestone."
Sally was determined to ignore him. She thought that if she refused to acknowledge his behaviour then he would leave her alone. But the situation quickly deteriorated.
A short while later, he kicked down the door of her house while she was out and trashed her room.
Sally went to the police and her stalker was eventually sentenced to community service. But his harassment continued.
Sally started to notice lewd, derogatory phrases scrawled around her local pub. One night, stones were thrown through her window. Another night it was a gas canister. It happened in the middle of the night and police told Sally there was little that they could do without witnesses.
Her housemate moved out. The stress was too much. And Sally's landlord was fed up at having to pay for new windows. They wanted her to leave too.
The abuse soon turned physical.
"I was on a night out with friends when he followed me," she said. "He attacked me and punched me in the head.
"I ran all the way to hospital with him in pursuit. When I got there, he sat in the waiting area watching me."
Terrified, she fled before she could receive any treatment and spent the night at a friend's.
"It wasn't long after this that I left university and fled to my mum's house in a different city," she said.
"I fled for my life. I was petrified that he would kill me. When he attacked me, I genuinely thought I was going to die."
At her mum's house, Sally thought she was safe. But then the phone calls started. And the letters. Unbeknownst to Sally, her stalker knew exactly where her mum lived - he'd stolen reams of personal information when he had broken into her house.
"He would ring for hours at a time," she said. "Gradually he began to make threats to my life."
The police were called in again. He was charged, convicted and sent to prison.
And for a while everything seemed to calm down. Sally was moving on. She got married and became pregnant. She thought that the stalking had stopped but after he was released from prison, he started turning up at her mother's house, threatening arson. And the menacing phone calls soon began again.
"I received many death threats and death threats to my sister via voicemail," she said.
He was eventually arrested for an unrelated public order offence. Sally would have to face him in court again.
He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and community service.
"With time spent on remand, he was free in a short amount of time," Sally said. "We had limited protection through his bail conditions and restraining orders but he just viewed these as a game.
"He continually breached them but always seemed to avoid arrest."
Eventually she managed to track him down online and passed the new information on to the police. He was arrested again. Finally, it seemed the ordeal was over.
She would still occasionally receive messages on social media and her partner was also harassed online, but things began to go quiet and Sally could move on.
She's changed her name and the family no longer lives in the same area. There has been no contact now for a substantial period of time. But the impact on her life has been "monumental".
"My self-confidence evaporated overnight," she said. "Long-standing friends know that I am a different person. I'm still very jumpy with knocks on the door and cars parked outside my house.
"Even now, if I come across his photograph I feel as if I've been punched in the stomach and I know my family feel the same too. Knowing this would no doubt make him feel powerful, but this is why sharing my story is important as it is me taking back some of the control that he took from my life."
She welcomes the government's proposals, though she worries that some victims might struggle to access the new protection orders.
"I was glad to hear that a five-year sentence could be applied as this seems much more appropriate for the damage stalking can do to the victim's life," she said.
"I would hope that judges would recognise the severity of these crimes and award these more appropriate sentences.  More victims may be able to gain suitable protection.
"I know from personal experience that collecting evidence for criminal pursuit of such matters can prove to be difficult."
