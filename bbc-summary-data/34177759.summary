SRUC looking at alternatives to Inverness vet lab proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's Rural College has started looking at alternatives for the future of a laboratory to those it previously set out in a consultation document.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Feedback on the consultation included strong opposition to a proposal to shut the veterinary unit in Inverness.
Farmers, vets and MSPs oppose any move to close the site.
The lab carries out post-mortem examinations on dead livestock as part of Scotland's animal disease surveillance services.
In a statement, SRUC said: "The proposals for changes to the Inverness vet lab and other disease surveillance centres operated by Scotland's Rural College were first published for consultation on 2 June.
"They were proposals not plans.
"Since the consultation finished, SRUC has taken note of the many views expressed and in light of them is revising the original proposals and continues to discuss alternatives or possible changes with key stakeholders. We will make them public as soon as we are able."
Scotland's Rural College looked at the future of the unit as part of a wider consultation on the future shape of veterinary disease surveillance.
In a report last month, SRUC said there was "strong opposition" in the feedback to the closure plan.
Opponents included 20 vets working at seven practices in the Highlands.
In a letter, they said they were unhappy with a suggestion that the post-mortem examinations be carried out by private practices on-site on farms.
The Prospect union and local MSPs including David Stewart and Rob Gibson have also opposed the closure plan.
Prospect spokesman Alan Denney said: "We are pleased to note that the wide-ranging concerns expressed during the consultation. including from Prospect, appear to have been listened to.
"We await with interest more details from the college."
Scottish ministers and a strategic management board will look at the options for the future shape of disease surveillance before any final decisions are made.
