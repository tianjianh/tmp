BBC Radio 1 has recovered from record low audiences, and now reaches 10.44 million listeners a week, according to new figures from ratings body Rajar.

The station gained 737,000 listeners in the last quarter, thanks in part to new presenters Clara Amfo and Annie Mac.
Breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw also increased his weekly reach by 344,000 to 5.84 million.
BBC Radio 2 remains the most listened to station in the UK, with 15.14 million tuning in.
In total, 48 million UK adults - or 89% of the adult population - tuned in to the radio every week between April and June, Rajar said.
Helen Boaden, Director of BBC Radio, said: "Radio is frequently underestimated so it's wonderful to see the whole market growing this quarter."
Radio 1's recovery will be welcome news to the station's bosses. Results for the first three months of 2015 showed the station's audience dropping to its lowest level for more than a decade - at 9.7 million listeners.
At the time, Grimshaw had 5.5 million listeners, his lowest audience since succeeding Chris Moyles in 2012, and the breakfast show's smallest audience since 2003, when Sara Cox was at the end of her tenure.
The next set of Rajar figures will measure the impact of Apple's Beats 1 radio station, which poached Zane Lowe from Radio 1, along with several of the station's producers.
Apple told the BBC it had signed up 11 million people to its Apple Music service since it launched on 30 June.
That compares with 75 million active users on Spotify, 16 million on Deezer and 770,000 on Tidal.
"We're thrilled with the numbers so far," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services.
However, it remains to be seen how Apple's user base will change when the free, three-month trial period ends and it introduces a monthly subscription fee of Â£9.99.
