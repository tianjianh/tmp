Norris, Lakeside runner-up in 2014, is joined by James Wilson, who was number one seed at this year's tournament.
Robbie Green and Jan Dekker are also attempting to earn tour cards.
The quartet are taking part in the PDC's Qualifying School, which begins on Wednesday in Wigan.
Stephen Bunting, the 2014 BDO world champion, switched after his win at the Lakeside and enjoyed a successful year, reaching the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship.
Bunting took advantage of the tour cards automatically offered to Lakeside semi-finalists, which the PDC has since withdrawn.
