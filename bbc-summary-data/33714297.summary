Up to 200 jobs have been secured at Liberty Insurance following an agreement with a customer service firm.

Teleperformance is to manage Liberty's Enniskillen contact centre for the Republic of Ireland.
In June, Liberty said they were cutting 270 jobs across Ireland, 20 of them in Fermanagh.
The agreement with Teleperformance should be in place by the end of August.
Liberty Insurance took over Quinn Insurance in April 2011.
The company provides car and home insurance to the Irish market and has offices in Cavan and Dublin.
Liberty chief executive Tom McIlduff said: "Teleperformance's focus on providing an excellent customer experience means that the company is a great fit with Liberty Insurance's values."
"I am confident that today's announcement will be to the benefit of our existing over 200 employees in Enniskillen, the wider Fermanagh community and our customers across Ireland."
In April 2011, Liberty Insurance took over Quinn Insurance, which was founded by ex-billionaire Sean Quinn.
The County Fermanagh-born businessman was once the richest man in Ireland but his empire was badly hit by the global downturn in 2008 and he lost control of his family businesses.
