Northampton Town and the missing millions: A timeline of events

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The people of Northampton want to know what has happened to their missing millions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The borough council loaned £10.25m to Northampton Town Football Club to redevelop the stadium and nearby land, but the funds have seemingly vanished, leaving an unfinished stand and the football club almost going under.
This story began four years ago when a decision was made to invest in the new stand. Now a police inquiry is under way into "alleged financial irregularities".
A BBC investigation has traced where most of the loan money seems to have gone, uncovering allegations millions of pounds was misappropriated by the developer appointed to oversee the project.
We've also discovered how some of it may have financed other schemes and how the developer disguised his funding of former council leader David Mackintosh's successful bid to become the MP for Northampton South.
These hidden donations are now the subject of another police inquiry, after the Electoral Commission referred our findings to them.
Mr Mackintosh said he welcomed both investigations and that he "will co-operate fully with police".
Below is our coverage to date. This timeline will be updated as we report on developments.
