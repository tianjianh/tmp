Leicester: Back to reality or still living the dream?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ever since the remains of Richard III were first found under a Leicester car park in 2012, the city has enjoyed a feel-good factor that culminated this year with Leicester City completing a "fairytale" Premier League title win.

But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over?
Or is it a case of what next?
Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine.
To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season.
However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals.
And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory...
Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe.
He said: "We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season.
"Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable."
But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing.
Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: "Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got.
"We saw a 17% increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June.
"What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors."

Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success.
He said: "We have done over 80% [occupancy] for the last year.
"It was fantastic in November, with 85% occupancy for the month - it was 65% two years ago.
"I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon.
"Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester."
But others aren't quite so bullish about the future.
Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won.
Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually.
"It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League," he said.
"But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens."
So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes?
Or will the city simply have to accept that "two out of three ain't bad"?
