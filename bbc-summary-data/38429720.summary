[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 1-2 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Rendell was on target against Woking for the second time in six days as Aldershot snatched a 2-1 injury-time win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rendell - who left Woking for the Shots in the summer and hit a hat-trick against them in the 4-0 win on Boxing Day - headed in a cross from Anthony Straker in the 63rd minute.
But less than two minutes later Woking hauled themselves level through Max Kretzschmar's lob over goalkeeper Jake Cole.
However, Aldershot won it a minute into stoppage time when Rendell helped the ball on in the area and Idris Kanu bundled it in at the far post.
