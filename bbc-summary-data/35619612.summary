[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controversial late penalty for St Johnstone secured a 1-1 draw for the visitors and denied Aberdeen the chance to cut the gap on Celtic to four points at the top of the Scottish Premiership.

Simon Church had put the home side ahead with a close-range effort.
But with just two minutes to play, Saints substitute Liam Craig scored from the spot after being challenged inside the box by Ryan Jack.
Aberdeen players and fans were left furious by the penalty decision.
The home side started this game buoyed by Celtic's slip up in their match against Hamilton on Friday but also shell-shocked by the news they could be without their top scorer Adam Rooney for six weeks.
Derek McInnes' side immediately set out to dominate possession and although they dictated play early on, they missed the obvious target that Rooney so often provides.
As they pushed for the opening goal, Kenny McLean found some space 10 yards out but his shot was weak and Saints goalkeeper Alan Mannus wasn't troubled.
As the first half progressed and the home side failed to take advantage of their possession, St Johnstone began to push forward and find gaps in an Aberdeen defence that, at times, looked very fragile.
Steven MacLean had a couple of decent efforts but his lob from 10 yards out didn't have enough to beat Scott Brown and his volley from the same distance was blocked at the last minute.
But just as it looked like the Dons were living dangerously, Church blasted them into the lead.
Ash Taylor's header from a Niall McGinn corner looked to be goal-bound. Mannus saved well but could not hold it and Church swept the ball into the back of the net from four yards.
It was a goal that not only settled the Aberdeen legions inside Pittodrie, but also the home players, who started to knock the ball around with the confidence of a side who see themselves as title contenders.
But despite their continued domination in the second half, they failed to extend their lead and it was to prove costly.
Jack, McGinn and Pawlett all linked up well but they just could not find a way through.
As some of the 12,563 fans started to head for the exits, the game's most controversial moment happened.
As Craig picked up the ball and drove into the box, he was challenged by Jack, who appeared to make contact with the ball. But Craig tumbled and referee Steven McLean pointed to the spot.
With the home fans still howling in protest, Craig stepped up and expertly sent Brown the wrong way.
For Aberdeen, the remaining few minutes were spent throwing the kitchen sink in the direction of the St Johnstone goal but the winner never came.
