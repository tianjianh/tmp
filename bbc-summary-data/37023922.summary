Marvin Johnson: Interest in winger no surprise to Motherwell boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Mark McGhee is unsure if Motherwell will be able to keep winger Marvin Johnson at Fir Park.

Oxford say they will not pursue the 25-year-old further after a Â£300,000 bid was rejected last week.
But McGhee is sure others will be watching Johnson, who has been linked with a move to Brighton after scoring four goals in five games this season.
"He's a brilliant player and I wouldn't be surprised if somebody like Brighton fancied him," said McGhee.
Johnson is under contract until the summer of 2018, having joined the Steelemen from Kidderminster Harriers for an undisclosed fee on the final day of the winter transfer window in 2015.
He scored six goals last season.
McGhee insists there has been no approach from Brighton, one of his former clubs.
"I was at Brighton's game with Lazio last week and I spoke to their chairman and Paul Winstanley [head of recruitment] and neither of them mentioned Marvin Johnson to me.
"So it's all speculation. I know these guys very, very well and I can assure you they would speak to me.
"Marvin has got to deal with the speculation, we've got to deal with it too. Until somebody makes an offer then it is not really worth the paper it's written on.
"I'm not confident either way. But every day that ticks by is one less I have to contend with."
Johnson has started the new campaign impressively and McGhee is backing him to remain consistent despite the uncertainty.
"He is a boy who doesn't really let these things distract him," the manager explained.
"He should perform all right, although in the background his head will be churning a wee bit at the possibilities.
"I've spoken to him a couple of times and reassured him that we are looking after his best interests as well. If there are developments then we will talk to him."
