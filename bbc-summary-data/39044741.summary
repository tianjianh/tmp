Off-duty firefighters fought to save a fire service apprentice after a two-vehicle crash in Snowdonia, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trystan Rhun Roberts, 19, died on the A5 at Capel Curig on 17 May, 2016.
Mr Roberts, from Cynwyd, near Corwen, Denbighshire, was an apprentice fleet technician with the North Wales Fire and Rescue Service.
Assistant coroner Nicola Jones recorded a conclusion of death as a result of a road traffic collision.
Mountaineering guide Robert Spencer told the inquest in Ruthin how Mr Roberts' Seat Leon overtook him at around 60mph as he drove along the A5 near the Siabod Cafe.
It then crashed into a Mercedes that was turning right into a car park.
The off-duty firefighters were among the first on the scene and attempted to resuscitate Mr Roberts.
Police collision investigator Gordon Saynor said it appeared that he had either not noticed the Mercedes or thought he could overtake it.
Ms Jones said she hoped Mr Roberts' family could take some comfort from the fact that everything possible was done to help him by highly-trained officers.
