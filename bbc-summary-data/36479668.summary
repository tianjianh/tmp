[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee Sheriff Court heard John Cummings shouted, swore and acted aggressively towards medics at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital.
The court was told he had been taken to the hospital heavily under the influence of alcohol.
Cummings threatened to turn up at the home of one of the doctors.
The 44-year-old, a prisoner at HMP Perth, pleaded guilty to a charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner on 7 May.
Sheriff Alastair Brown told Cummings: "People who kick off in A&E, threaten staff and assault staff can expect to be dealt with very seriously.
"It is a particularly sensitive environment.
"People may have been in there suffering life-threatening issues.
"Deterrence in these cases is the most important sentencing objective."
