Naked bike riders highlight 'vulnerability of cyclists'

Hundreds of cyclists have taken part in a naked bike ride through Bristol to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists on the roads.

The ride - on the theme "as bare as you dare" - is the seventh time the event has been held in the city.
Up to 250 people are thought to have taken part in the "family friendly" 6.5-mile (10km) city centre ride.
The event went ahead despite coinciding with a number of other planned city centre protests and marches.
But in a bid to "stay well away from other protests" - including those organised by the right wing faction South West Infidels, the Anti-Nazi League and Refugees Welcome - organisers of the naked bike ride decided to change the route.
The aptly named pub, The Full Moon in Stokes Croft, was the starting point but on the advice of police the route was amended to avoid College Green.
Event organiser, Will Bryson said: "We're celebrating bikes and bodies but we also have a serious message - to highlight how vulnerable cyclists are on the roads.
"Our roads are still too dangerous for many people to even consider cycling, and far too many cyclists are killed on the roads each year."
Bristol became England's first cycling city in 2008 and was awarded Â£22m to encourage residents to ride bicycles.
Three years later it was announced the project, which aimed at doubling the number of regular cyclists in the city, had failed to meet its target.
