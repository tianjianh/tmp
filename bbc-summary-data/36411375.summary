Scott Williams: Wales need improvement to compete with New Zealand

Centre Scott Williams says Wales will need to perform at a higher level to have any chance of beating New Zealand.

Wales have not beaten the All Blacks since 1953 and Williams admits a big improvement on their 27-13 warm-up defeat to England at Twickenham is required to give them a chance.
"Everyone's going to have to play one of their best games to beat New Zealand," the 25-year old said.
Wales play the first of three Tests against the world champions on 11 June.
Williams is aware any margin for error disappears against the All Blacks.
"We're trying to lift the standards, every pass has to be on the money because against New Zealand it has to be."
Williams was playing his first Test since being stretchered off with a knee injury in the 28-25 World Cup win over England in September 2015 and confirmed he felt good afterwards.
"It was a good blow out and I feel quite fit," he continued. "It takes one or two games at international level to get used to the intensity so next match it'll be better still hopefully."
Despite a second successive defeat against England, Williams feels will head to New Zealand in a positive frame of mind.
"We have to think positively because there's no point going to New Zealand with negative thoughts as it'll be a long couple of weeks so we're thinking about all the positives," said Williams.
"We needed this game and we'll take all the positives because we'll have to be at our best to beat them out there.
"If we start thinking negatively then it'll be really tough. There's a lot of positives, when we had the ball we looked dangerous and we just need to put the wrongs right."
