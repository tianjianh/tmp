The announcement was made at a press conference at Carrow Road.
Fry, who will act as an ambassador for the club, said: "Truly this is one of the most exciting days of my life and I am as proud and pleased as I could be."
Fry, who has a home in Norfolk, is a lifelong fan of the Championship club and has often been seen with majority shareholder Delia Smith at Carrow Road.
He said: "Having been shockingly overlooked by successive Norwich City managers all these years as a player, I have come to the sad conclusion that it is probably unlikely now that I will ever be picked to play for the first team.
"But I am happy instead to play my part in another capacity, as that of a proud and passionate ambassador for the great game of football.
"The day may still come when I am needed out on the pitch, I haven't entirely ruled that out, but until then I shall endeavour to serve with enthusiasm and energy, spreading the word far and wide of Norwich City Football Club and the pleasures and rewards to be had as a supporter."
Ms Smith said: "Having one of the club's most passionate supporters who just happens to also be one of the country's best-loved performers join us to act as an ambassador for the football club will be just fantastic."
The television chef, who has been majority shareholder at Norwich since 1996, was made a CBE for services to the food industry in 2009.
Norwich, who were League One winners last season, play at Scunthorpe on Saturday where they hope to secure their first points of the new Championship campaign.
