[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 2-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Jones struck a late penalty as rejuvenated Crewe made it back-to-back wins with a 2-1 victory over Sky Bet League Two play-off hopefuls Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa's 76th-minute strike appeared to have salvaged a point for the Chairboys after the striker's 12th goal of the season cancelled out Chris Dagnall's first-half opener.
But James' penalty three minutes from time secured the spoils for Crewe, who look a different proposition to the side which had limped on for 11 games without a win before their shock 5-0 demolition of Grimsby at the weekend.
Wycombe were bidding to reclaim a berth in the play-off places after losing 3-0 to Stevenage, but found themselves a goal down in controversial circumstances after just 10 minutes at Gresty Road.
Dagnall forced his way past Joe Jacobson to unleash a fierce drive which Wanderers' keeper Jamal Blackman parried under his bar. But referee Michael Salisbury conferred with his assistant before adjudging the ball had crossed the line.
Wycombe responded with Scott Kashket driving in a shot from distance, but failing to trouble Crewe keeper Ben Garratt.
Garratt was also safely behind Akinfenwa's header as the veteran striker latched onto Jacobson's free-kick.
Sam Wood should have done better when well placed in front of goal after the break, but the Wycombe midfielder fired his effort straight at Garratt.
Kashket was replaced by Garry Thompson up front, but Crewe continued to look the more likely scorers and on-loan midfielder Callum Cooke's volley had Blackman stretching to tip the ball over.
However, just as the home side were looking good value to increase their lead, Wycombe equalised.
Akinfenwa latched onto a ball pumped to the edge of the box and swivelled to dispatch a lethal finish into the bottom corner to level the scores 14 minutes from time.
But Crewe were not to be denied, and in the 87th minute Sido Jombati held back George Ray to concede what seemed a harsh penalty award and Jones blasted home from the spot.
