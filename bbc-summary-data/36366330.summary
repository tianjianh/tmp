The father of a woman jailed for failing to tell the authorities her husband had gone to join IS in Syria has said she was wrongly convicted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lorna Moore, originally from County Tyrone but who lived in Walsall, was sentenced to two and a half years.
Her husband, Sajid Aslam, 34, was part of a large network that heeded the militants' call for volunteers in 2014.
Noel Moore, from Mountjoy outside Omagh, said his daughter was unaware of her husband's intentions.
"It was a miscarriage of justice, it couldn't be anything else, my daughter didn't know where the man was going," Mr Moore said.
"I think the whole thing's rubbish from start to finish. Somebody's been accused of something they didn't do and getting two and a half years in jail for it.
"She didn't know that the man was going to go away. He didn't come back home after a week of holidays."
Muslim convert Moore, 34, was convicted of planning to take her three young children - including an 11-month-old baby - to the war zone.
Her father said there was "no way" she would have done that
"She thought too  much of her youngsters to take them over there," Mr Moore said.
"How would you be feeling if it happened to your daughter. It's a very difficult time, what else could it be."
Sentencing Lorna Moore at the Old Bailey on Monday, Judge Charles Wide QC described the trainee maths teacher as a "very strong character" and said she "knew perfectly well of [her] husband's dedication to terrorism".
"One of the troubling things about you is your facility for telling lies," he added.
He said Moore had told "lie after lie" to the jury during her trial and that some of her evidence was "nonsense".
Police say 12 people from Walsall went to Syria or tried to do so that year.
Two of the men who made it to Syria have since died, while the whereabouts of others is unclear.
