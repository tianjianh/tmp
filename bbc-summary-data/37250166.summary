The Scot, 23, was pipped on the line by American Shannon Rowbury but overtook Kenyan Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon in the overall standings.
Kipyegon could only finish seventh.
"I never expected anything like this," said Muir, who was seventh in the Olympic final in Rio. "I am the Diamond Race winner. This is big, big for me."
Muir beat her own British 1500m record by more than two seconds to win last week's Diamond League race in Paris. She also won in London.
The title earns the veterinary medicine student a prize of Â£30,000.

Double Olympic sprint champion Elaine Thompson won the 200m race in 21.85 seconds, beating rival Dafne Schippers by 0.01 seconds, with Britain's Dina Asher-Smith finishing fourth.
