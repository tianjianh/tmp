The 29-year-old jumped from 12th to ninth when he won the green jacket.
Since finishing second in September's Italian Open, Willett has missed the cut in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and tied 68th in the Turkish Airlines Open on Sunday.
"To be honest, I don't really want to be out there playing golf," he said.
The Sheffield-born golfer has now dropped to number 11 in the world. Australia's Jason Day retains top spot, with Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy in second.
"It couldn't happen at a worst time," added Willett. "Things are just not going our way, nothing feels great."
