[SN]TITLE[SN]
John Joe Nevin: Olympic boxer charged after pub row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olympic silver-medalist John Joe Nevin has appeared in court in the Republic of Ireland charged with public order offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old boxer was charged being intoxicated in a public place and engaging in threatening and insulting behaviour in connection with an argument outside a bar on Monday.
Mr Nevin, of Mullingar in County Westmeath, was remanded on bail.
He must obey a number of conditions, including a curfew.
But because of the defendant's commitments as a professional boxer this will not apply when he is outside the jurisdiction.
The court heard how a row broke at the Stillery bar on Dominic Street in Mullingar at around 23:20 local time on Monday.
A garda sergeant told the court that CCTV footage showed up to 25 people were involved in the row.
He said gardaÃ­ were called to the disturbance and made a number of arrests.
Four other men also appeared in court charged in relation to the incident.
Mr Nevin is due to appear in court again along with the four other men on 21 May when further charges may be brought.
