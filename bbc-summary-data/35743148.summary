Bridgend pawless puppy gets £10,000 metal legs

A puppy born without his back paws has been fitted with a pair of £10,000 metal legs.

West Highland terrier Rodney was born with stumps, but after a fundraising campaign, TV's Supervet Noel Fitzpatrick carried out the operation.
Rodney is now back with his foster family in Bridgend.
Fosterer Kelly Warner, 33, said: "It's an amazing sight and we are so thrilled he is starting to show signs of being a bouncy, lively puppy."
Eileen Jones, of the Friends of the Animals rescue centre, said: "This little westie puppy came in to our care with no back paws.
"A scan and further examinations showed that Rodney felt pain in his stumps so our only option, if he was to live, was to go for the bionic paws."
After his operation, Rodney spent one month recovering in the Supervet's practice in Godalming, Surrey, before being brought home.
Ms Jones added: "It's still too early to call but we are cautiously optimistic. He's not allowed to jump on furniture and walk upstairs, if anything goes wrong at this stage it's not going to be repairable."
If Rodney progresses well, he will be fitted with permanent legs in the near future.
