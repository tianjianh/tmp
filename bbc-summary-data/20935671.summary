[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rampion offshore windfarm application withdrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An application for a major offshore wind farm in the English Channel has been withdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energy company E.On said it had further consultation work to carry out on the proposed Rampion project before resubmitting the development consent order.
It wants to build 195 turbines off the Sussex coast.
E.On said it hoped to resubmit the application in February and remained "completely committed" to the project.
A spokeswoman said: "We have identified some areas that we need to add to the application.
"We want the application to be complete before the Planning Inspectorate decides whether to accept it and the only way to do this is to withdraw it and resubmit again as soon as we are ready.
"We remain completely committed to the project, but wish to take extra time now to maintain our comprehensive approach to consultation."
