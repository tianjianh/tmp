[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 1-1 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anthony Wordsworth scored a second-half equaliser to earn Southend a deserved point at second-placed Bradford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bantams, who lost their unbeaten record at Oxford on Saturday, went in front in the 36th minute through striker Marc McNulty - his first goal since joining on loan from Sheffield United.
McNulty raced onto a through pass from Haris Vuckic before shooting past the advancing Marc Oxley and he almost scored a second two minutes later, seeing his first shot blocked and his second deflected over the crossbar.
Josh Cullen also went close as Bradford ended the first half in charge.
However, Southend began the second half well, Nile Ranger forcing a diving save out of Colin Doyle in the 49th minute before they scored an equaliser five minutes later.
Ben Coker's left-wing cross was flicked on by former Bradford midfielder Will Atkinson and Wordsworth netted with a close-range header at the far post.
Both sides had chances to score a winner as play swung from end to end but a draw was fair result.
