Police said the officers were on routine patrol at about 1010 BST on Wednesday when the device was thrown.
None of the officers - from the PSNI's neighbourhood team - were injured.
District Commander, Chief Supt Alasdair Robinson said it was "a mindless attack on police officers just trying to do their jobs".
"It is by sheer good fortune that one of those officers was not killed or seriously injured," he added.
"Earlier this week we launched the policing commitments, our pledge to communities about what they can expect from us.
"Those officers were out on the streets delivering on that pledge, providing people with the kind of community based policing service they want."
