Hair-brained plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So you may have noticed that I am off to another place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I don't think this is my last blog post here, but I did want to say something a bit more personal than normal on this occasion - which is that working for BBC News has been the high point of my working life.
Its unrivalled commitment to objectivity, seriousness and relevance is a beacon. And its journalists, editors, producers and cameramen are world class.
Television is a team game. I want to thank all my brilliant colleagues who for the past 10 years have routinely, through their thorough professionalism, transformed my pig's ears into almost-silken purses.
I've never had a dull moment since I joined. I will miss the BBC terribly.
