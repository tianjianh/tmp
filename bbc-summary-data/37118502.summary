A first slice of funding for the £36m Hawick flood protection scheme has been confirmed by the Scottish government.

A meeting of Scottish Borders Council heard an initial capital grant of £1.3m was being provided in 2016/17.
The scheme will receive 80% of overall project costs from the government.
The funding comes ahead of a public exhibition in Hawick town hall on Tuesday and Wednesday which will give the public an opportunity to comment on the scheme.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "It is hugely positive news for Hawick that the Scottish government has provided the first tranche of funding for the town's flood protection scheme, and included the project on its priority list.
"The next aim is to now get the scheme built and that is why the public exhibition this month remains so important.
"As the scheme is currently in its outline design phase, it is a lot easier for us to address any concerns now than if objections are brought up at a later stage, which could result in delays to the overall project."
The public exhibition runs from 09:00 to 21:00 on both days.
