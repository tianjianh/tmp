Cardiff City have sacked Paul Trollope as head coach after less than five months in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bluebirds are second from bottom of the Championship after only two wins in 11 matches.
Assistant coach Lennie Lawrence and performance director Ryland Morgans have also left the club.
Former Sheffield United, Leeds United, Crystal Palace and QPR manager Neil Warnock is understood to be among the front-runners to replace Trollope.
Trollope was appointed by Cardiff on 18 May and confirmed in August that he would leave his role with Wales.
Trollope admitted his disappointment in leaving the role in a statement released via the League Manager's Association.
"I would firstly like to thank Tan Sri Vincent Tan, the chairman, Board of Directors and CEO for giving me the opportunity to lead Cardiff City," he said.
"I am of course disappointed to be leaving the football club after almost two years, however I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the club and would like to thank the players and all the staff at the Vale training complex and stadium for their hard work, commitment, friendship and support.
"I would also like to thank the fans for the support I received during my time at the club.
"I wish everyone at the football club every success for the rest of the season and the future."
Trollope becomes the third manager to be sacked by a Welsh club in seven days, following the dismissals of Swansea's Francesco Guidolin and Newport's Warren Feeney.
