[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man fearing 'Isis attack' is guilty of amassing explosives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who stockpiled explosive substances to "defend the UK from an attack by Isis" has been found guilty of three criminal offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roger Smith was concerned about an attack similar to that on fusilier Lee Rigby in London in 2014, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
The 46-year-old was found guilty of two counts of having explosive substances at his home in Clifton in Nottingham.
He was also found guilty of having a document for terrorist purposes.
That charge related to a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000, a guide to making bombs based on The Anarchist Cookbook.
Jurors heard that police first became aware of Smith in June 2014 because of a dispute with his neighbours concerning hedges and garden fires.
PCSO Matthew Holden said he had several dealings with the defendant, who openly told him he had a compound bow and a set of three knives.
He told jurors Smith was concerned about "a terrorist attack or Islamic attack similar to the Lee Rigby attack", said "Islam was at war with the West" and "believed a citizen should have the right to bear arms".
Police searched Mr Smith's home on 21 October 2015 and found gunpowder and large amounts of chemicals that could be used to make explosives along with a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.
In his police interview, Smith said he made the gunpowder to entertain his young relatives by lighting it in the garden.
He claimed he had the other chemicals for legitimate purposes and had the weapons because he was a "survivalist" who liked to shoot arrows in his garden.
Smith bought a second copy of the Anarchy Cookbook from Amazon while awaiting trial which he said was to use as evidence for his defence.
He was charged with an extra offence for making that purchase but the jury cleared him.
He is due to be sentenced on 16 December.
