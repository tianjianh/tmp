'Hostages' training exercise at Aberystwyth University

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An emergency services training exercise has seen 20 "hostages" taken at Aberystwyth University on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff, students and the public are being warned about the activity so no false alarms are raised.
It is being held between 10:00 BST and 15:00 at one of the Cwrt Mawr halls of residence on the Penglais campus.
The aim is to provide the emergency services and university with a scenario to test major incident plans.
It is the first time such an exercise has been done at Aberystwyth University, and police said it had been chosen because the location serves well - not because there was any suggestion the university was under threat.
The volunteer hostages staged a fake protest, chanting about free education, before a "gunman" staged a rampage across the campus.
Phil Maddison, director of health, safety and environment at Aberystwyth University, said: "We realise that it is vital for Dyfed-Powys Police force to carry out training exercises.
"It is also a way to test the effectiveness of our procedures within the university, and to adapt and update where necessary."
