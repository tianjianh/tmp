A special church service is being held to mark the first anniversary of the Glasgow bin lorry crash which left six people dead and 17 others injured.

Candles of remembrance are being lit at Glasgow Cathedral for each of those who lost their lives in the tragedy.
Bereaved families, survivors, emergency services staff and politicians are attending the ecumenical service.
The bin lorry veered out of control on Queen Street after the driver, Harry Clarke, blacked out at the wheel.
A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) later found that the tragedy could have been avoided if Mr Clarke, 58, had not lied about his history of blackouts in order to obtain and keep driving jobs.
Those who died in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.
Prayers for all six are being offered at the service, titled "Glasgow Remembers - The Queen Street Tragedy".
The name of each victim will be read out and a candle lit and placed with a flower in the cathedral. A seventh candle will be lit for those who were injured.
There will also be a two-minute silence and the Christmas lights on all the trees in the cathedral will be turned off.
The event, which got under way at 12:00, has been organised by ecumenical body, Glasgow Churches Together (GCT).
GCT chairman, Father David Wallace, said: "In many ways, the people of Glasgow look out for and support one another.
"This service is an expression of that care and concern we have for each other.
"Glasgow Churches Together seeks to bring people together in unity. Our service on 22 December is simply the opportunity to do so in remembrance of the tragedy."

The service is being attended by Archbishop Philip Tartaglia from the Roman Catholic Church.

The families of people affected by the tragedy have been invited, although some have said they will mark the anniversary in private.
Representatives of the emergency services, people who helped at the scene, including local businesses, are also attending, as is First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.
Provost Docherty said: "I am acutely aware that for the families and friends of those who lost their lives, and others caught up in this terrible tragedy, that Christmas will be a very difficult time.
"This service has been arranged to allow those affected, to gather together and remember those now gone, and support those still coping with the aftermath.
"I hope it helps them and brings them some comfort. My prayers and the prayers of this city and beyond are with them."
Glasgow City Council has already said bin lorries will not use Queen Street on the day of the anniversary as people may return to the scene to lay flowers.
In George Square, bookings for the Christmas ice rink will not be taken between 14:00 and 15:00, while fairground rides will be shut down between 14:15 and 14:45, covering the time when the crash occurred.
The tragedy unfolded in one of Glasgow city centre's busiest streets, which was packed with shoppers days before Christmas.
The FAI, which concluded in August, heard that Mr Clarke was driving the lorry with two other crew members.
As he turned on to Queen Street, Mr Clarke suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope, causing him to pass out.
The lorry carried on, however, and in the space of 19 seconds it ploughed through pedestrians on Queen Street before coming to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square.
In the aftermath of the tragedy, the Crown Office said it would not prosecute anyone over the crash.
That decision paved the way for the FAI which was held over five weeks at Glasgow Sheriff Court, before Sheriff John Beckett.
Earlier this month, Sheriff Beckett published his determination which concluded that Mr Clarke, who had a history of blackouts and poor health, had "repeatedly lied in order to gain and retain jobs and licences".
This included not fully disclosing the details of a blackout he suffered at the wheel of a stationary bus in April 2010 to his own doctors and in employment applications and medical assessments for later jobs at Glasgow City Council.
In the aftermath of the FAI report, relatives of Erin McQuade and Jack and Lorraine Sweeney announced that they would attempt to take forward a private prosecution of Mr Clarke as, in their view, the Crown's decision not to was "wrong".
