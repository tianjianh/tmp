Irish Premiership champions Crusaders have signed former Linfield and Derry City midfielder Philip Lowry and Coleraine defender Howard Beverland.

The double signing will be seen as a bold statement of intent from the club who have won the league title for the last two seasons.
Lowry, 26, most recently had a brief spell with Portadown after moving to a job in London.
Beverland, also 26, has spent his entire career with Coleraine.
He was the side's captain and his departure will be a big blow to Bannsiders boss Oran Kearney.
Crusaders had already completed two other high-profile signings in Ballymena United winger David Cushley and former Linfield captain Michael Gault who has moved to Seaview from Portadown.
