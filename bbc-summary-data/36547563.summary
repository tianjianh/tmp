[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri faced a trial at the High Court in Glasgow accused of being involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
A jury cleared 29-year-old Mr Badri. He had been due to graduate in 2013 but did not due to his arrest.
He will graduate in absentia with a degree in medicine on Friday, three years later than originally planned.
After the verdict in October last year, judge Lord Turnbull told Mr Badri: "The court would like to wish you well in your continued medical career."
And Lord Turnbull told the jury that he "wholeheartedly agreed" with the not guilty verdicts they had returned.
Speaking of his relief at the time, Mr Badri said: "I'm very happy and hope to continue my medical career. I've been in limbo for the last two years."
Mr Badri gave evidence during the long-running trial and accused so-called Islamic State of "hijacking" Muslim history.
He said he had al-Qaeda material on his computer for research purposes only.
When asked if he was a terrorist or intended to become a terrorist, he replied: "No, of course not."
The court also heard Mr Badri retweeted two weeks before he was arrested that the murderers of soldier Lee Rigby were "fringe nutters".
It was suggested that because Mr Badri had a large tub of nails and no hammer, the nails could be an ingredient for a bomb.
However the court heard the nails had been brought to the flat by Mr Badri's father while he was carrying out DIY work and the hammer had been borrowed by a friend and not returned.
The prosecution told the jury it was the "right thing to do" to return guilty verdicts.
However, defence QC Murdo Macleod said: "He is not a radical, he is not a terrorist, he has extremely tolerant views.
"He is a young man who wants to clear his name and get on with his career as a junior doctor."
