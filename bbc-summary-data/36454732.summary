EU referendum: Sir John Major's anger at Leave campaign 'deceit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former PM Sir John Major has said he is "angry about the way the British people are being misled" by the campaign to get Britain out of the European Union.

He told Andrew Marr he feared people would vote to leave on the basis of information "known to be incorrect".
He highlighted claims by Leave figures Boris Johnson and Michael Gove that the UK sent Â£350m a week to the EU as an example of "deceit".
Mr Johnson stood by the claim and urged an end to "blue-on-blue action".
Sir John stopped short of personally attacking fellow Conservatives Mr Johnson and Mr Gove but accused them of running a campaign that was "verging on the squalid".
In his most outspoken intervention to date in the referendum debate, the former Conservative leader said: "They are misleading people to an extraordinary extent".
Mr Johnson told Andrew Marr the Â£350m figure was a "reasonable" one to use, arguing that although some of it was returned by the EU "this is money we cannot control," adding that it could be spent on the NHS or other "one nation" priorities instead.
