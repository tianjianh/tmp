[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man in court over murder of Elizabeth Mackay in Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 70-year-old man has appeared at Inverness Sheriff Court accused of the murder of a 60-year-old woman in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Elizabeth Mackay, or Muir, was discovered at her home in the city's Hilton area on Thursday 31 March.
Michael Taylor, from Inverness, appeared in private before Sheriff Margaret Neilson.
He made no plea or declaration and will appear again within seven days.
Ms Mackay was originally from Nairn and had lived in Inverness for eight years.
The house in Kintail Court where her body was found is the same terraced bungalow where the body of hairdresser Ilene O'Connor, 39, was found in 2006.
Brian Grant, 50, was jailed in 2007 for beating Ms O'Connor to death and burying her body in the garden.
