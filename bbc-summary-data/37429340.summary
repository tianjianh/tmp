Emily Blunt has spoken out against a so-called "mummy cult" she believes puts unwelcome pressure on new mothers.

"I think there is a huge societal pressure on women when it comes to motherhood, this sort of mummy cult that goes on," the actress said.
"I think it sort of makes women feel that they have to be a bit defensive about the choices that they make."
The 33-year-old will soon be seen in The Girl on the Train, in which she plays an alcoholic divorcee.
Her character, Rachel, has unsuccessfully tried to have children.
Blunt, who has two children with actor husband John Krasinski, said modern women faced pressure over "whether they want to be a mother" and "whether they want to breastfeed".
"In the domestic world... women can be a bit cruel about each other, more so than any other environment," she said at the London premiere of her new film on Tuesday.
The actress's comments followed the airing of Motherland on BBC Two, a sitcom pilot about a group of mothers with differing approaches to child-rearing.
The programme drew praise from the Telegraph for its "sharply drawn" depiction of "the cloak and dagger politicking of the stay-at-home parenting circuit".
In The Girl on the Train, Rachel believes she has information relevant to the disappearance of a former neighbour.
The film version of Paula Hawkins' best-selling novel is out in the UK on 5 October.
