She is to join editorial staff at the news website next month to help raise awareness of children's mental health.
Her role will see her arrange contributions from a selection of leading figures on the subject.
A palace spokesman said the duchess was "delighted that The Huffington Post will help put a spotlight on this important issue".
He added: "The Duchess of Cambridge has made the mental health of young children a key focus of her work in recent years."
She has campaigned on the issue, is a patron of several related charities and last year visited groups helping vulnerable children.
Huffington Post UK editor-in-chief Stephen Hull said staff at the publication were "thrilled" at the prospect of welcoming their guest in mid-February.
"Dealing with mental health issues has been a major editorial focus for us and I'm very excited to be working together on such an important project," he said.
Last year she recorded a video message for Children's Mental Health Week, calling for greater support of young people struggling to cope with problems such as anxiety or depression.
"The stigma around mental health means that they do not get the help they so badly need - this needs to change," she said at the time.
