Wicketkeeper Adam Rouse has signed a contract extension with Kent after an impressive start to the season.

Rouse, 24, joined Kent in January 2016 after Ryan Davies move to Somerset.
He struck an unbeaten 95 against Derbyshire, a career-best first-class score, and has 13 catches in three County Championship games this season.
"I'm enjoying my role right now and with Sam Billings away it's given me a nice opportunity to figure out my game and develop as a player," he said.
Rouse played previously for Hampshire and Gloucestershire before moving to Kent on a temporary contract in 2015.
The former England Under-19 international has now established himself as Kent's first-choice keeper, with Billings out of action because of commitments with the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League.
"He's kept brilliantly and scored some vital runs since he joined the club," said head coach Matt Walker.
"There's a lot more to come from him and with Sam Billings away on England duty, he will play a lot of cricket."
