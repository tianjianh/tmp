[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 0-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louis Dodds' first-half goal earned struggling Shrewsbury a first league win at Millwall for 54 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dodds and Ivan Toney combined after 17 minutes before the midfielder calmly finished to seal the points.
Adam El-Abd and Jim O'Brien's last-ditch clearances kept the visitors ahead at half-time, but Millwall rarely threatened in the second half and Shrewsbury moved to within two points of escaping the relegation zone.
The hosts first threatened when, in the 15th minute, Shaun Williams' flighted ball found Lee Gregory, who flicked past Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler, but El-Abd covered well.
Shrewsbury then took a deserved lead two minutes later, Dodds and Toney opening up the Millwall defence before Dodds slotted home.
The home side had two chances to draw level in the 23rd minute, but Fred Onyedinma dawdled and Harry Smith's header was clawed out by Leutwiler.
Leutwiler made a brilliant save in the 34th minute from El-Abd's sliced interception, before O'Brien cleared the resulting corner off the line.
The Swiss keeper also kept his side ahead after 75 minutes, denying Gregory a fantastic goal.
The striker cut in from the right and curled in a shot from 20 yards, but Leutwiler saved at full stretch.
Millwall almost snatched a late point, but Smith shinned over after 86 minutes before skipper Tony Craig somehow missed a header from four yards in the final minute.
