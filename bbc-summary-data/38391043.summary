The film showed students and staff at St Ninian's High School singing whilst driving in the Manx capital of Douglas.
The Isle of Man government asked for its removal after angry comments were posted on the school's Facebook page.
St Ninian's High School (SNHS) said it was "sad that people have been upset and angered by our festive video".
Carpool Karaoke is a popular segment within The Late Late Show on US network CBS.
Adele, Sia and One Direction are among the guests who have sung along to their own songs whilst being driven around Los Angeles by English comedian Corden.
Several of the videos have gone viral on social media.
SNHS said its own version of Carpool Karaoke, a video which "took hours to produce", was "light hearted fun with no serious consequences".
"Drivers were driving safely and to the road conditions at all times all participants were wearing seat bets."
The school was responding to complaints that its video was "insensitive" towards people involved in car accidents, and that it was "irresponsible" and promoted bad driving habits.
Head teacher Andy Fox told the BBC: "This was something the children put together on a Friday afternoon and it was meant purely as a bit of fun.
"In the last couple of years we have lost a staff member and a student in road accidents and we take road safety very seriously."
However, it agreed to remove the video on the advice of the Isle of Man's Department of Education and Children.
