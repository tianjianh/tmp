West Brom and Watford have been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players during Saturday's game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Watford's Roberto Pereyra was dismissed in the 84th minute when he reacted angrily to a James McClean challenge in an incident that resulted in both sets of players clashing on the touchline.
Watford manager Walter Mazzarri said his midfielder was "unfairly sent off".
West Brom finished 3-1 winners at the Hawthorns.
Mazzarri added: "Pereyra was fouled. He was on the floor and his rival kept fouling him. He stood up and gave a small push and that's when I went to separate them."
West Brom boss Tony Pulis said on McLean's part in the melee that "trouble seems to follow him around".
However, he added: "The lad [Pereyra] kicked out. Whether you catch him or not, it is the intent."
Both clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge.
