The Swans have enquired about the Argentine striker who is valued at Â£15m, but Fox's boss Claudio Ranieri has dismissed the transfer speculation.
Dyer spent last season on loan with the Premier League champions and compared Ulloa with former Swans scorer Michu.
"He's a great player. I loved playing with him we had a good relationship he's a good guy," he said.
"He has the same attributes as Michu had. He's calm on the ball, has great presence and he's a great finisher.
"If he does decide to make the trip to Wales I'd more than welcome him. He'd be a great addition to the squad and he'll fit in nicely."
Michu scored 22 goals for Swansea in 2012-13 including one in the League Cup final when Dyer scored twice.
Dyer has returned to Swansea with a Premier League winners' medal after his spell at Leicester.
He says Ulloa impressed him although neither player featured regularly in the starting XI as Leicester upset the odds by winning the title.
"Obviously he was frustrated at the few chances he got - everyone was who was on the sideline really because the team didn't change," added Dyer.
"And why not, they were doing so well I wouldn't have changed the team either.
"It was great to be part of that team that went on to win the title and they were a great bunch of lads as well."
