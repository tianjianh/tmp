Bristol City winger Scott Wagstaff says he was delighted after making his first start for more than 12 months.

The 25-year-old was on the fringes of the first-team last season and has been plagued by a calf injury this campaign.
Wagstaff started in the 1-0 defeat by West Brom in the FA Cup third-round replay, after a cameo role in the win over Middlesbrough on Saturday.
"It is nice to get back on the pitch because that is what I have missed," Wagstaff told BBC Radio Bristol.
"I don't want to just be sitting around doing nothing. I have been training hard, working hard to get back in the team and got my chance."
Wagstaff completed 85 minutes against the Premier League side before being substituted.
Before Tuesday, his last start - which was also in the FA Cup - came against Doncaster Rovers on 13 January, 2015.
"It has been a tough season for me personally but I have kept myself going and tried to keep myself fit," the ex-Charlton midfielder added.
