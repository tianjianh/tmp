Gutknecht, who needed surgery after the fight, is in a "stable condition", says the British Boxing Board of Control.
The 34-year-old fell ill in his changing room following his defeat on 18 November, and was taken to hospital.
Groves, who beat Gutknecht to retain his WBA International super-middleweight title, has set up a fund to help the boxer and his family.
"He is still in hospital in a coma after having surgery the night of our fight 12 days ago," wrote Groves on Twitter.
Groves scored a unanimous points win in the fight at Wembley's SSE Arena.
