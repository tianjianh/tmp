[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A violent feud between two rival Dublin gangs which has, so far, claimed the lives of five men may now have led to the murder of a sixth man from Northern Ireland.

Michael Barr, who was originally from County Tyrone, was shot dead at the pub where he worked in Dublin's north inner city on Monday night.
Police are investigating a possible link to the Kinahan - Hutch feud.  BBC News looks back at the criminal dispute which has caused fear in Dublin and further afield.
Gary Hutch, a convicted armed robber from Dublin, dies after being shot a number of times by a masked gunman at an apartment block in Spain's Costa del Sol.
The 34-year had moved to Spain after his release from prison and was living in the country for eight years at the time of his death.
He had survived a number of previous attempts on his life.
He was a nephew of Gerry Hutch - a notorious criminal in Dublin in the late 1980s and 1990s, who was nicknamed the Monk.
There is chaos and panic as gunmen armed with AK47 assault rifles open fire inside a Dublin hotel as it hosts a weigh-in for a World Boxing Organization (WBO) title fight.
The armed gang, disguised as police officers, injure three men, one of them fatally.
The murder victim is named as 33-year-old David Byrne from Crumlin in the south of the city.
He was well-known to police and had been questioned several times over serious and organised crime.
Police sources express fear of the possibility of a reprisal attack.
A man claiming to speak on behalf of the dissident republican group, the Continuity IRA (CIRA), claims its members were responsible for the hotel gun attack.
He tells the BBC that CIRA members killed David Byrne because he had been involved in the killing of Real IRA leader Alan Ryan in Dublin in 2012.
However, police say they believe the motive for the hotel shooting was a criminal dispute, not a paramilitary feud.
Hours later, Eddie Hutch Snr is shot dead near his flat in Poplar Row, in the north inner city, in a suspected reprisal attack for the murder of David Byrne.
The victim, a taxi driver, is an uncle of Gary Hutch and a brother of Gerry 'The Monk' Hutch.
At his funeral, mourners heard a plea from the Hutch family for no retaliation.
Locals believe Eddie Hutch Sr was only murdered because of his surname - that he was an innocent man whose early life in crime was well behind him.
BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme broadcasts its investigation into the Kinahan gang's international drugs trafficking operation.
It charts Christy Kinahan's rise from a minor Dublin criminal to the "kingpin behind one of Europe's biggest drug cartels".
Using Spanish police files, the programme reveals the astonishing wealth and global scope of the Kinahan gang's operation.
At one point, gang members are revealed to be discussing the possibility of investing in their own container ship to transport drugs.
Noel Duggan, a well-known criminal linked to cigarette smuggling, is shot dead while sitting in a car outside his home in Ratoath, County Meath.
The 57-year-old victim had links to the Hutch family was a friend of Gerry Hutch.
A 24-year-old man dies after he is shot outside Noctor's pub in the Sheriff Street/Oriel Street area of Dublin's north inner city.
The victim is later identified as Martin O'Rourke, a father of three.
It is understood the murder was a case of mistaken identity and that detectives believe the intended target was an associate of Gary Hutch.
Mr O'Rourke tried to run but was shot several times by a gunman dressed in dark clothes, who then cycled away. The bike was later found abandoned, and the gun found in a bin.
