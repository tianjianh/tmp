[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Lafferty scored two late goals as Northern Ireland finished strongly to complete their expected win over San Marino at Windsor Park.

Steven Davis gave Michael O'Neill's men the lead with a 26th-minute penalty.
San Marino's Mirko Palazzi was sent off early in the second half but Northern Ireland left it until the final 12 minutes to make sure of the victory.
Lafferty flicked in number two, with Ward blasting in an 86th-minute third before Lafferty netted again.
The win puts Northern Ireland, who forced 11 saves from keeper Aldo Simoncini with their 35 shots, in third place in World Cup Qualifying Group C on four points.
They sit behind Germany and Azerbaijan, who are both on the maximum six points after their two games.
There was a mood of celebration before the match as the National Stadium in Belfast was officially reopened by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.
A pre-match parade marked the redeveloped ground's completion, with the 18,234 crowd applauding the likes of world champion boxer Carl Frampton on a 'lap of legends'.
But for long periods Northern Ireland's performance struggled to live up to the occasion in a match they were expected to win comfortably.
True, an NI victory looked assured once Davis had netted from the spot, but O'Neill's men should have added more goals before out-of-favour Norwich striker Lafferty and Burton's on-loan Ward made sure of the victory.
The hosts were expected to cruise to a comfortable victory over a country who have never won a competitive match, conceded 54 goals in their last World Cup qualifying campaign and are ranked more than 170 places below the men in green in the Fifa rankings.
Memories of the last World Cup campaign when Northern Ireland lost away to Azerbaijan, picked up one point from two matches with Luxembourg and were defeated at home to Israel were largely banished by a successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, but nerves lingered as the hosts struggled to break down their opponents.
Davis and Ward were among those to pass up first-half chances, while Adolfo Hirsch went close for the visitors when he shot over from the edge of the box.
Northern Ireland had failed to score in five of their last six games and their frustration grew in the second half as they passed up a series of opportunities.
Niall McGinn and Magennis were denied by the visiting goalkeeper in the second half while Davis was among those to shoot wide of the target.
Lafferty's strike 11 minutes from time eased Northern Ireland nerves, then Ward added the third with five minutes remaining.
Ferguson crossed from the left and Lafferty headed into the path of Ward, who smashed home from close range.
Lafferty's late goal ensured a final scoreline which more accurately reflected their dominance and banished memories of their earlier profligacy in front of goal.
It was Lafferty, hero of the successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, who proved the inspiration for giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.
The 29-year-old, who has been left on the sidelines for much of this season, belied his lack of game time for Norwich by chipping in with those two late goals, taking his overall international tally to 19.
Lafferty grabbed his first by turning the ball into the net from close range after meeting Shane Ferguson's cross and then tapped home Davis' ball with the final kick of the game.
The striker's double will give O'Neill something to think about for Tuesday's trip to face Germany, the NI boss having opted to go with Charlton Athletic frontman Josh Magennis from the start against San Marino.
Northern Ireland now turn their thoughts to Tuesday's Group C qualifier against Germany in Hanover and what a contrast that promises to be compared to this match.
San Marino and the Germans are separated by 198 places in the Fifa world rankings, with the former having never won a competitive game and the latter losing just two of 85 World Cup qualifiers in their history.
