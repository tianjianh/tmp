A woman in her 30s died at the scene in Bridge Street on Saturday afternoon. She has not yet been named.
Another pedestrian, a man in his 40s, who suffered serious pelvic injuries remains in hospital in London.
The injured driver of the Land Rover Defender, a man in his 40s, remains in the Royal Surrey County Hospital.
Police said a third pedestrian, a woman in her 30s, who had minor injuries has been discharged.
Tributes were being left at the scene on Sunday.
Witnesses who were in the area at the time described a major emergency response with several police cars blocking the road and the 4x4 covered from view.
A green screen was erected around the crash site.
Matty Wilson, who lives in a flat in the Friary Centre which overlooks the scene said it was clear there had been a major accident with a number of pedestrians involved.
He said emergency services remained at the scene for several hours afterwards.
BBC reporter Adrian Harms said the incident left Guildford "largely gridlocked" with the town centre in "chaos" until Bridge Street reopened at about 17:00 GMT.
The crash came just months after another crash near the main entrance to the Friary Centre when a car hit pedestrians and left several people injured, including a toddler and his baby sister.
The collision happened in North Street last October.
