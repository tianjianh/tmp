Kenneth Zohore: Russell Slade backs Cardiff striker to make impact

Manager Russell Slade hopes a first start for loan striker Kenneth Zohore could help revive Cardiff City's slim Championship play-off hopes.

The Danish under-21 international has made nine substitute outings since joining on loan from Kortrijk in Belgium and could start against Bolton.
Zohore, 22, scored his first goal in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat at Brentford.
"It's the sort of impact we have been waiting for. It's been his best impact," said Slade.
"He's put himself in one or two useful positions for us and not been able to finish.
"But we are all pleased for him he has managed to get that goal Tuesday night and a bit of confidence going forward.
"I have got to be thinking about starting him because we have one or two fitness tests."
Zohore is one of the youngest players ever to play in the Champions League after making his European debut for Copenhagen against Barcelona at the Nou Camp as a 16-year-old.
Cardiff will definitely be without midfielder Aaron Gunnarsson (ankle) and full-backs Fabio (groin) and Declan John (virus), while centre-back Bruno Ecuele Manga is recovering from malaria.
When they host Bolton on Saturday, Cardiff will be aiming to keep pressure on sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday, who are six points ahead of Cardiff with three games to go.
Slade, who reiterated his own contract negotiations are on hold until the summer, does not believe reaching play-offs is key to whether he continues next season.
Wednesday take on fellow play-off contenders Derby County in Saturday's early kick-off, so the result will be known by the time Cardiff face Bolton.
"While that remains a possibility, we have to search for the points ourselves. It is important we control the situation we are in," he added.
"It's all irrelevant unless we do what we have to do against Bolton. That is why the focus has to be on our game to ensure we get back to winning ways.
"We want to go to Sheffield Wednesday (on April 30) with them under pressure."
