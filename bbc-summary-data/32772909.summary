[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duchess of Cambridge has been invited to join the Women's Institute (WI) branch near her Norfolk home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Duchess, Prince William and their children live at Anmer Hall on the Queen's Sandringham Estate.
Anmer WI branch president Dorothy Pulsford-Harris wrote to Kensington Palace inviting the duchess to join.
"Her secretary said she had shown interest and would be in touch if she wanted to take it further," she said. Kensington Palace declined to comment.
The Anmer branch of the WI has 14 members, the youngest of whom is "in her 40s", Mrs Pulsford-Harris said.
They would be "delighted" if the duchess chose to join the group, she said, promising her "a very good tea, but not much jam-making these days".
The Duchess of Kent, who previously lived at Anmer Hall, had been a member and had "always been made very welcome", Mrs Pulsford-Harris said.
The branch meets once a month and  a copy of planned events and speakers for the coming year has been sent to the palace.
These include a talk about charity Scotty's Little Soldiers - a charity supporting children who have lost a parent in the armed forces - a discussion on health and well-being and a speaker from the Dogs' Trust.
The royal couple are frequent visitors to the village and attended the church carol service at Christmas.
"George was a delightful little boy and they were all very relaxed. It was just like an ordinary family outing," Mrs Pulsford-Harris said.
