Boss Neil Smith confirmed that the 34-year-old was staying after Saturday's friendly against Leatherhead.
Chorley joined Bromley in the summer of 2015 after leaving Portsmouth and made 26 appearances last term.
"We do have a young side at the moment and he brings experience on and off the pitch. He'll also come in and help coaching with our Academy," said Smith.
