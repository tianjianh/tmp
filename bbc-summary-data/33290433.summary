The body of Tia Kounota, 27, was found in an Audi in Fentham Road, Erdington, Birmingham, in July 2014.
Post-mortem tests suggested she had suffered a head wound before the car was set alight, police said.
Damien Dinobewei, 35, who has schizophrenia, admitted manslaughter and was given an indefinite hospital order at Birmingham Crown Court.
Dinobewei, of Pershore Road, Stirchley, and Ms Kounota had been in a volatile relationship before she decided to leave, West Midlands Police said.
Det Insp Warren Hines said: "I cannot begin to imagine the sense of loss Tia's family feel.
"Dinobewei's killing of a young woman with her life ahead of her - a woman who cared deeply for him and should have felt safe in his company - is truly despicable.
"Dinobewei's failure to take his medication, coupled with his consumption of illegal drugs, caused a rapid deterioration in his mental health, compounding his paranoia.
"I hope that by knowing Dinobewei has been given an indefinite order, preventing him from killing again, will be of some comfort to Tia's family and friends and help them to rebuild their lives. My thoughts remain with them all."
Dinobewei had admitted manslaughter at a hearing earlier in the month.
