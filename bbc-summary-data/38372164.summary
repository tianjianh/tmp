Everton midfielder Ross Barkley apologised to Jordan Henderson for his late tackle during Liverpool's win at Goodison Park, says the Reds captain.

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp and Toffees manager Ronald Koeman said Barkley, who was booked, might have been "lucky" not to be sent off.
"It was pretty late, but I know Ross well. He's a good lad," Henderson said.
Sadio Mane's injury-time goal won the game for the visitors and lifted them to second in the Premier League.
Klopp, whose side are now six points behind leaders Chelsea, suggested that midfielder Henderson was fortunate not to have suffered an injury as a result of the challenge by his 23-year-old England team-mate.
"I saw it one time. Everything is clear. If you saw it say how it was," the German manager told BBC Sport.
"Maybe Ross was really lucky and Hendo was really lucky."
Speaking on Sky Sports, 26-year-old Henderson added: "Thankfully I'm OK. It was mistimed and he apologised after. It's a derby - it doesn't matter if you're friends off the field."

Former Everton midfielder Kevin Kilbane told Match of the Day 2: "Barkley is lucky from two sides. He's lucky he didn't get a red card and lucky Henderson didn't get a serious injury."
The second-half incident also sparked a confrontation between Everton full-back Seamus Coleman and Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren.
The Republic of Ireland international Coleman was booked by referee Mike Dean as a result, but the Croatia centre-back was not punished.
Everton's Dutch boss Koeman said: "Why did he give Coleman a yellow and not Lovren? Everybody was reacting and it was started by Lovren and he already had a yellow."

It was a second away victory in a row for Liverpool, following the 3-0 win at Middlesbrough on 14 December, and the result means they have now lost just one of their past 20 matches against their Merseyside rivals.
"It was quite intense, and I'm very, very happy after the game," added Klopp.
"You saw the reaction of our fans, so obviously they were happy and that's the best you can do on a night like this.
"If you only win games on your brilliant days you don't win a lot of games. Today was a real fight, a real battle - we were ready for it and we're happy."
