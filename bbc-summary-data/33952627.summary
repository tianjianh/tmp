A mother-of-three who lives in north Belfast's Skegoneill area has said her family was left so frightened by a mass brawl there on Friday night that they will move out if it happens again.

Police have said they will increase patrols in the area after fighting broke out among more than 20 youths, some armed with knives and sticks.
The woman's car's windscreen was one of a number smashed during the trouble.
She said she could not explain to her children why it had happened.
"Having three young children, they don't know anything about the way things used to be in Northern Ireland," the woman who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Sunday News programme.
"It would be awful, awful disappointing if things started to go back and we ended up having to move.
"It makes me feel really emotional and very, very upset because we've tried to protect them for so long and they're so young. But it's something that's out of your control.
"People just feel they can come in to where you live and attack your things."
A 17-year-old boy was treated for a head injury as a result of the incident on Friday night.
A police officer also suffered a minor wound.
Police have said that both "sectarianism and the use of social media sites are a strong line of enquiry" in what was behind the violence.
The woman said she was getting her children ready for bed when the trouble started and her children had been frightened that something else would happen on Saturday night.
"I'm angry because of what has happened - our whole weekend has been taken up trying to deal with the police, deal with insurance companies, sort out what's going to happen to get to work next week," she said.
"But then again I'm speaking to my children and they're upset and I'm upset because they're upset and there's nothing I can explain, because they're so young and they want to know why someone would do this and what's the answer? There isn't an answer to give them."
Ch Insp Davy Moore of the PSNI issued a warning to those involved.
He said they "should stop and think of the consequences of their actions both in terms of causing serious injury to others or themselves".
"Parents need to take responsibility regarding the whereabouts of their children and in supervising access to social networking sites," he added.
"There are fears that should this behaviour continue that a young person may lose their life. This would have a devastating impact on communities.
"Police will be carrying out increased patrolling in the area."
