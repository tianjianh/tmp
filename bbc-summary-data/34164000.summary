The 31-year old, who has played 22 ODIs and 10 Twenty20 internationals, holds a UK passport and will play in all forms.
Broom said: "It's a great opportunity for me. I have heard great things about the progress being made at Derbyshire."
Elite performance director Graeme Welch said: "We know we need to strengthen our batting. Adding a player of Neil's experience and calibre will do that."
Christchurch-born Broom's last appearance for the Black Caps came in a T20 international against Sri Lanka in November 2013.
