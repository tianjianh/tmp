The museum is marking 15 years since its first Bollywood statue was created.
Kaif, the daughter of a British mother and a Kashmiri father, will be at the museum in London on Saturday for the unveiling, Madame Tussauds said.
Kaif made her debut in Bollywood in 2003 with Boom and has become one of the most sought after actresses in India, correspondents say.
For the wax statue, a team of about 20 sculptors and artists worked with the actress over four months - hundreds of measurements were taken and the museum said the statue cost Â£150,000 ($222,297).
In the wax model, Kaif will be in a dancing pose and dressed in a sequined outfit, BBC Hindi's Vandana, who uses only one name, reports.
Madame Tussauds unveiled its first Bollywood figure of superstar Amitabh Bachchan in 2000 when it asked the public to vote for an Indian actor who deserved a place in the museum.
Voted superstar of the millennium in a BBC Poll in 1999, Bachchan is worshipped by millions of fans in India and abroad.
Former Miss World and now Bollywood screen goddess Aishwarya Rai is often counted among the most beautiful women in the world.
Rai has worked in dozens of hit films and won several awards for her performances. She also starred in English-language films Pride and Prejudice and Pink Panther.
Her sari-clad wax model was unveiled in 2004.
Superstar Shahrukh Khan attended the unveiling of his model in 2007 and posed next to it.
Khan appeared pleased with the likeness and told the BBC: "What I like most are my eyes."
Bollywood heartthrob Hrithik Roshan's wax figure was unveiled in 2011 and soon became among the most kissed statues at Madame Tussauds, according to reports.
The star of hit films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dhoom2, Krrish and Jodha Akbar visited the statue along with his wife and children.
Award-winning actress Madhuri Dixit's likeness was unveiled in 2012.
The museum said they commissioned her statue as they were "constantly inundated with requests" to feature her by her fans around the world.
