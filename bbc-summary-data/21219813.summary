The county's fire service said crews had been pumping water out of homes in Market Drayton and one near Whitchurch.
Diksmuide Drive in Ellesmere has also been flooded and a farmer had to rescue a flock of sheep stuck in flood water in Oswestry, the fire service said.
Dave Throup from the Environment Agency tweeted that flood barriers were due to go up in Frankswell on Monday.
The agency has issued a number of warnings for rivers in the county including the Vyrnwy at Melverley and Maesbrook.
Battlefield Link Road in Shrewsbury and the A41 at Bletchley near Market Drayton have been closed due to flooding.
Mary Dhonau, from the Flood Protection Association, said the ground is already water-logged and recent flood victims must accept it may happen again.
She said: "It's just awful and my heart goes out to the people that are at risk of flooding, having been flooded myself.
"I cannot emphasise how horrible it is to have your home violated by filthy, foul smelling water."
The Environment Agency has published a live floods map.
