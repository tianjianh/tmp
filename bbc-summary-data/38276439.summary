The Cranes' head coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic confirmed they will begin their warm-up with a game against hosts Gabon on 29 December before facing Libya on 1 January in Tunis.
Uganda, who qualified for the Nations Cup after a 39 year absence, will then take on Tunisia on 4 January, Slovakia on 8 January and the African champions Ivory Coast in Dubai on 11 January.
"This will be a very good build-up to get my players well prepared for Afcon," said Sredojevic who is currently in Dubai to make arrangements at the Al Wasl club where he will base Uganda's training camp.
The Cranes are grouped alongside Egypt, Ghana and Mali for the 2017 Nations Cup and will be based in Port Gentil during the group phase.
Uganda is the only country that qualified for Gabon 2017 from the Council for East and Central African Football Associations (Cecafa) region and the Cranes are also still in contention for a place at the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia.
