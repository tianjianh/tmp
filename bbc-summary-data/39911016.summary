Portsmouth boss Paul Cook is interested in talking to League One-bound Wigan Athletic about their vacant managerial role, reports BBC Radio Solent.

Cook led Pompey to the League Two title this season and has one year remaining on his contract at Fratton Park.
But it is understood that the 50-year-old, a former Wigan player, is on the Latics' managerial shortlist after their relegation from the Championship.
As yet, there has been no official approach from Wigan to Portsmouth.
Graham Barrow has been interim manager of Wigan since March when Warren Joyce left after four months in charge.
Kirkby-born Cook played for Wigan between 1984 and 1988 before a brief loan spell back at the club in the 2001-02 season.
After moving down a division by leaving Chesterfield to take over at fourth-tier Pompey in May 2015, Cook led the Hampshire side to a sixth-placed finish in his first season, only to be beaten by Plymouth in the play-off semi-finals.
This campaign, Cook's side achieved promotion with three games to spare, before winning the title on a dramatic final day.
Off the field, former Walt Disney chief executive Michael Eisner is also in exclusive negotiations over a potential takeover from the Pompey Supporters' Club, who have owned the club for four years.
