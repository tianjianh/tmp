In a far-ranging interview with the New York Times, the US president-elect was quoted as saying: "I condemn them. I disavow, and I condemn."
He said he did not want to "energise" the group, which includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.
One of America's top generals, David Petraeus, has told the BBC he would be willing to serve under Mr Trump.
The former CIA director, a prominent figure during the Obama era until he resigned in 2012 over an extramarital affair, said it was up to Americans to "endeavour to help" the incoming president.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concern on Tuesday that Mr Trump's election victory could give succour to white supremacists.
A senior official close to her described the "Hail Trump" video as "repulsive and worrying".

"Breitbart is just a publication," Mr Trump told the New York Times. "They cover stories like you cover stories."
"If I thought he was a racist or alt-right or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him", he said of Mr Bannon.
Mr Trump also argued that:
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not follow up on a campaign pledge to pursue a further inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.
Later, Mr Trump was quoted as telling the New York Times: "I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't."
