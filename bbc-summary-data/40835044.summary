[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 1-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wasteful Lincoln were forced to settle for a draw against Morecambe in their first home match back in the Football League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Imps largely dominated the first half with Jordan Maguire-Drew and Nathan Arnold forcing veteran keeper Barry Roche into stunning saves while Matt Green dragged a good chance wide of the far post.
However, the Shrimps also threatened with only a last-ditch clearance from Sean Raggett denying Garry Thompson a goal and Aaron McGowan hitting the bar with a stunning 30-yard effort.
And it was Jim Bentley's visitors who took the lead in the 53rd minute when Aaron Wildig, having failed to convert a much easier chance two minutes earlier, volleyed home superbly from the edge of the box.
Matt Rhead, Raggett and Matt Green went agonisingly close to equalising but were denied by excellent goalkeeping, good defending or poor finishing.
However, the Imps finally levelled in the 70th minute when Green broke into the box, held off a defender and fired home from an acute angle.
