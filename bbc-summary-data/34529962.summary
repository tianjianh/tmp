A 30-year-old man from Limavady, County Londonderry, who slashed a man with a kitchen knife, has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Young, from Glengiven Avenue, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and threatening to kill a man and a woman.
The incident happened in his former girlfriend's home at Coolessan Walk, Limavady, on 14 March 2014.
Another man, Patrick McDonald, got a suspended sentence for assault.
McDonald, from Sperrin Park in Limavady who admitted assaulting the same victim, entered the woman's house along with Young and they carried out a violent and sustained attack.
They both kicked and punched him off a kitchen stool onto the floor where they again kicked and punched his head.
The judge imposed a twelve month jail sentence, suspended for three years, on Mr McDonald, who had fourteen previous criminal convictions.
The court was told the victim tried to defend himself but as he lay on the floor Young grabbed a knife with a six-inch long serrated blade and started slicing and slashing at his victim.
He sustained multiple knife wounds to his face and scalp and one of the injuries was so deep that his skull was visible.
The judge said when the police and ambulance service arrived at the scene the victim was bleeding heavily and unresponsive.
He also sustained multiple defence lacerations and two broken teeth.
The court heard that McDonald, had, by this time, left the house and took no part in the knife assault.
Young shouted to a woman in the house: "I am going to kill him."
He also shouted that he would put the man "six feet under".
Young was found outside the house, shouting: "I killed him, I killed him".
The judge said that Young had  "sliced his victim open with a knife and beat him to the floor".
He added:  "It is fortunate for us all that the innocent man is still alive but he still bears the mental and physical scars from what Young did to him."
