As part of the first major work in 40 years, nearly £700,000 has been spent on new heating, lighting, electrics and paint.
Officials said scaffolding had been removed and "extensive dusting" was under way.
A series of events are being held throughout the autumn to mark the project.
Special shades of paint were commissioned to make the inside of the building match the external stone.
Canon Missioner for the cathedral, the Reverend Doctor Elizabeth Thomson, said: "We have been doing paint archaeology and we have been looking at what they used originally and interpreting it for the 21st Century.
"It's a building that feels like it runs on light, you can stand in the middle of this beautifully proportioned space and just be flooded with light."
The church stands on the site of a Saxon church but the current building dates from the 1720s.
But during the renovation a small part of the medieval building was discovered and this is expected to be visible to the public in the near future.
An additional £100,000 is being spent on an ongoing reroofing project.
Cathedral officials were awarded £660,000 in government grants and has raised more than £120,000 toward work on the heating, wiring and roof.
