Music fans have started arriving for the T in the Park festival, which is being held for the first time at Strathallan Castle.

More than 80,000 people are expected to attend the event over the weekend, with many camping.
The festival is being held at the Perthshire estate after moving from Balado.
Acts set to perform include the Libertines, Kasabian, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds and David Guetta.
The festival moved from its traditional Balado home after fears were raised about an oil pipeline running under the site.
But the move sparked some local controversy around Strathallan.
After a lengthy planning battle over issues including wildlife and transport, DF Concerts won permission to hold the festival at Strathallan for the next three summers.
Coaches are running to the festival grounds near Auchterarder from around Scotland, and provisions have been put in place on the local road network.
Police and festival organisers have issued extensive advice to revellers ahead of the event, with strict rules in place including bans on selfie sticks, flagpoles, flares, nitrous oxide and so-called legal highs.
The festival arena opens to fans on Friday, although many opt to also camp over on the Thursday night. Weather forecasts predict a mix of rain and sunshine through the weekend.
Festival director Geoff Ellis said: "We're starting a new chapter for the festival at Strathallan and creating brand new memories for thousands of music fans.
"We have the UK's best line-up and there's no doubt it will be the weekend of the summer.
"My message to fans when they get here is to respect the site, look after yourself, your friends and your camping neighbours - and most of all, have a fantastic time."
