Jon Whitney: Walsall players will 'have me queuing up at dole office', warns manager

Walsall boss Jon Whitney has warned his players that too many more displays like their 4-1 home defeat by Scunthorpe will cost him his job.

Following last season's near-miss in the play-offs, the Saddlers have won just twice in 10 matches this term, and are now into the League One drop zone.
Whitney was "hurt" by their worst loss since April's 4-0 defeat at Bradford.
"If we have too many of them I'm going to be queuing up at the dole office," the 45-year-old told BBC WM.
"Some players have got to realise what they do has a consequence. It affects my family. It affects my mortgage.
"It was woeful. Men against boys. We were outpowered in every position. We have to start learning quickly."
He continued: "I have to apologise to the supporters who came. I never thought one of my teams would lay down like that.
"We have to forget about who wants to play pretty football and who wants to entertain. We need players who can fight.
"The naivety of some of our defending was beyond belief. I can't keep covering them for the mistakes they're making."
Walsall, who have dropped to 21st as a result of Wimbledon's point at Coventry on Wednesday, next host 17th-placed Millwall on Saturday.
They then visit Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in the EFL Trophy, but the following Saturday's scheduled return in the league has been postponed due to too many Walsall international call-ups.
Andreas Makris (Cyprus), Liam Kinsella (Republic of Ireland Under-21s), Simeon Jackson (Canada) and midfielder Maz Kouhyar, who has been called up for the first time by Afghanistan.
