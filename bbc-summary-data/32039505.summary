[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex Borders police officer Kevin Storey's sex attack sentence is cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police officer convicted of sex attacks on two women and a string of assaults has had his 12-year jail term reduced on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh ruled the prison term given to Kevin Storey,  48, formerly of Quarrydene, Melrose, was "excessive".
They imposed a nine-year sentence for his convictions for rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and assault.
They also held that a further three-year supervision period be scrapped.
Lord Menzies, sitting with Lady Smith, said: "It was submitted that the trial judge failed to attach sufficient weight to several mitigatory factors, which are relatively unusual, in this case.
"In particular, the fact the appellant had an unblemished record of public service.
"He served for 28 years as a police officer, latterly as a sergeant, and received several commendations in that service."
Lord Menzies said an assessment carried out on Storey also showed he was a low risk of future sexual and violent offending.
The senior appeal judge said that, when looked at in total, the charges he was convicted of amounted to "a protracted course of serious offending".
"The sentencing judge was entirely correct to take the view that only a significant custodial sentence would be appropriate to mark the seriousness of the offences," said Lord Menzies.
The judge who jailed Storey at the High Court in Edinburgh, Paul Arthurson QC, told him last year that he was a first offender with a "lengthy, honourable and unblemished record of police service in the Scottish Borders and elsewhere in the United Kingdom".
"You must be well aware that your appalling crimes render you a disgrace to your former uniform," he said.
Defence counsel Shelagh McCall said that testimonials submitted on behalf of Storey showed he was "a conscientious officer, a reliable and trusted friend and a positive member of the community".
She argued that the trial judge had not offered any justification for arriving at the final 12-year sentence imposed on him.
She maintained that "ultimately too high a final custodial figure" was reached in dealing with Storey.
She said: "Twelve years is, in my submission, an excessive period."
