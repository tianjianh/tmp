[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Holiday caravans which were left hanging over a cliff edge after a rock fall three years ago are to be moved again after fresh landslip fears.

In 2011, a cliff broke away, endangering caravans at Porthkerry Leisure Park in the Vale of Glamorgan.
Eighteen were moved back for safety, but 12 will be relocated again after a geologist detected ground movement.
Owner sally Edwards said it "could be nothing," but added: "We're not risking people's lives."
About 34,000 tonnes of rock spilled on to a beach below during the 2011 cliff collapse, leaving caravans partially hanging over the edge.
They were moved back and warning signs were placed around the cliff edge.
Since then a geologist has been regularly monitoring the section of coast.
Ms Edwards said a 15mm (0.6in) movement in the ground was detected in the last inspection.
"There has been nothing for two and a half years, but we as a company feel that we are just not prepared to take any risks and so we are being proactive and shutting the road down," she said.
"It could be something, it could be nothing.
"It could be two years, it could be 20 years, but we are not prepared to take that risk so we are moving the caravans away from the edge and repositioning them elsewhere on the site."
Work on removing the caravans and closing down part of the site will begin on Monday.
Ms Edwards, co-owner of the site for the last 16 years, said about Â£1m had been spent on monitoring and equipment.
With the latest changes, she said about 25% of the leisure site park had been lost.
She said caravan owners would be offered an alternative pitch on site, or a refund for the remaining site fees for this year.
