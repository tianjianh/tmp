Jac Grmusa from Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, pleaded guilty to 11 offences, including voyeurism and sexual grooming.
Merthyr Crown Court heard he filmed a 16-year-old who was attending the Royal Welsh Show in Builth Wells in July.
Grmusa was sentenced to four years and eight months in a young offenders institution.
The court heard the boy reported the incident to the police and Grmusa was arrested.
His phone was examined and Grmusa was found to have used a gay dating app to contact a 14-year-old boy.
In grooming the child, Grmusa had met the boy three times.
Grmusa had used other apps to contact a 16-year-old boy who he had sex with. He also distributed images of young boys.
Speaking after the case, Det Insp Neil Jenkins, said: "Grmusa's conviction is the result of a complex and technical investigation.
"This excellent team work has resulted in a dangerous individual being taken off the streets and has no doubt prevented further harm to children."
An NSPCC spokesman said: "Grmusa used popular social media channels to target some of his young victims and commit serious offences against them.
"He did not care about the consequences his actions would have on vulnerable children.
"This case highlights once again that online safety is one of the major 21st Century child protection challenges, with the internet used as a gateway by abusers to commit hundreds of offences against children each year."
