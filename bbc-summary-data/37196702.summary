Cardiff City have signed left-back Joe Bennett, 26, from Aston Villa on a three-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former England Under-21 defender will not feature in Saturday's game against Reading with his move subject to international clearance.
The Bluebirds have also signed goalkeeper Ben Amos on a season-long loan from Bolton.
Amos, 26, came through the ranks at Manchester United, making seven first-team appearances for the Red Devils.
Sheffield Wednesday had previously been linked with a move for Bennett, who joined Villa from Middlesbrough in 2012.
He is the Bluebirds' seventh summer signing after Lex Immers, Kenneth Zohore, Emyr Huws, Jazz Richards and Frédéric Gounongbe moved to the Cardiff City Stadium.
Meanwhile, midfielder Kagisho Dikgacoi's contract with the club has been terminated by mutual agreement and he leaves Cardiff City with immediate effect.
The South African international, 31, made just 17 league appearances for Cardiff and had one year left on his contract.
Dikgacoi, who was part of the South Africa squad for the 2010 World Cup finals, suffered with knee injuries after joining the Bluebirds from Crystal Palace in June 2014.
