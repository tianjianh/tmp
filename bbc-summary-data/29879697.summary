McBusted aren't known for doing things quietly, so to announce their 2015 tour, the supergroup threw an indoor fireworks party for their fans.

The band had a fire-eater, popcorn and candy floss machines and played tattoo roulette.
They will kick off their UK arena tour in Glasgow next March.
They've promised fans music from Busted and McFly, but will also play stuff from their brand new debut album McBusted.
"Massively overwhelmed" is how drummer Harry Judd summed up the band's success so far.
"It was like a dream state, we were like, 'What the hell was going on?' But the tour [earlier this year] was epic, you know, we made an album. The whole thing has just been crazy.
"But we are ready to go back on tour again, because you know it's been a while and that's the more fun thing."
McBusted united back in 2013 and one of their first performances was at BBC Children In Need.
The band's 2014 tour became the largest UK arena tour of the year and they ended up playing to more than 350,000 people.
But singer Tom Fletcher says the popularity has made them want to look forward.
"We love playing all the old songs," he said. "But I think what's exciting now, is it's not about being nostalgic and looking back.
"We have a whole new album of songs that we're really proud of and really excited to play live."
Matt Willis admitted he had to put in a lot of work to make things better with his wife, after he called her during BBC Radio 1 Breakfast show game Call or Delete.
He pranked her by saying he had been given a huge opportunity in Hollywood and they needed to make a decision about moving there ASAP.
"Wounds are healed, wounds are officially healed. But it did take a few days, I'm not going to lie, it was a bit ropey for a few days.
"But no, she was fine, but I think I just went a bit close to the bone."
