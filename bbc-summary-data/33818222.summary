[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mark Armstrong faces life for 32-hour schoolgirl abduction in Fife

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted abducting and raping a 15-year-old during a 32-hour ordeal in Fife may face a life sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Armstrong, 26, kidnapped the girl in Dunfermline between 12-14 March, as she returned home from netball.
He also pled guilty to assault and robbery offences against other women in the days leading up to the attack.
A judge called for a full risk assessment to be prepared on Armstrong, which can lead to the imposition of an Order for Lifelong Restriction.
Under such an indeterminate order a court fixes the minimum term the criminal must serve, but he will only be freed if the parole authorities are satisfied it is safe to do so.
The court previously heard Armstrong warned the girl he had a flick knife and he would use it if she tried to get away or call for help.
He throttled her and subjected her to a prolonged sex attack in the grounds of a derelict cottage.
Armstrong then led the girl back to his home in Dunfermline and continued to subject her to sexual abuse and rape. The girl later said it happened "over and over again".
Armstrong has been placed on the sex offenders' register and remanded in custody.
