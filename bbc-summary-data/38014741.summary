Saido Berahino: West Brom striker looks 'sharper' and is near return

West Brom striker Saido Berahino is close to returning from injury and looks "sharper and mentally a lot clearer", says Baggies boss Tony Pulis.

The 23-year-old has not played since September and was put on a fitness regime, spending time in France, after being ruled unfit and overweight.
He is unlikely to face Burnley on Monday but could return when Albion visit Hull City on 26 November.
"He's trained well this week but he needs games," Pulis said.
The former England Under-21 international's form has suffered since he reacted angrily to a bid from Tottenham being turned down on deadline day of the summer transfer window in 2015.
Having scored 20 goals in 45 games in 2014-15, he has only managed seven in 40 since then - and none in his last 14 matches for West Brom.
Pulis said: "Fitness-wise we're pleased, he's getting there. The next step is to get him some games.
"There's lots of good people who have spoken to him. The most important thing is Saido unravels who has given him good advice and bad advice.
"Saido's been a player in demand ever since I've been here from other clubs and speculation has run with it. It's been a saga.
"He's got a lot of talent, and he's got to exploit that and get the best out of his talent. Over the past year or so that's not happened. He's got to work out why."
