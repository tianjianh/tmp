McArthur tore his ankle ligaments and winger Puncheon strained his hamstring in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Bournemouth.
Scotland international McArthur tweeted: "Looks like season over for me with ankle ligaments tore.
"Just another challenge in my career to make sure I work hard and come back stronger."
Palace boss Alan Pardew, whose side have lost five games in a row, said: "We have lost two very important players in McArthur and Puncheon.
"They have both been having a wonderful season for us, so it is a significant blow."
