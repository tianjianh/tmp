Flint Castle, which attracts about 30,000 people each year, has been made a priority by the Welsh government.
There are plans for improvements and new activities.
Deputy Minister for Tourism Ken Skates said the Welsh government recognised "its potential to attract even more visitors due to its proximity to the English border and links to other Edward I castles in north Wales".
