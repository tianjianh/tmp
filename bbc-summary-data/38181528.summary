Would-be film actors are being urged to audition for the big screen this weekend by the film director Ken Loach.

The production company behind many of his projects, Sixteen Films, is looking for "sparky lads" with enthusiasm for a new film about the 90s rave scene.
Although not a Ken Loach project, the award-winning director tweeted that it was a "great project nonetheless".
The auditions will be held in Edinburgh and Bathgate on Saturday and Sunday between 11:00 and 16:00.
The calling notice says "boys may be older, but must still pass for 16".
Loach, who often casts untrained unknowns in his films, was last in Scotland casting for The Angels' Share in 2012.
The film, starring Paul Brannigan and John Henshaw, resulted in a best actor award for Brannigan at the Scottish Baftas the same year.
Brannigan, who later went on to star with Scarlet Johansson in Under the Skin, told the Good Morning Scotland programme that working on a Ken Loach project had changed his life.
He said: "It's been exciting at times and it's been hard at times. I've been lucky enough to have met good friends."
He also had some advice for any would-be actors attending the auditions.
"I think you just need to be prepared for rejection, but you also need to be prepared to just keep going.
"I've turned up to auditions and I've not been prepared and that's gave me the wee kick in the backside that I needed. So you need to be prepared, you need to put the graft in and do some home training."
Hugh Hodgart, director of drama, dance, production and screen at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, said casting directors were always on the look-out for raw talent.
He told the programme: "I think it's absolutely great. I may be in the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which is obviously a training an educational institution, but there are many ways into the profession."
"There are lots of different ways in. And certainly authenticity, the sense of actors who don't seem to be acting, that's what we're looking for."
