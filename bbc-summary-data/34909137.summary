Jamie Healey, 22, who had his spleen and kidney removed after the attack in Tamerton Foliot, Devon, told Plymouth Crown Court he was "hit from behind".
Another man, Tanis Bhandari, 27, died after being stabbed twice in the back.
Ryan Williams, 22, pleaded guilty to murder, wounding and assault. Donald Pemberton, 21, denies murder, wounding and actual bodily harm charges.
In a video interview recorded the day after he left hospital, Mr Healey told police how he put his hand to his back and saw a "trickle of blood".
He said he remembered his mother being beside him as he lay on the floor "bleeding out".
"I just remember mum shouting at me, 'I'm here, I'm here'," said Mr Healy, who underwent three operations.
"I remember saying to her, please don't let me die."
Also giving evidence was George Walker, 21, who suffered cuts to his arm and neck in the attack.
He told the court how he had seen one of the men "waving a knife around" in front of his girlfriend and had "jumped in to protect her".
"I was just thinking of getting in between so she didn't get hurt," he said.
He told the jury: "I thought he was going to kill me. He just wasn't going to stop until I was dead."
Mr Williams, 22, of Haydon Grove, St Budeaux, Plymouth, changed his plea halfway through the trial and pleaded guilty to murder, three counts of wounding with intent, and one count of assault occasioning bodily harm.
Mr Pemberton denies murder, three counts of wounding with intent, and one count of actual bodily harm, in relation to four other men who were injured.
The case continues.
