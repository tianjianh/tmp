The Irish international struck a penalty corner with seven minutes to go to claim the win after they trailed 1-0 at half-time to a Julian Dale goal.
Two strikes from Jonny McKee edged Bann in front before Cork equalised again but Magee's goal settled matters.
Lisnagarvey had briefly moved top with Saturday's 8-2 win over Railway Union.
There were hat-tricks for Neal Glassey and Matty Nelson with James Lorimer and Andy Williamson getting the other goals for Garvey after snow clearing had enabled the Comber Road contest to go ahead. Mark English replied with a brace for Railway Union.
After a run of four games without a win this made it four victories in a row for the defending champions who also welcomed back international Timmy Cockram for the first time this season.
Cork C of I remain a point behind the two Ulster clubs. Despite Sunday's loss they had beaten Pembroke 2-0 on Saturday with both goals coming from penalty corners scored by John Jermyn.
Fourth place Three Rock Rovers are only two points of the leaders after hat-tricks for Mitch Darling and Luke Madeley in a 6-1 home win over UCD.
Monkstown, whose game with Instonians was called off are fifth but only four points adrift in what is a five-team race for the IHL tile.
There was one rearranged game in the women's Irish Hockey League as Pegasus beat Belfast Harlequins 2-1 at Deramore.
Steph Thompson gave them the lead after a rebound from a penalty corner but Katie Larmour equalised for Belfast Harlequins before half-time.
There was some controversy surrounding the winning goal for Pegasus as there was suspicion that the ball hit a foot in the build-up but Vanessa Surgenor converted a Tate Doherty cross to ensure a 2-1 win, a result that moves Pegasus up to fifth in the table and leaves Harlequins alongside Pembroke and Ulster Elks on the same number of points at the bottom.
