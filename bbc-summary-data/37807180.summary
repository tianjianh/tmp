Evans went close for Chesterfield early on before the visitors went ahead midway through the first half when Jay O'Shea calmly slotted in from close range from Kristian Dennis' threaded pass.
Sam Walker pushed away O'Shea's low effort soon after, but Kurtis Guthrie's diving header flashed inches wide and Drey Wright was denied by keeper Ryan Fulton.
Colchester needed just 53 seconds to equalise after the interval when substitute Tarique Fosu netted with his first touch after coming on with a low finish, after the ball had broken to him in the area.
Colchester captain Luke Prosser's header from Wright's corner then rattled the bar.
But Chesterfield restored their advantage six minutes into the second half through Evans, who emphatically volleyed home after Tom Anderson had nodded on a free-kick in the area.
Guthrie was later denied by Fulton but Chesterfield claimed a narrow victory.
