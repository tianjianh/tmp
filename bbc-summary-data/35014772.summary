[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger claims Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez could have died after colliding with the camera pit at Norwich last weekend.

Sanchez fell into the boards after an apparent shove by Ryan Bennett, although the Norwich defender denied it was a deliberate push.
"First of all it's dangerous to have a camera there," Wenger said.
"He could've killed him. He didn't need to push like he did. I think the camera position was absolutely dangerous."
Bennett, 25, tweeted after the match to give his version of the incident, writing: "Genuinely was trying to stop not push Sanchez just to clear that up."
Chile forward Sanchez landed heavily in the cameraman's area on the touchline during the first half at Carrow Road, and although he was fit to resume he was later forced off with a hamstring injury.
