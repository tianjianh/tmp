The influx of Poles to Inverness has led to the setting up of the city's first Polish football team.

Polonia FC competes in the second division of the Inverness and District Amateur League.
The club is the brainchild of priest Father Piotr Rytel from the city's St Mary's Church.
A friend of former Celtic goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska, Fr Piotr is the new team's secretary, first aid man - and right-back.
Fr Piotr, the Highland's only Polish priest, said: "I pray and I play. That is all I do."
He added: "It is good to socialise but also to have some competition with the other teams."
Polonia FC has become so popular among the Highlands' Polish community that coach Jacob Olubik has had to turn potential players away.
He said: "God is with us you could say.
"Father Piotr has helped us promote our team, communicate with the other clubs and helped in finding new players."
