The world number one's success in York saw him become just the sixth man in history to win each of the sport's 'Triple Crown' events more than once.
Six-times UK champion Steve Davis said Selby "is one of the greats already".
Leicester's Selby, 33, beat Ronnie' O'Sullivan 10-7 in a thrilling, high-class final which saw six centuries.
Davis added: "If he doesn't know how great he is, he should just watch the tape of that match."
Stephen Hendry, the winner of 36 ranking events, was also full of praise for Selby and beaten finalist O'Sullivan, saying the pair were the "best two players in the world".
Two-time world champion and triple Masters winner Selby told BBC East Midlands Today: "It means a lot when it comes from your fellow professionals.
"When it comes from the likes of Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis you have to pinch yourself.
"What I have achieved probably won't sink in until the end of my career."
