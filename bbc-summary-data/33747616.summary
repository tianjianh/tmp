Dozens of farmers protested against low milk prices at a supermarket in Strabane, County Tyrone, on Friday night.

Up to 50 tractors blocked a lane into the Asda car park.
Farmers went into the store and cleared bottles of milk from the shelves, took it to the checkouts and left it there in trolleys.
The police say they received no complaints. Asda said it respects the right to peaceful protest.
Dairy farmers across Northern Ireland have warned they will go out of business if they do not receive higher prices for their milk.
They said the price they are getting paid for their milk is well below what it costs farms to produce it.
The Strabane protesters told BBC Radio Foyle they had been "working for nothing" over the last 12 months because of the price fall.
"I'm a fifth generation farmer, I would like to pass is down to my son, but at the way it's going, we're going to have to sell up," one protester said.
Another said: "I can't sustain losses much longer, we're going to be out of business.  We've talked to banks, but the banks are only going to support us for so long."
The Stormont agriculture and rural development committee held a special meeting earlier this week to discuss the dairy farming crisis in Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill has called for intervention at European level to tackle the problem.
On Thursday, about 200 farmers protested in the grounds of Stormont over dairy prices.
