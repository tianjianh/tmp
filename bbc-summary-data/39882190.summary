Defender Liam Moore has no problem with Reading being labelled underdogs as they bid to win promotion through the Championship play-offs.

Moore, 24, has played a key role in Jaap Stam's side in his first season since joining from Leicester City.
And he hopes to tap into some of the fairytale spirit which led Leicester to the Premier League title a year ago.
"I was around a 5,000-1 miracle last year, so I don't look too much into the odds," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
Centre-back Moore has made 44 appearances in all competitions for Reading, who finished the regular season in third place and now face Fulham in the two-legged play-off semi-final.
A meeting of two of the division's form sides starts with the first leg at Craven Cottage on Saturday before the return at the Madejski Stadium next Tuesday.
"Not many people thought we'd be where we are this season, but it's an enjoyable place to be and has been a fantastic season," Moore said.
"If people want to write us off without a ball being kicked, then that's fine. We'll continue to work hard and see where it takes us."
Moore admitted the decision to leave his home town club in August to join Reading was initially tough, but the chance to work with Stam and play regularly was a major draw.
"Unfortunately, he can't roll his kit on and play," Moore said, when asked how vital the former Manchester United defender's experience will be during the play-offs.
"He will pass on what he can, but the play-offs can do crazy things to people. Your livelihood's at stake here.
"You can either go up or you're back to playing another 46 games in this league. Ultimately, it's the 11 players plus the subs who do the job on the day.
"Hopefully we can do the gaffer proud as every piece of information he's passed on to us this season has been vitally important and stuff we can take on board.
"Every week I feel like I've learnt something new from him and started to create good habits in my game. It's only good for me to be playing under him."
