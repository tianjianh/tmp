Adam Matthews: Sunderland full-back joins Bristol City on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City have signed full-back Adam Matthews on a two-month loan deal from Premier League side Sunderland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthews has made only two appearances this season since signing on a four-year contract from Celtic in July 2015.
The 24-year-old has won 12 caps for Wales, but has not featured since a 3-0 defeat by Serbia in September 2013.
"I want to help the team here first and if my performances warrant a Wales call-up in the summer that'd be brilliant," he told BBC Radio Bristol.
"In the back of my mind I'd be buzzing if I did go [to the European Championships], but like I said my first aim is to help Bristol City up the table."
The Robins currently sit 20th in the Championship, five points above the relegation zone.
