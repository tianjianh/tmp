Teenager Laura Wolvaardt hit a superb 149 as South Africa made a massive 337-5, their highest one-day total.
Ireland struggled in response and could only manage 159-8 in their 50 overs, with Mary Waldron top scoring on 35.
It follows defeats by India and Zimbabwe, with the Irish back in action against India on Monday.
Wolvaardt's run-a-ball knock included 17 boundaries while Aoife Beggs was the best of the Irish bowlers with 3-64.
Malahide opener Waldron shared a 51-run stand for the second wicket with Laura Delany (23), who made her 100th international appearance, as Ireland slumped to a third straight defeat.
